Guns, Drugs and Juvenile Crime: Evidence from a Panel of Siblings and Twins

                                           ABSTRACT

Using a nationally-representative panel data set of U.S. high school students (AddHealth data) that
contains a relatively large sample of siblings and twins, the paper investigates the impacts of gun
availability at home and individual drug use on robbery, burglary, theft and damaging property for

juveniles. Using a variety of fixed-effects models that exploit variations over time, the results show
that gun availability at home increases the propensity to committing robbery, burglary and theft by

about two percentage points for juveniles but has no impact on damaging property. It is unlikely that
gun availability is merely a measure of the unobserved home environment because gun availability
does not influence other risky or bad behaviors of juveniles. The results show that having access to
guns increases the probability of being cut or stabbed by someone and of someone pulling a knife

or gun on the juvenile. Estimates obtained from models that exploit variations over time and
between siblings and twins indicate that the median impact of cocaine use on the propensity to
commit various types of crimes is 23 percentage points. The impact of using inhalants or other drugs

is an increase in the propensity to commit crime by 14 and 18 percentage points, respectively.

Guns, Drugs and Juvenile Crime: Evidence from a Panel of Siblings and Twins


I. Introduction

       Despite the decline in juvenile crime since the early 1990s, opinion polls indicate that

the public overwhelmingly believes that juvenile crime is a serious problem facing the

country (Soler 2001). Investigation of the determinants of juvenile crime is important for a

number of reasons. First, the social cost of youth crime is estimated to be $60 to $300 billion

per year, and the overwhelming majority of this cost is an externality to the society (Levitt

and Lochner 2001).1 Second, participating in illegal activities early in life has implications

for the future well-being of the individual. For example, Mocan, Billups and Overland

(2000) show that current criminal activity makes future criminal activity more likely by

increasing criminal human capital and depreciating legal human capital. Thus, engaging in

crime when young would make one less likely to be successful in the legal labor market later

in life. Along the same lines, Allgood, Mustard and Warren (1999) show that youth criminal

behavior has a negative impact on earnings as an adult, and Bound and Freeman (1992) and

Freeman and Rodgers (2000) document a negative relationship between youth criminal

record and labor market outcomes.

       Levitt and Lochner (2001) present a four-part classification scheme to explain

criminal activity, which involves biological, social, criminal-justice system and economic

factors. For example, social factors include the extent of parental supervision and behaviors

of neighborhood peers (Glaeser, Sacerdote and Scheinkman 1996; Mocan and Rees 1999,




                                                2
Case and Katz 1991). The influence of increased punitiveness of the criminal justice system

is documented by Levitt (1999), Levitt (1998), Snyder and Sickmund (1999) and Corman and

Mocan (2000); and examples of the research on the relationship between economic

conditions and crime include Gould, Mustard and Weinberg (2002), Corman and Mocan

(2002), Raphael and Winter-Ebmer (2001).2



Drugs, Guns and Crime

        Drug use and access to firearms are two other potentially important determinants of

criminal activity, although the extent of the relationships between guns and crime, and drugs

and crime have not been identified clearly. Despite the strong evidence that drug use and

criminal activity are positively correlated, the causal impact of drug use on crime has not

been conclusively established (see the literature reviews of Chaiken and Chaiken 1990,

Harrison 1992). Even though some recent studies using aggregate data provided evidence on

the potential causal impact of drug use on crime (Corman and Mocan 2000, Grogger and

Willis 2000), convincing cause-and-effect evidence from micro data is missing.3 The

difficulty in identifying the causal impact of drug use on crime stems from the possibility that

the observed positive correlation between drug use and crime may be due to the influence of

an unobserved variable which has an impact on both drug use and criminal activity. For

example, if the degree of risk aversion of the individual has an impact on both his drug use

  Levitt and Lochner (2001) report the upper limit of the social cost of youth crime as $300 billion,
but they indicate that this may be an overestimate because the typical youth crime is less serious in
comparison to an adult crime.

  For a more detailed discussion of various factors ranging from schools to gangs, see Wilson and
Petersilia (1995).

  A few papers analyzed micro data in related context. Markowitz (2000) investigated the impact of
alcohol and drug prices on violent crime using the National Crime Victimization Survey, Jofre-Bonet
and Sindelar (2002) analyzed the impact of drug treatment on criminal behavior.



                                                  3
and criminal behavior, then biased estimates of the impact of drug use on crime would be

obtained in analyses that do not take into account the confounding due to risk aversion.

       Another contested issue is the link between gun ownership and criminal activity.

Blumstein (1995) suggests that the rise in juvenile homicide rate between mid-1980s and

early 1990s is associated with an increased tendency to carry guns among juveniles.

Wintemute (2000) argues that the increase in violence in mid-1980s is attributable to gun

manufacturers’ move to produce cheap medium- and high-caliber pistols, and that the decline

in youth violence in the 1990s is attributable to stricter gun control policies adopted during

the same period. However, empirical evidence on the impact of gun ownership on crime is

mixed. In an analysis of the impact of right-to-carry laws, Lott and Mustard (1997) report

that counties with concealed weapons laws have lower crime rates, while Duggan (2001)

shows that changes in gun ownership are positively related to changes in homicide rates, and

that this relationship is driven almost entirely by an impact of gun ownership on homicides

with firearms. Cook and Ludwig (2002) find that local gun ownership prevalence has a

positive impact on residential burglary rates. They interpret this finding as an indication that

the existence of guns at homes may be a motivation for burglars because guns are valuable

loot. Ayres and Donohue III (2002) show that the finding of “more guns-less crime” by

Lott and Mustard (1997) is not robust to estimation with updated data. On the other hand,

Marvell (2001) finds no evidence that juvenile handgun bans adopted by states had any

impact on crime. Ludwig and Cook (2000) find no evidence that implementation of the

Brady Act was associated with a reduction in homicide rates; and Lott and Whitley (2001)

find no evidence that safe-storage gun laws reduce the number of juvenile accidental gun

deaths or suicides, and that the passage of the law is associated with increased violent crime




                                                4
and more crimes occurring in people’s homes. Mustard (2001) finds that enactment of right-

to-carry laws does not increase police deaths, and may actually help reduce their risk of being

killed.

          Based on these conflicting findings, some analysts suggest that gun control laws

reduce social welfare, and that they should be scrapped. They claim that this is because

research reveals no impact of gun control on crime, while gun control is costly as it interferes

with individual choice and imposes monetary costs on police, prosecutors, courts, and prisons

(Parker 2001).

          The research on gun-crime relationship cited above relies on aggregate (state or

county level) data on crime rates. More specifically, analysts investigated the impact of the

enactment of concealed weapon laws, or a measure of gun ownership on aggregate crime

rates. The main shortcoming of this research is the measurement of gun ownership or gun

availability. Gun ownership is approximated by various proxies, such as sales of Guns &

Ammo magazine at the state or county level (Duggan 2001), the proportion of suicides that

involve firearms (Cook and Ludwig 2002), and voter-exit surveys (Lott 2000). In this paper

we use nationally-representative individual-level data, where information on the availability

of guns at home as well as delinquent behavior are provided directly by each respondent.

          Analyses of aggregate crime data reveal the net impact of gun ownership on crime

rates. For example, assume that gun availability increases criminal tendencies, and gun

availability also allows opportunities for self-defense, which deters potential perpetrators.

The net effect of these factors on crime may be zero. On the other hand, the net effect would

again be zero if there was no impact of gun availability on crime either from aggression or

protection points of view. It is difficult to isolate these factors using aggregate data. The




                                                 5
individual-level data set we use allows us to directly test whether gun availability induces

juveniles to commit more crime. In addition, using victimization information provided by the

same individuals in the data set, we test whether gun availability has an impact on juveniles’

crime victimization. Thus, our analysis provides a clearer picture regarding the pathways

through which gun ownership impacts crime.



A Panel of Siblings and Twins

       This is the first paper to investigate the link between guns, drug use and juvenile

crime using nationally-representative individual-level data. To eliminate confounding due to

unobservable variables, we exploit the longitudinal aspect of the data which include siblings

and twins who live in the same household. The use of longitudinal data to eliminate time-

invariant individual heterogeneity is a standard tool in micro-econometrics. As explained

below in detail, the longitudinal nature of our data, and an unusually large number of

personal and family background variables allow us to examine the impact of the availability

of guns at home on an individual’s criminal activity.

       Data on twins have been employed by previous research to estimate returns to

education, schooling and marriage decisions, and the impact of birth weight on infant health

(Ashenfelter and Krueger 1994; Miller, Mulvey and Martin 1995; Behrman, Rosenzweig and

Taubman 1994; Behrman, Rosenzweig and Taubman 1996; Almond, Chay and Lee 2002).

All of these twin studies employed cross-sectional data on twins, and to the best of our

knowledge, this is the first study that uses a panel of siblings and twins to control for both the

impacts of time-invariant and time-varying unobservables.




                                                6
       We analyze four different crimes: robbery, burglary, damaging property, and theft.

The four drug use indicators we employ are the use of cocaine, the use of inhalants, injecting

illegal drugs, and the use of other drugs. The information on gun availability is obtained by

asking juveniles whether guns are easily available to them at home. We address potential

measurement error in drug use and gun availability. The identification of the impact of gun

availability on crime is obtained from the change in gun availability between the survey

years. Between-sibling variation cannot be exploited to investigate guns-and-crime

relationship because all sibling pairs answered the question on gun availability in the same

manner. We find that gun availability increases the propensity to commit robbery, burglary

and theft for juveniles, but it has no impact on damaging property. Gun availability does not

reduce the probability of being victimized, and it makes it more likely for a juvenile to be

stabbed or having a knife or gun pulled on him. We show that gun availability is unlikely to

be a measure of undesirable home environment, because gun availability has no impact on

other bad behavior such as lying, smoking, being expelled from school, drinking and fighting,

and having sex.

       Drug use is found to increase the propensity to commit crime. Using cocaine,

inhalants, and other drugs increases the propensity to commit crime from 14 to 23 percentage

points; injecting drugs increases the probability of committing crime by 50 percentage points.

       Section II presents the analytical framework, section III discusses the measurement

error in drug use. Section IV describes the data, Section V displays the results and Section

VI is the conclusion.




                                               7
       II. Analytical Framework

           The crime supply equation, with the addition of drug use and guns can be

presented as:4

(1) CR = f (X, A, F, DR, G),

where CR stands for a measure of the extent of the criminal activity of the individual, X

represents the characteristics of the person such as age, race and ethnicity and religious

beliefs. A stands for location-specific deterrence and economic variables that impact criminal

involvement, such as crime-specific arrest rates, police presence, and the unemployment rate,

F is a vector of parent and family characteristics, DR represents drug use of the individual,

and G stands for the availability of guns to the individual.5

        Drug consumption in Equation (1) is a function of the price of drugs, buyers’ income,

and tastes for drug use and specific penalties targeted at drug users. Using Goldstein’s

(1985) conceptual framework, drug use can affect criminal activity through three channels.

First, the “pharmacological” effect is the direct impact of drug use on criminal activity

because drug use may increase aggression. The second is the “economic” effect—that higher

expenditures on drugs cause some users to finance these expenditures by committing crime.

The third is the “systemic” effect—the violence due to the illegality of the drug market,

because the participants cannot rely on contracts and courts to resolve disputes. If the

“economic” effect is the dominant factor to influence criminal activity, the impact of drug use

on crime could be ambiguous. For example, if the demand for drugs is price inelastic, then an


4
  Theoretical justification of the inclusion of drug use in the crime equation can be found, among
others, in Ehrlich (1973).
5
  Empirical evidence from aggregate data on the impact on crime of deterrence, economic conditions
and drug use can be found, among others, in Corman and Mocan (2002), Corman and Mocan (2000),
Levitt (1998), Levitt (1999), and Raphael and Winter-Ebmer (2001).



                                                 8
increase in drug use, say due to a rightward shift of the supply of drugs, would be associated

with an increase in drug consumption which is coupled with a decrease in drug spending. If

the economic effect is more important than the pharmacological one, increased drug use

would be associated with a reduction in crime.6

          Ownership of guns can impact crime in two different ways. First, gun ownership may

make committing crime, especially violent crime, easier. Second, gun ownership may

prevent crime victimization if potential perpetrators consider the probability that their victim

may carry a gun. In our particular case, we analyze these two effects separately. That is, we

investigate both the tendency to commit crime and the likelihood of being a victim of a crime

of the same individuals as a function of gun availability at their home.

          Empirical specification of the crime supply equation as a function of observable and

unobservable personal characteristics (including biological attributes), deterrence measures,

economic conditions, as well as the attributes of the family, the extent of the drug use of the

individual and the availability of guns is presented by Equation (2) below.



(2)         CRjit= α+δXjit+γFjit+βDRjit+ϕGjit+HAst+µji+λjit+ΩjiF+ΨjitF +εjit



where CRjit is the criminal activity measure of the ith individual of the jth sibling (or twin)

pair at time t. Xjit represents observable individual characteristics such as age, race, gender

and religiosity of the person, weekly allowance of the child, and measures of risk aversion

such as whether the child wears seatbelt while driving. Fjit stands for observable family




6
    For a more detailed discussion, see Mocan and Corman (1998).



                                                  9
attributes, including parent characteristics and measures of the extent of supervision at home.7

DRjit represents consumption of drugs, and Gjit is the availability of guns at home. Ast stands

for the deterrence measures faced by the individual, such as the arrest rates and the size of the

police force, as well as local economic conditions in location s at time t where the child

resides, and µji captures individual-specific time-invariant unobservables which include

intellect. λjit represents person-specific time-varying unobservables, ΩjiF captures

unobservable time-invariant family attributes, ΨjitF is unobservable time-varying family

attributes, and εjit is a standard error term.

           Taking the first-difference of Equation (2) across time periods gives



(3) ∆CRjit= δ∆Xjit+γ∆Fjit +β∆DRjit+ϕ∆Gjit +H∆Ast+∆λjit+∆ΨjitF +∆εjit



where ∆ stands for time-differencing. Equation (3) is a standard fixed-effects model, where

time-invariant family and individual characteristics drop out, but time-varying heterogeneity

remains.

           We estimate different formulations of Equation (3) to investigate the link between gun

availability at home (G) and juvenile’s criminal activity. Note that in Equation (3), the

change in individual’s criminal activity between the two years depends, among other factors,

on the change in local deterrence and economics variables (Ast). The values of these

variables are not collected beyond the first year of our data; therefore ∆Ast cannot be

calculated. However, following Currie and Moretti (2002) and Cook and Ludwig (2002), we

include state or county dummies to control for such factors. That is, we estimate

7
    The complete list of these variables is given in the data section below.



                                                      10
(3A) ∆CRjit= δ∆Xjit+γ∆Fjit +β∆DRjit+ϕ∆Gjit+κKs +ejit,

where Ks stands for a set of state or county dummies that control for state-specific or county-

specific time-varying local deterrence and economic factors, and e is the error term.

         As summarized in Duggan (2001), it is conceivable that a positive relationship

between gun ownership and crime may indicate purchase of guns in response to expected

future increases in crime. Although this argument has merit, especially in aggregate data,

Duggan (2001) finds no support of such reverse causality from expected crime to gun

ownership. In our case reverse causality is even less likely. This is because, our dependent

variable is criminal activity of the youth, while our gun measure is the availability of guns at

home. To the extent that this measure captures guns owned by parents, it is exogenous to

future criminal involvement of the child. On the other hand, if parents’ gun ownership is a

proxy of their criminal propensity, and if this attribute is transmitted to the child, then gun

availability at home is a proxy of bad home environment, which may be correlated with

juvenile’s delinquent behavior. We show in the results section that this hypothesis has no

empirical support.

         Unlike gun availability at home, consumption of illicit drugs varies between siblings.

This allows us to eliminate time-varying family effects by taking within-sibling differences of

Equation (3), which gives:8



    (4) ∇∆CRjit= δ∇∆Xjit+β∇∆DRjit+∇∆λjit+∇∆εjit

8
 Note that this procedure also eliminates time-varying economic and deterrence measures as they do
not exhibit variation between the individuals in the same household. Subjective probabilities of




                                                11
where ∇ stands for between-sibling differencing. This specification eliminates all

heterogeneity with the exception of time-varying individual-specific unobservables (λjit).

Note that the family environment and location-specific economic and deterrence variables

drop out in Equation (4) as they are the same for all siblings of the same household.

The analog of Equation (4) for twins is:



 (5) ∇∆CRjit= δ∇∆Xjit+β∇∆DRjit+∇∆εjit



In Equation (5) time-varying individual-specific heterogeneity is eliminated under the

assumption that it is biologically the same between twins. This may be particularly the case

for monozygotic (identical, or MZ) twins. Therefore, Equation (5) is estimated for all twins

(monozygotic and fraternal), as well as for MZ twins.



III. Measurement Error

        As described in Section IV below, data collection procedures were designed to

minimize concern about confidentiality. For example, respondents were not provided with

written questionnaires; rather they listened to sensitive questions on delinquent behavior,

drug use and gun availability through earphones, and entered their answers directly on laptop

computers. Nevertheless, it is still conceivable that drug use and gun availability is reported

with error. Furthermore, it is plausible that the reporting error is not symmetric in the

classical sense, but it is one-sided.




apprehension and conviction may differ between siblings. However, to the extent that they are
approximated by such measures as arrest and conviction rates in the locality, they do not vary.



                                                  12
        To demonstrate the impact of non-random measurement error in drug use in first-

differenced data, consider equation (6) below where i stands for the ith individual and t is the

time period.

(6) ∆CR it = β∆DR * it + ∆ε it

        The subscript j and Xit are dropped for ease of exposition. Let DRit* be the actual

drug use, DRit stand for the reported drug use and <it represent the measurement error. The

reported drug use is equal to the actual drug use plus the measurement error; that is

DRit=DR*it+vit.

Note that DR=1 if the individual reports using drugs, and DR=0 if he/she reports no drug use.

Similarly, DR* =1 if the actual drug use is positive and DR* =0 if actual drug use is zero. Let

the probability distribution of vit be

Prob(DRit= 1, DR*it= 1) = p1, Prob(DRit= 1, DR*it= 0) = 0, Prob(DRit= 0, DR*it= 0) = p2,

Prob(DRit= 0, DR*it= 1) = q.

That is,

            DRit                  DR*it                     vit                   Prob(vit)
             1                     1                        0                        P1
             1                     0                        1                        0
             0                     0                        0                        P2
             0                     1                        -1                       q

        The first row in the table indicates that the probability of using drugs and reporting as

such is p1. The second row indicates that the probability of reporting positive drug use when

the person in fact did not use drugs is zero. The probability of telling the truth when actual

drug use is zero is p2; and q stands for the probability of lying when the actual drug use is

positive.




                                                13

Following Ashenfelter and Zimmerman (1997), the probability limit of $ in equation (7) can

be substituted into Equation (6) to obtain

        Note that p1 is readily available in the data, which is the mean reported drug use. The

medical literature contains detailed information regarding the reliability of self-reported

substance use. For example, in an analysis the drinking patterns of college students, it has

been found that the reliability of reporting in the quantity and frequency of drinking beer,




                                                   14
wine and spirits was high, with a reliability ratio of 0.84.9 Reliability ratios range from 0.89

to 0.92 for items such as “driven a car while drinking,” “missed a class because of hangover,”

and “damaged property because of drinking.” (Weiss et al., 1998). An analysis of out-of-

treatment drug users indicated a reliability ratio of 0.72 for self-reported cocaine use, 0.77 for

heroin, and 0.82 for crack. The ratio was 0.88 for the number of times the person injected

drugs. For both cocaine and opiate use, total agreement between self-reports and urinalysis

was over 84 percent (Johnson et al. 2000). Utilizing this literature, we postulate that 80% of

drug users reported their drug use correctly. This suggests that p2=1-(p1/0.8), q=p1/4, and D is

calculated from the data, separately for gun availability and each drug use measure.

Variations in the reporting rate did not change the results in a meaningful way.

        The analysis of guns-crime relationship is performed by estimating versions of

Equation (3A). In case of the variable that measures gun availability, measurement error

seems negligible. This is because, in the sample of siblings and twins, there is nearly perfect

agreement between siblings to the question on gun availability at home. For example, in the

first wave among 2,117 sibling pairs, 440 pairs indicated that guns were available to them at

home and 1,677 pairs said guns were not available. There was perfect agreement between

siblings in these answers. In wave two, 326 individuals indicated that guns were available at

home; and 323 of these siblings indicated the same. Thus, the agreement rate was 99%. One-

thousand-eighthundred-one juveniles indicated that guns were not available, and the

responses of their siblings were almost identical (1,798 of them also said that guns were not

                                                   15
available at home).10 Therefore, we first report the results with no adjustment for

measurement error in gun availability. However, we also report estimates with adjustment

for non-random measurement error in gun availability as described above (Equation 8). It is

well-known that classical measurement error in the explanatory variable attenuates its

estimated coefficient, and the bias is exacerbated in first-differenced data (Levitt 1998a,

Griliches and Hausman 1986).11 In our case, where we entertain the possibility of one-sided

measurement error due to differential propensity of telling the truth about gun availability at

home, the bias depends on p1, p2 and D.

           In models that employ time and sibling (or twin) differencing, we estimate models

(suppressing X) such as

∇∆CR jit = β∇∆DR * jit + ∇∆ε jit

The probability limit of the estimated coefficient is equal to (the details are in Appendix-A)

10
  This cannot be attributable to siblings lying in concert, because although in some cases the siblings
took the survey in different days, in most cases they took it simultaneously.
11
  This can be seen by calculating the probability limit of ϕ in equation (3A) when gun availability is
measured with error. In case of classical measurement error one obtains

IV. Data

        The data used in the analyses are drawn from the two waves of the National

Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health).12 Add Health is a nationally

representative study of adolescents in grades 7 through 12. An in-school questionnaire was

administered to every student who attended one of the sampled 132 U.S. schools on a

particular day during the period between September 1994 and April 1995. A random sample

of approximately 200 adolescents from each high school/feeder school pair was selected for

in-home interviews which are conducted from April 1995 to December 1995.13 The in-home

   Participating high schools were asked to identify junior high or middle schools that were expected
to provide at least five students to the entering class of the high school. These schools are called



                                                    17
interviews constituted the core sample and contained about 12,000 adolescents. In addition

to the core sample, several special samples (e.g. ethnic and genetic) were also drawn on the

basis of in-school interviews. The core and the special samples provide a total number

20,745 adolescents for Wave I. The adolescents are interviewed for the second time from

April to August 1996 for Wave II. In Wave II, 14,738 adolescents were interviewed.14 Data

are gathered from adolescents, from their parents, siblings, friends, romantic partners and

fellow students, and from school administrators. The survey was designed to provide

detailed information on teen behavior, including their criminal and substance use/abuse.

        One feature of Add Health that we utilize in this paper is the genetic oversample. The

genetic sample consists of pairs of siblings (full, half and stepsiblings), identical twins and

fraternal twins. Eligibility for the genetic sample was determined based on the responses

provided by adolescents in the in-school questionnaire. All mixed sex twin pairs were

classified as fraternal, or dizygotic (DZ). In addition to asking each twin if they were MZ or

DZ, each twin was also given a set of questions on confusability of appearance (if they

looked like two peas in a pod as young children, and three questions on whether they are

confused by strangers, teachers or family members). A zygosity scale is created, which is an

average of the confusability item scores over the reports of both twins. When self-report

data on appearance was missing, mother’s report of confusability of appearance was used. If

there was conflict between the twins’ self-reports of zygosity and the classification based on


feeder schools. Their probability of selection was proportional to the percentage of the high school’s
entering class that came from that feeder.
14
  The sample for the Wave II In-home Interview was composed of the respondents of the Wave I In-
home Interview, with the following exceptions: A respondent who was in the 12th grade in Wave I
and who was not part of the genetic sample was not interviewed in Wave II. Respondents who were
only in Wave I’s disabled sample were not re-interviewed.




                                                  18
confusability of appearance, the twins are classified as “uncertain zygosity”. Using the

responses from Wave I questionnaire, those classified as uncertain zygosity were asked in

Wave II for cheek samples for DNA analysis. There are 43 twin pairs that refused to provide

a sample for testing, and they are deleted from our sample. After deleting twins with

undetermined zygosity, the raw sample of siblings (including twins) consists of 4,030

individuals. Of these, 1,986 are full siblings, 700 are half siblings, 821 are DZ twins and 523

are MZ twins. The sample of twins contains the DZ and MZ twins; and the sample of

identical twins consists of the 523 MZ twins. Twins constitute 7 percent of the sample.15

There is one set of triplets and no quadruplets. The triplets are coded as three sets of twins.

        The survey includes a number of detailed questions about delinquent behavior of

adolescents. Specifically, respondents were asked whether they had committed any of the

following acts in the 12 months prior to the interview date: robbery, burglary, damaging

property, and theft. Adolescents were also asked about whether they had used different types

of illicit drugs such as cocaine, other drugs (heroin, LCD, etc.), inhalants, or ever injected any

illegal drugs with a needle. In wave I, the juveniles were asked if they ever used these drugs.

In wave II they were asked if they used these drugs since the last interview. Survey

administrators took several steps to maintain data security and to minimize the potential for

interviewer or parental influence. First, respondents were not provided with any printed

questionnaires. Rather, all data were recorded on laptop computers. Second, for sensitive

topics, such as delinquent behavior, substance use/abuse, and gun availability, the adolescents




15
  The proportion of twins in total births has been rising steadily over the last two decades. When
most of the adolescents of the sample were born around 1980, twin births were about 2 percent of
total births (National Vital Statistics Report 1999).




                                                  19
listened to pre-recorded questions through earphones and entered their answers directly on

the laptops.16

        Definitions of the variables used in empirical analyses based on the siblings and twins

samples and their descriptive statistics are reported in Table 1.17 The first two columns of

Table 1 report the weighted means and standard deviations of the sibling sample of Wave I.

The next column displays the standard deviations of the first-differenced variables, and the

last column presents the standard deviations for the first-and-sibling-differenced variables.

Some personal and household characteristics, such as race, ethnicity, gender, and whether

parents were born in the U.S. do not change between the waves. Therefore, these variables

are not reported in Table 1. The deterrence variables in Wave I, such as arrest rates, pertain

to 1992, and they were not collected in the second Wave. This is not a drawback because

sibling or twin differencing eliminates all variables that are the same across twins or siblings.

Put differently, siblings of the same household are exposed to the same time-series variation

in contextual variables, such as local economic and social conditions, and deterrence

measures. For the analysis of guns-crime relationship, the change in these contextual

variables between the two survey years is controlled by state or county dummies.

        Table 1 shows that about 24 percent of the 3,394 siblings and twins indicate that guns

were available to them at home, and about 22 % of the households in wave I have guns

accessible by juveniles. Cook and Ludwig (1996) and Smith (2000) report that in the 1990s

35 to 40 percent of households had firearms. Given that the question posed to the juveniles

pertains to “guns available to them,” 22% availability rate appears reasonable. Our data set

  For less sensitive questions, the interviewer read the questions aloud, and entered the respondent’s
answers.

also matches well in other dimensions with similar surveys. For example, in our data set,

about 10% of the juveniles responded in the affirmative to the question “have you ever

carried a weapon at school?” This response rate is consistent with other youth surveys. In

1993, 8 percent of high school students had carried a gun in the prior 30 days (Kann et al.

1995).



V. Results

Guns and Crime

          In Table 2 we report the estimated coefficients of gun availability at home in four

crime regressions using first-differenced data (Equation 3A) on siblings and twins.

Regressions include 21 control variables, including Seatbelt, Height, Weight, GPA, Perceived

IQ-Below Average, Perceived IQ-Average, Welfare, Alcohol at Home, Drugs at Home,

Allowance, Tattoo, Piercing, No Chance to Live until 35, Good Chance to Live Until 35,

Decides Own Curfew on Weekends, Decides Own Curfew on Weeknights, Decides TV

Time, Chooses Own Friends, Gut Feeling-Yes, Gut Feeling-Neutral. Regressions also

include measures of drug use. Table 2 reports gun coefficients from the models that also

include cocaine as a drug use measure. Regressions that included other measures of drug use

provided very similar coefficients.

          The left-hand-side panel of the table (columns 1-3) reports coefficients unadjusted for

measurement error; the right-hand panel (columns 4-6) reports the results with measurement

error adjustment (Equation 8). In the second and fifth columns of Table 2 the change in local

deterrence and economic conditions between the two years is controlled for by a set of state

17
     Questions in Wave II are worded as “Since the last interview … ”. Therefore the change in




                                                   21
dummies. The third and sixth columns present the results of the models that include county

dummies, under the assumption that time-variation in deterrence and economic conditions

where the juvenile resides has an impact on his/her behavior.

        The coefficient of gun availability is always significant in robbery, burglary and theft.

The magnitudes indicate that having guns available at home increases the probability of

robbery, burglary and theft by 1.5 to 2 percentage points after adjusting for the measurement

error. If current criminal activity of the juvenile depends positively on his past criminal

behavior, and if current gun availability at home is negatively correlated with juvenile’s past

criminal behavior, the results may be biased downwards.18 In that case, the results reported

in Table 2 are underestimates of the true impact of gun availability. It is interesting to note

that gun availability at home has no impact on the propensity to damage property. To the

extent that no gun is needed to damage property, this result is meaningful.19

        It should be noted that the models include four parental supervision variables

(Decides TV time, Decides Own Curfew on Weekends, Decides Own Curfew on

Weeknights, and Chooses Own Friends) as well as a variable that measures whether alcohol

is available to the juvenile at home, and another variable that measures whether drugs are

available at home. Thus, controlling for these family environment and supervision effects,

gun availability has a separate, positive impact on delinquent behavior. We also estimated


behavior between the two waves is easily identifiable.
18
  Specifically, if an increase in criminal behavior between time periods t-2 and t-1 (∆CRt-1) motivates
parents to eliminate guns at home (∆Gt<0), and if (∆CRt-1) is positively correlated with the dependent
variable ∆CRt, the estimated impact of guns will be biased down. We thank John Donohue for this
insight.
19
  The point estimate is similar to the ones estimated in burglary, robbery and theft equations. The
explanatory variable is same (the change in access to guns) in all regressions, and the change in
damaging property exhibits more variation than other crime categories (see Table 1).



                                                  22
the same models using first-differenced data on all juveniles (n=11,456). Neither the

magnitudes nor the statistical significance of the results changed.

        If availability of guns at home is interpreted as a sign of undesirable home

environment, and if such an environment impacts the juvenile’s criminal behavior, then the

relationship between guns and crime is not causal, but it is a reflection of the influence of

harmful home environment. For example, if most parents who allow their children to have

access to guns at home have criminal tendencies themselves, and if such criminal human

capital is transmitted to the child, then having access to guns is a proxy for a tendency for

criminal behavior. We have no information on the criminal records of the parents, but it

should be emphasized that taking first-differences of the data eliminates parent-specific as

well as child-specific heterogeneity, such as unobserved tendency for criminal delinquency.

        Nevertheless, to test whether gun availability at home is merely a measure of

unobserved time-varying parent characteristics that also impact child behavior, we

investigated if the change in gun availability has an impact on the change in other ill-behavior

of the child such as lying, being expelled from school, drinking and fighting, smoking, and

having sex.20

         If having guns available at home is a proxy of the home environment, then it should

have an impact on these behaviors as well. The results, reported in Table 3, demonstrate that

availability of guns at home has no impact on lying, being expelled from school, smoking,

drinking & fighting, and having sex. The point estimates are small, negative in half of the


20
   In Wave I the questions for these behaviors are: “Have you ever lied to your parents or guardians
about where you have been or whom you were with?,” “Have you ever being expelled from school?,”
“Have you ever tried cigarette smoking?,” “Did you get into a physical fight because you had been
drinking in the last 12 months?,” and “Have you ever had sexual intercourse?” In Wave II, the same
questions were asked as “Since the last interview, have you …”.



                                                 23
cases, and never statistically significant. This indicates that having guns available at home is

positively related to criminal activity, but it has no significant impact on other types of bad

behavior.

       One main argument in favor of concealed weapons laws is that they allow law-

abiding citizens to protect themselves from potential perpetrators. As a result, carrying a

firearm is expected to decrease criminal victimization. We provide a test of this hypothesis.

The data set contains four questions that measure criminal victimization of the juvenile.

They are “whether during the past 12 months someone pulled a knife or gun on you,”

“whether during the past 12 months someone shot you,” “whether during the past 12 months

someone cut you or stabbed you,” and “whether during the past 12 months you were

jumped.” Using the same set of explanatory variables, we estimated the probability of

victimization based on these questions. The results, which are reported in Table 4 reveal that

having access to guns does not decrease the probability of victimization for juveniles. In fact,

gun availability increases the probability of being cut or stabbed, and the probability of

someone pulling a knife or gun on the juvenile by about 2 percentage points. The increase in

the probability of victimization can be because juveniles may become overconfident because

of guns being available to them. As a result, they may engage in situations with less certain

outcomes. This point has been demonstrated theoretically by Donohue III and Levitt (1998).

The upshot is that, the results show that gun availability has a positive impact on juvenile

crime, and it also increases the risk of being victimized.




                                                24
Drugs and Crime

        In Table 5 we report the estimated coefficients of drug use indicators using the sample

of siblings (including twins). The top panel presents results pertaining to Equation (3A),

which is the fixed-effects model. As in Table 2, in addition to drug use measures, the

regressions include the following explanatory variables: Seatbelt, Height, Weight, GPA,

Perceived IQ-Below Average, Perceived IQ-Average, Welfare, Alcohol at Home, Drugs at

Home, Guns at Home, Allowance, Tattoo, Piercing, No Chance to Live until 35, Good

Chance to Live Until 35, Decides Own Curfew on Weekends, Decides Own Curfew on

Weeknights, Decides TV Time, Chooses Own Friends, Gut Feeling-Yes, Gut Feeling-

Neutral.

        The bottom panel of Table 5 displays the results obtained from Equation (4), which

involves time-differencing as well as sibling-differencing. In this specification variables

pertaining to family attributes drop out as they do not vary between siblings. Both panels of

Table 5 display two sets of results. The left-hand-side presents the results unadjusted for

measurement error in drug use, where the right-hand-side displays the results with

measurement error adjustment. For each drug variable we used specific values of Φ obtained

from the data.

           As Table 5 demonstrates, drug use coefficients are positive and significantly

different from zero in almost all cases in the top panel, and a similar picture emerges in the

bottom panel, with the exception of the impact of Other Drugs.21


21
  Note that the relative sample size of the first-differenced and first-and-sibling differenced data
depends on the number of siblings in households. For example, if a household consists of two
siblings, the first differenced (time-differenced) data will contain two observations, and the first-and-
sibling differenced data will contain one observation. On the other hand, if the household consists of
three siblings A, B and C, the first-differenced data will contain three observations, and the first-and-



                                                    25
        Table 6 presents the results for twins. As in Table 5, the upper panel displays the

results of the fixed-effects model (Equation 3A), while the lower panel contains the results

obtained from time- and within-twin differencing.22 To the extent that individual unobserved

time-varying heterogeneity is the same between twins, this specification is represented by

Equation (5). Although the sample size goes down to about 450 in case of twins, drug use

coefficients remain significant in many cases, even in models with time and twin-

differencing. For example, in the lower panel cocaine consumption impacts theft and

damage. Other drugs influence burglary, theft, and damage. Injection is associated with an

increase in the propensity to commit burglary and theft.

        Table 7 displays the results for identical twins. Although there are only 400

observations in the fixed-effects model (top panel), with the exception of theft, each crime is

influenced by two different drug measures. For example, robberies are influenced by using

cocaine and inhalants, burglaries are influenced by inhalants and injection, and damage is

influenced by using inhalants and other drugs. In the lower panel where the results of fixed-

effects and within twin differences are reported, the sample size goes down to 176, and

therefore, the coefficients are not estimated with precision. Nevertheless, injection is

statistically significant in burglary and theft equations, and other drugs is significant in the

damage regression.

        The results in Tables 5-7 demonstrate the positive impact of drug use on crime.

Although the precision of the estimated coefficients goes down as the sample gets smaller,


sibling differenced data will also contain three observations (it will consist of ∆A-∆B, ∆A-∆C and
∆B-∆C, where ∆A is a first-differenced variable of sibling A). In case of a household with four
siblings, the first-differenced data have four observations and first-and-sibling differenced data have
six observations.

the point estimates of individual drug variables are stable across specifications. We

calculated the median point estimate for each drug category across crime types. In models

with first-differences the median impact on crime of using cocaine is 11 percentage points.

The impact of using inhalants is 14 percentage points. The median impacts on crime of other

drugs and injecting drugs are 5 and 27 percentage points, respectively. In double-differenced

models the median impacts are 14 percentage points for inhalants, 18 percentage points for

other drugs, 23 percentage points for cocaine, and 50 percentage points for injection. The

results for injection should be taken with caution because of the small number of users in this

case.



Reverse causality

           Although taking first and sibling (or twin) differences eliminates unobserved

heterogeneity that would otherwise have been included in the error terms, it can still be

argued that drug use may be influenced by reverse causality from property crimes if

committing these crimes is associated with increased income. To account for this potential

reverse causality, we considered a reduced-form drug use equation, where the instruments

that impact the drug use of the juvenile include the following variables: whether at least one

of the three best friends smokes at least one cigarette a day, whether at least one of the three

best friends drinks alcohol at least once a month, and whether at least one of the three best

friends uses marijuana at least once a month. While it can plausibly be argued that friends’

consumption of cigarette, alcohol and marijuana may be correlated with own drug use, it is

less obvious that these instruments are uncorrelated with own criminal activity.

     The sample size of the first-and-twin differenced data is not half of the first-differenced twin sample




                                                      27
Unfortunately no better instruments are available. State or county level alcohol and drug

prices are not viable candidates to identify the effect of drug use as they do not vary between

siblings and twins. School based policy variables are not useful either, because all twins and

most siblings attend the same school.23 Estimation of the double-differenced crime and

double-differenced reduced-form drug use equations with full-information maximum

likelihood revealed that although the magnitudes of the estimated drug use coefficients are

similar to those reported in tables 5-7, most coefficients are not estimated with precision.

The imprecision of the estimated coefficients is most likely due to weak instruments, but the

data set does not include better instrument candidates. (The explicit specification is reported

in Appendix B).

       In Table A-1 in Appendix B we report the coefficients for inhale and inject for

siblings, twins and identical twins. These are the drugs that created most precise estimates.

For siblings, the use of inhalants has a positive impact on burglary, theft, and damage.

Injection has an impact on robbery and burglary. In case of all twins, injection has an impact

on theft, and in the sample of identical twins injection influences burglary and theft.



VI. Conclusion

       The analysis of the determinants of juvenile risky behavior in general, and juvenile

crime in particular has become an important research question (Gruber 2001, Levitt 1998b,

Mocan and Rees 1999). In addition to sanctions, economic variables and social factors, guns

and drug use are potentially important determinants of criminal activity. The causal effect of



because of missing values in some variables.

   Grossman, Kaestner and Markowitz (2002) highlight the same point in their analysis of drug use on
teenage sexual activity.

drug use on crime has not yet been established due to statistical difficulties. The propensity

to use drugs may be correlated with unobserved attributes and characteristics of the

individual. If these attributes, such as risk aversion or intelligence, have an influence on

criminal activity, then estimates of drug use on crime are biased because of this confounding.

The same difficulty exists in research on guns-crime relationship, which used aggregate (state

or county-level) data. In addition, it has been difficult to find data sets with measures of gun

availability. Therefore, researchers explained crime rates with some proxies of gun

ownership, such as sales of gun magazines, or suicides involving firearms. Alternatively,

they analyzed the impact of gun laws on state or county crime rates.

       In this paper we employ the AddHealth data, which is a nationally-representative

panel data set of high school students that contains an oversample of siblings and twins. In

addition to an unusually large number of interesting variables that aim to gauge personal

characteristics, family background and family supervision, the data set includes a direct

question on the availability of guns to the juvenile at home. The data set also contains

detailed information about drug use and criminal activity of the juveniles. In particular,

consumption of cocaine, injecting drugs, using inhalants, and using other drugs are measured.

The crimes we analyze are robberies, burglaries and thefts committed by juveniles and

whether they damaged property.

       We adjust for measurement error in gun availability and drug use with an algorithm

that allows for non-symmetric measurement error. The impact of gun availability on crime is

analyzed using first-differenced data, where time-invariant individual-specific and family-

specific heterogeneity is eliminated.




                                                29
       The results reveal that gun availability at home increases the propensity to commit

robbery, burglary and theft by two percentage points for juveniles, but it has no impact on

damaging property.    It is unlikely that gun availability is merely a measure of the

unobserved home environment. This is because other measures of home environment, such

as various parent supervision variables and variables that indicate the availability of alcohol

and the availability of drugs at home, have no similar systematic impacts on crime. More

important, gun availability at home has no impact on other bad behavior, such as lying, being

expelled from school, drinking and fighting, smoking and having sex.

       We also investigate whether gun availability decreases the probability of being a

crime victim. We find no support for this hypothesis; in fact the results show that having

access to guns increases the probability of being cut or stabbed by someone and someone

pulling a knife or gun on the juvenile.

       The variation of drug use between siblings and twins allows us to exploit within-

sibling differences of the first-differenced data. This enables us to filter out time-varying

unobservables that are common to each household (therefore to each sibling). In addition,

taking the twin differences of the first-differenced data enables us to eliminate the genetic

component of criminal activity common to both twins.

       The results indicate that drug use increases the propensity to commit crime. The

median impact of injecting drugs on the probability of committing robbery, burglary and theft

and creating property damage is 50 percentage points, although this result should be taken

with caution because it is based on small number of individuals who inject drugs. The

median impact of cocaine is an increased criminal propensity of 23 percentage points. The

use of inhalants generates a (median) 14 percentage point increase in the propensity to




                                                30
commit crime; and other drugs increase the propensity to commit crime by 18 percentage

points.

          Given the impact of juvenile criminal activity on human capital accumulation and

future earnings, and given the magnitude of the externalities generated by juvenile crime

cited in the introduction, these results suggest that the current debates on gun control and

drug policies have dimensions in addition to individual liberties and constitutional rights.

                                           APPENDIX-A

General Framework

DRit= DR*it + vit , where DR*it is the actual drug use (0=No, 1=Yes) and DRit is the reported
drug use (0=No, 1=Yes)

Let probability distribution of vit be
Prob(DRit= 1, DR*it=1)=p1
Prob(DRit= 1, DR*it=0)=0
Prob(DRit= 0, DR*it=0)=p2
Prob(DRit= 0, DR*it=1)=q

In other words,

            DRit                   DR*it                      vit              Prob(vit)
             1                      1                         0                   P1
             1                      0                         1                   0
             0                      0                         0                   P2
             0                      1                         -1                  q

p1+p2+q=1;

E[ v ] = − q
E[ DR*] = 1 − p 2
var[v] = q − q 2
var[ DR*] = p 2 − p 22
cov[v, DR*] = − p 2 q
var[ DR] = p1 − p12


Probability Limit of the Coefficient of Drug Use in First-differenced Data

The probability limit is

        ^      var[∆DRt *] + cov[∆v t , ∆DRt *]
p lim β = β
                        var[∆DRt ]

Note that by definition

var[∆DRt *] = var[∆DRt ] − var[∆v t ] − 2 cov[∆DRt *, ∆vt ]

Thus,

                       1             1            1
cov[∆DRt *, ∆v t ] =     var[∆DRt ] − var[∆v t ] − var(∆DRt *)
                       2             2            2

                                                  43
Substitution for cov(∆DR*,∆v) provides

         ^
 p lim β = β
                        [
                   0.5 var(∆DRt ) + var(∆DR * t ) − var(∆v t )                 ]
                                  var(∆DRt )

Note that
var(∆DRt ) = var(DRt − DRt −1 ) = var(DRt ) + var(DRt −1 ) − 2 cov(DRt , DRt −1 )

Assuming that DR is covariance stationary; i.e. Var(DRt)=Var(DRt-1),
var(∆DRt ) = 2σ DR
                2
                   (1 − ρ DRt , DRt −1 ) , where σ2DR=var(DRt).

Similarly
var(∆DR *t ) = 2σ DR
                  2
                     * (1 − ρ DR*t , DR*t −1 )                 and        var(∆v t ) = 2σ V2 (1 − ρ vt vt −1 )


where σ2ν =var(νt) and σ2DR*=var(DRt*)


Substituting the variances of DR, DR* and v into the probability limit formula, one obtains

(A1)               ^
          p lim β = β
                                 [
                             0.5 2σ DR
                                    2
                                       (1 − ρ DRt , DRt −1 ) + 2σ DR
                                                                  2
                                                                     * (1 − ρ DR *t , DR*t −1 ) − 2σ v (1 − ρ vt , vt −1 )
                                                                                                     2
                                                                                                                             ]
                                                              2σ   2
                                                                   DR   (1 − ρ DRt , DRt −1 )

Note that
A2 = cov( DRt , DRt −1 ) = cov( DR *t + v t , DR *t −1 + v t −1 )

= cov( DRt , DRt −1 ) = cov( DR *t , DR *t −1 ) + cov( DR *t −1 , v t ) + cov( DR *t , v t −1 ) + cov(v t , vt −1 )

Also,
cov( DRt , DRt −1 ) = ρ DRt , DRt −1 σ DR
                                       2


cov( DR *t , DR *t −1 ) = ρ DR*t , DR*t −1 σ DR
                                             2
                                                *

cov(v t , vt −1 ) = ρ vt ,vt −1 σ v2

Therefore, one can rewrite (A2) as
ρ DRt , DRt −1 σ DR
                 2
                    = ρ DR*t , DR*t −1 σ DR
                                         2
                                            * + ρ vt ,vt −1 σ v + cov( DR * t −1 , v t ) + cov( DR * t , v t −1 )
                                                              2




Because,
cov( DR *t −1 , vt ) = cov( DR *t −1 , DRt − DR *t ) = cov( DR *t −1 , DRt ) − cov( DR *t −1 , DR *t ).

Assuming
cov( DR *t −1 , DRt ) = 0, one obtains
cov( DR *t −1 , v t ) = − ρ DR*t , DR*t −1 σ DR
                                             2
                                                *




                                                                   44
Similarly.
cov( DR *t , vt −1 ) = cov( DR *t , DRt −1 − DR *t −1 ) = cov( DR *t , DRt −1 ) − cov( DR *t , DR *t −1 )

Assuming

cov( DR *t , DRt −1 ) = 0,
one gets
cov( DR *t , v t −1 ) = − ρ DR*t , DR*t −1 σ DR
                                             2
                                                *



Therefore, (A2) is equivalent to:
ρ DRt , DRt −1 σ DR
                 2
                    = ρ DR*t , DR*t −1 σ DR

Probability Limit of the Coefficient of Drug Use in Double-differenced Data

The probability limit is

 p lim β = β
                                                           var(∇∆DR jit )


                                                                                        45
By definition, var(∇∆DR jit *) = var(∇∆DR jit ) − var(∇∆v jit ) − 2 cov(∇∆DR jit *, ∇∆v jit )

Therefore,
                                                            1                 1               1

Note that

var(∇∆DR jit ) = var(DR j 2t − DR j 2t −1 − DR j1t + DR j1t −1 ) = var( DR j 2t ) + var( DR j 2t −1 ) + var(DR j1t ) + var( DR j1t −1 )
− 2 cov( DR j 2t , DR j 2t −1 ) − 2 cov( DR j 2t , DR j1t ) + 2 cov( DR j 2t , DR j1t −1 ) + 2 cov(DR j 2t −1 , DR j1t ) − 2 cov( DR j 2t −1 , DR j1t −1 )
− 2 cov( DR j1t , DR j1t −1 )

where the subscripts 1 and 2 represent the first and the second individuals in sibling (twin)
pair j, and t-1 and t represent the first and the second time periods. Suppressing j for ease of
notation, we can rewrite the above equation as

   var(∇∆DRit ) = 4σ DR

                                                   2




Assuming constant variances of drug use between siblings and over time, one obtains

var(∇∆DRit ) = σ DR
                 2
                    ( Φ + 4)
where (A5)= Φ = −2 ρ DR                   2 t DR2 t −1
                                                         − 2 ρ DR2 t DR1t + 2 ρ DR2 t DR1t −1 + 2 ρ DR2 t −1DR1t − 2 ρ DR2 t −1 DR1t −1 − 2 ρ DR1t DR1t −1

Similarly, var(∇∆DR *it ) = σ DR
                              2
                                 * ( Ψ + 4)


where

Ψ = −2 ρ DR*2 t DR*2 t −1 − 2 ρ DR*2 t DR*1t + 2 ρ DR*2 t DR*1t −1 + 2 ρ DR*2 t −1 DR*1t − 2 ρ DR*2 t −1 DR*1t −1 − 2 ρ DR*1t DR*1t −1

and, var(∇∆v it ) = σ V2 (Ω + 4)

where

Ω = −2 ρ v2 t v2 t −1 − 2 ρ v2 t v1t + 2 ρ v2 t v1t −1 + 2 ρ v2 t −1v1t − 2 ρ v2 t −1v1t −1 − 2 ρ v1t v1t −1



                                                                                 46
Substituting the expressions for the variances in (A4) gives

                                                           1
            ^

                ^          1 (var( DRit )(4 + Φ ) − var(vit )(4 + Ω) + var( DRit *)(4 + Ψ )
 p lim β = β
                           2                       var( DRit )( 4 + Φ )

Note that
cov( DR1t , DR2t −1 ) = cov( DR *1 t + v1t , DR * 2t −1 + v 2t −1 )
cov( DR 1t , DR 2 t −1 ) = cov( DR *1 t , DR *1 t ) + cov( DR *1 t , v1 t ) + cov(v 2t −1 , DR * 2t −1 ) + cov(v 2t −1 , v 2t −1 )

Because
  cov( DR1t , DR2t −1 ) = ρ DR1t , DR2 t −1 σ DR
                                              2


   cov( DR *1t , DR * 2t −1 ) = ρ DR*1t , DR*2 t −1 σ DR
                                                      2
                                                         *

   cov(v1t , v 2t −1 ) = ρ 1t ,v2 t −1s σ v2

We obtain
(A6)=Cov(DR1t,DR2t-1) =
 ρ DR1t , DR2 t −1 σ DR
                     2
                        = ρ DR*1t , DR*2 t −1 σ DR
                                                2

                                                                         2




The third term in Equation (A6) is:
cov( DR *1t , v 2t −1 ) = cov( DR *1t , DR2t −1 − DR * 2t −1 ) = cov( DR *1t , DR2t −1 ) − cov( DR *1t , DR * 2t −1 )

Assuming cov( DR *1t , DR2t −1 ) = 0 we obtain

(A7)= cov( DR *1t , v2t −1 ) = − cov( DR *1t , DR *2t −1 ) = − ρ DR*1t , DR*2 t −1σ DR
                                                                                    2
                                                                                       *



The fourth term in Equation (A6) is:
cov(v1t , DR * 2t −1 ) = cov( DR1t − DR *1t , DR * 2t −1 ) = cov( DR1t , DR * 2t −1 ) − cov( DR *1t , DR * 2t −1 )

Again, assuming cov( DR1t , DR * 2t −1 ) = 0 we obtain

(A8)= cov(v1t , DR * 2t −1 ) = − cov( DR *1t , DR * 2t −1 ) = − ρ DR*1t , DR*2 t −1 σ DR
                                                                                      2
                                                                                         *



Substituting (A7) and (A8) into (A6) one obtains

One can obtain similar expressions for
ρ DR2 t DR1t , ρ DR2 t DR1t −1 ρ DR2 t −1DR1t , ρ DR2 t −1 DR1t −1 , ρ DR1t DR1t −1 .

To address potential reverse-causality, we specify Equations (A7) and (A8) below.

(A7)    ∇∆CRjit= δ∇∆Xjit+β∇∆DRjit+:jit.

(A8) ∇∆DRjit= B∇∆Xjit+.∇∆Zjit+0jit.


In Equation (A8) Z represents the instruments that impact the drug use of the juvenile which
include the following variables: whether at least one of the three best friends smokes at least
one cigarette a day, whether at least one of the three best friends drinks alcohol at least once a
month, and whether at least one of the three best friends uses marijuana at least once a month.
While it can plausibly be argued that friends’ consumption of cigarette, alcohol and
marijuana may be correlated with own drug use, it is less obvious that these instruments are
uncorrelated with own criminal activity. Unfortunately no better instruments are available.
State or county level alcohol and drug prices are not viable candidates to identify the effect of
drug use as they do not vary between siblings and twins. School based policy variables are
not useful either, because all twins and most siblings attend the same school.24
Equations (A7) and (A8) are estimated jointly using full information maximum likelihood.
We allow for a correlation between the error terms in equations (A7) and (A8) using the
discrete factor method (DFM). The DFM assumes that the correlation between these two
equations is governed by a common factor, the distribution of which can be approximated by
a step function. The common discrete factor is then integrated out of the model as in the
standard random effects approach. This method is less restrictive than the specifying
functional form, such as joint normality. See Blau and Hagy (1998), Hu (1999), Mocan,
Tekin, and Zax (2000), and Mocan and Tekin (2003) for applications of the DFM.
