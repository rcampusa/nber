       Coherency Conditions in Simultaneous Linear Equation Models
                    with Endogenous Switching Regimes

                                   SUNMARY

                                                                                   S

       In   modelling disequilibrium macroeconomic systems which one would

want to subject to econometric estimation one typically faces the problem

of whether the structural model can determine a unique equilibrium. The

problem inherits a special form because the regimes in which the equilibria

can lie are each linear. By placing restrictions on the parameters that

insure the uniqueness of such a solution for each value of the exogenous

and random variables, we can improve the estimation procedure.

       This paper provides necessary and sufficient conditions for uniqueness

——or "coherency." These conditions are applied to a variety of models that

have been prominent in the literature on econometrics with 'switching regimes'

such as those of self—selectivity (Maddala), simultaneous equation tobit and

probit (Amemiya, Schmidt) and multi—market macroeconomic disequilibrium

(Gourieroux, Laffont and Nonfort).

           Let us consider a general econometric model defined as
follows


                g        '
                             x u
                              ,       ,   0) =   0



      where        is a vector of eadogenous variables,      x is a vector

of exogenous variables,      u is a vector of perturbations, 0 is a

vector of unknown parameters and g is a known vector function.


           If this model is to be used for econometric purposes, it
must associate a unique value of           y with any admissible value of

x ,    u   and 0     ;   in other words, the model must have a well—defined

reduced form


                    = h
                        (x ,      u   '   0)


           In the sequel we shall call "coherency conditions" the condi-
tions on the parameters 0 that insure this property.


           This coherency problem must be distinguished from the identi-
fiability problem which can be meaningfully stated only for a model
satisfying the coherency property. Indeed the identifiability of a
model, which is the uniqueness of the parameters of the model given the
distribution of the observable variables, presupposes the existence
of a well—defined distribution for the endogenous variables. For
instance, in the general linear model



           Byt+Cxu
      the coherency condition reduces to the invertibility of B (i.e.
det B 0 ) whereas the first—order identifiability amounts to the

uniqueness of B and C given B' C
                                            —2



             In   non linear models the issue of coherency is usually
incompletely dealt with by assuming the differentiability of g and

requiring a non vanishing Jacobian
                                              a   g     The latter condition
                                              a

insures    only locally the obtainability of a reduced form. Moreover,
the constraints implied on the parameters are never spelled out.


            In this paper we provide an explicit solution of the cohe-
rency problem for a particular class of non linear models, namely the
class of simultaneous linear equation models with endogenously swit-
ching regimes. In this case g is piecewise linear in y and the

coherency property is the invertibility of this piecewise linear
mapping.


            Recently the literature has offered a large variety of
such models, in particular the self—selectivity models (e.g. MADDALA
 9]), the simultaneous equation Probit and Tobit models (e.g.
AMENIYA    [1], SC1IDT    [13])   or   the simultaneous equation disequilibrium
models (e.g. GOURIEROUX,LAFFONT and MONFORT [3]).


          In the next four sections we provide necessary and sufficient
conditions of coherency for the general piecewise linear model under
four different sets of assumptions. Each case is illustrated by various
examples   borrowed from the literature.

    1- TYPE I MOVELS : CONTINLIOLIS PIECE(UISE LINEAR MAPPINGS ON CONES
       VEFINEV BY ENVOGENOUS VARIABLES.




             Consider the Euclidian space,                      ,   and consider a inde-

pendent linear forms, a1 ,               ... , a  ,   defined       on     .   For   each

subset I of the set (i ,                 2 ,  ... , n} let  ,        C1 be the cone

defined by



        C,=CXIXG]Rn
         I          a.x0
                    1
                                                            if iEI and

                                        a.x<O               if iI}

             There are 2' such cones ; they coincide with the orthants

of         if each linear form a. is the th coordinate projection

function :      a. x =
                  1
                          x.1


             Let us associate with each cone an invertible linear mapping,

         from    a    .         a
A1 ,            ]R    into ]R       .    Then, consider the mapping f           Z A1
                                                                                I
where


•
                      (x)=I             if xEC1
                 I
                          =0            if xC1

             The mapping f is therefore a piecewise linear mapping from

       into ]R defined by the linear mapping                     A1 on each cone C1 with

U CT =]Rtt       Note that the mappings A,. need not be different ; in
                                                      .1.

that case, the relevant partition of P' in cones may, have less than

     elements.


               We will see in the examples below that the possibility of
having a well—defined reduced form in a model where the structural
form is piecewise linear depends on the invertibility of a mapping
suchas f


               In this section we assume, as it is often the case in appli-
cations, that the matrices A1 are constrained in such a way that the

function f is continuous. We can then state our first invertibility
theorem1'.




     Theorem I


               Suppose that the mapping f            E A1            is continuous
                                                     I          I

from IRtl to           .   A necessary and sufficient confition for £ to
be invertible is that all the determinants, det                     A1 ,
I C {i ,   2   ,   ... , n}   ,   have the same sign.


           We show belowhow to use this theorem in examples presented
in a very concise form2.

    Example 1.1.


           Consider the following model discussed by LEE [81

    where (y ,                    are endogenous variables, (X ,                      X2)
are exogenous variables and (u1 ,                                are random disturbances.

           The problem of the existence of a reduced form for this model
is identical to the problem of the invertibility of the mapping from

             There is another piecewise linear Continuous mapping between
(D ,   S)    and the observable variables, namely,                      P) .   It   is

                                   0             1              1       0

Applying again theorem 1 we see that the mapping is one to one since

AI>o, A2>0

             Consequently the mapping from the random disturbances and
exogenous variables to the observables is one to one when A > 0

X2 > 0 ,       <   0       12 > 0 ,        ensuring    a well defined reduced form for

this problem.




     Example 1.3.


             GOLDFELD and QUANDT [51             have studied a model which can be
defined as follows


            Rt =6' ItX + It
                       I




               =

                                           2    2t +

     where         defines the crop of the corriodity, E the desired

harvest ;    St = mm       (R ,            is   the actual supply, i.e. the actual

harvest.


            The demand is defined in the form of an inverse demand
function


                   13D +          X3 + u3


     and the price adjusts to equate demand and actual supply                  (D =   S)

                    It   is easy to verify that the mappings (A.) coincide on

the common boundaries of the cones (C.) on which they are relevant.

Therefore theorem I can be applied ; the coherency conditions are that
the determinants (I —               —

                    It is worth pointing out the difference which exists between
the coherency conditions and the stability conditions of the "natural"
dynamic process associated with the above system.

       designed to converge to the (fixed price) equilibrium of type 1.
The linearization of this system around the equilibrium (Q                , Q)
yields


                    —F' y2F'


                             —G'

           Therefore,    the adjustment process is locally stable if and
only if the real parts of the characteristic values of the matrix

     —F'
            y2F']
                        are negative. The sum       of   the characteristic values

  y4G'
is negative, since the trace —      (F'   +   G')   is negative. The product of
the characteristic values equal to the determinant F' G' (1 —

must therefore be positive in order that the real parts of the charac-
teristic values be negative (actually the characteristic values are
real in this particular case ). The local stability of the quantity
adjustment processes in every regime is therefore equivalent to the
coherency conditions.


           The generalization of this approach to the n —market case
is straightforcard. The model can be written as3):

             The coincidence on the coon boundaries of these cones is
easily checked. The coherency condition requires therefore that the
determinants of all these matrices be of the same sign. This is a
quite messy condition. However it is much weaker than a condition of
stability of each of these matrices (A1)



             Beyond the n = 2        case, stability implies coherency but not
the converse. Indeed stability requires that the real parts of the
characteristic values be negative. Since complex characteristic values

always appear in pairs of conjugate values, the determinant which equals
the product of characteristic values is, under the stability conditions,

of the sign of ( 1)fl          • In particular this implies that the determinants
are of the same sign in all regimes 4)

              The   first condition requires that the mappings, A1 , coin-
cide, point by point, on the intersection of the subspaces defining the
cones C1            the second condition is a global coincidence of these

mappings     on appropriate facets of the cones.


        Example 2.1..

             The first example of application of this                    theorem appeared
in   GOURIEROUX and alii [3] where it was proved directly for n = 4
p=2      .



             The structural form of a two market disequilibrium model                      is
obtained,    using the Clower effective demand. As in Quandt's model
(example 1.5.), four regimes are obtained, according to the signs of
the excess demands on the two                  markets.

             For example, in regime I where there is excess demand on
both markets (the cone C1 is defined by                           Di — S1 > 0
D2t —   S2   )0),            the structural form is

2t are the exchanged quantities. In this regime the Clower effective

demands coincide with the Wairasian demands (see GOURIEROtJX and alii

          The point by point coincidence of these mappings on the inter—

The global conservation of the boundaries àf the cones requires

     Example 2.2.


            We know from economic theory that there exists a correspon-
dence of possible effective demands and any selection in this corres-
pondence is a potential candidate. In GOURIEROUX and alii [31 we used
the Clower effective demand ; QUANDT [11] and ITO [6] use a different
notion which is Continuous on the boundaries of the regimes, and
PORTES [10] has compared these two notions with a third one inspired
from BENASSY [2].


            We show below that the different notions of effective demands
are related by piecewise linear mappings.


            Consider two sets of linear demand and supply functions
         S1 ,    D2     ,
                            S2 and Dt ,                    S   ,
                                                                       Dt   ,
                                                                                 S   inducing   two

sets of structural forms. They define the same model if and only if


                                            =
                     mm (Die ,    S1)               mm
                                                           (D Sj)  ,




                     mm (D2 , S2)           =       mm
                                                           (D ,        S)
     and                > S1                 >S
                     D2 > S2                 >S
            These conditions joined to the linearity assumption                           imply

surprising since the Clower effective demand is discontinuous while
the Ito—Quandt's one is not.

Benassy model (see FORTES [10]). tn that case we have

3   -    TYPE 3 MOVELS         PIECECUISE AFFIWE MAPPINGS
         OW   CONES VEFINEV BY ENVOGENOUS VARIABLES.




               A natural generalization of the problem considered in section
2 is the case in which the endogenous variables are transformed by
affine mappings. Using the same notations as before, each affine map-
ping is defined on C1 by


                    B1 (x) = A1 (x) + b1               x E



        where A1 is an invertible linear mapping from iR into


and b1E
               This kind of model appears when there are, at the same time,
truncated variables (tobit or disequilibrium models) and dunmiy varia-
bles (probit models).


               SCHMIDT [13 ]    studied   the "pure" simultaneous probit model,
i.e. the case in which the endogenous variables are either untruncated
or binary ; mathematically this means that all the A1 matrices are

identical. The necessary and sufficient condition for coherency found
by Schmidt is essentially the recursivity •of the model solved in terms
of the untruncated variables.


               In the following theorem we propose a sufficient condition
for the general case.

                We have seen in theorems 1, 2, and 3 that the condition on
 determinants is an invertibility condition if we have                     p   n indepen-
dent linear forms defining 21'                  cones. In appendix 4 we give a counter—
example showing that this result breaks down if there are                      p > a

     is continuous, f is invertible if and only if the determinants,
det A., have the same sign.




     Example 4.1.


             Let us consider a single market disequilibrium model where
the systematic part of the supply function has two possible forms,

CO1'JCLLIVING REMARKS




           The approach of non linear modelling by piecewise linear
models with endogenously switching regimes, which seems to be powerful
and flexible, probably deserves specific developments.


           In this paper we solved the first problem raised by this
approach, namely the coherency problem. The next problem which requires
a systematic study is the identifiability question. The maximum likeli-
hood techniques of estimation and testing are then readily implementable,
however the non differentiability of these models necessitates a
careful study of their asymptotic properties.

APPENDIX               1    : PROOF OF THEOREM 1



                           Our results are derived from a theorem proved by Samelson and
alli [121 which gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a linear
space to be partitioned in cones.

          A necessary and sufficient condition for the cones      C1 to
form a partition of E is that the matrix F     of   the vectors
              — 'n    in the basis ( ,   ... , ) have        all its

principal minors positive.

             We    denote by             ,   i       {i , 2    ,         , n}   ,   the matrix obtai-

        Second step


                  Before considering the proof of theorem 1, it is convenient
to first solve the following special case.


                  Let us denote by e1 ,               •.. , e}          an orthonormal basis of

         For every subset I included in 1 , 2                             ,   •.. , n}   ,   let   C1 be

the orthant of                   defined as


                                     n
     C
         I
              =     {x/x=        .
                                 1=1
                                     Z x.e.

                                                         and       x.<0
                                                                    1

     There are                 such orthants. Let us associate with each orthant

              Proof


                   Let us define         : .1 = A{1,..    .,n}
                                                                  (e.)

                  From the continuity of f ,             we derive that the system

(a1 ,          ... , a)    is a basis for any I



              f is invertible If and only if the closure of the cones

denoted by A1 (C1) ,                is   the positive cone generated by (a1 ,...                      , a)

                  From lemma 1, a necessary and sufficient condition for f to
be       invertible is that the          matrix   r of the system (—

Since          V i : A0 A{} =                      —

        Third step


               Consider now the general context of section 1, where the cones
C1 are defined by n independent linear forms a1 ,                                            ... , an

        and    f= EA1Ic

        By choosing an appropriate basis, we can assume that a1 x =                                           x.

         If   P is the matrix of this change of basis, we know from
lemma 2 that a necessary and sufficient condition for the invertibi—

         This condition is equivalent to " det A1 of the same sign

        First   step


             Let us first consider the case in which there are p = n
independent linear forms. By choosing an appropriate basis we can assume
that these linear forms a. ,                     I   = I   ,       ... , n   are such that

a. x =
                   .th   coordinate of x )                          this choice implies that the
                                                               ;

      cones C1 are the               orthants     associated with the canonical basis

             The function f = E                                is discontinuous. Let us consider

                                            I          I

        The second assumption of theorem 2 implies that f* is continuous.


            Moreover the images of the cones C1 by f and f* are the same                                         -


for   any I ,     therefore           f is invertible if and only if f* is inverti-
ble. Applying theorem I to f* ,                       the coherency condition is              det 4   of   the

same sign for any I "                   Since
                                                     4     is      obtained from A1 by multiply-

ing each column by a positive number, det 4                                  and   det A1 have the

same sign and the coherency condition is also "                               det A1 of the same
sign for any I

             Second step



                    Let us consider the general case p                          n .   Each of the 2
 cones C1 , I C Ci                  ,       ... , p}       is an union of orthants

 j C Ci , ... , n}              .       On all the orthants                   corresponding to the same

 C1 ,         the   restrictions                  of f are the same and are equal to that
of A1 .             f   can be written

            From the first step the coherency condition is " det                                of the

                                                               . Since   the determinant of       is

equal to the determinant of the associated                                 A1 the coherency condition
is also " det A1 of the same sign "

APPENVIX 3       PROOF OF THEOREM 4.



             By choosing appropriate bases on the domain space and on the
rangespace we can have: a =                     (1, 0,..., 0) and A. (x xE W, x1                        =   O}
=   {y   y E                    =   O}                       for   i = I,..., q
                      y1

             From now, we denote {x1 =                      O}   =    x        xe ,    x1
                                                                                             =    0}

             The latter condition can be rewritten:
                                                     0                          0

                                                     x
                                                     y
which implies that the first row of the A1ts is of the form:
                     (ct, 0,..., 0)


         Moreover the continuity of f implies that the A.'s are identical
on 1x1 =      0);    therefore the A.'s have the following structure:



                     A. =

where the (n — 1) x (n                   I) matrix M is the same for all the A's,


             Let d. be the number such that :.

             (For   i =   I   or i =   q,   we have similar results; for instance
                    if cx > 0 B1(C1) =                            k1} =
                                                       B1   fx1                     d1}
                              < 0 B1(C1) =                        k1} =
                                                       B1 (x1              {y1 > d1}

          We are now able to show that f is invertible if and only if the
ci's have the same sign. The condition is necessary because if ci. and
         have different signs, say ci.             >    0 and         < 0, we see that:


                    B(C.) '      B1     (C.1)               {d_,<yid1} fl (d.1y1<d.}=


therefore, f is not invertible.


          The condition is sufficient because, if the ci.'s have the same
sign, say ci. > 0 Vi, the bands


                    B(C.) = {d1_1 <           y1
                                                        d.}       (with i =   1,...,   q + I and
                                                                  d =
                                                                  0     —,dq+I =+)
define   a partition in iR
                                ii




          To complete the proof we have only to note that the ci1's have
the same sign if and only if the determinants of the A.'s have the same
sign, since det A. =          ci.1.det M

cones are    defined by more than n linear forms (even in the continuous
case).

          All the determinants are positive, f is obviously Continuous,
however f is not invertible since f(x) = f(—x) V x E JR2
