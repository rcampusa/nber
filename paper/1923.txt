                            Poverty Among the Elderly:
                      Where are the Holes -in the Safety Net?



                                     ABSTRACT

      Using data from the longitudinal retirement history survey (RHS), we

 examine the economic status of the cohort of the elderly who were 68 - 73 years

 old by 1979 to see who fell through the safety net in the l970s. Our most

 important finding is that a non-trivial fraction of the elderly in the

 age/vintage group we study either remained poor, became poor, or had very low

 replacement rates in terms of their total income. This occurred despite the

 enormous general improvement of the economic status of the elderly, part of

which was made possible by very large increases in real Social Security benefits.

      Examination of the characteristics of those who fell through the safety

net reveal that females, especially widows, were the most likely candidates for

economic difficulty in this cohort in this stage of their life.

     We also note a sharp difference in realizations of retirement income

expectations among those who were poor and/or had low replacement rates

relative to those who were well off and/or had high replacement rates. Both

groups received substantially more Social Security benefits than expected,

whereas those with (ex post) low replacement rates received less in pensions

and continued earnings than they had expected while those with high replacement

rates received more than expected.

1.   Introduction

     A substantial body of research, combined with aggregate and average

official government statistics, documents the absolute and relative real income

gains made by the elderly population of the United States in the last fifteen

years. The large increase in real Social Security benefits in the early l970s,

and their subsequent indexing, were a major source of this improved economic

position of the elderly.   It also coincided with a substantial acceleration of

early retirement, a lengthening of life expectancies, and other factors

affecting the welfare of the elderly.

     Among the most important factors which have been documented concerning the

economic status of the elderly over this period are the following:

     1.   A sharp reduction in the incidence of poverty among the elderly,

which even continued in the 1981-2 recession;

     2.   The substantial increase in absolute and relative real income of the

non-poor elderly;

     3.   The (historically) approximate neutrality of inflation on the cost-

of-living of the elderly relative to the rest of the population; and also the

likely lower inflation vulnerability of the elderly, given their typical asset

ownership (especially housing and Social Security);

     4.   The substantial increase in economic resources, given various

conceptual adjustments, of the elderly during their retirement years relative

to their own career average earnings.1

     Various other factors could be mentioned, and we do not mean to imply that

more research on the factors mentioned above is unnecessary; certainly, we are

in need of improved understanding of these phenomena. However, it is our

tentative conclusion that subsequent research is unlikely to alter the

qualitative results of this set of findings.




                                        2
    The previous research mentioned above refers primarily to the typical, or

average, situation of elderly retirees, and in particular, to the younger

cohorts of elderly retirees, since those are the groups for which data are most

readily available. A correlative, and important, question is given this re-

markable social achievement of lifting the bulk of the elderly out of poverty,

and substantially increasing the real incomes of many of them, what fraction

were not so fortunate? How many stayed poor? Who were they? Who was so

unfortunate as to suffer substantial declines in their incomes relative to

career average earnings? Who had particularly low or particularly high

replacement rates?

     The purpose of this paper is to begin to answer such questions. Again, we

focus on a particular data set and a particular cohort of the elderly, and even

within this data set, described below, we must winnow our sample down for

various reasons. Our analysis, however, is nonetheless revealing. A non-

trivial fraction of the elderly were left behind, and various characteristics

of this group can be ascertained. Also, a modest fraction of elderly retirees

although well-off prior to retirement suffered substantial real income declines

and could now be described as relatively poor. Again, our analysis suggests

that this phenomenon is not randomly distributed across the elderly population,

but heavily concentrated in particular groups, i.e., widows.

     Thus, our goal is both to supplement previous studies of the average or

typical real incomes or replacement rates of the elderly during retirement and

to highlight the heterogeneity in the change in the economic well-being of the

elderly. Toward this end, the next section describes our data and methodology.

We basically attempt to examine three sets of phenomena using the Longitudinal

Retirement History Survey. We attempt to examine who among the elderly were

poor in the late l970s; who among the elderly were well-off prior to

retirement but suffered substantial declines in real incomes post-retirement;



                                      3
 and who among the elderly had quite low or high (unadjusted) replacement rates.

 In our previous research, we concluded that various important adjustments

 should be made to the typical way replacement rates are calculated to gain a

more accurate scalar measure of the economic well-being of typical, or average,

elderly individuals and families, relative to their own earlier working lives.

We adjusted replacement rates for such things as taxes, career average versus

high three years of earnings, risk, childrearing costs, etc. In this paper, as

described in more detail below, we take a somewhat more conventional view and

just examine income during retirement unadjusted for taxes, risk, childrearing

and other expenses. We do this both for comparability with other studies and

to separate the two issues of a preferable way to approximate the well-being of

typical elderly retirees and families from the detailed study of the poor

elderly.

     Section 3 presents two types of information on each of the three questions

posed above. The first type of information consists of cross-tabulations of

post-retirement income by pre-retirement earnings by various characteristics.

We examine, in this way, the fractions of the elderly who are poor, suffer

substantial income declines, and had high and low replacement rates, as well as

characteristics of these groups relative to the general elderly group under

study. The second presents a probit analysis of some characteristics

potentially correlated with each of these outcomes and discusses the analysis.

This is just a richer way of examining the data; we do not present a

structural interpretation of factors associated with, for example, poverty in

old age, just a probablistic analysis of factors associated with it.

     Section 4 concludes the paper with a summary of the results, some of the

potential implications of the analysis, and some avenues for further research.




                                      4
2.   Data

     All of the empirical results of the next section are based on the

Retirement History Survey conducted from 1969-79 by the Social Security

Administration. The survey initially included 11,153 households whose heads

were born between 1905 and 1911. There was substantial attrition (due to

placement in nursing homes or loss of contact as well as by death) for each

successive biennial survey, so that only 7,352 original respondents or their

widows remained to answer the last survey in 1979.

     Respondents were surveyed in odd-numbered years concerning current family

composition, labor force participation, health, activities, and assets and

wealth and concerning the previous (even-numbered) years' income and benefits.

Replacement rates are calculated here for the years prior to the survey years.

The Social Security Administration prepared a matched data set of its records

of the survey respondents' and spouses' covered earnings through 1974. It is

this information which was used to determine the earnings histories which

formed the denominator in the calculation of replacement rates.

     Social Security Administration records consider only the earnings for each

year in each job which totalled less than the year's maximum taxable earnings.

In cases where reported covered earnings equalled or exceeded the taxable

maximum, the following imputation procedures were used:

     The few cases of covered earnings above the taxable maximum were taken as

given. In these instances the person paid taxes in two or more jobs. We

assumed that earnings in neither job exceeded the taxable maximum.

     In cases where covered earnings equalled the taxable maximum, we assumed

that the taxable maximum was attained in the middle of the last quarter in which

taxes were paid. If, for example, the respondents finished paying social security

taxes in the third quarter, we imputed his year's wage income to be 8/5 times

the taxable maximum. This method should prove relatively unbiased, if inexact.



                                      5
     A household was excluded from our tabulations if at least one of the

following conditions holds (number excluded in parentheses):

      (1) Household reports federal or military pension income in 1971, 1973,

1975, 1977 or 1979.    (N — 239)

     (2) Respondent never reports self retired or partly retired, or the

respondent's spouse is always reported either working or looking for a job, but
not at work. (N — 825)

     (3) The household shows no earnings subject to Social Security taxes

between 1958 and 1974. (N — 553)

     (4) Household dies or is lost from the survey before 1977. (N — 664)

For the regressions of the next section, we also eliminated those households

who had 1977 income, 1969 financial or non-financial wealth or expected total

income after retirement of less than $100. This left us with a sample of 5,644

households for 1977.

     The paper reports total income replacement rates relative to career

average indexed earnings. Total income was constructed by summing the

households' income from wages, interest and dividends, rent, annuities,

pensions, relatives, disability benefits, state welfare benefits, workers'

compensation, AFDC, unemployment insurance, SSI and social security (old age,

disability, survivor's and black lung benefits). Career average indexed

earnings averages earnings over the period 1951 to the earlier of retirement or

1974. The indexing is done with the Personal Consumption Expenditure deflator.

     Before turning to the empirical results, it is worth mentioning that the

data are not for the elderly in general, but for a particular cohort of people

who were 67-72 years old in 1977. These households are not representative of

the entire elderly population for many reasons. First, none of them are

extremely old. Second, almost all of them benefitted from the sharp increase




                                      6
in the level of real Social Security benefits which occured in the 1960s and

early 1970s. Third, they enjoyed the rapidly rising real wages of the 1950s

and 60s. The main point is simply that we are looking at a fairly narrow age

cohort for a moment in time (1977 for the most part in this paper). The

experiences of this group should be generalized only with extreme caution.


3.   Analysis of Who Has Low Incomes and/or Replacement Rates Among the RHS Sample

     Table 1A gives a cross tabulation of 1976 post-retirement income on career

average pre-retirement earnings for all retired households in the 1977 survey

which met our selection criteria and which did not have missing information for

any of the income categories. It also shows the median replacement rate for

each cell, where this replacement rate is total retirement income relative to

price-indexed "career average" pre-retirement earnings.2 The figures are not

adjusted for family size, taxes, and risk as we did in our previous paper. If

those adjustments were made, and we feel that there is a good case for them,

the replacement rates would be significantly higher.

     Of particular concern to us are the 674 households (or 16 percent of the

sample) whose post retirement income was below $3,000 in 1976. Of those

households, 547 had career average household earnings of less than $5,000,

indicating that their relative poverty was a lifetime phenomenon. It is quite

rare that those with above average earnings (say, those with career average

earnings in excess of $20,000) end up with less than $3,000 in retirement. For

the entire sample this happened in only 33 instances, although the frequency of

occurence was about 4 percent for those whose earnings did, indeed, exceed

$20,000.

     A small minority of households end up with more real income in retire—

ment than their career average earnings. While this is not precisely illus-

trated in Table 1A, that table does show that 8 percent of those with pre-

retirement career average indexed earnings under $10,000, have post retirement

incomes above $10,000. The corresponding figure for crossing the $20,000

threshold is 2 percent (i.e., 2 percent of those whose career average indexed

earnings were below $20,000 have retirement income in excess of $20,000).

     Tables lB and 1C contain the same information separately for married

couples and widows. The most obvious result is that widows are far more likely

to suffer a sharp fall in retirement income relative to the household's pre-

retirement earnings, Of those widows whose households' career average earnings

were between $10,000 and $20,000, fully 59 percent of them have retirement

incomes under $5,000. Thirty-nine percent of those with career average

earnings between $5,000 and $10,000 wind up with retirement income under

$3,000. This collapse into relative poverty for widows partly reflects

inadequate insurance and lack of joint survivor pension annuities.

     Table 2 contains some detailed characteristics of households with low and

high unadjusted career average replacement rates. A comparison of the first

two columns of the first page of the table contrasts the average figures for

those with replacement rates greater than 200 percent with those whose

replacement rates are under 67 percent. For those with total income

replacement rates of greater than 200 percent, 1976 Social Security income

amounted to 27 percent of 1976 income and 55 percent of career average

earnings. For those with low replacement rates, Social Security in 1976

amounted to 67 percent of 1976 income and 15 percent of career average

earnings. In absolute dollars, those with low replacement rates on average

received more from Social Security than those with high replacement rates.

     One aspect of Table 2 which we find interesting is that the low and high

replacement rate households expected in 1973 to have roughly the same post-

retirement income. However, the high replacement rate group actually received

77 percent greater income in 1976. Social Security, pensions, and earnings

were all well above expectations for the high replacement rate group, whereas

pensions and earnings were below expectations for the low replacement rate

households. Fully 29 percent of the low replacement rate group are widows

whose husbands died since 1969.

     Table 3 contains the same detailed figures for those whose retirement

income is low in absolute terms. As already mentioned, more than half of these

households are widows. Social Security and a small amount of earnings amounts

to 78 percent of their income. Pension income is very low and below

expectations. Earnings are also below expectations. Note that these groups

with very low income are 55 and 61 percent widows, respectively. As was

apparent in Table lA, most of these people had low career average earnings.

     Table 4 contains some summary information regarding those excluded from

our selection criteria. Several observations can be made. First, those with

military or federal pensions are very well off, with very high pensions

relative to other people. They also had more than $30,000 in financial wealth

in 1977, more than any other group. Those who had not retired by 1977 also

have above average incomes, and substantial amounts of financial wealth.

     Table 5 illustrates the distribution of replacement rates for six

different pre-retirement earnings classes. Table 5 shows that only 20 percent

of the $7,500 - $12,500 category had a replacement rate of below 60 percent

(when only Social Security and pension income are included).3 Thus, we

conclude that less than 30 percent of these households are forced to make

significant downward adjustments in their consumption potential. The

percentages of households with low replacement rates are slightly higher for

the higher earnings categories, but it should be mentioned that other sources

of income certainly reduce the number of households who face these downward

resource adjustments.

*For example:    Married couples who received between $20,000 and
$30,000 in career average earnings had a median replacement rate
of 63%.    Ten percent of these couples had replacement rates of
92% or higher.




                                    20
     We can summarize some of the tabular results thus far. First, despite the

high average or median replacement rates, a significant fraction of elderly

households end up with very low incomes and/or with sharply lower resources

than they had during their working careers. There is a wide distribution of

replacement rates. A nontrivial percentage of households actually have higher

real income in retirement than their career average earnings history. The

group most likely to have a low income or have suffered a large income decline

is widows. The sharply higher incidence of poverty and income loss by widows

suggests that public policy may have failed in this particular area.

     Our tabular results also show that based on expectations reported in 1973,

both those with high and low actual 1976 replacement lates received more

Social Security income than anticipated. This clearly indicates that the

increase in Social Security which occurred between those years conveyed a

windfall gain on this population. Likewise, those with high replacement rates,

most of whom had a history of low earnings levels, received more in pensions

than expected and more in labor market earnings in 1976. On the other hand,

those with low replacement rates, received less in pensions and earnings than

they had expected.

Probit Analysis of Low Incomes and Low Replacement Rates

     Beyond the simple cross-tabulation of post-retirement incomes and pre-

retirement career average earnings, and an examination of the average charac-

teristics of poor and low replacement rate families with the general elderly

population, it is worthwhile to attempt to examine the factors most closely

associated with low incomes and low replacement rates. Our analysis of these

phenomena are presented below in Tables 6 and 7. These report, respectively,

probit analyses of the probability of moving from relatively high pre-retire—

ment career average earnings to low post-retirement income, and the probability

of being very poor and of low replacement rates. The analyses are performed on

a relevant subset of the data described in Section 2 above. For example, the

analyses of movement from well-off to poor is done on the subset of individuals

who had pre-retirement career average earnings above $20,000.00 (indexed). The

probabilities of low incomes and low replacement rates are based on the more

complete samples described above. Each of the analyses in the tables provide

some preliminary insights into the characteristics associated with higher

probabilities of the economic circumstances described.

     Table 6 presents two probit analyses of the probability of moving from

high to low incomes. Our approach, in these as well as subsequent regressions,

is to attempt to isolate and measure various potential characteristics likely

to be associated with the events under analyses. Thus, in the first column of

Table 6 we note that the factors having the greatest potential impact on the

likelihood of moving from a pre-retirement career average earnings of a house

hold exceeding $20,000.00 to a post-retirement income under $5,000.00 are that

the respondent was newly widowed, separated or divorced in the sample period;

and working in the opposite direction, was expected retirement income. Those

who retired later (or in later surveys) were less likely to suffer a sharp drop

in economic resources.

     Factors such as age within the six years of age cohorts we examine and the

log of financial wealth in 1969, have coefficients suggesting modest negative

impacts on this probability.

     The second column includes a larger number of potential variables which

have been discussed in the literature, such as race, health, location, educa-

tion, etc. Again, the most important in terms of the size of the coefficient

and statistical significance appear to be newly widowed, separated or divorced

and low expected income. The coefficient for widows as of 1969 is large and

significant. Age is significant, suggesting that as we look at older people in

this cohort, they are slightly less likely to move from rich to poor; those

retiring later are also somewhat less likely to see their incomes collapse; and

the log of financial wealth shows up as marginally significant in decreasing

the probability of income collapse as it increases for those with incomes above

$20,000.00. The other variables, again, tend to have small coefficients and

are not statistically significant. The original set of variables have

coefficients which are quite similar in the regression with the expanded list

of variables.

     Je should not be surprised that we are unable to identify precisely the

impact on substantial reductions in income from the large number of potential

candidates in our winnowed sample. Among other things, there are undoubtedly a

variety of case-specific considerations which cause such events which cannot be

captured in most of the types of variables we have here. The newly widowed,

separated or divorced variable, however, is one and obviously has an immense

impact on the probability of income collapse.

     Table 7 presents analogous probit analyses for the probability of post-

retirement income roughly below the poverty line. The first column reveals

that females and those who are newly widowed, separated or divorced, are much

more likely to be very poor than the general population. Those who retire



                                     27
 later, have greater pre-retirement earnings (hardly a surprise) expected re-

tirement income, or own   a   home have substantially lower probabilities of being

very poor. The coefficients of other variables measuring household size,

location, poor health, widowed in 1969, and the log of financial wealth, have

very small coefficients and are not statistically significant. The second

column, again, excludes some of these variables and adds race and age. Once

again, females and newly widowed have substantially higher probabilities of

very low incomes in their retirement years than do the general population. The

coefficient on the dummy variable for blacks is also substantial, and at the

margin of statistical significance. Once again, those retiring later, with

substantially greater career average earnings, or with greater expected retire-

ment income, are much less likely to be poor in old age. We included in this

regression a dummy variable taking the value 1 if the household owns its home.

Home ownership is a substantial fraction of non-financial wealth. The proba-

bility of low incomes decreases substantially for the group that owns its home.

Taken as a whole, this way of arranging the data suggests that despite the

enormous reduction of the incidence of poverty among the elderly by 1977, which

has continued since that time, some glaring problems remain:     particularly

those associated with elderly females, especially those newly widowed, separ-

ated or divorced. Perhaps this reflects the characteristics of pensions dis-

cussed above. One curiosity is that the widow's benefit was raised to 100

percent, and should be replacing a very high fraction of the first few thousand

dollars of earnings. Apparently, for many elderly widows, there is virtually

no other income source, and for some elderly widows, Social Security has not

filled the poverty gap.

     The last two columns of Table 7 provide an analysis of the group in the

population which has a 1976 post-retirement replacement rate less than 50

percent. Recall that this is the unadjusted replacement rate, i.e., the ratio



                                        28
of 1976 post-retirement income to pre-retirement price-indexed career average

earnings. The price-indexing and the career averaging are the only adjustments

made to the traditional replacement rate figures (although we do look at total

income, not just Social Security). We do not make any of the adjustments we

made in our previous paper for factors such as risk, taxes, cost of children,

etc. We have a large list of potential characteristics similar to those above,

but not surprisingly, some of them merely reflect the progressive nature of the

benefit formula. Recall, the benefit formula replaces a much higher fraction

of the first few thousand dollars of earnings than of subsequent earnings, and

therefore, one can be poor and have a replacement rate substantially in excess

of 50 percent. Thus, in examining those with low replacement rates, we are

much more likely to be discussing those further up the income scale. Once

again, widows, whether newly widowed or widowed at the start of the survey

period (1969), are much more likely to have low replacement rates. Also appar-

ent, though hardly surprising in view of the progressive nature of the benefit

formula, is the substantial positive impact of higher career average earnings

on the probability of low replacement rates. Quite simply, those with substan-

tial career average earnings are much more likely to have lower replacement

rates due to the progressive nature of the benefit formula. The factors which

appear to have a negative effect on the probability of low replacement rates

are, most importantly, the retirement vintage, financial wealth, and expected

retirement income. That those who retired later are less likely to have low

replacement rates reflect both, at least in part, the double indexing of Social

Security for several years prior to the retirement date involved and the

"Gordon" effect, replacing low wage years with high wage years in the benefit

computation. Most of the other variables have coefficients which are quite

small, and not statistically significant. Of marginal economic significance,

but statistical significance, are those relecting location in an SMSA and years



                                    29
of education; the more highly educated and less rural population is less

likely to have low replacement rates.

     Taken as a whole, the results reported in Tables 5, 6, and 7 suggest,

historically, some substantial gaps in the safety net for the elderly. An

enormous social achievement occurred in the reduction of the incidence of

poverty among the elderly, although the cost in terms of society's transferring

resources to the elderly was substantial and the target effectiveness of these

transfers is open to question. Various types of conclusions can be drawn.

Perhaps the most important is that females, especially widows, were much more

likely to be left behind than males, or intact couples. Finally, we are not at

this point able to provide a structural interpretation to these events. Was it

due to problems in the annuitization and survivorship rights in pensions? To

case-specific events which we cannot identify? If the primary purpose of a

social insurance program is to prevent destitution among the elderly, and to

provide a floor to replacement rates, we will need to generate better data and

methods to answer these questions in order to design more cost-conscious and

target effective public income support systems for the elderly.


4.   Conclusion

     We have attempted to complement previous research on the general economic

status of the elderly with an examination of who fell through the safety net in

the l970s. The analysis must be regarded as preliminary in some respects, and

as suggestive in others. Clearly, the most important finding is that a non-

trivial fraction of the elderly in the age/vintage group we study either re-

mained poor, became poor, or had very low replacement rates in terms of their

total income. This occurred despite the enormous general improvement of the

economic status of the elderly, part of which was made possible by very large

increases in real Social Security benefits.



                                     30
     Examination of the characteristics of those who fell through the safety

net reveal that females, especially widows, were the most likely candidates for

economic difficulty in this cohort in this stage of their life.

    A variety of other variables seem to impact the probability of low incomes

and/or low replacement rates. For example, those who retired relatively early

tended to be more likely to be poor and/or to have low replacement rates. This

partly reflects particular institutional features surrounding Social Security

and its double indexing for a brief period, but it also partly reflects factors

influencing retirement in the first place.

     A variety of other intriguing findings were mentioned, including the sharp

differences in realizations of retirement income expectations among those who

were poor and/or had low replacement rates relative to those who did well.

Perhaps much of this seems self-evident in retrospect, but it is important to

attempt to get behind these numbers to reasons why these events occurred.

Undoubtedly, many of them had case-specific causes. The results here are

suggestive of a need for further research on the structure and nature of the

survivorship and annuity features of pensions; the coverage and marital status

provisions of Social Security; as well as a more detailed study of the rela-

tionships between actual retirement income outcomes and expectations.

     In short, we hope that the work in this paper helps stimulate research on

those left behind in the general improvement of the economic status of the

elderly, and on the private and governmental income support systems designed to

assist these people.

1.   These facts are documented in numerous recent studies. While numerous

authors have commented on various factors related to the improved economic

status of the elderly, we refer the reader to the following as examples: M.

Boskin (1986); M. Boskin and J. Shoven (1984); M. Hurd and J. Shoven (1982);

M. Hurd and J. Shoven (1985); and M. Boskin and M. Hurd (1982). These papers

provide references to the research of others on the topic; the other research

comes to quite similar qualitative conclusions.


2. We use average indexed earnings from 1951-74 or 1951 to retirement; thus,

"career average" is really the average over roughly the two decades prior to

retirement.


3. In Boskin and Shoven (1986), we demonstrated that an unadjusted replacement

rate of around 70 percent translated into full replacement when tax, family

size and risk adjustments are included. Thus, an unadjusted replacement rate

of 60 percent would be marginally below full replacement.
