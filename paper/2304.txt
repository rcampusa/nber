           Productivity Levels and Productivity Change Under Unionism




                                    ABSTRACT




     This paper examines how unions affect the rate of productivity change over

time. The direction of union impact cannot be predicted from economic theory.

Firms may tend to select more productive technologies to offset the cost of

higher union wages or they may tend to select less productive technologies to

keep union wage demands in line. Evidence from manufacturing indicates that

unions have not affected productivity growth, but in the construction industry

productivity growth has been much slower in areas where there is a high initial

level of unionization or where unionization is growing.

     Roughly 10 years ago researchers started to produce quantitative estimates

of the impact of unionism across cross sections of firms or industries. The

results of this research, summarized in Freeman and Medoff (1984), show that in

most instances productivity is much higher at a given point in time under

unionism.

     These studies have not considered the question of how unions affect

productivity over time. The use of cross section data sets has largely

precluded the examination of this set of issues, with one notable exception.

Connerton, Freeman and Medoff (1983) use repeated cross sections and find that

productivity in union bituminous coal mines was 33 to 38 percent higher than in

nonunion mines in 1965, but 14 to 20 percent lower in 1975 and 1980. They

attribute the decline of the union coefficient to the deterioration of

labor-management relations during that time period, a perfectly legitimate

inference given the theoretical framework within which all of these studies

(including, of course, my own) has been embedded. The exit-voice model

emphasizes turnover, training, and labor-management interaction, but pays scant

attention to such dynamic factors as investment in R&D, lags in adopting new

techniques, and organizational change.

     This paper examines how unions affect the rate of productivity change over

time. Considering both price theoretic and institutional factors, the impact

of unionism on productivity change cannot be predicted ex ante. Just as in the

case of cross section union-nonunion differences in productivity levels, the

question of whether unions promote or retard productivity change is an

empirical issue. The evidence reported below indicates that unions have had no
                                                                                  2


impact on productivity change in manufacturing, whereas in construction

productivity growth has been much slower under unionism.



                      II. PRODUCTIVITY CHANGE UNDER UNIONISM



     In cross section analyses union-nonunion productivity differences can arise

through union effects on turnover, training, work rules, labor-management

communication, worker morale, and management behavior. Using a Cobb-Douglas

production function Qt=(+cUt)LtaKtb, the net impact of all of these sources

of productivity differences between union and nonunion observations in a cross

section can be determined by estimating the parameter c. Suppose now that two

cross section data sets are available. Then after taking log differences, the

parameter c can also be estimated with the equation



     dlog(Q/L) = c*dUt +   b*dlog(K/L)   +   (a+bl)*dlogL.                  (1)




In this specification, productivity changes are entirely a function of changes

in percentage unionized, the capital-labor ratio, and establishment size. If

the model has been correctly specified and if there is no measurement error in

the data set, one should get the same estimate of c from either the conven-

tional cross section equation or the log difference equation (1).

     The parameter c in (1) is assumed to be constant in each period. This

assumption is inappropriate whenever productivity shocks occur within either

the union or nonunion sector. For instance, if relations between labor and

management deteriorate, as was the case in the bituminous coal industry in the

period examined by Connerton, Freeman, and Medoff, one would expect c to
                                                                                   3

 decline. Also, c could change as a result of changes in the sources of

 union-nonunion productivity differences. For instance, if changes are made in

 union work rules to allow management greater flexibility in assigning workers

 to jobs, this would cause c to rise. If c is allowed to very over time, the

 product of the change in c and the initial level of percentage unionized must

be added to (1):



   d1og(Q/L) = ct*dUt +    b*dlog(K/L)      +   (abl)*dlogL   +   dc*Utl.    (2)




     The assumption of a constant value of c in (1) is also inappropriate when

there is a difference in the rate of technical change between the union and

nonunion sectors. Let d0 = annual rate of technical change under unionism and

d1 — annual rate of technical change in the nonunion sector. Then the

production function becomes Qt=(÷cUt)LtaKtbexp (doUt+di(l-Ut))t) and the

estimating equation is now

   dlog(Q/L) = c*dUt +    b*dlog(K/L)   +   (a+bl)*dlogL
                      +    (dodi)*Ut1    +d1t +    (dodl)t*dUt.             (3)

As one can see from comparing (2) and (3), changes in labor-management

relations (or other factors which may cause c to vary over time) and unequal

rates of technical change between the union and nonunion sectors are

econometrically equivalent in terms of their effects on productivity change.

In each case both the initial level of unionization and the change in

unionization appear on the right hand side of the equation.

    Unions are likely to influence productivity change through both price

theoretic and institutional mechanisms. Changes in the union-nonunion wage gap

lead to factor substitution decisions that will change labor productivity, but
                                                                                 4

have no effect on total factor productivity. The change in the capital-labor

ratio controls for this spurious source of productivity change in (3).

    Union wage behavior becomes a more critical factor when the technology

itself is endogenous. Tauman and Weiss (1984) show that under certain

assumptions unionized firms are more likely to choose the most productive

technology. They consider the case of a duoploy where one firm is unionized

and the other is nonunion. These firms participate in a two-stage

non-cooperative game with the union. In the first stage the firms choose their

technology while the union simultaneously chooses the wage. Output and

employment are determined in the second stage. Both firms initially have the

same technology, but each can purchase and install a more productive technology

at the same cost. Labor is assumed to be the only factor of production, so the

more productive technology must be labor-saving.

     The decision to adopt this technology hinges on product demand. At very low

demand levels, neither adopts, and at very high demand levels, both adopt. The

key difference between the union and the nonunion firm is that the union

charges its firm higher wages at high levels of output, while the nonunion

firm pays the same, competitive wage at all output levels. Thus the union firm

stands to gain more than the nonunion firm from adopting the more productive

technology at some output levels and it is possible to have a solution where

only the union firm uses that technology.

     This result is very sensitive to the assumption that the union selects its

wage at the same time that the firms select their technologies. If the union

can alter its wage after the technologies have been chosen, it has the ability

to appropriate the returns from the increase in productivity. Realizing this,

the union firm is less likely than the nonunion firm to adopt the best
                                                                                   5

 technology and it is impossible to have an equilibrium where only the union

 firm uses the most productive technology.

     Union firms may also want to keep some low productivity capacity in

operation as part of a strategy to keep union wage demands in line. Baldwin

 (1983) shows that when the capital replacement cycle is long relative to the

time horizon of the union, in the absence of enforceable longterm wage

contracts, it is optimal to invest in both efficient and inefficient capacity

rather than to invest only in the former. If firms invest only in the most

efficient capacity, they are subject to the risk of higher union wage demands

in the future, as pointed out by Tauman and Weiss. However, by investing in

both types of capacity, unions will be less likely to make such demands because

some of the less efficient capacity would no longer be profitable to operate

and employment would fall, lowering the union's utility. Although this

strategy results in lower productivity growth in unionized industries, it is

optimal from the standpoint of investors because it guarantees them some return

on new capital investments.

     Both the Tauman and Weiss and the Baldwin models are couched in terms of

certain returns to investment in more productive capacity. Nelson (1981) has

emphasized that two key aspects in the process of technical change --

investment   in R&D and the screening and spread of new technology - -   involve
considerable uncertainty. Unionized firms engaged in innovative activities

must deal with an additional source of uncertainty, namely the reaction of the

union. In addition to the question of how much of the returns to any sort of

innovative activity (product or process) will have to be shared with the union,

there is also the issue of the willingness of unions to agree to changes in the

production process. The expected returns to innovation may not only be lower
                                                                                  6

under unionism, but they may also be more unpredictable. If so, this would

result in an even slower rate of technical change under unionism.

     Now consider the institutional effects of unions on productivity growth. In

most cases unions do not attempt to prevent management from introducing new

techniques, mainly because the consequences of doing so are almost always

self-destructive. Two specific cases cited by Bok and Dunlop (1970) are the

attempts of the window-glass workers to stop the glass making machine in 1908

and the efforts of the cigar makers to halt specialization and new machinery.

The window-glass union had to be officially disbanded in 1928 while percentage

unionized in the cigar industry dropped from 45 to 20 percent. Instead of

obstructing new technology, Bok and Dunlop conclude (p.262) that "labor leaders

have normally chosen to accept new methods and share in the gains which these

innovations make possible." A key exception to this general rule, they note,

seems to be the case of "older members with a short, remaining working life and

with little interest in moving or learning new skills, [who] may even find

rational grounds for sacrificing their union in order to prolong their jobs

until retirement (p.262).t'

     Even if unions rarely attempt to block the introduction of new technology,

they can still make the introduction of new technology more costly. In almost

every case management must consult with the union before making any changes in

work assignments, skill requirements, number of positions, or plant and

equipment. Slichter, Healy and Livernash (1960) note that this will generally

raise questions regarding craft jurisdiction, seniority, wage adjustments, and

treatment of any displaced workers. Problems are most likely to arise when

management must deal with a number of craft unions simultaneously. Even though

management may at times receive highly valuable input from the union, on
                                                                                  7

 balance one would expect that the greater cost of introducing new technology

 under unionism should make the introduction of such technology less likely than

 in a nonunion setting.

      However, there are also many cases in which the unions themselves have

actively encouraged firms to make changes that workers believe will lead to

more job security and higher wages. Slichter, Healy, and Livernash note that

such a policy "usually is followed when the union is worried about the ability

of an industry or a plant to hold its own in competition (p.355)." For

instance they point out that the engineering departments of the needle trades

have at times suggested technological changes to employers and assisted the

employer in implementing them, performing a role similar to that of the

extension service in agriculture. Unions also have generated technical

improvements in plants with profit sharing or employee participation programs.

Currently, the growing emphasis on work organization and efficiency in

quality-of-work-life (QWL) programs is another example of unions acting to

promote productivity growth. To the extent that workers feel that they are

more likely to share in the benefits of QWL programs under unionism, those

programs may turn out to be more successful in a union than a nonunion

setting. Thus, the "voice" aspects of union behavior are far from irrelevant

in the analysis of productivity change.

     On balance the above discussion indicates that considering both price

theoretic and institutional aspects of union behavior and managerial response,

the impact of unions on productivity growth is an empirical question. I turn

now to a survey of existing evidence, all of which comes from the manufacturing

sector.
                                                                                 8

                     III. PREVIOUS EVIDENCE FROM MANUFACTURING



     Only two studies have focused on the effects of unionization on productivity

growth. Hirsch and Link (1984) found slower productivity growth in industries

where percentage unionized is high and in those where that percentage is

rising. Freeman and Medoff (1984) found no correlation between unionization

and productivity growth in three different samples. There is, however,

additional evidence on this question in a number of other studies where,

although the emphasis has been on estimating the impact of R&D on productivity

growth, percentage unionized has.been included as a control variable. The

samples in some of these studies are almost identical to that used by Hirsch

and Link and to one of the samples used by Freeman and Medoff. Thus

examination of their findings not only provides a wider base of evidence, but

also serves as an independent check on the robustness of the Hirsch and Link

and the Freeman and Medoff results.

     The results of all studies of productivity growth which include unionization

as a right-hand variable are summarized in Table 1. All of the studies are

limited to manufacturing and are grouped in Table 1 according to whether they

use data on industries (at various levels of aggregation) or firms. For each

study the table describes the sample, reports the measures of productivity and

unionization, lists the control variables, and summarizes the results for the

union variable(s).

     The studies summarized on the first four lines all use data sets consisting

of two-digit industries over various intervals. The first three of these

consistently find much slower average annual productivity growth in unionized

industries, with the estimates of the union-nonunion difference ranging between
                                                                                  9

 4 and 6 percentage points. Even at the lower bound, this implies that over an

 18 year period there will be twice as much productivity growth in a nonunion

 industry compared to a unionized industry, implying that unions anathematize

 economic progress.

      There are good reasons to question these findings. The results obtained by

 Kendrick and Grossman for the change in unionization variable imply that a 10

percentage point increase in unionization results in 1.8 percent faster

productivity growth. Although they attribute this finding to multicollinearity

of the change in unionization with other variables, it could just as easily be

explained in terms of "shock effects" in cases where unionization is
                                                                       growing
and in terms of increased turnover and lower labor quality in cases where

unionization is falling. Also, Terleckyj's (1980) findings indicate that the

estimated effect of the initial level of unionization is very sensitive to

which total factor productivity measure is used as the dependent variable. He

finds a significant negative union impact on productivity growth for only two

out of four measures.

     The biggest problem with these results lies in the nature of the data. At

the two-digit SIC level of aggregation it is impossible to determine whether

unions directly reduce productivity growth or whether unions are most likely to

be found in industries with limited opportunities for technical advancement.

Percentage unionized is highest in "smokestack" industries such as primary

metals, transportation equipment, and paper where the products and the

production process changed very little over the sample periods examined in

these studies. The only way to control for differences across industries in

opportunities for productivity growth is to construct a data set with some

predominantly union and some predominantly nonunion observations within each
                                                                                10

industrial category. This can be done by either using a finer level of

aggregation than the very crude two-digit level or breaking down the two-digit

industries by some other variable, such as location.

    The remaining industry studies cited in Table 1 follow one of these two

strategies. Terleckyj (1984) breaks a few two-digit industries down into their

major three-digit components and finds significantly lower productivity growth

under unionism in only one out of three specifications -- one where he includes

R&D embodied in purchased capital goods but excludes R&D spending. When the

latter R&D variable is included (with or without the embodied R&D measure), he

finds no link between unionism and productivity growth. In a sample of 138

three-digit industries, Sveikauskas and Sveikauskas (1982) find no correlation

between unionization and productivity growth in any of the seven equations they

report. Freeman and Medoff examine one sample of three-digit industries,

another sample of four-digit industries, and another consisting of two-digit

industries broken down by state or region. As noted earlier, in all three

cases they find slower productivity growth under unionism, but the relationship

is not statistically significant.

     The main conclusion that can be drawn from the industry studies surveyed

here is that there is little reason to believe that unions have acted as a

major obstacle to productivity growth in manufacturing. Although the sign of

the union coefficient is almost always negative, in the most careful studies

the estimated effect of unions is rather small and estimated with relatively

little precision.

     The results of three studies using data sets consisting of individual firms

or lines of business within a firm are reported on the last three lines of

Table 1. This type of data provides another way to obtain observations by
                                                                                 11
 union status within a particular industry, thus allowing independent variation

 in unionism and technological opportunities. This flexibility is obtained at

 the cost of limiting the sample to large, publicly traded firms and, in some

 cases, measuring unionization inaccurately. Two studies by Link find

 dramatically slower productivity growth in firms which seem to be predominantly

 unionized. Link's measure of unionization in both of these studies is

 percentage unionized in the three-digit industry in which the firm mainly

 operates. His samples are limited to a small number of industries, all of

which have average to above average levels of unionization. Clark and

Griliches find productivity grows at a one percent faster rate under unionism,

but the union coefficient is the same size as its standard error. Thus, the

studies using data on firms also fail to provide any conclusive evidence that

unions have any direct effect on productivity growth.

     One indirect mechanism not considered in any of the studies summarized in

Table 1 may be quite important. Connolly, Hirsch, and Hirschey (1986) report

evidence from a sample of 367 firms from the Fortune 500 that investment in R&D

adds less to the market value of firms in unionized industries and that firms

in those industries respond to this by investing in less R&D. This means that

holding R&D intensity constant in an OLS equation may not be the appropriate

method for estimating the total impact of unionization on productivity growth.

By failing to consider this indirect effect, the studies surveyed above may

very well be underestimating the total impact of unionization. Further work

with more broadly representative data sets is clearly needed to establish the

robustness of Connolly, Hirsch and Hirschey's findings with respect to union

effects on R&D and how this influences estimates of the union impact on

productivity growth.
                                                                                 12

                        IV. NEW EVIDENCE FOR MANUFACTURING



     Because of the absence of any firm   conclusions   on the links between unionism

and productivity growth in the studies surveyed above, this issue was

re-examined over a sample of 74 three and four digit industries for which

U.S. Department of Labor (1986) reports indexes of output per employee hour

between 1972 and 1983. Besides not being used in any previous study focusing

on unionization and productivity growth, this data set merits examination

because the output measures are based mainly on physical quantities, which

should make them extremely accurate, and because it covers a more recent time

period, one where union density has been declining rapidly.

     The percentage growth in the labor productivity index in each industry is

assumed to be a function of R&D intensity, four-firm concentration ratio, and

unionization. Scherer (1984) constructed two measures of 1974 R&D activity:

one indicating R&D originating in each industry and a second indicating

R&D used by each industry. The second measure was obtained by using an

input-output table to estimate how much of the R&D originating in a particular

industry was used in other sectors. Each measure of R&D spending was converted

into a measure of R&D intensity by dividing it by value added in 1974, as

reported in the Annual Survey of Manufactures. Both the initial level and the

change in the concentration and unionization variables were included as

right-hand side variables. The concentration ratios come from the Censuses of

Manufacturing for 1972 and 1982. The initial level of unionization is the

value reported by Freeman and Medoff for production workers from the pooled May

1973-75 CPS tapes; the final level was estimated by the author from the May
                                                                                13

1983 CPS pension supplement public use tape. The results are reported in Table

2.

     Productivity growth is strongly related to concentration and R&D in this

sample, but it is unrelated to unionization. Productivity tends to grow

slightly faster in industries with high initial levels of unionization and

markedly faster in industries where percentage union is declining most rapidly,

but neither coefficient is statistically significant in any specification. In

results not reported in Table 2, the equations were re-estimated with union

variables calculated across all occupations; the union coefficients were even

smaller. This new evidence re-enforces the main conclusion from the previous

studies surveyed in Section III --   there   is no direct connection between

unionization and productivity growth in manufacturing.

     One limitation of this analysis is that it holds R&D intensity constant,

whereas the models discussed in Section II imply that unions could reduce

R&D. Even when R&D intensity is dropped from the model in column 6 of Table 2,

there is no relationship between unionization and productivity growth. To test

the linkage between R&D and unionization directly, each R&D intensity measure

was regressed on unionization and the concentration ratio. The results,

reported in Table 3, show that unionized industries spend much less money on

R&D. The ratio of R&D originating to output is 12 percentage points less in an

industry where all production workers belong to unions than in an industry

where none do. The ratio of R&D used to output is 17 percentage points lower

in unionized than nonunion industries. Increased concentration is associated

with higher R&D spending in this sample.

     Both union coefficients are dramatically larger than the mean of the

dependent variable and, if taken literally, imply the mean ratio of R&D to
                                                                                14

output in unionized industries is negative. This suggests that the model is

overly simple. There are many important variables which remain to be

considered, along with different possible routes of causation. Nonetheless,

the results are very consistent with those of Connolly, Hirsch, and Hirschey

and point to the need for more careful analysis of the union-R&D-productivity

link in the future.



                      V. EVIDENCE FROM THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY



     Construction is widely thought of as an industry in which very little

technological progress has been made and where there are very limited

opportunities for future productivity growth. Goverrinient statistics

systematically overstate the growth of prices in the industry because they

assume prices grow at the same rate as a weighted average of wages and material

costs, disregarding the relationship between wages and productivity. This

understatement of productivity growth is partly responsible for the perception

that there has been little progress, along with the popular wisdom that the

jobs of painters, plumbers, electricians, and carpenters have not changed in at

least 30 years. Interestingly, productivity growth in construction was above

the nonmanufacturing average between 1948 and 1968. Allen (1985) shows that

much of the alleged decline in construction productivity since then is

attributable to biases in the data.

     Tatum (1984) cites two major sources of innovation in construction. One is

changes in the design of projects so that they can be built with less labor or

materials. The other is changes in the construction process itself. This can

include: "(1) development of new construction methods or sequences; (2)
                                                                                 15

application or extension of methods or techniques originally developed to meet

other requirements; (3) development and application of new equipment and tools;

and (4) scale-up or refinement of existing methods." (Tatum, pp. 311-2) For

instance, a case study of the highway construction industry by Koch and

Moavenzadeh (1979) shows that the main source of productivity growth in that

sector between the 1950s and the l970s was improvements in equipment. They

attribute this to competition among equipment manufacturers, changes in highway

design including some standardization of certain features, relatively stable

demand (because of the use of user fees to fund highway construction and

repair), and the increased price of labor relative to capital. Rosefielde and

Mills (1979) cite other sources of productivity growth in the construction

industry, including the widespread adoption of power tools and machinery,

introduction of larger lifting and moving machinery, changes in the use of

building materials which economize on labor time (such as drywall for plaster,

movable partitions for walls), and increased use of prefabricated components.

     Where do these innovations come from? It is quite clear that they do not

come from R&D done by firms in the construction industry itself. Scherer

estimates that these firms do only $28 million a year, a small amount compared

to the size of the industry. A study recently completed for the Building

Research Board of the National Research Council (1986) also found very little

government spending on R&D related to construction. One potentially important

factor is R&D embodied in capital goods and materials purchased by the

construction industry. Scherer estimates that R&D spending by companies in all

industries which is used by companies in construction amounts to $432.9

million.

     The predominance of craft as opposed to industrial unionism in construction

makes this industry an especially interesting case to consider for examining

how unions affect productivity growth. Unions are most likely to influence

productivity growth in construction through relative factor prices and work

rules. The small amount of R&D done by firms in the construction industry

makes it unlikely that this route of union influence is very important.

     Pooled data from the 1972, 1977, and 1982 Censuses of Construction

Industries are used here to estimate the effect of unions on productivity

growth in construction. There are separate observations in each year for three

two-digit industries and 27 states or regions identified in the May 1973-75

Current Population Survey (CPS). The 1972 data set is the same as that in

Allen (1984) and the 1977 and 1982 data sets are constructed in exactly the

same way. The May 1977-78 CPS is used to estimate percentage unionized and

labor quality for 1977; the May 1979-81 CPS, for 1982.

     The productivity variable used in Table 4 is the change in the log of total

factor productivity. Total factor productivity is the ratio of output to a

weighted average of capital and labor inputs. The weights in each year equal

the input shares in that year. To convert monetary to real values, variables

were deflated to 1972 dollars. The output measure used below is value added.

It was deflated by the deflator for construction industry GNP in the national

income accounts and by the Dodge Cost Index (where New York City =   100).   These

adjustments control for differences across states or regions in price levels in

1972 and the rates of price increase since 1972. The capital variable equals

the sum of (1) the service flow from owned capital and (2) expenditures on

rented machinery and structures. It was deflated with an index of durable

equipment prices, weighted by the share of each type of equipment in
                                                                                  17

 construction, as reported by Boddy and Gort (1971). The weights for education,

 age, occupation and region in the labor quality index are all based on wage

 equation coefficients for nonunion workers (with separate coefficients for men

 and women) from the 1977-78 CPS. This removed year-to-year variation in wage

equation coefficients as a source of labor quality variation.

      Estimates of equations (1) and (3) are reported in Table 4, along with an

extension of (3) where productivity growth is also allowed to be a function of

the initial levels of average establishment size and labor quality (denoted

 (3') in the table). The model was also estimated (1) under the assumption of

constant factor shares and (2) with labor productivity as the dependent

variable. These results were the same as those in Table 4 and are not

reported. The estimates of (1) show that productivity growth is slower in

state by industry cells where unionization is growing, but the coefficient is

smaller than its standard error.

     Two stronger conclusions emerge from the estimates of (3). First,

productivity growth is much slower in areas with high levels of unionization.

The Union-nonunion difference in productivity growth, in terms of annual rates

of change and assuming no productivity growth under unionism, is between 3.8

and 5.3 percent. Second, productivity growth is also much slower in areas

where the proportion of union workers is rising. The change in unionization

coefficient falls from. -.173 in the estimate of (1) to -.456 in (3). The

level of unionization and the change in unionization coefficients are both

economically and statistically significant, implying that the specification in

(3) is to be preferred to that in (1). To test whether the initial level of

unionization is acting as a proxy for initial levels of other variables which

might contribute to productivity growth, (3) was extended to include the
                                                                                 18

initial values of the labor quality index and average establishment size.

Inclusion of these two variables caused the coefficient of the initial level of

unionization to drop even further from - .375 to - .516.

     Do the results in Table 4 reflect a one-time shock to c as described in (2)

or do they indicate different trends in productivity growth as described in

(3)? One way to distinguish these two interpretations is to estimate the model

over shorter periods and see if the results are the same in each period. If

they are, this would indicate that the results should be interpreted in terms

of a trend rather than a single shock. The market share of union contractors

was falling between 1972 and 1982, but Allen (1986) shows that the rate of

decline was steepest after 1977. Also, 1982 was the last year of an extended

period of depressed output in construction. To test the robustness of the

results in terms of stability over different periods, separate models were

estimated for 1972-1977 and 1977-1982. The results, in the last six columns of

Table 4, show only one important difference between the two periods. Whereas

the initial level of unionization is inversely related to productivity growth

in both periods, the relationship between changes in unionization and

productivity growth holds up for 1977-1982 but not for 1972-1977. This

probably results from either the relatively modest drop in unionization in the

earlier period or greater variation in the change in unionization in the later

period.

     If the means of the dependent variables are taken seriously, these results

imply that productivity was falling in both the union and nonunion sectors over

this period. Most of this alleged productivity decline results from

overestimation of the rate of price increase in construction and the absence of

any controls for changes in the mix of construction, as discussed in Allen
                                                                                 19

 (1985). Once adjustments are made for these factors, the change in

 productivity over this period is negligible. If the rate of productivity

 growth for the industry is assumed to be zero, the estimates of the

 union-nonunion difference in productivity growth in Table 4 still imply that

 productivity was falling in union construction while rising in nonunion

 construction.

      There are no obvious sources of declining productivity in union construction

over this period. Strike activity has fallen since 1975, indicating no

deterioration in labor-management relations akin to that in the coal industry.

There was no change in this period in the share of workers covered by

agreements limiting or prohibiting subcontracting, limiting or regulating crew

size, and restricting work by those outside the bargaining unit. Thus, the

possibility that productivity in union construction stayed constant, rather

than declining, should not be ruled out. The results in Table 4 would then

imply very rapid productivity growth in nonunion construction.

     Regardless of whether productivity in union construction was constant or

falling during this period, there is still the question of why the produc-

tivity gap between union and nonunion construction narrowed. Most construc-

tion-related R&D is done in industries which supply materials and equipment to

construction firms. The growth in capital input or the change in the

capital-labor ratio is the best available signal of this form of innovative

activity in the CCI data. Although included as a control variable in Table 4,

one could reasonably argue that to estimate the true impact of unionism,

capital must be viewed as an endogenous variable in a system of equations.

     To test this, both the change in capital input and the change in the

capital-labor ratio were regressed on the exogenous variables in equation (3')
                                                                                20

over the same sample used in Table 4. The strongest correlate of the change

in capital and the change in the capital-labor ratio across region-industry

cells was the change in labor quality, which had a negative coefficient. The

change in unionization and the initial level of unionization coefficients were

smaller than their standard errors in both equations. Thus, the change in

capital in the CCI data not seem to be directly linked with the unionization

patterns in the CPS data.

    A question which cannot be addressed with these data is how to interpret

the results in light of the growing share of union workers who seem to be

working for nonunion contractors and the growing share of union contractors

which have opened nonunion subsidiaries. For instance, the data on capital

input indicate that union contractors have invested just as much as nonunion

contractors. This finding can be misleading if the union contractors put most

of their new capital into their nonunion "double-breasted" subsidiaries.

    A number of labor-market related causes of the decline in the union-nonunion

productivity difference are discussed in some detail in Allen (1986). The

rising share of union members working in the open shop seems to have eroded the

training advantage which union contractors once possessed over their nonunion

competition. It is also likely that the high unemployment rates observed

during much of this period significantly eroded the search economies offered by

union hiring halls.

                                 VI. CONCLUSION



     This paper has examined the ways in which unions can affect productivity

growth and presented evidence from manufacturing and construction. While cross

section studies which estimate union-nonunion differences in productivity
                                                                                 21

levels frequently find productivity to be higher under unionism, the results

reported here show that unionism has little effect on productivity growth in

construction. The main reason for the difference in the results between

manufacturing and construction probably lies in the dominance of the craft form

of unionization in construction. As noted by Slichter, Healy, and Livernash,

the introduction of changes in the work place is much more costly under this

form of unionism and this makes innovation less likely to occur.

     There is evidence that the building trades unions are aware of this problem

and have begun to do something about it. In a number of areas contractors and

unions have formed cooperative associations to generate productivity

improvements. In St. Louis PRIDE (Productivity and Responsibility Increase

Development and Employment) was launched in 1972. This group, which also

includes owners, engineers, architects, and equipment and materials suppliers,

has been so successful that employment of union craftsmen has actually

increased by 35 percent and the open shop has made little headway in that

area. In 1982 the AFL-CIO Building Trades Department and the National

Construction Employers Council launched a "Market Recovery Program for Union

Construction" which aims to emulate this approach nationwide. The results of

these efforts will determine whether the effect of unions on productivity

change can vary over time in a particular industry, an issue beyond the scope

of this paper but which should be examined in future work.
