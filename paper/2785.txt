                  CREDIBILITY, DEBT AND UNEMPLOYMENT:
                     IRELAND S FAILED STABILIZATION


                                ABSTRACT



               Can the credibility of a stabilization plan affect the
output costs of diainflation? The new classical economics has asserted
this possibility, but little evidence has been brought forward. This paper
analyzes the stabilization program of Ireland in the l980s against the
background of the new classical economics, The main questions are two: Did
EMS membership yield a special credibility bonus? And is the
stabilization program sustainable. The answer to both questions is
negative.
               The idea of a credibility bonus Is an attractiye potential
policy implication of EMS membership: by joining the EMS, playing by the
rules of fixed exchange rates and benefiting from the stabilizing
influence of German inflation targets, a country's policy makers achieve a
dramatic turn around in expectations, in inflation and in long-term
interest rates. But the evidence on international disinflation in the
1980s shows that it was not limited to EMS members; all OECD countries
experienced sharply reduced inflation and a large drop in long-term
nominal interest rates, EMS membership did not contribute to reduce the
sacrifice ratio of disinflation. In fact Germany, on whose anti-inflation
credentials the credibility effects are supposedly based has one of the
highest sacrifice ratios among DECD countries.
               Ireland did reduce inflation to the German level, but a
serious public debt problem has emerged and the unemployment rate stands
near 20 percent. This raises questions of the Sargent-Wallace kind about
the sustainability of the program.

           A much debated issue in the macroeconomics of stabilization is the

existence of a credibility effect and how to reap it. Can confidence in a

stabilization plan can affect the output costs of a disinflation? The new

classical economics has asserted chat this is, indeed, the case: a new program

(under new management) if it were fully credible, would lead economic agents to

set wages and prices in accordance with the announced program. The transition

to low inflation could be achieved without much delay and without significant

unemployment. Long-term nominal ssaet prices would quickly reflect the change

in expectations Indeed, in the perspective of the new classical economics any

different outcome would be the consequence of a misreading of the program or a

lack of belief in the policy makers' determination to actually carry out the

announced measures.

          The credibility literature has blossomed in the aftermath of the

work of Barro and Gordon (1983) and Backus and Driffill (1985). The theory is

clear and plausible, but the evidence is primarily anecdotal. mete ace,

hovever, some attempts to lend empirical support to thts strand of thinking.

In particular Sargent (1982, 1963, 1986) has given a strong reading of this

paradigm in his deacription of the ends of four hyperinflations. He has also

 interpreted the 1926 Poincare stabilization in France as a clear example of the

model's predictions.2

           It is interesting to look at the recent disinflation experience

worldwide, but particularly in several high-inflation countries in Europe to

judge the extent to which success at reducing inflation can he seen as another

instance of these texthonk cases of credible stabilization. The sharp break in

the pattern of high inflation and high nominal interest rates in the early

l983s in Ireland, Italy, the UK or Denmark can certainly be interpreced as a

response to [he shift in policies and a sign of confidence and imprcved

expectations.

          The emphasis on the central role of expectations is en attractive

interpretation of the policy implications of EMS membership: by joining the

EMS, playing by the rules of fixed exchange rates and benefiting from the

stabilizing influence of German inflation targets1 a country's policy makers

achieve a dramatic turn around in expectations, in inflation and in long-term

interest rates. But there is nor only the question whether EMS membership did

in fact play a critical role. There is elso a wider failure of the paradigm in

a caae like Ireland's: while inflation and lone-term nominal intereat rates did

decline, real intareat rates turned sharply higher (fiscal correction

notwithstanding) and unemployment increased massively, as did public debt. ke

therefore conclude that Ireland's experience bears more resemblance to the

unsustainable path of Sargent-Wallace 'tmonetariat arithmetic" than to Poincare-

style costless stabilization. This paper concentrates on the experience of

Ireland; it attempts to identify special EMS effects in the stabilization hut

also places it in the wider context of what happened to inflation and interest

rates in the group of industrial countriea.

           Our analysis starta out with a sketch of the new classical paradigm,

using the Poincare stabilization as a concrete example of the difficulty

encountered in interpreting a ccncrete case. From there we proceed to an

analysis of the decline in inflation and interest rates in the 1980a. The

following two sections deal with the specific experience of Ireland. The

concluding section draws some policy conclusions.



1. THE NEW CLASSICAL ECONOMICS AND THE CREDIBILITY PARADIGM

                         Distussion of stabilization does not take long before it

comes to                    Stabilization   efforts succeed if they are credible, and

the more credible they are the less costly they will      be   in terms of output

bases. The    favorite   policy for credibility theorists ts   a startling reversal
of a critical element of instability by a drastic, public act, immediately

recognized as such. Markets chat adjust instantly co the new reality and the

economy, in no te, acts our the new and stable equilibrium. It this section

we briefly review the theoretical Issues in the discussion of stabilization

po1.Lcy .wttn crec:on:ty enects.

1.1 The Theory

           Rational expectaticr.s imply that economic agents use      all   available

information   to predict their economic environzient, including goverr.enc
                                          4



policies. The equilibrium hypothesis is that economic agents set prices, wages

and interest rates on the basis of all available information in a manner thac

achieves their plans. There is no anticipated, involuntary unemployment in this

world. In the new classical model a fully understood and believed shift in

monetary policy to e noninflationsry stance should rot lead to any protracted

unemployment: economic agents will recognize the shift in policy and will aet a

che future path of all nominal variables --wages, prices, interest races-- to

be consistent with this new monetary regime under conditions of full

employment.

           Sargent (l986,p.lll) baa characterized the implications of the new

classical economics in contrasting this school of thought with the Phillips-

curve tradition:

     "ge now turn to the second group of theories of inflation, which are the

           But Sargent (lSS,p. 114) also notes that in those circumstances

where there is no clearly identifiable1 credible change in regime a policy

shift can prove costly. Commenting sceptically en the Thatcher experiment, he

notes:


        Fir is difficult to interpret Thatcher's policy actions in terms of
     the kind of once-and-for-all widely believed, uncontroversial, and
     irreversible regime change that rational expectations equilibrium theories
     assert   tan cure inflation at little or nc cost in tens of real
     output. . Where these conditions are not met, rational exoertatior.s
     equilibrium models imply that ccntractionary monetary and fiscal polity
     actions are likely to be costly in terms of reel output and unemployment..


           The alternative to the equilibrium model would be a Taylor-Fischer
model of   overlapping   long-term wage contracts. These wage contracts would be
reflect rationally the public's expectations about monetary and fiscal policy

Unlike in the equilibrium model, however, the concern for relative wages of

different groups (or for real wages) leaves open the poaaibility of at least

temporary unemployment as the economy adjusts to a shock or to a change in the

monetary regime.3 Credibility effects must be added as an extra source of

unemployment. This latter possibility, of course, also exists in the

equilibrium approach. In fsct, Sargent (l986,p.llS) comments (in contrasting

the Thatcher stabilization with that of Poincare) on the difficulty in

assessing gradualist versus shock treatments.


     "Gradualism itwitea speculation about future reversals, or U.turna. in
     policy. Large contemporary government deficits unaccompanied by concrete
     prospecta for future surpluses promote realistic doubts about whether
     monetary restraint must be abandoned sooner or later to help finance the
     deficit. Such doubts not only call into question the likelihood that the
     plan can succeed in reducing inflation permanently but also can induce
     high real costs in terms of depressed industry and lengthened unemployment
     in response to what may be viewed as only temporary downward movements in
     nominal demand due to the monetary restraint."


          Subsequent literature in the new classical mode has focuaed on

expectations forration in a context of imperfect information games as the

central source cf a program's real effects. Following the work of Earro and

Gordon (1963) the literature views the inflation issue as a game between the

public ar.d a policy maker whoae anti-inflation attitudea are not known to the

public with certainty. Policy makers may or may not be strongly anti-inflation

crienred; consecuently hey may or not seek to fool the public into a low-


3See Taylor (1982) and MoCallun (1984) for axamplea of the effects of an
unanticipated shift in the monetary regime.

inflation belief in order to exploit that situation by creating an output-

raising inflation surprise. To the extent that the public updates its beliefs

about policy makera on the basis of actual inflation experience, inflationist

policy makers have en interest in building anti-inflation credentials which

they then would hope to exploit later in a more dramatic inflation surprise.

That possibility exists because the public never knows with certainty the

policy mskers true preferences.           -



            Persson (1988) in his survey shows thst credibility is central to the

effects cf regime changes in the new classical model. Work by Backus and

Driffill (1985, 1987) has used the reputation model tc show optimal

disinflation policies. Because the reputation issue is central to the imperfect

infcrmation    game disinflation   is front-loaded: by creating immediate high

unemployment policy makers establish their credibility.
me chief point of the literature is that          the absence of credible precommitmenc

creates    information problems that cause unemployment in the process of      regime

changes.   The more a government is able to precommit its policies or
unsmoiguously signsl its intent, the smaller the misunderstanding and the
resulting unemployment -    Alesina (l988b) has extended the analysis to the
political business cycle in noting the implications of the game-theoretic         model

of   policy for macroeconomics between miettions, inrerrrered in the context of
the credibility issue major policy commitments such as EMS membership might be
expected to carry disinflation oonuses because they change the policy game.

1.2 4ging Credibility

          How would one in fact, at the time of a stabilization program, judge

the degree to which a program inspirea credibility? Sargents own

qualifications make entirely clear that a fully credible stabilization must be

a rare event. The problem is that at the outset of a program there is no

assurance of how effective the measures in fact will be and whether they can be

sustained. Programs fflay look poor from the outset and in fact fsil; but they

may also look poor but then succeed as a result of unexpectedly favorable

developments. Alternatively, a program, may look as if it were certain to

succeed and then is brought down by unexpectedly unfavorable developments.

Finally there is the rare program that looks good and in facc turns out to be

successful. In those cases where stabilization in fact succeeded there is

rarely any evidence that this success was apparent from the outset.

          In Dornbusch (1987) I review the course of stabilization in Germany

to aae the point that confidence and credibility trailed by months behind the

fact of stabilization. It. Dcrnbusch and Fischer (1986) we show the difficulty

it judring st the outset failing and successful programs. a note in particular
that out of 3 stabilization efforts, two fail. The same point has bean made by

 ebb (1965)
          Focusing   on the credibility of a program in the parspeetive of the

new classical economics, any ds;repan:y from full employment would be a

reflection of less than full credibility. An slcerna:ive is to obsee changes

in long-tarn nominal interest rates. A decline in long-term interest rates
can be interpreted would be evidence that a stabilization program is supported

by credibility. Disappearance of yield differentials, both on short and on

long-term securities, show a disappearance of expectations of rising inflation

and increasing currency depreoiation Changes in long-term interest rates are

then measures of how public confidence in stabilization is progressing.

Applying the term structure theory, the yield on long-term bonds reflerte

current and anticipated future short-term interest nominal rates A For a given

real interest rate, thanges in the yield on long-term bonds represent changes

in the path of expected inflation,

Credible stabilization leads to an expectation of disinflation and hence to

reduced long-term interest rates. Conversely, a policy nix that is ultimately

expettad to become inflationary is reflerted in high conical long-term interest

rates. Andersen and Riaager (19S7, 1988) have illustrated this reputation-based

disinflation model by studying the path of interest rates in Denmark during the

l982 stabilization,

          We turn next to the 1926 Pointare stabilization which illustrates

nar.y of the issues raised in this section.




1.3 An illustration: The Poirrare Stabilization

          There are not many examples of "fully rredible stabilization", bt

the 1926 Pointare stabilization in France has become the exanole par exrellenre

as a result of Sargent'a vigorous portreval of the episode.


4See Begg (1983) for the relation between the yield on long- term bonds and the
sequence of future short rates.
1.3.1 The Events France had emerged from World War I with a substantial public

debt. Would the country go the way of Germany, with hyperinfletion, or the way

of the UK with an attempt to restore the prewar parity of gold? Keynes (1926)

discussed the issues of exchange rates, debts and budgets in his Opan Letter

to the French Minister of Finance".5 He saw France's large public debt as an

obstacle tn stabilization and argued that

        "the level cf the Franc exchange will continue to fall until the
       commodity value of the frsnc due to the rentiet has fallen to a
       proportion nf the nstionsl income which accords with the habits and
       mentality of the country."
          In fact, depreciation and inflation were chosen in the early 1920t

ss the means of reducing the real value of debt. The inflation was created

basically by maintaining low interest rates on the floating debt, thus assuring

exchange deprecistion and ultimately an exchange rate collapse as shown in

Figure 1. In 1921-2& the debt-GDP ratio averaged 16? percent: by 1926 it had

already declined to only 114 percent. Against this favorable background

Poincare undertook the decisive 1926 stabilization.

         Successful stabilizations can only be judged ex post: many

stabilizations in their early stages (like bebies) show great promise and only

later can one determina which were the decisive events that made this one

succeed and that one fail. The Poincare stabilization was different ss udged

by the urgency of the situation, the decisiveness of the measures and the

special role of Pointsre as a known and eatablished fiscal conservative, here

is how Wolfe (195l,p.34) describes the events:

        â¢ - a new National government was formed under Raymond Poincare, pledged to
        save the Franc at all costs, A radical tax bill giving government
        authority to increase all taxes 20 percent was jammed through the Chamber
        of Deputies.     coupled with a cut of more than a billion francs in
        government expenditures.


An external loan was arranged and the proceeds were used to reverae currency

depreciation. The Franc appreciated within a month by 28%. Wholesale prices had

been rising at 8-10% per month, now they fell for two months. Stability had been

achieved!

              These measures and eventa convey precisely what we would understand

to be the essential measures for successful stabilization. But (with apologies to

credibilists) the description just offered is that of the Â£a.U..ad 1924

stabilization, not of the successful 1926 stabilization.

              Having made our point, consider next the July 1926 stabilirstion. At

the center of the stabilization is (once again) Poincare. Sargent writes:

       "Raymond Poincare was s fiscal conservative, who had raised taxes while
       Prime Minister in 1924, and was known to advocate balanced budgets and
       France's return to gold.. as soon as he assumed control of the government.
       and even before his program was enacted by the legislature, the Franc
       recovered and inflstion stopped, -- The stabIlization of the French Franc
       vas followed by several years of high prcsperit. The French stabilization
       thus seema to fit the prediction of the rational expectations equilibrium
       aDproach."


              The immediate turnaround in the French Franc (Fisure 1) does, indeed,

  convey    the impreasion of an overnight change in the public's perception of
 polity. Interestingly, the budget had already been balanced before the crisis
 got undervay. Makinen and ;'oodward (1957) reccgr.Ice this point and show that
 the   crisis was related to the floating debt and interest rate ceilings, not to

 the budget, Political instsbility, in particular the notion of a capital le
                                       11


promoted by the Left? had added to the motives for capital flight. With

Poincare holding office there was an immediate recognition that special

taxation of capital would not be a risk anymore, at least for the time being.

Taxation did increase, but the immediate reason for the strong appreciation is

no doubt a sharp increase in short-term interest rates ahown in Figure 2. An

increase interest rates always is a means to attract capital inflows, bring

about exchange appreciation and thus impose at least temporary inflation

stabilization.

          Was the Poincsre stabilization perceived by the public as a

relatively permanent improvement for public finance, inflation and

depreciation? The movement of long-term bonds--the yield on the 3% rentes shown

in Figure 2-- suggests otherwise. There was, in fact, no sharp and immediate

drop in the long-term interest rate. Between May and November 1926 the yield on

3 rentes only fell from 6.29 to 6.02 percent. Moreover, throughout 1926-2?

(excepting mid-1926) the yield on long-term bonds exceeded the short rate,

thus suggesting a belief that stabilization remained tentative.6 Of course, cbs

realized reel short-tern interest rate was exceptionally high: In the 12 months

from July 1926 wholesale prices fell by 25.8 percent and consumer prices by 3

percent and that is how stabilization was achieved fcr the time beine.

         The very gradual decline of the yield on long-term bonds, corpared

with the rapid recorsr-v o the Franc, suggests that exchange rats policy was

mediately credible. 3ut that credibility takes a very spetial form: credible


61n fact, even 2 years after successful stabilization the yield on long-term bonds
remained higher than after the breakdown of the unsuccessful 1924 stabilization.

 until further notice. In that case one would expect, with a positive short-term

 interest differential, an inflow of capital which supports the exchange rate

 policy. Following the informal exchange stabilization, tong-term bond yields

 did not fall much, suggesting that stabilization remained tentative until it

 was validated by the sheer experience of the new policies and their viability.

            Models of speculative attack on a fixed exchange rece regime show in

 fact exactly this possibility. Even policies that mre ultimstel1 unsustainable,

 they can survive for a while provided they are supported by reserves and/or

high interest rates.7 This is the key to understanding why some of the programs

 that ultimately fail can be 'tapt up for a while.




1.3.2 Evsluaticn: The Poincare stabilization, judged in the context of the

credibility literature helps make two points. First, there is no realistic way

of telling whether s particular stabilization program will in fact succeed with

certainty or fail without question, The Poincare program did succeed, there

remains the question whether it succeeded because of the fiscal reform of the

previous years, the erosion of the real value of the public debt that had

already taken place before or because of the decisive support to the exchange

race.

            The second point is thac successful stabilization is rarely if eve:

established from one day   to   the next. The political circtatances in which

instability emerges do net change overnight. Stiff measures might be taken, 'cut


7See Salant and Henderson (1978), Krugman (1979), Flood and Carber (1984) and
Dornbus:b   (1987),
                                         13



there is no assurance that they will not be revoked the next day (as was the

case in France in 1924). There is no effective precommitment and hence

stabilization is something that can only be established with the passage of

time. Once the public adapts to the new reality, and views stability as the

rule, this stability is extrapolated and is reflected in reduced long-term

interest rates. In the short run credibility thrives mostly from tight money

and a fixed exchange rate. The behavior of long-term interest rates in Franca,

following the 1926 stabilization, certainly does not suggest an immediate

confidence in a sharp break of the inflation process.




1.4 Unpleasant Monetarist Arithmetic

          A final strand of lIterature highlights the izplioationa of

unsustaInable (and hence incredible) policy regimes. Sargent and 1.'allaoe (1981)

have explored the implications of an unsustainable shift to tIght money. They

consider a world where budget deficits are financed by money and debt. A shift

toward reduced money creation implies accumulation of debt and a rising

interest burden.

             If debt grow:h becomes excessive the shift to tight        cannot be

sustained: ultimately. to avoid insolvency inflationary money creation becomes

necessay as a means to finance the accumulated interest bill. Sargent and

 allace conclude(Sargent (198G,p.l39):

     "without help from the fisral authorities, fighting current inflation with
     rich: monetary polity must eventually lead to higher future infation."


          This problem is of interest because in several European countries,

moat notably in Ireland, inflation stabilization by tight money has, in fact,
                                            14



 translated into an extraordinary fiscal problem: the debt ratio has risen far

 above 100 percent and keeps rising. There is a genuine question of how the

mushrooming of debt can be stopped and whether future inflation will be che

answer. Historically there is ample precedent for debt reduction through

 inflation and capital levies as Alesina (l988a) and Eichengreen (1988) have

shown. The question is which way Ireland might go. If high future inflation,

with the benefits of seigniorage and inflationary debt liquidation is the

answer, the question arises why nominal long-term interest rates have declined

so much.

           We   turn next   to the Irish stabilization to see how much credibility

factcrs can be discerned in that experience.



2. DISINFlATION IN IRElAND

1922 Ireland abandoned the sterling peg in 1978 and joined the EMS. And as the

ENS   became increasingly a zone of monetary stability, Ireland played the game

with gteat success. By 1988 inflation had declined practically to the Cenan

level! The   Irish   experience would thus seem to bear out the argument that ENS

membership   was an effective disinflation device for couricries who had lacked a
firm anchor and hence were experiencing drifting, high inflation races.
             This argument has been advanced in a number of recent papers
including Akerhoim (1988), Collins (1988), Ciavazzi and Pagano (1987),
Ciovannini   and Cievazci (1987, 1989), as well    as Andersen and Risager (1987).
Akerholm sumnarizes this hypothesis as follows.
                                           15




        "By joining an international fixed exchange rate area like the ENS, tha
        country could demonstrate a atronger commitment to a fixed exchange rate;
        a depreciation is no more a unilateral affair but requires the approval of
        all the participanta in the currency area. Furthermore, short-term
        borrowing facilities and co-operative errangements would be made available
        in order to safeguard the financiel base for intervention at times of
        market unrest. Hence, the risks of a depreciation are reduced, which
        should help reduce risk premis and impose more flexibility on the behavior
        of the labor market."


             As we shall see asset markets did, in fact, show a response in the

sense of credibility although that effect did not go all the way to the

elimination of yield differentials, Because yield differentials did remain

high,    while   inflation differentials vanished, real interest rstms increasingly

became a problem. But an even more important issue was the lack of a flexible

labor market. A major fiscal contraction hsd no counterpart in a crowding-it of

net exports via increased international competitiveness. The elimination of

inflation therefore gave rise cc a fiscal problem and unemployment of

unprecedented proportion.



2.1 :nfletion and interest Rates

             The yield on 15-veer bonds in Ireland peaked in Febnoarv 1962 and by

October had declined by 5 percentage points. The rapid decline of long-term

interest    rates was merched, as   shown in Figure 2. by a shar decline in

inflation.    Teble 1 shows the decline in yields across maturities. Followir.g the
rapid decline of rates by 400 beefs pcinta in 1982; they declined by another
tOO basis points over the perIod to 1988 Inflation fell even more, so much so
ther by mid-1988 Irish inflation was not significantly different from chat of
Germany.

            The magnitude of the decline in yields is far more rapid and aizeable

than what occurred during the Poincare stabilization. The immediate question is

to know what happened in politics and/or economic policy to bring about so

massive a change in interest rates? Table 2 ahows the main events in politics,

monetary, fiscal and exchange rate policy.

          It is tempting to aaaign to EMS membership and specifically the

policy of not seeking large realignments a central role in the shift of

inflationary expectations. We investigate that hypothesis in more detail below.




2.2 The 1982 Adjustment

          The height of instability prevailed at the beginning of 1982 when

the government fell on the issue of a tight budget. Early 1982 provides a

watershed not in the sense that the need and willingness to implement

stabilization first became apparent. Certainly the need for auscerity had been

clear at least since 1981. Figure 4 shows the long-term interest differential

with Germany. This differential increases sharply toward the end of 1981 and

the beginning of 1982 and then falls off rapidly. The decisive fact of early

l982was that a political ccnsensua emerged to actually push these measures

forward. Moreover, this consensus survived changes in government and thus

rained tomentum. The consensus supported four specific policy measures:

          â¢ A shift toward consistently positive and high real interest rates.

       5 shows the realized real short-term interest rste. After a pattern of

       negative rates, starting in 1982 real rates are always positive and



          â¢ A fixed exchange rate policy in the context of the EMS   provided a
strong anchor. It s especially significant that in both 1982 EMS realignment

Ireland maintained the central rate.

1979.81 the primary budget deficit had averaged 7.2 percent.

a reduction to 6.2 percent, followed in 1983 and 1984 by a further reduction to

only 1.9 percent. Fiscal action thus was    drematic.8

            Partly as a result of ricing unemployment, partly as a   result of

wage agreements the increase in labor compensation slowed down from 18,1% in

1981 to only 14.4% in 1982.
                                                                                  of

long-term inflation expectations was the emerging political

need for fiscal correction following the inflation of 25% per year in late

1981. The fact that the new Fianne Fail government in Maroh submitted broadly

the same budget as the one on which the previous government had fallen

substantiates this consensus.

          The various pieces of the stabilization effort had strongly

                                                           assured that credit

demand would be financed abroad since the cost of borrowing abroad (including

reduced exchange depreciation) now seemed lower than domestic    loan rates. That

could come down to a narrower differential.

          The decline in nominal long- term interest rates can thus be

 interpreted as e response to the policy package and to the fact of a major
                                                                                  Not
 reduction in inflation. A special role must go to the exchange rate policy.

taking advantage of an EMS realignment for devaluation in 1982 signified a

shift from an accommodating exchange rate policy to a determined effort to

squeeze inflation. At this stage the EMS was clearly becoming an instrument of

disinflation. The resulting change in exchange rate expectations allowed a

decline in short and long-term interest rates.

          It is also interesting to note that in 1982 the term structure was

basically flat. In terms of models of policy makers' reputation there is no

suggestion (perhaps surprisingly) that confidence was stronger in the near term

than in the long term. Interpreting the term structure in terms of risks of

depreciation the premium above Cermsn rstes was flat across maturities. We

return to this point below.



2.3 Post-1982 Consolidation

           Following the initial adjustment in interest rates, the period from

1982 to 1988 shows steady further decline in rates. Over this period inflation

was brought down to less than 2 percent1 the primary budget moved all the way

to surplus and unemployment increased to above 18 percent. Much of the budget

progress was concentrated in 1963-84 when the Drirnaty deficit was brought down

to less than 2% of COP. Infistion declined rapidly and already by 1984 had

already fallen to the level of the averaae of the 12 European countries and

then kept up with the pack.

         One especially interesting episode in this period of cor.solidation is

late 1986 and early 1987. In this period the pound sterling (not in the ENS)

weakened against the EMS currencies. Sterling is of special interest to Ireland
                                       21



because mote than 40 percent of imports come from the UK and the UK market

accounts for more than 30 percent of Ireland's exports. Starting in mid-1985

sterling started depreciating, reaching a cumulative peak of 38 percent

(against the DM) in the first quarter of 1987. Thia depreciation caused a

growing loss of competitiveness in Ireland and hence raised increasingly

questions about the country's ability to hold on to the EMS central rate.

          In the first 1986 realignment the Irish rate was not moved, but in

the August 1986 realignment Ireland devalued by 8 percent. But this realignment

was insufficient to allay the fears that further devaluation might ensue. These

fears were reinforced by slippage on the budget correction. The long-term

differential with Germany increased from 3   to   8 percent in this episode,

highlighting the fear of depreciation. (See Figure 4) The government fought the

deteriorating expectations, and the resulting capital outflows, with a sharp

tightening of monetary conditions. The short-term interest rate increased frcm

10 percent to 14.6 percent. Pressure on the Irish pound stopped only when

sterling stopped declining in early 1987.

         By 1988 strengthening of fiscal contractioo, continuing high real

interest rates and the resulting high unemployment brought down inflation to

German levels and short and long-tan nominal interest rstea had declined to

lass than 10 percent. There continued to be a differential relative to OH

rates, but little queation that the Irish pound, for the time being, was a

harder currency.               -


         Before asking questions about the sustainability of the program we
turn to an international comparison. In the 1980s long-ten interact rates
                                             22


  declined worldwide. It is therefore interesting to ask how the Irish experience

  compares with that of other countries, Specifically, how isuch of the decline in

  inflation and interest rates Ireland was due to worldwide factors and how much

  can be attributed to the stabilization?



  3. INTERffiATIQfl COMPARISONS

           In this section we review the international disinflation
                                                                         experience

 and the pattern of declining long-term interest rates worldwide,      The evidence
 is relevant in judging whether EMS membership played an obvious and major role

 in the Irish disinflation. To answer that question we consider evidence on

 three points;

           â¢ There was a worldwide disinflation and reduction in long-term

 interest rates in the 1980s and thus Ireland's case wss by no means special.

           â¢   We consider   evidence on whether EMS membership exerts a credibility'

bcnus and thus reduces the costs of disinflation.

           â¢ It is also interesting to ask whether the Irish reduction in

interest rates is unusual in view of the large accunulation of debt. To address

that question we look at the role of inflation and fiscal factors as

determinants of long'term interest rates in a cross section of countries,



3.1 Interest Rates and Oisinflsn

          Ireland was not the only country to experience disinflation in the

lSEOs. On the contrary, evefl' single OECO country went through the same shift

in policies and enjoyed a reduction in inflation and an accompanying reduction

in long-term interest ra:as.

 public. The wage-setting public does not know at the outset whether the

 government is or is not the inflationist type in the way modelled by Barro and

 Cordon (1983). Upon adoption of exchange rate targets there is an immediate

 decline in short-term interest rates. But uncertainty about the governments

 true nature persists and is reflected in a positively sloped term structure

 which reflects the possibility of an ultimate devaluation.

            In this analysis actual experience of reduced inflation and anti-

 inflation policy decisions and the fact of a fixed exchange rate lead to a

 gradual reinforcement of the belief that ftjg policy maker is not inflationist.

As a result over time the level of long-term interest rates further declines,

The term structure premium vanishes as the public conaolidatea their belief

that government does not harbor the intention of an ultimate inflation burst.

            This model is used by Andersen and Risager to identify the key policy

decisions that load to a change in expectations and thus to a decline in     long-
term Danfsh interest rates and in the term structure premium. These     eventa,

involving wage agreements fiscal agreements and exchange rate decisions not to

devalue occLr in the period from October 1962 to May 1983 as shown in Table

The events thus lag sorswhat or. the decline in Irish rates the first   part of

which had already occurred by fall of 1962. There is an interesting question tc

hiow   whether Denmark drew on the Irish precedent.

 3.2 The Cost of Disinflation

             Consider next the question whether EMS membership confers specisl

disinflation advantages. That question has been addressed in an extensive

literature on the EMS and especially by Ungerer et al (1986), Rogoff (1985),

Collins (1988) and Cuitian cc al (1988). Both Rogoff and Collins emphasize that

inflation convergence did not occur in the first few years of the ENS; indeed,

a tendency toward converges only atarta    after   1982. Moreover, as alresdy noted

above most industrialized countries had reduced by 1988 inflation rates to

blow 5 percent, independent of EMS membership. Ungerer et al (1986) did find a

significant EMS effect in estimated inflation equations, but their findings are

rightly questioned by Collins.

             Rather than considering the question of inflation convergence and the

possibility of an EMS-induced break in the inflation performance there is an

alternative approach that focuses on sacrifice ratios. The sacrifice ratio- -

defined   as the number of extra percent unemployment years per percent reduction

in inflation-S measures the cost of disinflation. If EMS membership conveys

special disinflation advantages we would expect, other things equal, a lower

sacrifice ratio for EMS members. Table 5 shows the sacrifice ratios for all

OECD members (except Turkey and Iceland) for the disir.flatior. experience of

1981-1988.

            It is immediately obvious that EMS membership does not make for small

sacrifice ratios and a regression (not reported here) bears out that fact. It

is striking that Germany, whose anti-inflation reputation is supposed to give

the EMS the credibility bonus has one of the highest sacrifice ratios. This

evidence should firmly lay to rest the view that EMS membership can make

disinflation easiet; it may make it more credible, but even so ft certainly

does not make it cheaper in terws of lost output.



3.3 Convergence

            RAther than focussing qn disinflation we can also lock at the

prospects of inflation differentials. If we are willing to assume that long-

term real interest rates are equslized across countries then nominal interest

differentials   on 1ong cen securities represent trend differentials in
                                              28


 inflation, Alternatively, without any assumption about real interest rates,

long-term interest differentials represent trend bilateral exchange rate

changes. Table 6 shows the average and standard deviation of bilateral long-

term interest differentials of various countries with Germany.

          It is   apparent that differentials between EMS members and Germany are

neither smaller nor more stable than those between noruuembers and Germany. In

fact, current inflation differentials have narrowed more than long-ten

interest differentials. This suggests that trend depreciation of exchange

razes is expected to remain a characteriatic of the EMS, except between Germany

and the Netherlands.



3.5 Determinants of Lane-ten Interest Razes:

          The literature on long-term interest rates has been relatively

unsuccessful in explaining the large changes in the 1980a in individual

countries. 1e use   international   cross section evidence to identify the key
                                      2g



determinants of long-term interest rates. In particular we are interested to

separate out the role of inflation of fiscal variables and once again any

special EMS affecta.

          In country studiee there aay be some scope to use aurvey data and

budget forecasta as explanatory variables for (forward-looking) long-term

interest rates, but there is little hope to do so for a large group of

countries. In fact, even consistency of the fiscal dsta may already ha an

issue. We therefore concentrate on current actual variables. Our cross section

covers the main industrialized countries with annual data for the time period

1974 to 1997.

          The basic question is what role inflation and fiscal variables play

in determining sn individual country's long-term interest rate. We also want to

know whether the EMS plays s special role in the determination of long-term

interest rates of partner countries. The basic hypothesis is that a country's

long-term interest rate, given external interest rates, is higher the higher is

the rate of inflation. If fiscal variables are to play a role we would expect a

non- interest surplus to be an indication of stabilization and reduced future

inflation. As such it should imply a lower long-term interest rate. finally, if

fears of Sargent-Wallace inflstionsr debt liquidation are a concern we expect

a higher debt/CNP ratio to imply a higher expected rate of inflation and hence

a hfgher interest rate.

          In Table 7 we use a pooled annual data of industrialized countries

for the period 1974-87 to uncover the determinants of the large shIft in long- -

term interest rates among industrialized countries.

         Equations 1. and 5. explain long-term interest rates by debt ratios,
the non-interest budget and the inflation rate. Each of the explanatory
                                           31


variables has the expected sign and is significant. Note that the coefficient

cf inflation is significantly different from unity. This is not surprising

because current inflation is certainly not a good indication (on a one-for-one

basis) of future inflation, in addition, of course, there is no presumption of

s constant real interest rate, A further interesting point is the role of the

debt ratio. Net public debt (as a fraction of GD') has a significant positi\Te

effect on long-terN interest rates. But the effect is quantitatively small in

that an extra 60 percent of GD? in debt raises the long-term rate by only a

percentage point.

             A difficulty with equations 1. and 5. is that they concentrate

extlusively on national determinants and do not allow for a common world

capital market or constraints from a monetary regime like the EMS. We therefore

now turn to these factora. In our discussion we concentrate on the regressions

for European countries.

              Equation 6. introduces the German long-term interest rats (for the

other European countries) as an additional explanatory variable. This procedure

assumes that Germany sets exogenously its policies and long-ten rate,         but that

the rest of Europe is influenced by the German rate. We obsee that the German

rate is, indeed significant. Higher German rates raise interest rates in         other

European countries. At the sac time the debt variable becomes insignificant.

              Further regressions show the influence of the inflation differential

between a coun;r s.nd Germany (flTFDIFF). This variable, too, is highly

 significant    and   the size of its coeffioients is large and thus helps account

 for   the   large differences in long-term interest rates. Finally we look for an

 EMS effect, interestingly (and contrary to expectations if the EMS is seen as a

 stability Club) the EMS coefficient is positive. EMS partners, other things

 equal, have.higher nominal interest rates. The proper interpretation is that

 the EMS dummy is phased in 1979, exactly at the time long-term interest rates

become very high. it thus helps explain the high interest rate period rather

 than tracking special membership effects,9

             A particularly interesting finding is the absence (except in 1.. 5.

and 6.) of the Sargent-Wallace effect. Debt ratios per se simply do not appear

as determinants of long-term interest rates. This is a striking finding because

it runs so much counter to the belief that extremely high debt ratios Cas that

of Irelsnd, for example) should be predicting financial trouble. Contrary to

that notion, the equations support the view that current flows variables such

as the non-interest budget and current inflation contain more information than

the    stock position. This   suggests that asset markets do not see high debt

stocks    as predicting special   taxation of assets or inflation as a risk.



3.5 Sumrcarv

            In this section we have looked at    international evidence cf special

EMS    effects. The hypothesis that EMS   membership could have helped achieve

disinflation    in Ireland is attractive in view of game-theoretic models that
emphasize the special role of precoient and reputation. Taking part in a
hard-currency club, in   terms of these models, would be extected to yield a


9Tha   regressions use domestic   rather than offshore interest rate, This     makes the
neglect of caz variables in our analysis a potentially serious shortcoming.

disinflation   bonus. The evidence we have reviewed here does not support the

view that EMS membership yielded the partners extra facility in reducing

inflation or translated into an expectation of mare       substantial disinflation.

                                                                       The most
In fact, the evidence points if anything in the other direction,

striking evidence to the contrary is, of course, the very high German sacrifice

ratio.

           We now turn to a discussion of the costa of stabilization

We have already seen in Table S steve that Ireland had one of the highest

sacrifice ratios. Our interest is now to identify why unemployment

much.




4. FAILED STABILIZATION

             Ireland has stopped inflation and the primary budget today is in

surplus. In the near-term a major outbreak of inflation and depreciation is

entirely implausible. Inflation stabilization thus is a fact. But so are two

                                                                                  at
other points: Firs:, as Figure 10 and Table B show, stabilization has come

 the coat of an extremely high level of unemployment and in that sense
                                                                                   the
 stabilization is not complete and can even be said to have failed. Second,

 debt   ratio has risen sharply and continues to rise. Ireland has the highest
 debt/GOP ratio among industrialized oottries, far higher than :taly and
 Belgium. and perhaps with lsrael the highest in the world. ln this respect.
 too, stabilicarion can be said to have failed.

               "Only limited progress has been made so far in halting the
          accumulation of large Exchequer Deficits; the resulting high levels of
          taxation, crowding-out pressures and crushing debt interest bill (nearly
          half in respect to foreign debt) have created a difficult environment for
          investment and growth. Employment has only recently begun to stabilize
          after a prolonged fall, Unemployment has climbed to the unacceptably high
          average of 18.75 well above the Community average, but the figure would be
          much larger had not emigration moved to high new levels recently, thereby
          offsetting the strong underlying growth in the labor supply.


The triumph of low inflation has thus come at the cost (perhaps inevitable) of

extraordinary high unemployment, massive emigration and a precarious debt

overhang. 10

             Two questions can be asked at this stage. One is to know why

 stabilization led to high unemployment and escalating debt ratios. The other is to

 know whether the Irish debt situation ia unsustainable in some well-defined sense.

 If so what are the policy options?



 4.1 What Went Wrong?

             Several factors come together in explaining the extraordinarily poor

performance of the Irish economy. The firs: is that fiscal contraction per se

reduces real aggregate demand and thus reduces output and employment. The textbook

says that expenditure reducing policies must be accompanied by expenditure switching

policies if full employment is to be maintained, These have, not, in fact been used.

On the contrary, the real exchange rate has been allowed to appreciate rather than

depreciate and the real interest rate has increased sharply. Thus increased net

exports due to stronger competitiveness or higher investment were not brought forth

to make up the slack,

                  Table 9 shows a 17 percent rise the relative labor cost in Ireland since
             -




the stabilization effort began in 1982. Since 1978 the real appreciaticn on this

measure amounts to 37 percent! There is some question on how to measure

cnmpetitivenesa and it is clear that the result would differ quantitatively            froa

this estimate. But it is doubtful chat an altogether different picture wnuld

emerge â¢ll

                  Taking as a fact thst Ireland's toapetitiveness has sharply

deteriorated there is little surprise that there has been no "crowding in"

following        the budget cuts; on the contrary the overvaluation policy, while

contributing to disinflation has made fiscal adjustments extra expensive.

                  It is interesting to ccir.pare Ireland to Latin America. Just like     in

latin   America, initially public finance went out of control and exchange rate

overvaluation and the budget were financed by rassive external borrowing. The main

difference       between the two experiences is that Latin America can no longer borrow
and as a result, under IMP programs. has undergone budge: cutting and real
depreciation with        high   inflation. Ireland    continues to enjoy external financing and

therefore has been able to indulge a low inflation experience. But this has             tome at

the   cost of dramatic unemploent because of a lack of crowding in.

                   Monetary policy has worked similarly to avoid crowding in. Table 10

shows thac the realized real interest rate increased sharply in toe 198Cc             compared

    to the 1970a. Part of this increase reflects higher worldwide interest rates. But in

    part the higher real interest rate is a counterpart of the hard currency play which

    continues to command less than full credibility.

                  Irish interest rates4 even with a fixed exchange rate policy and near-

     German levels of inflation continue to exceed those in Germany. It             is   noteworthy

     that the realiced real interest rate always turns out positive becauss the

     government in fact        stuck   to a no-depreciation policy. But if hish nominal

     interest     rants were   a reflection of antc1pated depreciation one would expect

-    less   of a decline in investment       since   presumably, in char   case, ex ants   real

     interest rates    were    not positive and high. In fact, however, investment declined

     sharply. The experience with investment, just as the unemployment experience,

puts   in question simplistic versions of the new classical mechanism of       credible
stab flit   at ion -
               The exceptionally high real interest rate has had an immediate effect

on budget dynamics in a way suggested hy Sargent and Wellace (1981) with a

positive and high real interest rate (relative to the growth rate of income) the

ratio of debt to CDI' rises. The recessionary monetary-fiscal and exchange rare

mix has pushed down the growth rate of income and pushed up the real interest

rate. As a result the debt ratio is rising very sharply.

              A further factor that deserves attention is seigniorage. In a strongly

growing snd moderately inflating economy the government tan finance part of the

budget deficit by money creaticn. The shift to a low inflation policy sacrifices

these seigniorage revenues. To the extent that slow growth is a byproduct. this

further reduces the scope for money creation. In Ireland, as Table 10 above

shows, the reduction in seignicrage is more than a percent of CDt and thus

represents a significant component of the deficit financing problem.

              We   tun next   to the question whether stabilization can be sustained.



       Is the Irish Fiscal Situation tnsuataineblel

              The Sargent-Wallace (1981) model preditts that a shift towerd tight

money,   given the non-interest budget, will lead higher real interest rates
                                                        to

effect is not discernible in regression equations. The first question to ask,

therefore, is whether the Irish debt accumulation (and that of other high debtors

such as Belgium or Italy) is simply not explosive.

          The conventional debt-dynaisics model shows that the increase in the

ratio of deht to GDP, d, is given by two determinants:

          â¢ the primary budget deficit, and

            The mid-1988 forecast for Ireland's budget shows a surplus for the

primary balance. Other things equal the budget improvement (if sustained)

stabilizes or even reduces the debt-income ratio in the years ahead. But real

interest rates continue to be very high. In       part   this reflects less then full

credibility which leaves a residual differential, even if inflation is duwn         to
the    German level.

             In jud;ing whether the debt dynamics is stable at the current levels of

the parameters one has to consider the effective real interest tate ;aid on the

debt. This is the weithted average of realized after-tax real interest rates on

the domestic and (by differing denomination) foreien debt. tne comolete

Ingredients for that calculation are not available, but Table A-I in the Appentix

sets out some of the elements, It appears that a fair amount of the debt was

issued as long-tern bonds in the period of high interest rates. Giava:zi end

Pagano (1988) estimate that the average maturity of the Irish domestic debt Is
                                              41


8 years. Thus at least for the present realized real interest rates are very



             There is also a question whether foreign debt is tax exempt and for that

reason has a significantly higher cost. In sum, there does not seem to be a

sensible way to Judge whether the parameters imply a stable debt ratio, one that

further rises or that declines very moderately. But it is entirely clear that a

period of high real interest rates in the world economy would make Irish debt

entirely unsustainable. Since such a scenario has a significant possibility (as

does the low growth outlook) any discussion of sustainability must recognize this

possibility.



.3 Policy Options

           Suppose that one concluded that Irish debt is unsustainable, what are

the options that have been suggested? It is easy to identify measures which would

    solve the problem:                                -




           .   Taxation. Ireland's taxation is nothing short of oppressive. As Table

12 shows, marginal razes are high as is the etonomy-wide burdcr.. Raising marginal

income tax     rates   provides a powerful disincentive and   intreased   commodity

taxation leads to       reduced   living standards that encourage emigration of the most

skilled   wcrkers.

            The average level of taxation in Ireland is not significantly higher

than the average for all OECD countries. The major problem is that the cax

structure ia very inefficient, with large segments of the potential tax base

almost completely excluded from taxation. As a result labor and consumption are

the main targets of taxation, with taxation of corporations, capital including

land or wealth practically non-existent.

            Among the feasible options that have been recommended are the following:

            â¢ Expenditure cuts are, of course, an option. They are both difficult

and oes:race.

            â¢   The GElD has made a   strong case for broadening the tax base as      the
chief directIon of fiscal reform. Taxation of corporations, as noted, retains
minimal and     exemptions   from the VAT remain plentiful. The introduction of       a

withholding tax (with foreign credit) on the outstanding external debt would also
yteld some revenue.
            â¢ A once-and-for- all     capital la'' on   financial assets as well as real

assets    intluding land could raise revenue the: could be devoted to          a reduction of
                                          43


 the   level of indebtedness. Alternatively, a recurrent wealth tax could finance

part of the deficit.

            â¢    Supply-aide policies are emphasized by many observers as absolutely

central. Unless Ireland becomes far more competitive internationally there is no

chance to grow out of debt. And if Ireland does not very rapidly come out of the

debt trap the real economy will continue to deteriorate. The gain in

competitiveness requires a major reduction in the relative wage in Ireland and

that means devaluation with incomes policy.

            Depreciation would not help reduce debt burdens because half      the debt is
denominated     in foreign currency. But for growth a much lower real value of the

punt is essential. If devaluation is accompanied by a forceful incomes policy it

can also help reduce the risk premium.

            â¢ Another direction of change, perhaps in combination with a capital

ley,    is a restructuring of the debt or even   of the monetary system. At    present
Ireland pays a confidence tax in that the yield on Irish asseta exceeds that in

Germany by significantly more than the interest differentiel. This implies real

itnerast   rates ate higher than they would be in the absence of currency
confidence problems -
           me   yteld differential on long-ten Irtsh dollar bonds relative to US
government debt in the period from May 1956 to October averaged 115 basis poitts.
Suppose chat is the risk premium for Irish Tholitical risk. lr. addition the
local currency debt, nearly half of the total debt, tarries a currenry risk
premium of another 2 percentage points (relative to Geriany) . This excess risk
carries a major burden in the budget since it amounts to s ftnancing requirement
                                            44


of fully 1.5 percent of COP per year. This coat can be saved by refunding the

debt into a portfolio of OH, dollar and Yen debt.

            Of course1 a decision to move all the way to as debt dencminsted in

foreign currency implies that inflationary liquidation and capital lavies cay

become much harder. It is therefore a step which would only be appropriate in the

context   of s major fiscal reform, thet assures that the current doubts about the
budget    process can be largely removed.

            An alternative to refunding of the debt would be a return to an

inflation policy which generates sei.gniorage and affords (in a transition phase)

a moderate liquidatict of the long-term domestic currency debt.              Such an

inflation policy is, however, increasingly difficult to conceive of es

integration in the Common Market is being pushed ahead in the direction of 1992.

Thus the country should might go the other way adopt the OMark as its currency

and enjoy the reduction in the currency risk premium on its debt. The

intermediate position is doubly expensive because it means foregoing seigniorage

and at the same time incurring the cost of a risk premium.



5. CCN:ItDTNC RLMAP.Y3

            Ireland   faces a ical posr-stabilizatton problem: high real interest

rates,    depressed activity and a rising debt ratio. The   oritital    failure in the
stabilization occurred in the labor market where lark of a gain         in

competitiveness    stood in the   way of crowding in. As a result the    graduaflst
attempt at    stabilization cannot succeed.: even if inflation ran be zept       low and
the rise in the debt ratio brought to a atandstill, the trogram is a Leilure
                                             4S


because the extremely high and inefficient levels of taxation make Ireland a

thoroughly unattractive place for production, in the perspective of a far mote

competitive Europe after 1992 shopping for attractive production locations will

become far more pervasive than it has been in the past and Ireland is bound to

appear Llrtstttactive.

             Ireland's problems are worse then these of most countries. There is no

simple clean way out because the debt is so extremely large and the tax burden is

already enough to drive people into emigration. In the lPZOs one would have said

this is the case where a capital levy should restore the normal functioning of

the economy. Unfortunately moderate inflation is not enough and outright levies

are unpopular, even if they may turn out to be the only solution.

             The other conclusion we drew deals more broadly with inflation

stabilizarton. A policy cbs: uses a fIxed exchange rate to disinilate and that

requires at the same time fiscal ccnsolidstion can easily run into difficulties.

The fixed exohsnge rste policy stands in the wsy of s gain in competftiveness and

in fact easily becomes a policy of overvelue:ion. The overvalued currency then

needs to be defended by high real nreresr cares. me combination of            budget
cutting,    high real interest races and an overly strong currency creates

unemployment     on each score. There is no offsetting crowding- in methsnisc .nless
money wages are strongly flexible downwsrd        or produttivirv groh :s     high.

Neither    was the case   in   Ireland and hence the countn is locked   into a high
unemployment     and high debt crap.
            LS   membership has been portrayed as an important means     of   reducing the

costs of disinflation. c5 have seen that there is no evidence of such a
                                       46


credibility bonus from EMS membership. Several of the EMS members, including in

particular Germany have the highest sacrifice ratios among the OECD members.

There is some indication of credibility effects in asset markets: long-term

interest rates have followed current inflation to a very significant extent, even

though they have not gene all the way. But Irish market unemployment has

increased sharply and remains stubbornly high: half the inflow into the labor

force emigrates end the other half becomes unemployed! That experience is sharply

at odf.s with the new classical model of the labor market and there is no

plausIble way in which these events tan be interpreted as arising from confusions

about government policy. The lesson for stabilization policy is clearly that

governments must pay far more attention to the need for crowding-in through

increased competitiveness. A major real depreciation at the outset of the program

would provide the required offset to budget cutting.
