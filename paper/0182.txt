                                       Introduction

        The changing competitive position of the United States in international

trade is the net result of many influences operating on the internal prices of

the United States and its chief competitors and on the exchange rates between

their currencies and the currencies of other countries. Both monetary and real

factors, and both cyclical and secular influences affect the competitive position

of the country.

        The present paper is intended to make a modest contributicn to an under-

standing of one small but important link in this complicated chain of interact-

ing factors. It is a link that has often been ignored because strong simplifying

assumptions have until very recently usually been made about it. We refer to the

relation of exchange rate changes, export prices, and domestic prices. During

the last few years a number of attempts have been made to examine the extent to

which exchange rate changes were "passed through"; that is, the extent to which

a given depreciation in the U.S. dollar, for example, resulted in a corresponding

decline in the price of U.S. exports in foreign currencies. ** However, the pos-
sibility that a change in the exchange rate might also alter the relationship be-
tween the export price     and the domestic price of a given product, expressed in

the same currency, has been almost completely ignored. The assumption made,

implicitly    by most past writers in the theory of international trade and more

recently explicitly by advocates of the monetary approach to the balance of

payments, has been that the "law of one price" applies to shipments destined

for home markets and for foreign markets.


                   Reasons   for Deviations from the    Law of One Price

        For the prices of internationally traded goods to be identical in different

markets, transport Costs must be zero or equal for each product for all origins to

each destination, or each traded good must have only one source of supply. If

these conditions are not met, there must be some differences in prices of inter-

nationally traded goods either at each destination for goods with different origins

or at the various points of origin for goods with a single destination.

        There are, however, more weighty reasons -—       both   static and dynamic ——      for
expecting departures from the law of one price. A static circumstance giving rise

to price discrimination between destinations is that in at least some sectors there

are oligopolistic firms      facing   different elasticities of demand at home        and   in
each foreign     market; profit maximizing behavior would lead such firms to charge
lower   prices   in the markets characterized by more elastic demand. The
                                                                           possthility
of   price differences among different exporters from the same or different countries

is abetted by the existence of        product   differentiation both in terms of physical

characteristics relating to appearance and performance, and in terms of various

service   elements suchas before—and—after—sale advice and service, credit terms
                       *
and speed of delivery.
                          Oligopoly strategies aimed at maintaining a certain price

position relative to rivals may produce price discrimination when the constellation

of rivals differs from market to market          or when the e:.change rates   of   different

destination countries move differently with respect to the oligopolist's home

currency. Such behavior would be warranted if the oligopolist regards his long

run profit iaximization in a market as being jeopardized by a loss of market

share (a form of capital).

     In addition, dynamic factors associated with changes in competitive advan-

tae and changing market shares make it possible for one source of supply to be

selling at lower prices over protracted periods of time. Selling at a low price

is, after all, the traditional way of breaking into a market and expanding market

shares. Shifts in trade shares in individual product classes and broad groups of

products are continually occurring. In the decade of the l960s, for example, the

share of Japan in "world" manactured exports rose by more than 70 percent while

that of the U.K. dropped by more than a fourth and that of the U.S. by more than
           *
a tenth.       If such shifts are prolonged and frequent, disequilibrium situations in

which markets have not fully adjusted to changes in comparative advantage may be

the norm rather than the exception. The files of the U.S. International Trade

Commission (formerly the Tariff Commission) and of like bodies in other countries

are full of claims that foreign sellers are undercutting domestic producers in home

markets, and such claims are not infrequently accompanied by expanding foreign

shares in domestic markets.

     Lack of knowledge, uncertainty regarding the reliability of new suppliers.,

the reluctance to give up a satisfactory relationship with customary suppliers and

commitments to a given type of equipment because of previous purchases or stocks



 The share comparisons are for the years 1960 and 1970; the "world" consists of
 the 14 major industrial countries.. See.U.S. Department of Commerce,
 national Economic Indicators and Ccmetitive Trends, June 1976, p. 57.

 of spare parts may all explain the failure of buyers to respond immediately to

 price differences. They may explain too why it may be necessary for price dif-

 ferences of a substantial and/or prolonged character to exist if sellers hope to

 overcome the inertia of buyers in patronizing customary sources.

         There are, therefore, reasons for believing that there will be notable de-

 partures from the uniformity of prices and also, since the causal conditions alter

 through time, in the uniformity of price changes. The evidence on this point is

 far from voluminous, but it tends to emerge from almost any careful set of inter-

 national price comparisons.


 Evidence of price differences for exports of different origin

         Documentation of the existence of substantial differences in the export

prices of different countries may be found in an earlier National Bureau study

dealing with the international price competitiveness for manufactured metals and

metal products (Kravis and Lipsey, 1971). While some differences were found in

all 6 of the 2—digit SITC categories included in the study, the largest differences
                                           **
were in .ron and steel (SITC Division 67).    Japanese prices averaged 30 percent

     Relative prices of each iron and steel product in this comparison are weighted
     by the importance of each product in 1963 exports of OECD countries. The country
     composition of the OED has varied; the statistics in the source cited refer to
     18 European countries and the U.S., Canada, and Japan.

less than those of the U.S., German prices 24 percent less and the U.K. prices 22

percent less. Table 1 shows frequency distributions of price differences from the

U.S. for individual 3— and 4—digit SITC categories falling within the iron and

steel (SITC 67), non-electrical machinery (SITC 71) and electrical machinery (SITC

72) divisions. For iron and steel, the individual differences, though clustered

around the    average   cited above, were as large as 43 percent for Japan in the case

of iron and steel wire (SITC 67) and 40 percent for Germany in the cases of bars

and   rods   (SITC 673.2) and tube   and pipe fittings (SITc 678.5). These differences
persisted more or less over the entire period covered by the study, 1953-64. The

period was one in which the U.S. share in the iron and steel exports of the 21

OECD countries declined from 19 percent to 10 percent and that of the U.K. from

14 percent to 9 percent, while the German share rose from 12 to 18 percent and

the Japanese share from 5 to 14 percerrt. Similar,         though   less dramatic differences

in prices and    changes    in shares were found in non—electrical machinery and
                           *
electrical    machinery.       For this period, at least, notable and even substantial

price differences persisted while the low price sellers gradually expanded their

market shares and the high priced sellers saw their shares contract.

goods from different countries.

       Using a combination of data reported upon. in         earlier work (1971) and

official German    and U.S. export price data, we      are able   to compare German and U.S.
export prices for machinery and equipment         (SITC 7) over   the   period 1954—75 (see

Table 2). From 1954 to 1969 when the D.M./dollar exchange rate was relatively

stable (varying within a 7 percent range) the annual ratios of German to U.S.

export prices, both taken in dollar terms, varied within a 10 percent range.

Beginning in 1969, however, the mark began to appreciate, and most of its rise

was passed through to German dollar export prices. The German/U.S. export price

ratio was 45.5 percent higher in 1975 than in 1969; the German export price in

DM increased by 44.3 percent and the $/DM rate by 59.7 percent compared to a rise

in U.S. export prices of 58.4 percent. As this implies, there is very little cor-

relation between the changes in German and U.S. export prices when both are ex-

pressed in dollars.


Price discrimination

        There is also persistent evidence that price discrimination by sellers to dif-

ferent markets is quite common in international trade. References to such discrim-

ination are continually appearing in the business and financial press, and occas—
                                                                     *
ionally    there is an official finding of discriminatory pricing.

        Although information about domestic pricing policies was not solicited in the

National Bureau study referred to above, about half of the 121 U.S. sellers that

provided    price information nevertheless indicated what their pricing policies
                                                                                           **
were.     Of these, about   half stated that their foreign and domestic prices differed.

The    information obtained from these and other sellers and buyers, including some

     For example, it was recently reported that the Common Market fined a glass pro-
     ducer for selling insulating fiber glass in Germany at a price 40 percent higher
     than that charged in the Benelux countries and another firm for maintaining music
     record prices in Germany 50 percent higher than in France. It was also reported
     that a fruit comnany was selling bananas in rich Common Market countries at twice
     the price charged in poorer ones. New York Times, 17 January 1976.

from abroad, suggested that price differentiation between various markets was

more widely practiced by European suppliers than by U.S. firms and still more by

Japanese exporters.

      iore systematic evidence about the existence of price discrimination for

traded goods may be obtained by comparing the German and U.S. export price series

with their corresponding wholesale price series. The price series for machinery

and   transport   equipment (SITC 7) shown in Table 2 were constructed by combining

the individual wholesale price series to an aggregate index with the aid of each

country's export weights. Thus the effect of different goods composition in ex-

ports and in domestic sales has been sharply reduced. It is true that there is

still room, within the 4-digit SITC categories, for compositional differences, but

if markets were perfect 1substitutions in production and consumption could be ex—,

pected to keep the price movements of such closely related goods in close harmony.

      Are the ranges of variation in the export/domestic price ratio --   6.4 percent
for the U.S. (column 8) and 8.5 percent for Germany (column 7) ——    sufficiently
small so that we may judge export and domestic prices to move identically? One

way of answering this question that has often been followed is to regress one

price series against the other and to demand for a judgment in favor of identity

not only an r2 that is equal or close to one but also a constant term that is insig-

nificantly different from zero and a slope coefficient that is insignificantly

different from one. The two sets of series do not pass these tests unequivocally.

The r2 for the annual percentage changes in the U.S. wholesale price index and

the percentage changes in the U.S. export price

index   is 0.95 and the r for the corresponding German pair is 0.80.       The latter

is significantly different from one at the 5 percent level. Both the U.S. and

German equations satisfy the condition that the constant term be insignificantly

different from zero. However, the slope coefficients in the U.S. equations are

significantly different from one (at the 5 percent level) and the same is true

for Germany when export prices are taken as the dependent variable though not in

the opposite case.

       It is in any case questionable whether reliance should be placed on a stat-

istical test. The differences may not be large enough to be picked up by a

statistical test yet be economically important. Variations of less than

10 percent in the export/domestic price ratio over a 20 year period may appear to

be quite modest. Yet when account is taken of profit/sales ratios —- which for U.S.

corporations producing SITC 7 products were around 4 percent in 1970 —— such swings

imply large shifts in the profitability of exports and domestic sales. As we have

pointed out elsewhere, both U.S. and German data provide evidence of associated

changes in exports relative to domestic shipments (Kravis and Lipsey, 1977).

        At a less aggregated level evidence about the existence of price discrimina—

tion between domestic and export sales of traded goods may be obtained from corn-

parisoris between export and domestic price series in an earlier paper in which

changes in export prices for four countries (Germany, Japan, U.K., and U.S.) were

compared with changes in domestic prices over the one- and four—year spans calculated

in the Price Competitiveness book. It was found that in more than two-thirds of

the cases the difference between export and domestic price changes was 4½ percent-

age points or more, far from identical changes. The correlation between the two

price movements was also fairly low —— below .50 —- and it was low for each of the

four countries, each time period, and each SITC division included.

        For the U.S., we can draw on matched export and wholesale price indexes for

ten 4—digit SITC categories covering periods of 17 to 22 years ending in 1974.

They are based on NBER (Kravis and Lipsey) indexes up to 1964 and on published ELS

indexes for the subsecuent years. The index numbers were expressed as year to

year price relatives (the index for a given year being divided by the index for

the previous      year), and the   export price series and wholesale price series for

each    of    the ten 4-digit SITC categories were correlated in this form.

        The results are shown in Table     3.        The coefficients of determination do not

suggest identity between domestic and export price changes: 12 of the 16 are .75

or below. The ratio of the export price index to the wholesale price index strayed

over a 20 percent range or greater during the nine year period in over half the

                                                            and earlier when the rate of
inflation was lower, produces both lower
                                                     and a narrower range for the whole—
sale/export price index ratio. The highest
                                                       is .65 and 8 out of the 10 are
below .50. Five of the categories reveal a wholesale/export price
                                                                             range over 10
percent and one of 20 percent ormore.

        The conclusion we come to is that the prices of U.S. exports tend to move

like U.S. domestic prices but with considerable room for variation. In some

product categories the association is quite         close   but in others there are substan—
tial differences in time to time      movements.

                         Effects   of Exchange nate Changes
        Since export prices can and   do   move differently from domestic prices, the
question    arises whether changes in   exchange rates affect the export/wholesale
price   relationship.


Theory of   price discrimination
     The theory of the firm facing separated markets is well known.
                                                                    Let us assume
for simplicity that there are only two such markets and that there is an upward

sloping long-run marginal cost curve. Assume further that the original (pre—$
                                               —14—




devaluation) foreign demand curve (Dr') is more elastic than             the   domestic demand

curve (D0). The initial domestic price S P and the initial export price is

these prices correspond to the marginal revenue established by the intersection at

E of the marginal cost curve (LRMc) and the combined marginal revenue curve (T0).

(See   Figure 1.)     The U.S. dollar devaluation or depreciation) causes a rotatiOn

in the foreign demand curve         (to D)   and the foreign marginal revenue curve moves
from MR' to.MR. The aggregate marginal revenue curve shifts from T to
                                                                                         MRT1,
and the   effect is to change the equilibrium           intersection of the long—run marginal

cost curve and the total marginal revenue curve from E to E1. The resulting

prices are          arid       It can be proven that under our assumptions the dollar

export price changes by a greater degree than the dollar domestic price. If it is

further   assumed that     factor inputs are a function        of the exchange rate, then the
long-run   marginal cost curve shifts from LRMC            to LRMC1. The   resulting prices
are      and P. The depreciation of the U.S. dollar, in this case, decreases the

amount of optimal price discrimination between the domestic and export market.

       If we had assumed instead, that the foreign demand curve was less elastic

than the domestic demand curve, ceteris paribus, or if there had been an exchange

rate appreciation rather than an exchange rate depreciation, then the amount of

optimal price discrimination between the domestic and export market would have

increased.

       Still another possibility is that the oligopolist (or any seller facing a

sloping demand curve) keeps his foreign currency prices in each market unchanged

in order to maintain his market share. This policy carried out in the face of

exchange rate changes would        of course produce discriminato-ry pricing or, if
prices    in different markets were already different, it would produce changes in

the degree of discrimination.

where         is the log of the dollar export price relative, C is the constant,

fied ourselves that the more approximate matching of             export   and wholesale price
series that has been done here does not produce results that differ essentially

country among U.S. export destinations in 1973. In the regressions, account has

been taken of the lags between exchange rate changes and their impacts on prices

by   including not only the exchange rate for the current year relative    to the   pre-
vious year (R/Ri)        but   also the corresponding relatives for the two immediately

preceding years (Rt_i/R2 and Rt_2/Rt3). For convenience these variables are
shown in the tables as R,          and R_2, respectively.
        The   results of the regressions are set out in Table 4. The coefficients of
the R terms tend to be negative and the sum of the three  coefficients is invari-
ably negative. In all but agricultural machinery, the largest and most significant
negative coefficient is for R2. The sum of the R coefficients, the equivalent of
b1 in equation 1, may be interpreted as a discriminatjoncoeffjcjent. That is, it
showsthe change in export prices holding wholesale prices constant. Putting it
another way, in terms of Figure 1, the sum of the three R coefficients is equal
to the ratio of           to P/P0; that is, the ratio of the export price relative
              to the corresponding wholesale price relative. Given a 10 percent U.S.
dollar depreciation, for example, the equation for SITC 7 tells us that the U.S.
dollar export price will rise by 1.9 percent more than the      U.S. dollar wholesale

price   over a two to three year period. The association is negative because a
depreciation (decline in foreign currency units per dollar) is equivalent to an
upward shift in the foreign demand for U.S. goods (in terths of U.S. dollars) and will
cause the price discriminating exporter to raise his U.S. dollar export price relative
to his domestic price, while an appreciation will produce the opposite effect. In
the case of a depreciation, price discrimination in which lower prices are charged
exporters is apt to be reduced while in cases of appreciations price discrimination
may be increased as export prices are lowered still further below home price levels.

    Several reservations about these conclusions must be entered. One is

that the last few years of the period, 1971—74, saw different exchange rate

institutions and much greater variability of the exchange rate than those of the

earlier years. The relatives for the SDR/dollar rate since 1970 are as
           *
follows:

                           1971/70      99.7
                           1972/71      92.4
                           1973/72      91.1
                           .1974/73     99.1


The 8 or 9 percent changes in 1972/71 and 1973/72 contrast with very much smaller

changes in the opposite direction (2 or 3 percent appreciations at the outside)

in the average exchange rate of the-U.S. dollar against the currencies of main

trading partners for the period before 1971.

     The data thin   out   as we go back in time   to   pre-1971 years and there is but

limited opportunity to explore the stability of the relationships in Table 4.

For SITC 71, there were 170 pre—1971 observations. The equation is:


     (1.1) p = 2.8 + .5Q P
                    (8.6)  '
                             — .09 R — .02 R + .01 R
                                                                 2
                                                                        .

                                                                            2=
              (6.8)           (1.8)   (5)      (.2)



The equation is very similar to the SITC 71 equation in Table 4 except that it is

R.rather than R_1 or R2 that has the largest impact on export prices. Also, the

sum of the coefficients of R (ZR) is - .10, for the pre-1971 period, a smaller

negative number than the -.17 of the Table 4 equation.

 For SITC 72 only 36 observations are available for the period ending in 1970

and the results are less reliable.                 When SITC 71 and 72 observations are pooled,

ER becomes -.05, again smaller than the Table 4 results.**

    The different results found for the pre— and post-1971 data ar.e plausible

within the framework of search and information cost theory if it can be assumed

that exchange rate changes during the fixed regime period were more fully antici-

pated than exchange rate changes during the flexible regime. Given art exchange

rate change and thus a change in the foreign country's demand for U.S. exports

in terms of U.S. dollars, the oligopolist can be regarded as knowing only one
                                  ***
point on the new demand schedule.     The less anticipated the exchange rate

change, the longer and more costly the searcK. Thus, it would be expected that

the price response lags after the post-1971 exchange rate changes are longer than

the pre-1971 exchange rate changes. it is planned to investigate further these

differences between the pre— and post-1971 data with respect to the tiraing and

magnitude of the exchange rate effects using a quarterly lag structure.

        We conclude tentatively that the structural relationships that we have uncov-

 ered are valid both for the period before 1971 and for later .years although the

 sizes of the coefficients and the lag structures may differ.

        A second reservation is that results apply only to one export sector, albeit

 an important one; machinery accounted for about one—fourth of U.S. exports in 1974.

It is possible, however, that discriminatory pricing may characterize other impor-

tant export sectors as for example transport equipment and chemicals which accounted
for 15 percent and 9 percent of U.S. exports, respectively.*

Pass through coefficients

        A more technical limitation is that the equation we have fitted is open to

the charge of simultaneous equation bias because P, P, and R are all interdep—

•endent. One of the results of this interdeendency is that the coefficient of

the    exchange rate in equation 1 does not represent the extent of the pass through
of an exchange rate change.      Rather than reflecting the

full amount of the change in the dollar export price (and thus the

fore   ign currency export price) given an exchange rate change, the coefficient
represents    the change in the amount of price discrimination that is associated
with the exchange    rate change. That is, the coefficient of the exchange rate

represents    the change in the dollar export price     above any change in the dollar
wholesale    price which may be associated with    exchange rate change. To ensure
                                                  the

that the    coefficient on the exchange rate represents the extent of the pass through
rather than    the change in the amount of price discrimination that is associated

with an exchange rate change the procedure that is followed is outlined below.

        First we make the domestic price variable, P, a function of domestic cost

variables       and   the exchange rate:


        (2)   Pwp=C0 +a0 +a R+E
                            1  0

where         represents two domestic cost variables -—               unit   labor
                                        *
cost and unit         non—labor cost.           This enables us to form a wholesale price variable,

AP5,        that is independent of the exchange                rate variable:



               wp
                    -a 1   R=a0             0


Finally, by substituting AP5 into equation 1 (see page 16):


            (3)P5=C1+AP5
               X       WI)
                           + (b     ola +b)R+E      1            1


whereE =b E +E.
             1 00
        The resulting coefficient on R now gives the effect of b1 from regression 1 plus

the effect of a1 from regression 2 times the effect of b from regression 1. In

other words, the resulting coefficient tneasu.res, for a given exchange rate change,

the full change in the export price, including the extent of the change in the whole-

sale price plus the difference between the change in the export price and                 the change
in the domestic price (the extent of the discrimination caused by the exchange rate
         **
change).    Of course, the procedure does not fully capture all the simultaneity

involved; it ignores the influence of export prices in equation 2, but, especially

    for the U.S., this may             be a small source of bias relative to that affecting equation
    1.        (Equation 2 also ignores the possible effect of exchange rate changes on whole-

    sale prices via the cost of imported materials.)

               When   equation     2 is used as a regression equation, the coefficients of, the

 unit cost variables are highly significant and account for one—third to half of

    the variance in U.S. wholesale prices. The coefficients of the Rs, however, never

    achieve statistical significance, though they conform to expectations in that they

    are predominantly negative. (See Appendix Table 2.) A negative relationship

 between                  and   R, R1, and R_2 is expected both because an exchange rate change
    affects the total marginal revenue curve and because, if domestic goods have

    nported materials, an exchange rate change affects the long—run marginal cost

    curve (assur4ng that it is not horizontal).

               It should be noted that a regression based on the variables in equation 3

    differs from a regression based on equation 1 only in that the coefficients and

    t-statistics on the exchange rates differ. The                  2 and the coefficients and t—
    statistics on all other             variables   remain the same. The regressions involving

    AP are therefore identical with those in Table 4 except for the sums of coef—
         wp
    ficients of the P.s. A comparison of Tables 4 and 5 indicates that the negative

    size of the R's tends to be larger and the coefficients of the R's more signifi-

    cant when AP is used for the nonelectrical machinery categories but that the
               wp
    opposite is true for electrical machinery. The sum of the R's compare as follows:

     If the coefficients of the R's are negative in equations explaining
then the coefficients of the R's regressions using AP will be more negative

than the coefficients of the R's in Table 4. This condition is met in the equa—

tions for SITC 71 but not for SITC 72.

     The sums of the adjusted R coefficients (EAR) provide measures of the extent

to which foreign currency export prices fell short of matching the proportionate

change in the exchange rate, and thus tell us how the foreign currency pride of

U.S. exports changed as a result of the exchange rate change. For SITC 7 as a

whole,   for example, a 10 percent devaluation of the dollar (fall in the foreign
currency   price of the dollar) would result in a 2.0 percent increase in dollar ex-

port prices and an 8.0 percent decline in the foreign currency prices. The "pass

through"   ratios may thus be obtained by adding 1 to the EAR; the pass through
ratio was .80 for SITC 7,   .78   for SITC 71,   etc.


Additional independent variables
     Even with these adjustments, our equations can be criticized for omitting
some independent variables that may conceivably also have an influence on dollar
export prices. In Table 6, the equations in Table 5 are repeated with the addition
of two independent variables.
     One of the new variables, P,      is intended to   reflect the prices of U.S. com-

petitors for each 4- or 5-digit SITC category. In the absence of actual price data

the implicit deflators in own currency of 17 countries accounting for close to 100

percent of non—U.S. machinery exports were weighted according to the relative impor—
                                                              *
tance of their exports in each 4- or 5—digit category in 1973.   Of course U.S. export



 A destination weighted deflator was also used but it did not prove significant
 when added to equations containing P' perhaps becauc rivals were also destina-
 tions.

prices may be expected to be positively correlated with competitors' prices.

       Since a strong negative relationship between PC and the exchange rate is

weighted GDP in constant foreign currency prices.                          A relative rise in U.S. income

may be expected to raise U.S. domestic prices rather than US. export prices,

while a relative rise of foreign incomes may be expected to have the opposite

effects. The coefficient of DY should therefore be negative.

       The two new variables have coefficients that generally add significantly to

the explanation of U.S. export prices except in the case of electrical machinery.

(See Table 6.)

       A   comparison of       the   Rs in Table 6 with those of Table 5             indicate   that the
new variables do not radically alter the outcome with respect                        to the pass through

situation.        It remains true that exporters tend initially to                  pass through the full

effect     of   the change     in the exchange rate but subsequently change their prices
so that one-fourth to one-half of                  the   change in   the exchange   rate is offset by
a change in the         dollar   export price.

 An appreciation of the weighted average foreign currency price of the dollar (R),
 which is equivalent to a depreciation of the weighted average of the foreign cur-
 rencies, should cause the foreign currency export price of our competitors to
 decrease. In fact a strong negative relationship does exist.

     The sum   of   the pass-through coefficients in the right hand columns of Tables

5 and 6 (for 1953-74) is greater than the sum of the discrimination coefficients

in the right hand column of Table 4, as expected, for all SITC categories with

the exception of SITC 72. Thus, for example, the pass through for nonelectrical

machinery SITC 71 is 73 percent effective (Table 6) while the discrimination co—
                       *
efficient   is -.23.       This indicates that a 10 percent U.S. dollar depreciation

will cause the dollar export price io rise by 2.7 percent while the dollar whole-

sale price will rise 0.4 percent over a two to three year period (the difference

between the export and wholesale price indexes, 2.3 percent, is indicated by the

discrimination coefficient).

     For machinery as a whole a 10 percent U.S. dollar depreciation causes a 2.4

percent rise in the dollar export price. Since.the dollar wholesale price is

only minimally affected by the exchange rate change, the 10 percent U.S. dollar

depreciation causes a 2.4 percent differential between the home—currency domestic

and export price.



                                        Conclusion


     We have shown that the law of one price does not necessarily apply to traded

goods and that export prices and export price movements can be and frequently are

different from domestic prices and domestic price movements. In the irnoortant

machinery and equipment area competitors' prices and relative growth in GDP (U.S.

versus export destination countries) affect the U.S. export/domestic price relation-



 Eased on an equation containing the independent variables shown in Table 4 with
 the addition of P and DY as independent variables, thus making it comparable

ship, the former positively and the latter negatively.

       Finally exchange rate changes also have an influence, a dollar depreciation

tending to increase the export/domestic price ratio and an appreciation           having
the   opposite influence. Most of the equations indicate that U.S. exporters

initially   "pass   through"   the   full effect of the exchange rate changes to their

foreign customers. Since the dollar export          price is little affected by   the ex-

change rate change, a depreciation of the dollar is initia1l passed on in the

form of proportionately        lower export prices in terms of   foreign currency.

Exporters   gradually   adjust their export prices to conform to the optimal relation-

ship between home and foreign prices by raising dollar export prices. By the end

of two to three years, the sum of the R coefficients suggests, one-fourth to one—

half of a depreciation has been offset by dollar export price increases, and the

reamining three—quarters to one—half passed on to foreign purchasers in the form

of lower foreign currency prices of U.S. exports.
