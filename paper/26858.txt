Wandering Astray: Teenagers' Choices of Schooling and Crime

                                          ABSTRACT

We build and estimate a dynamic model of teenagers' choices of schooling and crime,
incorporating four factors that may contribute to the different routes taken by different teenagers:
heterogeneous endowments, unequal opportunities, uncertainties about one's own ability, and
contemporaneous shocks. We estimate the model using administrative panel data from Chile that
link school records with juvenile criminal records. Counterfactual policy experiments suggest
that, for teenagers with disadvantaged backgrounds, interventions that combine mild
improvement in their schooling opportunities with free tuition (by adding 22 USD per enrollee-
year to the existing voucher) would lead to an 11% decrease in the fraction of those ever arrested
by age 18 and a 17% increase in the fraction of those consistently enrolled throughout primary
and secondary education.

1         Introduction
Teenage years are a critical period in life, featuring major physical, psychological and at-
titudinal transitions. Faced with all these complications, some teenagers may experience a
particularly difficult transition and wander astray, dropping out of school and/or even en-
gaging in criminal activities. Juvenile delinquency is a serious problem in many countries.
For example, in the U.S., over 725,000 teenagers were in detention centers in 2011, 40% of
whom were black. Understanding why some teenagers wander astray is key to many social
policies.
        In this paper, we build and estimate a dynamic model of teenagers' decisions of schooling
and crime. We consider, in a coherent framework, four potentially important factors under-
lying different routes chosen by teenagers. The first factor is the heterogeneous endowments
received by teenage years: teenagers come from different family backgrounds, attend primary
schools of different quality, have different ability levels and different preferences.1
        The second factor consists of frictions that lead to unequal opportunities. First, schools
can select students based on their backgrounds. Such selection is prevalent, although it may
be less explicit in some countries than in others.2 Second, a teenager's payoff from school-
ing may depend directly on one's family background.3 Given these institutional frictions,
teenagers of the same caliber but from different backgrounds may make different choices,
which endogenously exacerbates the initial inequality.
        The third factor is the uncertainty faced by teenagers about themselves and their future
prospects, which relates to one of the defining features of adolescence known as "identity
development." In our model, a forward-looking teenager is uncertain about his own ability or
productivity at school, but has a belief about it. Given his belief, a teenager chooses, in each
period (if not in jail), whether or not to attend school and whether or not to participate in
crime and thereby face the risk of being arrested and punished. If choosing to attend school,
the teenager's test score is realized at the end of the period, which depends on one's school
    1
      Our model focuses on teenagers' decisions and takes the endowment by teenage years as pre-determined.
The word ability throughout this paper refers to one's ability pre-determined by one's innate ability and the
investment received by teenage years. See Heckman and Mosso (2014) for a comprehensive review of the
literature on early human development and social mobility.
    2
      For example, in many countries, the allocation of students to public schools often uses neighborhood-
based priority rules, which puts students in poor neighborhoods at a disadvantage.
    3
      For example, a high school degree may not provide low-family-income teenagers the same option value
of going to college as it does for teenagers with richer parents, if colleges are not affordable for the poor.



                                                      1
and family characteristics, one's ability and a test score shock. A teenager uses his realized
test score to update his belief about his ability, which will in turn affect his future decisions.
   The last factor is "luck," modeled as contemporaneous shocks that may affect one's
choices. Although contemporaneous, these shocks can have long-term impacts because of
the dynamic nature of one's choices, i.e., current choices may affect choice-specific payoffs
in the future. Moreover, the impact of "luck" can be particularly strong when it interacts
with other factors. For example, given uncertainties about oneself, bad test shocks can lower
a teenager's belief about his prospect of schooling and discourage him from following this
path. Bad test scores can also limit a teenager's choice set given institutional frictions such
as selective high school admissions.
   We apply our model to administrative data from Chile, which offer a great opportunity to
study the paths chosen by different teenagers. In particular, we have linked administrative
primary school and high school records of teenagers from the 34 largest Chilean municipalities
with their juvenile criminal records. The linked data sets provide information on these
teenagers' family backgrounds, school characteristics, annual academic records of enrollment
and performance, and annual criminal records of arrests and sentences. We estimate the
model via the maximum likelihood method to recover parameters governing the distribution
of preferences and learning abilities across teenagers from different backgrounds, the degree
of uncertainties they face, the outcome test score production function, and how primary-to-
secondary school transfer opportunities may vary with one's observable and unobservable
characteristics. The estimated model fits the data well.
   We use the estimated model to conduct a series of counterfactual policy interventions,
targeted at teenagers with disadvantaged family and primary school backgrounds, who are
more likely to wander astray. We find that policies that make schools free alone and policies
that improve schooling opportunities (primary school environment and primary-to-secondary
school transfer opportunities) alone have very limited impacts, especially the former. A
combination of these two types of measures would be three times as effective in keeping
the targeted teenagers on the right track as either type of measures alone. For example,
a free-tuition treatment combined with an improvement of schooling opportunities to the
mediocre level would increase the fraction of those consistently enrolled throughout primary
and secondary education from 68.76% to 80.43%, and reduce the fraction of those ever
arrested by age 18 from 5.24% to 4.69%. The policy requires adding only about 22 USD to


                                                2
the existing voucher per enrollee-year during high school and a relatively mild improvement in
schooling opportunities by enrolling a targeted teenager in a median-quality primary school
and giving him the same primary-to-secondary school transfer opportunities as faced by his
counterpart from middle family backgrounds. At a higher cost of 280 USD per enrollee-
year, enhancing the previous intervention with a guaranteed free seat in a mediocre private
high school would lead to another 7 percentage-point increase in the fraction of consistently-
enrolled teenagers and double the reduction in the fraction of ever-arrested teenagers.
       Recent studies have investigated a wide range of potential factors that may affect crim-
inal activities. Levitt and Lochner (2000) examine biological, social, criminal justice, and
economic determinants of crimes. Factors that have been examined in more detail include
the effect of police, incarceration and conditions in prison (Levitt 1996, 1997, 1998; Katz et
al. 2003; and Di Tella and Schargrodsky 2004), social capital, social interactions and peer
effects (Case and Katz 1991; Glaeser et al. 1996; Gaviria and Raphael 2001; Jacob and
Lefgren 2003; Kling et al. 2005; and Sickles and Williams 2008), and family circumstances
and structure (Glaeser and Sacerdote 1999; Donohue and Levitt 2001).
       A strand of this literature has focused on the relationship between schooling and crime.
For example, Lochner and Moretti (2004) find that school attainment significantly reduces
participation in criminal activity. Freeman (1996) and Lochner (2004) both study the inca-
pacitation effect of schooling and emphasize that education increases opportunity costs of
crime.4 Lochner (2010) explores the direct effect of education on crime reduction via social
and emotional development. Other studies have explored the extensions of the mandatory
schooling age or the cutoff birth date for enrollment to study the effect of education on crime
(Machin et al. 2011; Clay et al. 2012; Anderson 2014; Hjalmarsson et al. 2015; and Cook
and Kang 2016).
       Another focus has been on the persistence of youth crime.5 For example, Nagin and
Paternoster (1991), Nagin and Land (1993), Nagin et al. (1995), and Broidy et al. (2003)
find that both unobserved individual types and state dependence (prior criminal behavior)
are important. Merlo and Wolpin (2009), via a VAR approach, find important roles for het-
   4
     Jacob and Lefgren (2003) find that youth property crime rates are significantly lower but youth violent
crime rates are higher on days when school is in session than on days when it is not. Hjalmarsson (2008)
and Cort´ es et al. (2020) find that arrest and incarceration prior to age 16 reduces the probability of high
school graduation.
   5

and Herrnstein (1985) for examples in criminology.

erogeneity in initial conditions and stochastic events in one's youth in determining outcomes
as young adults. Mancino et al. (2015) find small effects of experience (the accumulation of
education and crime) and stronger evidence of state dependence.
        Most studies in economics on crime follow the framework of Becker (1968), where indi-
viduals make rational choices.6 For example, in a closely related paper, Imai and Krishna
(2004) estimate a dynamic model and find that the effect of forward-looking behavior is large
in explaining youth criminal decisions.7 Following this literature, our paper maintains the
assumption of forward-looking and rationality. However, we introduce information friction
into the classical framework and allow for the possibility that teenagers may be ill-informed
about their own abilities. In this aspect, our work is related to the literature that empha-
sizes uncertainties about own ability in one's college choices (Altonji 1993, Arcidiacono 2004,
Cunha et al. 2005, Stange 2012, Bordon and Fu 2015, and Arcidacono et al. 2016). It is
likely that uncertainties about own ability also play an important role at a younger age,
which we consider in this paper.



2         Background

2.1        Teenage Crime in Chile
As is true in many other countries, teenage crime is a serious social issue in Chile. For
example, in 2013, the number of arrests per 100 teens was 2.93 in Chile, as compared to 3
in the U.S. in 2014.8 In 2007, the Chilean Parliament passed the new Adolescent Criminal
Responsibility Law, which established a system of responsibility for adolescents between age
14 and age 18 who violate the law.9 Offenders aged between 14 and 16 may be sentenced
to up to 5 years and those older than 16 up to 10 years in closed or semi-closed detention
centers, where they must take part in social reinsertion programs. Other penalties provided
in the law include parole, community service and making reparations for damages caused.
    6
     Some studies have questioned the assumption of rationality and forward-looking. For example, Wilson
and Herrnstein (1985), Katz et al. (2003) and Lee and McCrary (2005) suggest that potential offenders
may have very high discount rates or be myopic. On the other hand, consistent with individuals being
forward-looking, Levitt (1998) shows that arrests decline faster after age 18 in states where punishments are
relatively mild for juveniles than for adults than states where juvenile punishments are relatively harsh.

focus on different punishments for youths than for adults.

Between 2007 and 2014, the average number of teens prosecuted under this law was about
20, 160 per year, of whom 83% were male. Given the rare incidence of crime committed by
girls, our study focuses on boys only.


2.2     Primary and Secondary Education in Chile
In 1980, the Chilean government introduced a major reform of its education system, one
component of which was the introduction of vouchers such that schools were funded with
a flat voucher per attendee.10 , 11 Both public and private schools can receive vouchers from
the government. Since 1994, private schools have been allowed to charge additional fees
up to a cap while still being eligible to receive government vouchers, subject to progressive
crowd-outs.12 Partly because of the tuition cap, some private schools opted out of the
voucher system. As a result, there are three types of schools: municipal (public), private
with voucher (voucher-private), and private without voucher (non-voucher-private). Non-
voucher-private schools usually charge much higher tuition and serve students from "elite"
family backgrounds. In 2014, 54.2% of the schools were public, 41% were voucher-private,
and 4.8% were non-voucher-private. Of all students between Grade 1 and Grade 12, 39.1%
were enrolled in public schools, 53.2% in voucher-private schools, and 7.7% in non-voucher-
private schools.13 We focus on students enrolled in public and voucher-private schools.
    Primary education lasts from Grade 1 to Grade 8; secondary education from Grade 9
to Grade 12. Progression from one grade to the other is not guaranteed: the Ministry of
Education provides guidelines for grade retention, where a student is to be retained if his
GPA or attendance falls below certain cutoffs. These rules are not always respected and
schools have certain flexibility in implementing them (D´
                                                        iaz et al. 2018).
    Among all public schools, 9.9% offer both primary and secondary education, 80.6% offer
only primary education and 9.5% offer only secondary education. These figures are 38.5%,
  10
     In 2008, a targeted voucher system was introduced to transfer more resources toward schools catering
the poorest 40% of the population; students in our sample period were not affected by this new policy.
  11
     The other major components of the reform were 1) decentralizing public schools from the central gov-
ernment to municipalities, 2) making teachers' contracts more flexible. For a summary of these reforms, see
Gauri (1999), and Mizala and Romaguera (2000).
  12
     In 2014, the cap was 84, 232 pesos (about $110) per month (there are 10 academic months in Chile).
Attendance fees crowd out government vouchers progressively, where the crowd-out rates are 0 for the first
0.5USE (1USE is about $30), 10% for the part between 0.5USE and 1USE, 20% for the part between 1USE
and 2USE, and 35% for the part above 2USE.
  13
     The fact that public schools (54% of all schools) cater only 39% of students is mostly driven by the fact
that public schools are over-represented in rural areas, where schools are smaller.


                                                      5
48.5% and 13% among voucher-private schools. Therefore, most students have to change
schools between primary and secondary education. During our sample period, school ad-
missions were decentralized and conducted by individual schools. Good schools could be
very selective, which selected students not only on primary school GPAs but may also on
family backgrounds.14 The selective admission procedure, together with the differential fees,
contributed to the segregation of students of different socioeconomic statuses (SES) across
schools. An OECD review noted that "social segmentation has deepened such that increas-
ingly, students from the same or similar socioeconomic backgrounds are schooled together."15
       In 1988, the Chilean government introduced a system of national standardized tests
(SIMCE) as a way to measure student learning process and school performance, in which
all students in proper grades participate.16 The government uses SIMCE results to allocate
resources and to inform the public about the quality of schools by listing school-level results
in major newspapers. However, individual test results are not released to students or schools.
We obtained individual test results, which we use to standardize GPA's across schools and
to facilitate identification.



3        Model
We model a teenager's dynamic choices of schooling and crime, who is faced with institutional
frictions and uncertainties, including the uncertainty over his own ability.


3.1       Primitives
Across L locations, there are in total K primary schools and K  high schools, characterized
by Wk .17 A teenager i is endowed with a vector of family background Xi (including home
location li ), a primary school ki0 , a type i  {1, 2} and ability ai . A teenager knows his
  14
     Many schools, especially non-public schools, required parents to report their income and present their
marriage certificates; some schools even conduct parental interviews. See Contreras et. al. (2010) for an
analysis of the selection process. In 2015, the Chilean Parliament passed a law to centralize the admission
procedure for all public and voucher-private schools, which eliminated selection based on family background.
This was gradually implemented from 2016.

on the relationship between the education market and the SES segregation in Chile, see Valenzuela et. al.
(2013).
  16
     See Meckes and Carrasco (2010) for details.
  17
     Schools are either public or voucher-private. If both levels of education is offered in the same school, the
school is counted both as a primary school and as a high school.

                                                       6
type i but not his ability ai . He has an initial belief about ai and updates his belief over
time as new information comes in. The researcher does not observe i or ai , which may be
correlated with (Xi , Wki0 ).
       Given the fact that all individuals in our sample were consistently enrolled between
Grades 1 and 4 and that no one had criminal records before age 10, we start the model at
age 10 with the initial schooling Gi0 = 4 for every i. In each period t = 1, ..., T (corresponding
to age 10 to age 18), except when he is in jail, a teenager decides whether or not to enroll
in school (eit ) and whether or not to participate in criminal activities (dit ): (eit , dit ) 
{(0, 0) , (0, 1) , (1, 0), (1, 1)}.


3.1.1      GPA and Grade Progression

One's academic achievement is measured by one's completed grade level (Git ) and standard-
ized grade point average (GP Ait ) .18 GP Ait is a stochastic function of family characteristics
Xi , school characteristics Wkit , whether or not one is repeating the current grade and ability
ai , where ai enters with a normalized coefficient of 1, such that


                       GP Ait = 0Git + Xi 1 + Wkit 2 + 3 (1 - git ) + ai + gpa
                                                                           it                            (1)
                                 GP Ait + ai + gpa
                                               it .



Git is i's grade level at time t, and 0Git is a grade-specific constant. git = 1 if i successfully
progressed to the current grade from the last period, so 3 is the effect of repeating a grade.
gpa
it  is an i.i.d. shock drawn from N (0, 2
                                         gpa ) . A student cannot separately observe ai and


gpa                                                gpa 19
it . Let GP Ait denote the part of GPA net of ai + it .

       We model grade progression as a stochastic function of school characteristics, GP Ait and
one's type, such that the probability that a student progresses to the next grade in t + 1 is
given by
                                      Pr (git+1 = 1|Wkit , GP Ait , i ) .                                (2)

We allow one's type to enter the progression function in order to account for factors known
  18
     Throughout this paper, GPA refers to standardized GPA that is comparable across schools. The stan-
dardization is done by comparing the school-specific GPA's with the standardized SIMCE tests in 4th (10th)
grade for primary (secondary) schools.
  19
     Given our focus on learning and uncertainties, we choose the specification (1), following the literature
on learning (e.g., Arcidiacono (2004)), which differs from the value-added specification.

to the teenager but not to the researcher that may affect grade progression. Moreover, grade
progression is uncertain even from the teenager's point of view, due to unpredictable shocks
and the fact that schools have some flexibility in implementing grade retention guidelines.20


3.1.2      Beliefs

The teenager does not know his ability ai , but he has the rational initial belief that it is
                                                2
drawn from a type-specific distribution N (ai , a ) and uses his GPA information to update
his belief. Let (EAit , V Ait ) be i's updated beliefs about the mean and the variance of his
ability at the end of period t, given by
(EAit , V Ait ) =
       
        (EAit-1 , V Ait-1 ) if GP Ait is not available,
                      2                                             2 V A                             (3)
        EAit-1 2 gpa           + GP Ait - GP Ait 2gpa   V Ait-1
                                                                  , gpa it-1         otherwise.
                  gpa +V Ait-1
                                                        
                                                          +V Ait-1 2gpa +V Ait-1
                                                                      



When GP Ait is not available (e.g., if eit = 0), one's belief keeps unchanged. Otherwise, beliefs
are updated following the Bayes rule. The speed at which one updates his belief is governed
by the relative magnitude of gpa versus a , i.e., the dispersion of GPA shocks versus that of
the ability distribution. Notice that because of the randomness in GPA realizations, ex ante
identical teenagers may have different beliefs about themselves and act on them to choose
different routes.

Remark 1 We introduce uncertainty and learning for two reasons. First, identity develop-
ment is one of the defining features of adolescence. Arguably, learning about one's schooling
ability is an important component of identity development.21 Second, as we will show later,
our data exhibit patterns that are consistent with learning: a student is less likely to be
enrolled if he has received negative signals about his ability.
  20
      We assume that grade progression does not depend on one's ability conditional on GPA and type, hence
it does not provide further information about one's ability. It would be much more complicated to update
beliefs based on both the continuous GPA outcome and the binary grade progression outcome, yet without
adding much insight to the model.
   21
      An ideal model would also allow the teenager to learn about his ability in criminal activities. How-
ever, such a model is not identifiable with our data: although aggregate crimes (caught and uncaught) are
observable, at the individual level, neither uncaught crimes nor returns to crime are observable.

3.1.3     Transition to High School

Between Grades 8 and 9, a transition happens between primary school and high school. Let
the probability that i can transit to school k  be ptr
                                                    k  i , with          k   ptr
                                                                              k  i = 1. That is, a student

can always get a seat in the high school system. Yet, whether or not one will attend high
school is his choice. We model ptr
                                k  i as dependent on Xi , i , one's GPA, the characteristics of

one's primary school Wki0 and the destination school Wk, such that


                                ptr      tr
                                 k  i = P (Xi , i , GP Ai , Wki0 , Wk  ) .                            (4)


The direct effect of Xi and GP Ai on ptr reflect the fact that schools can select based on
family background and GPA. To allow for non-random matching based on unobservables,
we introduce i into P tr (·). One's primary school affects ptr via two channels. First, it
affects ptr indirectly via its effect on academic achievement (GP Ai ) . Second, it can also
affect the transition directly via Wki0 and the interaction between Wki0 and Wk . For example,
transition to higher-quality high schools may be easier if the quality of one's primary school
is also high.22 Through either effect, inequality at the primary school stage will lead to
further inequality at the high school stage.

Remark 2 Without data on the application and admission process, we model the transition
to high school in a reduced form way, which is a limitation. In our effort to address some
of the selection issues in this process, we include unobserved individual characteristics (i )
among other variables in the stochastic transition function, and we estimate this transition
process within the model.


3.1.4     Timing

For each t = 1, .., T , the within-period (a year) timing of events is as follows:

                                         ed
   1. Choice-specific payoff shocks it = it              ed
                                                              are realized, which are i.i.d. Type-1
        extreme-value distributed.

   2. A teenager chooses (eit , dit )  {(0, 0) , (0, 1) , (1, 0), (1, 1))} .
  22
    If a school offers both primary and secondary education, the probability that a student continues his
education in the same school would be high because Wk0 and Wk are almost identical in that case.



                                                     9
   3. If eit = 1, one's GP Ait and grade progression (git+1 ) are realized. One's belief about
         ai is updated.
         If dit = 1, one's arrest/non-arrest result is realized. If arrested, a jail sentence (it  0)
         is prescribed, following a stochastic function of one's age and criminal record.


3.1.5      State Variables

The vector of state variables it contains the following:

   1. Permanent variables: i , Xi .23

   2. Dynamic variables: EAit-1 , V Ait-1 , Jit-1 , Git-1 , eit-1 , git , kit .

          (a) EAit-1 , V Ait-1 : i's belief about his ability, evolving according to (3).

          (b) Jit-1 = [Jit-1,1 , Jit-1,2 ] . Jit-1,1 : the total number of past arrests. Jit-1,2 : the total
              length of sentences received in the past.

          (c) Git-1 : the highest grade completed.

          (d) git : whether or not one progressed one grade between t - 1 and t.

          (e) eit-1 : whether or not one was enrolled last period.

          (f) kit : the ID of the one's most recent school, which is ki0 if Git-1 < 9 and the ID of
              one's high school if Git-1  9.24

                                                         ed
   3. Transitory shocks to choice-specific payoffs: it = it               ed


       The evolution from it to it+1 is stochastic, because it depends on not only one's choices
(eit , dit ) but also a vector it of factors realized at the end of t. The vector it consists of
1) GP Ait (if eit = 1), which affects belief updating (EAit , V Ait ); 2) the grade progression
shock (if eit = 1), which, together with GP Ait , affects git+1 and Git ; 3) the realization of
arrest and sentencing outcomes (if dit = 1), which affect Jit . To save on notation, we will
write it+1 instead of (it+1 |it , eit , dit , it ).
  23
     Notice that ai , being unknown to the teenager, is not a state variable. Instead, one's beliefs about ai ,
captured by (EAit-1 , V Ait-1 ) , are dynamic state variables.
  24
     Within primary school or high school stage, school transfers are rare. We assume that transfers only
happen between the two stages. If a student transferred schools between Grades 5 and 8 (Grades 9 and 12),
we use the first primary school (high school) as his school.



                                                      10
The state space is large because the dynamic beliefs (EAit-1 , V Ait-1 ) are continuous vari-
ables. We solve the model via backward induction with Monte Carlo integration and inter-
polation (Keane and Wolpin 1994).


3.2     Teenager's Problem
At t  T , unless he is in jail and hence unable to make choices, a teenager's problem is


                            Vt (it ) =                max                  Vted (it ) ,
                                         (e,d){(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1))}


where Vted (·) denotes the choice-specific value function. We specify Vted (·) for regular cases
first, and then for the case of the last grade of primary education, where, if one chooses
eit = 1, he may face the transition to secondary education at the end of the period.


3.2.1   Value Functions: Regular Cases

e = 0, d = 0 :
                                  Vt00 (it ) = it
                                               00
                                                  + E Vt+1 (it+1 ) ,                                    (5)

where the expected period payoff for being inactive in both activities is normalized to 0 and
00
it is the payoff shock. The expectation for the next period is taken over the payoff shocks
 ed
 it+1 .



e = 1, d = 0 : One's utility from attending school depends on his GPA, characteristics Xi ,
type i , school characteristics Wkit , whether or not he is also participating in crime dit ,
whether or not he is repeating a grade (1 - git ), and whether or not he has a criminal
record, given by
                               U sch (GP Ait , Xi , i , Wkit , dit , git , Jit-1 ) .

Let Fit (z ) and Eit (z ) be the CDF and the expected value of some variable z , viewed by
teenager i at the beginning of t, given his belief (EAit-1 , V Ait-1 ) . The value of choosing
(1, 0) is given by

                          U sch (·) +      git+1 =0   Pr (git+1 |·) E Vt+1 (it+1 ) dFit (GP Ait )


                                                        11
The parameter , if positive, captures inertia effects or psychic costs for a non-enrollee to
return to school. At the beginning of period t, one has to form expectation about his outcome
GP Ait (hence the integral over Fit (GP Ait )), which affects U sch (·) and the probability that
he will proceed to the next grade Pr (git+1 = 1|Wkit , GP Ait , i ).


e = 0, d = 1 :
                                                                                                
                                 01

If one engages in criminal activities (d = 1) , he receives a type-specific utility for criminal
activities (ri ) . With a location-specific probability (1 - li ), one is not arrested, in which
case he enjoys a payoff R (li , Xi ) that varies across locations and Xi , and proceeds to the
next period without additional criminal record. With probability li , one is arrested and
serves a jail time (  0) drawn from a distribution that shifts with one's criminal record
(Jit-1 ) and age (t) . In this case, he receives the utility of being arrested, which may differ
depending on one's criminal history.25 While in jail, one is not allowed to make decisions
until t +  + 1 when one is out of jail and proceeds with an updated criminal record.26


e = 1, d = 1 :

When engaging in both activities, one enjoys the expected contemporaneous utility from
both (Line 1 of (7)). If not arrested, one enjoys the criminal payoff R (·), observes git+1 , and
continues to t + 1 with updated beliefs (Line 2). The last line of (7) describes the case when
one gets arrested.
  25
     In an alternative specification, we allow the in-jail utility to depend not only on Jt-1 , but also on jail
time  . The added parameter is estimated to be close to zero, we therefore choose the simpler specification.
  26
     The sentence  may not be an integer (year), in which case, we round  to count the length of inaction
periods, but the criminal record Jit is updated precisely.

3.2.2    Value Functions: the Last Grade of Primary Education

When the state variables are such that Git-1 = 7 and git = 1, the teenager is allowed
to progress to Grade 8. In this case, the value functions Vt10 (·) and Vt11 (·) need to be
modified: at the end of t, if one can proceed to the next grade (git+1 = 1), a student will
face the primary-secondary school transition, which involves an additional layer of expec-
tation over the opportunities to transfer to different high schools. In particular, Vt10 (·)
and Vt11 (·) in this special period differ from the regular value functions in that, the term
  1
  git+1 =0   Pr (git+1 |·) E Vt+1 (it+1 ) in value functions (6) and (7) is replaced by

                                                                                                    
             Pr (git+1 = 0|·) E Vt+1 (it+1 ) + Pr (git+1 = 1|·)               ptr
                                                                               k  i E Vt+1 it+1 , k  ,
                                                                          k


where it+1 is the vector of state variables excluding the school ID.


3.2.3    Terminal Value

The terminal value function is given by


                                   VT +1 (Xi , i , GiT , JiT , EiT (ai ) , WkiT ) ,                        (8)


which depends on the teenager's characteristics (Xi , i ), outcomes by time T (grade level GiT
and criminal records JiT ), his up-to-date belief about his own ability and the characteristics
of the school he was last enrolled in.

   Table 1 shows the information structure of the teenager's endowment. Besides Xi and
one's primary school ID ki0 , both the researcher and the teenager also observe the teenager's
GPA {GP Ait }0
             t=-3 from Grade 1 to Grade 4, before the model starts. Neither the teenager

nor the researcher observes ai . The teenager knows his i , which is not known to the re-
searcher. However, as mentioned in Section 2.2, the Grade-4 SIMCE score si is observed by

                                                         13
the researcher but not by the teenager. We make further empirical specifications as follows.

Beliefs (EAi0 , V Ai0 ) : By t = 1, the teenager's should have already used {GP Ait }0
                                                                                     t=-3 to

update his initial belief. Therefore, we model (EAi0 , V Ai0 ) as the Bayes output starting
                 2
from ai  N (ai , a ) and updated with {GP Ait }0
                                               t=-3 following (3).

The unobservable (i , ai ) may be correlated with the observables and follow the distribu-
tion

                                                                           ai - ai
                            f (i , ai |Xi , Wki0 ) = Pr (i |Xi , Wki0 )                ,                (9)
                                                                              a
                   with Pr (i = 1|Xi , Wki0 ) =  (Xi , Wki0 ) .


We assume that one's type is drawn from a Type-1 extreme value distribution, which may
shift with both Xi and Wki0 . The latter is introduced to capture potential non-random
matching between students and primary schools. The second component in (9) follows the
                            2
assumption that ai  N (ai , a ).
Score si is modeled as being governed by


                                 si = 0 + Xi 1 + Wki0 2 + 1 ai + i ,                                   (10)

              2
where i  N 0,   is a random noise. Equations (1) and (10) share the same 1 and 2 ,
i.e., the effects of family and school characteristics on GPA and on SIMCE are assumed to
the same, which will be useful for identification.27



4      Estimation and Identification
We assume that the sentencing length  is drawn from an ordered probit distribution that
may shift with one's age and criminal records (arrests and jail time), and estimate this
distribution outside of the model (details are in the appendix). We also pre-set the annual
discount factor  at 0.9.28 We estimate all the other model parameters using the maximum
  27
     As long as there are no new parameters associated with X and W in the production of s, the information
on s will greatly facilitate identification of the GPA production function (e.g., we could have assumed that
si = 0 + 1 ai + i ). We choose to use Equation (10) because SIMCE is taken at Grade 4 and hence may
have been affected by one's school quality.
  28
     The monthly discount factor is estimated to be 0.99 in Imai and Krishna (2004).

likelihood method. The vector  to be estimated includes parameters governing preferences,
the production of GPA and SIMCE, grade progression, the distribution of type and ability,
and primary-to-secondary school transition probabilities. Teenager i's contribution to the
likelihood is the sum of his type-specific likelihood, weighted by his type probabilities, i.e.,

                                         2
                             Li () =          Pr (i = m|Xi , Wki0 ; ) Lim () ,
                                       m=1


where Lim is the likelihood conditional on i being type m (see the appendix for details). The
                                             N
overall log likelihood is £ () =             i=1   ln Li () .


4.1       Identification
Our discussion of identification focuses on the complications arising from the two major
components in our model that are absent in a bare-bone dynamic discrete choice model:
unobserved types and learning about one's own ability.


4.1.1      The GPA Production Function

The identification of the GPA production function (1) involves two complications: C1: GPA
is observed conditional on enrollment, a classical selection problem; and C2: the unobservable
ai is correlated with observable inputs in the production of GPA via one's type i .
      Without C2, the researcher would have all the information the teenager has about ai , and
hence would know his beliefs. In this case, the GPA production function would be identified
since C1 can be dealt with given that the enrollment decision is based on beliefs about ai
rather than ai directly. In particular, without C2, Eit (ai ) , which is a weighted sum of all
the past GPAs, can serve as a control function in GPA production.29
      With C2, Eit (ai ) contains information known to the teenager through his type; and the
control function approach becomes insufficient. However, the identification is facilitated by
the additional information of one's Grade 1 to Grade 4 GPAs and si , which we observe for
all teenagers since all of them were enrolled during those years. In particular,

Given that si is observed by the researcher, the second row in Equation (11) implies that we
can identify 1 , 1 , 2 and 3 , as long as 1 = 1.30 The constants {0Gt } and 0 are not all
identified, we therefore normalize 0Gt in one grade to 0.


4.1.2       Type Distribution

One major source for identifying the distribution of unobserved types is one's academic
outcomes. First, since ability distributions are type-specific, conditional on (X, Wk ) , the
distributions of ability measures (s and GPAs) will shift as the ability distribution shifts
with one's type, exhibiting different modes. Given the assumption that type-specific ability
distributions and the mean-zero score noise distributions are all uni-modal and symmetric,
the observed modes as well as the distribution of (X, Wk ) surrounding each mode are infor-
mative about type-specific mean ability a and the correlation between type and (X, Wk ).
Second, conditional on (X, Wk ) , cross-individual dispersion of test scores arise from both
their differential ability and test score noises. Using within-individual comparison of multi-
ple measures of his ability (s and GPAs), we learn about the dispersion of test score noises.
A comparison of cross-individual and within-individual test score dispersions informs us of
the dispersion of abilities. The two dispersions are key parameters governing the speed of
learning, as in (3) . Third, like ability distribution, the probability of being retained also
varies with types. As such, some students will be retained more often than others with the
same GPA and school type, which gives information about their types.
       As in all dynamic-choice models, another major source of information is one's choices
  30
       Our estimated 1 is 0.95.



                                                  16
over time. Relative to dynamic models without criminal behaviors, our model is subject to
one additional identification complication: except for studies that use survey data with self-
reported criminal activities, uncaught crimes are unobservable at the individual level. This
data limitation makes a model with criminal choices non-identifiable if arrest rates are allowed
to differ across individuals and/or to change with one's criminal experience. As such, we
have to follow the crime literature and impose the strong assumption that individuals within
the same municipality l face the same arrest rate l , which is calculated using aggregate
crimes and arrests. With this assumption, individual-level data on (non)arrests gives direct
information on the probability that one is involved in crime. As such, the joint distribution
of dynamic choices and characteristics (e, d, X, W ) becomes available, as is the case in other
dynamic models, and hence the usual identification argument applies.



5     Data
Our data cover a cohort of teenagers from the 34 largest Chilean municipalities, whom we
follow from the year they entered primary schools (2002) until 2014. These 34 municipalities
include all the big cities in Chile, accommodating about 50% of the Chilean population. Of
all juvenile crimes recorded annually in Chile, over 60% occur in these 34 municipalities. Each
of these 34 municipalities is treated as a location l in our model. We construct our sample
by linking four data sets at the individual level and one at the school level, supplemented
with aggregate information at the municipality level.
    Three of our data sets are administrative records from the Ministry of Education of
Chile. The first data set contains each student's Grade 1 to Grade 12 annual records of
attendance, GPA, and grade retention, as well as the ID of one's school and some basic
demographic information (e.g., gender). The second data set contains individual-level records
of standardized test (SIMCE) scores in Grade 4 and Grade 10. One's Grade 4 SIMCE
score is used as si in our model, i.e., the noisy measure of one's ability that is observed
by the researcher but not the teenager. We also use Grade 4 (Grade 10) SIMCE scores to
standardize student GPAs for primary schools (high schools). The standardized individual
GPAs are then used as GP Ait in our model. The third data set is at the school level, which
provides information on school characteristics, including tuition and fees.
    The fourth data set is from the Defensoria Penal Publica (DPP), which contains ad-


                                              17
ministrative criminal records of almost all arrested youths between 2006 and 2014.31 For
each arrest, we observe the time of the accusation and the sentence received. We merge
the schooling records and the criminal records by individual ID. Focusing on those whose
primary schools were either public or voucher-private, we obtain a sample of 47,665 teenage
boys.32
       We supplement administrative data with rich information on these teenagers' family
backgrounds, coming from a survey conducted on parents at the time of the SIMCE tests.
Of the 47,665 teenagers in our sample, the parents of 45,130 teenagers filled out the survey.
Excluding observations missing critical information, such as parental education and family
income, our final sample contains 34,784 teenage boys, whose trajectories between age 10
and age 18 are the focus of our study.
       For municipality characteristics, we obtain information on the average household income
from the National Socio-Economic Characterization Survey (CASEN), and information on
aggregate crime rates and arrest rates from the Ministry of the Interior and Public Security.


5.1       Summary Statistics
The upper panel of Table 2 shows school-level statistics for each of the two types of primary
schools (cross-school standard deviations within each type are in parentheses). Relative to
voucher-private schools, public schools have lower average student test scores.33 Throughout
the paper, tuition refers to the out-of-pocket cost for households, i.e., the sum of tuition
and fees net of vouchers that schools receive directly from the government. Public schools
are basically free, with an average annual tuition of 600 pesos, but the average tuition is
over 105,800 pesos in voucher-private schools.34 Based on the school-level social economic
status (SES) classification by the Ministry of Education, most public schools are low-SES
and only 5% are high-SES; in contrast, only 19% of voucher-private schools are low-SES and
44% are high-SES.35 The lower panel of Table 2 shows student characteristics by the type of
their primary schools. The difference in family backgrounds is clear between the two groups:
  31
     Fewer than 2% of cases were handled by private attorneys, on which we do not have information.
  32
     We focus on boys because of the rare incidence of female crimes. Boys account for about 53.6% of the
sample.
  33
     Within-school average scores are taken over all students, including girls and boys.
  34
     1,000 Chilean pesos are about 1.3 USD.
  35
     The classification by the Ministry is based on a composite score, where each component measures a
certain aspect of the distribution of enrollees' family backgrounds.


                                                   18
those attending voucher-private primary schools have much higher family income and better
educated parents.36

       Panel A of Table 3 shows outcomes among teenagers grouped by their parental education,
and by the quality of their primary schools as proxied by the school-level average SIMCE
scores. There is a clear correlation between teenagers' enrollment/arrest status and academic
performance with their backgrounds. For example, the fraction of teenagers ever arrested by
age 18 is 1.3% among those with highly-educated parents, versus 5.6% among those whose
parents have low education. Panel B shows outcomes over time, where with normal grade
progression, t = 1 to 4 corresponds to the age when one should be enrolled in Grade 5 to
8, and t = 5 to 8 corresponds to high-school age. Both non-enrollment and arrests are low
frequency events, but grow over time. In particular, arrests happen almost only in high
school age.



  36
    For parental education, we use the mother's education whenever possible, if the mother is not present,
we use the father's education. Parental education is defined as high for those with some college education
or more, as low for those without any secondary education, as middle otherwise.

    Relative to the standard Becker (1968) framework, one additional feature of our model is
information friction, which is partly motivated by findings from the following exercise. First,
we regress GP Ait on individual dummies (di1 ) and grade dummies (dGit ):


                                     GP Ait = di1 + dGit + it .                                            (13)


Net of individual heterogeneity and grade-specific factors, the residual from this regression
(it ) arguably captures the deviation of one's GPA's from the expected level. Then, we
regress enrollment status (eit ) on individual dummies (di2 ) and the lagged GPA residuals
{it }t <t .
                                 eit = di2 +            bn it-n + it ,                                     (14)
                                                  n>0

where it is an error term. Table 4 shows the results from (14), in three specifications
with increasing numbers of lagged GPA residuals. Without excluding other explanations,
the positive and significant coefficients on residual scores are consistent with information
friction and learning: better GPA shocks in the past improve one's belief about his prospect
of schooling and hence increase his enrollment probabilities.

parameters governing the (standardized) GPA production function, where one's unobservable
ability (ai ) enters with a normalized coefficient of 1. GPA increases with parental education,
family income, and enrollment in pre-schools, decreases with welfare enrollment status and
grade retention from the previous year.38 Individual GPA also increases with school quality
as measured by school average SIMCE scores.
       Panel B of Table 5 shows the distribution of ability. The mean ability among Type
1 individuals is much higher than that among Type 2 individuals. Panel C shows that
compared to Type 1 individuals enrolled in the same type of schools, Type 2 individuals are
slightly more likely to progress to the next grade if they achieve the same GPA.
       Panel A of Table 6 shows teenagers' in-school utility parameters. A teenager does care
about his performance in school: schools are more enjoyable if one obtains a higher GPA,
although insignificantly so; moreover, schooling utility drops significantly if one has a low
GPA (below the 25th percentile) and/or one is repeating a grade. Everything else being
equal, Type 2 individuals, who have lower ability on average, enjoy schools slightly more
than their Type 1 counterpart. That is, if Type 2's enjoy schools less, it is due to their
lower ability and hence poorer GPA, rather than pure tastes. The same tuition imposes
a larger burden on the lowest-income group, relative to the other income groups. We also
find that private schools, high-SES schools and higher-quality schools are more enjoyable to
attend.39 The bottom part of Panel A shows that past activities can directly affect one's
current choice: schools become less enjoyable if one has a criminal record, and returning to
school is costly if one was not enrolled in the previous period. This is one of channels via
which a temporary bad shock that led one off the track in the past can leave persistent effect.

   We have estimated other versions with finer categories of school SES and SIMCE scores, which do not
improve upon the more parsimonious specification reported in Table 6 .

       Panel B shows that Type 2's have a higher taste for criminal activities relative to Type 1's,
which, combined with their lower learning ability and hence poorer perspective in schools,
makes Type 2 teenagers more prone to crimes. Attending schools and committing crimes at
the same time is costly, especially during primary school stage. Moreover, consistent with
previous studies, as reviewed by Levitt and Lochner (2000), we also find a significant age
effect on the tendency to commit crimes. The middle part of Panel B shows that the payoff
of uncaught crimes does not vary much with local crime rate among the entire population
(not just teenage crimes), but decreases with local average income except for those from
low-income families.40 Finally, a teenager incurs disutility if caught doing crime, but this
deterrence effect is concentrated on first-time arrests.
       Panel A of Table 7 shows the estimated parameters governing the type distribution.
  40
     Our model is silent about why criminal payoffs may vary with aggregate conditions such as crime and
income, which does not affect our ability to study individual choices and how an individual would respond to
counterfactual policies. See Fu and Wolpin (2018) as a recent example of studies on crime in an equilibrium
setting.

Teenagers with better family backgrounds are more likely to be Type 1's.41 Moreover, those
enrolled in higher quality primary schools are more likely to be Type 1's, which reflects the
initial sorting between households and schools. Using these estimates, Panel B reports the
percentage of Type 1 teenagers in our sample. Overall, there are 46% Type 1 teenagers.
This fraction is about 10 percentage points higher among teenagers with high-education
parents than among those with low-education parents. The disparity is even larger across
teenagers attending different groups of primary schools by school SES and by school-level
SIMCE scores.

6.2     Model Fit
Overall, the model fits the data well. Table 8 shows the model fit for the age-status profile.
Table 9 shows the fit for outcomes separately for teenagers with different parental educa-
tion levels, and different initial primary schools as grouped by school-level average SIMCE
scores. The model captures the heterogeneous outcomes across these groups reasonably well,
although the model underpredicts the cross-group difference in the fraction of the ever ar-
rested. Using model-simulated data, we run the same regressions (13) and (14) as we did
in Section 5.1. Table 10 shows that the model is able to replicate the correlation between
enrollment and past GPA residuals. Finally, Table 11 shows the fit for primary-to-secondary
  41
    The likelihood does not improve if we add other variables in the type distribution (e.g., parental educa-
tion) and the associated parameters are close to zero. We therefore choose the simpler specification.

7      Counterfactual Experiments
We use the estimated model to conduct a set of relatively easy-to-implement counterfactual
interventions targeted at disadvantaged teenagers, who are more likely to wander astray.
Specifically, we target teenagers who are initially enrolled in low SES primary schools and
whose parents have low education. These teenagers account for 10% of all teenagers in our
sample.42 The average monthly family income per person among the targeted teenagers is
25,460 pesos, as compared to 63,114 pesos among all teenagers in the sample. The first two
columns of Table 12 shows that in the baseline, the targeted teenagers are more likely to
have some arrest records than others (5.24% versus 3.08%). They are also much less likely
to be consistently enrolled than other teenagers (68.76% versus 82.22%).


7.1     Free Schools, Better Schools
Given our finding that low-income families are more sensitive to tuition costs than others
(Table 6), our first intervention completely lifts the tuition burden for the targeted teenagers.
Specifically, Policy 0v (v for voucher) gives additional vouchers to the targeted teenagers on
top of the vouchers that already exist in the baseline (Section 2.2), so that high schools
become totally free for them to attend. The purpose of this exercise is to examine the effect
of tuition intervention without changing the primary-school environment for these teenagers.
Therefore, additional vouchers are needed only at the high school stage, since these teenagers
attend public primary schools that are already free.
  42
    As is true in any individual decision model, results from these experiments abstract from potential
equilibrium impacts. Even though policies targeted at these teenagers may have limited equilibrium impact
given that they are a small fraction of the population, the policy impact should still be interpreted only at
the individual level.


                                                     26
       As shown in Columns 3-4 in Table 12, Policy 0v has little impact on the fraction of
ever-arrested teenagers; it increases, by 1.7 percentage points (ppts) or 2.5%, the fraction
of those who stay on the right track, i.e., those who are consistently enrolled throughout
primary and secondary education and have no criminal record. As shown in the last row of
Table 12, Policy 0v would involve, an average (additional) voucher of 11,280 pesos (14 USD)
per enrollee-year in high school years.43 That is, both the effect and the cost of Policy 0v
are very small.

       Keeping tuition levels as they are in the baseline, the next two interventions aim at re-
ducing institutional frictions that have led to poor schooling opportunities for the targeted
teenagers. Specifically, Policy 1 improves the initial primary school environment for a tar-
geted teenager i from that of his baseline primary school (Wki0 ) to that of a better primary
school (Wkm ) , starting from t = 1 (Grade 5).44 Specifically, km refers to a public primary
school with median school-average SIMCE scores, high SES and zero tuition.45 Policy 1 im-
proves i's learning environment, and hence one's GPA and in-school utility, from Grade 5 to
Grade 8. It also improves i's primary-to-secondary school transfer opportunities, indirectly
by improving one's GPA, and directly via the role of Wk in the transfer process. Notice
that free public schools similar to or better than km already exist, however, they may not
  43
     Specifically,    for a given teenager (Xi , i , ai ),               the expected voucher is the aver-
age high school tuition weighted by his primary-to-secondary school transfer probabilities
  P tr (Xi , i , GP Ai , Wki0 , Wk ) tuitionk dF (GP Ai |Xi , i , ai ) . The overall average is then taken over
the distribution of (Xi , i , ai ) among the targeted teenagers.
  44
     One way to implement Policy 1 would be to enroll i in km or a similar primary school starting from
Grade 5.
  45
     Most public primary schools are free, especially those attended by the targeted teenagers in the baseline.

                                                      27
be easily accessible for the targeted teenagers due to frictions such as selective admissions,
which also exist in other countries.46
Policy 2 enhances Policy 1: in addition to improving their primary school environment to
Wkm , Policy 2 further improves primary-to-secondary school transfer opportunities for a tar-
geted teenager to those faced by their counterpart from middle-level family backgrounds.
That is, a targeted teenager would be treated equally as someone who has the same GPA
and type but whose family income, parental education, and family SES are all at the mid-
dle level.47 Notice that Policy 2 only requires a fairer school transfer process, rather than
(unrealistically) change one's family background.
       The effects of Policies 1 and 2 are shown in the last 4 columns of Table 12. By improving
one's primary school environment from Grade 5 (t = 1), Policy 1 would lead to a 4 ppts
or 6% increase in the fraction of the targeted teenagers who consistently stay on the right
track. However, the fraction of the ever-arrested remains above 5%. Supplementing Policy
1 with better high-school transfer opportunities (Policy 2) leads to no further noticeable
improvement in outcomes. Relative to the free high school treatment (Policy 0v), improving
schooling opportunities is more effective, but the effect is still quite limited.

Remark 3 To make our counterfactual experiments more realistic and policy relevant, we
have made three choices throughout. First, rather than imposing restrictions directly on
behaviors, the interventions aim at inducing behavioral responses by changing one's oppor-
tunities and/or incentives. For example, even with improved and/or free access to schools,
a teenager can still choose not to enroll. Second, the interventions we consider are all rela-
tively mild and easy to implement. For example, the targeted teenagers are given schooling
opportunities faced by those from middle-level backgrounds, instead of those from rich fam-
ilies. Third, as our model is silent on the formation of a teenager's initial endowment, we
hold fixed a teenager's ability, preference type and initial belief about himself and start the
intervention at t = 1 (Grade 5). Therefore, the effects should be interpreted as those on the
  46
     For example, in many countries, including the U.S., although public schools are all free to attend, their
quality differs substantially across neighborhoods. With neighborhood-priority rules commonly used in allo-
cating students to public schools, good public schools are difficult to get into for children from disadvantaged
backgrounds.
  47
     Specifically, let Xm denote a vector of middle-level family background. A targeted teenager i is now
given the transfer probability vector {P tr (Xm , i , GP Ai , Wkm , Wk )}k , where i's own characteristics (type
and GPA) remain but family characteristics Xi is replaced by Xm (only in P tr (·)). Affirmative action, where
admissions favor disadvantaged students, would be a more progressive treatment.

7.2       Free and Better Schools
As shown in Table 12, neither lowering financial cost alone nor improving schooling opportu-
nities alone would be very helpful for the targeted teenagers. We now examine a combination
of the two types of measures. The next two policies, labeled as Policy 1v and Policy 2v,
improve schooling opportunities and make schools free. Specifically, Policy 1v (Policy 2v) is
the counterpart of Policy 1 (Policy 2) with the additional feature that high school tuition
is fully covered for the targeted teenagers via extra vouchers. Table 13 shows that Policies
1v and 2v are about three times as effective as their counterpart. Under Policy 2v, which
is more effective than Policy 1v, the fraction of the ever-arrested decreases by 0.6 ppts or
11%; and the fraction of the consistently-enrolled increases by 12 ppts or 17%. Both policies
would involve an additional voucher of about 17 thousand pesos (22 USD) per enrollee-year
on average. This is a small cost, especially considering the fact that Policy 1v and Policy
2v are three times as effective as their counterpart in keeping these teenagers on the right
track.

       Finally, our parameter estimates imply that relative to their public-school counterpart,
private schools are more enjoyable to attend and more effective in producing knowledge
(GPA). We therefore implement Policy 3v, which enhances Policy 2v by guaranteeing the

    The effect on later cohorts can be larger/smaller, depending on whether households' investment in
early childhood responds to these teenage-year interventions in a complementary/substitutable manner. In
addition, early childhood interventions may also change one's initial conditions by teenage years (e.g., Garcia
et al. (2016)).

As shown in the last two columns of Table 13, Policy 3v would lead to a 20% reduction in
the fraction of ever-arrested teenagers, doubling the effect of Policy 2v in this dimension.
It would also lead to a 27% increase in the fraction of consistently-enrolled teenagers. The
additional voucher in this case is over 221 thousand pesos (280 USD) per enrollee-year, which
is a significantly larger voucher than that under Policy 2v and yet is still arguably a small
cost.



8        Conclusion
We have developed a model of teenagers' dynamic choices of schooling and crime, incor-
porating four groups of factors underlying the routes taken by different teenagers, namely
endowment, institutional friction, information friction and transitory shocks. We have esti-
mated the model using a rare administrative data set from Chile that links school records
and teenage-year criminal records. The estimated model well captures the patterns in the
data.
       We use the estimated model to study a set of realistic counterfactual policy interventions,
targeted at teenagers with disadvantaged backgrounds. We find that neither making schools
free alone nor improving schooling opportunities alone would be very helpful for the targeted
teenagers. Interventions that combine these two types of measures would be three times as
effective as either type of measures on their own. The cost of these interventions are relatively
low, both financially and in terms of the degree to which the schooling opportunities are
improved. Given that frictions featured in the Chilean setting exist in many other countries
in the same or similar formats, e.g., the unequal access to good schools, lessons learned from
this exercise can be useful elsewhere.
       There are several dimensions along which our framework can be extended. First, we
have taken teenagers' ability and unobserved types as pre-determined endowments that are
correlated with their family backgrounds. An important extension is to bring into our
framework early childhood investment that shapes one's initial conditions by teenage years.50
  49
     This mediocre private high school is categorized as middle SES, and its school level SIMCE score is
0.08, which is higher than the average among all high schools (0.04), but lower than the average among
voucher-private high schools (0.31).
  50
     See, for example, Cunha and Heckman (2007), Cunha et al. (2010) and Del Boca et al. (2013) for
studies on parental investment on children.


                                                  30
This extension would allow for an investigation of how interventions in childhood interact
with those in teenage years, but would require additional information on parental investment
such as time inputs. A second extension is to open the black box of the "terminal value"
function by modeling one's post-high-school choices and outcomes. When these additional
data become available, this extension will allow for a broader view on how pre-job-market
intervention and intervention targeted at low-skilled workers may interact in helping those
from disadvantaged backgrounds to move up the ladder.

where GP A is the 25th percentile of GPA over all students, so I (GP Ait < GP A ) indicates
low GPA. 3 is disutility for being retained. The second line specifies the utility associated
with different school characteristics: high school (Git > 8) or primary school, private or not,
whether or not the school quality (average score) is low (i.e., below the 25th percentile), and
the school's SES status (1 being low and 3 being high). In the third row, pk  Wk is the
tuition charged for attending school k, inci  Xi is i's family income level. We introduce
8 and 9 to capture the idea that the trade-off between education attainment and tuition
costs may depend on family resources. 10 is a type-2 specific constant term. In the last
row, 11 is the disutility of attending school for someone with a criminal record. 12 (13 )
is the disutility of attending primary school (high school) while committing crimes.

( Sk - SP ) I ( Sk > SP ), (Sk - SP ) - = ( Sk - SP ) I ( Sk  SP ); and the other terms are similarly
defined. The first row of (17) captures the transition likelihood associated with quality
differences between a secondary school and one's primary school as well as one's own GPA.
                      
In particular, (Sk - SS ) measures the quality of a given secondary school k  relative to a
median secondary school. This term is interacted with the quality of one's primary school
relative to a median primary school as well as one's own GPA relative to a median student.
The coefficients are allowed to differ depending on whether or not the primary school or the
student is above the median, and on student unobserved type (i ) . The second row captures
the ease/difficulty to transfer to a private secondary school for all and for those enrolled in
private primary schools. The third row captures the transition likelihood associated with
the interaction of the SES status of the secondary school and the origin primary school. The
last row interacts the SES status of a high school and a student's own SES.

   A1.4 Crime Payoff and Utility upon Arrests
The payoff from crime when one is not caught varies with local crime rate (crl ) , local average
income (INCl ) , and one's family income (inci ) , such that


          R (li , Xi ) = 1 crli + INCli (2 + 3 I (inci = low ) + 4 I (inci = middle)) .


If arrested, one's utility is given by


                                  uj (Jit-1 ) = µ1 + µ2 I (Jit-1 = 0) ,

                                                     36
where µ2 is the additional disutility for first-time arrests.

    A1.5 Terminal Value
VT +1 (Xi , i , GiT , JiT , EiT (ai ) , WkiT ) =


              GiT (0 + 1 SkiT ) + 2 I (JiT 1 > 0) +
                                                                          
                            3 + 4 I (i = 2) + 5 exp (EiT (ai )) + 6 SkiT
              I (GiT = 12)                                                .
                            +7 I (parent edu=mid) + 8 I (parent edu=high)

The first row represents the value of grade level and whether or not one is ever arrested,
where the former may vary with the quality (average SIMCE score) of the school one last
attended. The second row specifies the value of finishing high school, which may differ by
type, one's belief about his ability, the quality of one's school, and one's parental education.
We take the exponential exp (EiT (ai )) because EiT (ai ) can be negative, which arises from
the fact that test scores are standardized to have a mean of 0 and that ai and test scores are
on the same scale.

    A1.6 Distribution of Sentencing Length
We measure  in units of 6 months, with   {0, 1, 2, ...11}. We assume that  is drawn from
an ordered probit distribution, with the continuous latent variable (  ) given by

                             
                             it = 0 + 1 ageit + 2 Jit-1,1 + 3 Jit-1,2 + it ,



where Jit-1,1 (Jit-1,2 ) is the total arrests (total sentences) in the past. To estimate  and
the cutoff parameters from our DPP data, we assign  = 0 if no jail time was prescribed,
 = 1 if the observed sentence was positive but no greater than 6 months,...,  = 10 if it was
longer than 54 months but no greater than 60, and  = 11 if it was 60 months or longer.

    B. Standardization of GPA
    For a primary school k , we estimate its grading parameters (araw  raw
                                                                  k , bk ) using its students'

Grade 4 raw GPAs and Grade 4 SIMCE scores in the following regression


                               GP Araw    raw
                                   ki0 = ak   + braw          raw
                                                 k SIMCEki0 + ki0 .


                                                                               GP Araw   raw
                                                                                   kit -ak
The standardized GPA in primary school k is then given by GP Akit =                braw
                                                                                             .   To stan-

dardize secondary school GPAs, we follow the same procedure but school grading parameters
are estimated by comparing Grade 10 raw GPAs with Grade 10 SIMCE scores.

    C. The Likelihood Function
    Model parameters to be estimated () include 1) preference parameters u , 2) GPA
production and grade progression parameters G , 3) type distribution parameters  , 4)
type-specific ability distribution parameters a , 5) school transition probability parameters
tr , and 6) the parameter that relates standardized test score (unknown to student) and
ability ( ). Given observables (Xi , ki0 ), the estimated  should maximize the probability
of observing each teen's school enrollment, GPA's, grade progress and arrests over time, i.e.,

                                       Teenager i's contribution is given by


                   Li () =          Pr (i = m|Xi , ki0 ;  ) Lim (\ ) ,

            Lim (\ ) = T                                   tr
                       t=1 Limt (\ ) × Lim0 (G , a ,  ) × p (·, i = m|tr ) .



Lim is the likelihood conditional on i being type m, which is the product of period-specific
likelihoods Limt (\ ), complemented by the additional information provided by one's pre-
G0 performance (Lim0 (·)) , and the school transition probability as specified in (4) .
    Limt (\ ) for t  1 : Let imt be the vector of state variables for i of Type-m at
time t, and imt be the part net of payoff shocks.52 arrestit = 1 implies dit = 1. When
arrestit = 0, one may not have committed a crime or may have done so but failed to be
arrested.53 Therefore,
  51
     Notice that two outcomes in the model do not enter the likelihood directly: 1) crime, because it is
observed only via arrest; 2) jail sentences, which, conditional on arrests, do not depend on  and hence will
not contribute to the likelihood.
  52
     The following state variables are directly observed in the data: Xi , Jit-1 , Git-1 , eit-1 , kit-1 , git . Given
the observed history of GPA's, one's beliefs EAit-1 , V Ait-1 only depends on model parameters and one's
type.
  53
     The likelihood of observing a missing value of an outcome is 1 in non-applicable cases. For example,
Oit = · if i is in jail from previous sentence; GP Ait = · if eit = 0.
