        This longitudinal analysis of the labor market behavior of older,

urban white males in 1969, 1971, and 1973 focuses on changes from wage—

and—salary to self—employment and changes from working to non—working

status. In each two—year transition approximately four percent of wage—

and—salary workers switched to self—employment. They were primarily men

who were previously self—employed or who were in wage—and—salary

occupations with characteristics similar to self—employment, e.g.,

managers and salesmen. For a blue collar worker employed forty hours

per week the predicted probability of switching was close to zero.

Controlling for a large number of economic and demographic variables, the

self—employed were significantly more likely to continue to work, partly

by reducing their workweek to under 35 hours. Other significant predi.ctors

of continuing to work are good health, years of schooling, white collar

occupation, no expectation of a private pension, and a workweek longer than

fifty hours. Age is also important, especially at the eligibility ages

set by social security.

                              Introduction


Background

         The labor market behavior of older workers 1is receiving increasing

attention from social scientists at the same time that policies affecting

such behavior are becoming important subjects of public debate. Empirical

economic research has concentrated primarily on explaining labor supply——

especially the retirement decision——with ill health, social security payments,

private pensions, assets, income, wage rates, taxes, and the business

cycle the main variables of analysis. Some economic research, primarily

theoretical, has attempted to explain other phenomena such as seniority

rules, rigidity of wages at older ages, and mandatory retirement.

Recent policy discussions have focused on the desirability of raising or

eliminating mandatory retirement ages, raising the social security

retirement age, and reducing or eliminating the implicit tax on earnings

of those eligible for social security retirement benefits.

         The principal reason for the increase in interest in older

workers is the realization that current retirement patterns, longer life

expectancy, and a slowing—down in the growth of the non—aged labor force

will eventually necessitate either large increases in taxes or large

decreases in benefits to retired workers. Short of large—scale immigration

there is not much that can be done to change the size of the non—aged

labor force for at least the next 20 years, and no one is advocating
                                       2



shorter life expectancy. Thus, there is growing support for efforts to

róverse the trend toward earlier retirement.

          According to Gordon and Blinder (1980) there are five basic classes

of' reasons why older people retire from the labor force. They are: poor

health, age—related declines in wages for reasons other than health,

incentives created by the social security retirement system, incentives

created by private pensions, and age—related shifts in preferences toward

leisure. In a recent study, based on cross—section analysis of Retire-

ment History Study data, they find strong effects from wages and private

pensions, a usubstantial, though not overwhelming!! effect of ill health,

some support for a shift in preferences, but an insignificant effect from

social security. Boskin (1977), on the other hand, has questioned the

significance of health and has emphasized the importance of social security

retirement benefits, as have Pellechio (1979) and several other investi-

gators.

          Most of the published studies have concentrated on wage—and—

salary workers alone; the self—employed are typically excluded. An

important exception is Quinn (1980a, b), who has looked specifically at

the self—employed, and who has called attention to I!partial retirement.!!

He has speculated that some wage—and—salary workers switch to self—employ-

ment toward the end of the life cycle as an' alternative to withdrawal from

the labor force. He assumes that there is much more flexibility in hours

and wages among the self—employed and that the change in class of work is

a form of partial retirement.

          The increased importance of self—employment at older ages is a

well established feature of the U.S. labor market. For instance, in
                                         3




cross—sectional data the proportion self—employed among white urban male

workers rises from about 15 percent in the late fifties to more than 25

percent by the late sixties. (See Table 1, column 1.) Given a long—term

trend away from self—employment,--'1 this increase may be partly a cohort

effect. However, in longitudinal data from the Retirement History Study

(columns 2 through 7 of Table 1), life—cycle effects within cohorts are

also very pronounced. Indeed, for every birth cohort except 1907, the

within cohort change is slightly larger than that revealed in the cross—section,

possibly for cyclical reasons or as an artifact of the RHS sample.

        The observed increase in the importance of self—employment over

the life cycle can result from class—of—worker differences in continuation

at work or from shifts by wage—and—salary workers into self—employment,

or both. Table 2 shows that both phenomena were present during the period

under study. In the 1969—71 and 1971—73 transitions approximately four

to five percent of wage—and—salary workers switched to self—employment;

within this eight—year segment of the life—cycle the probability of switching

does not vary systematicallywith age. A class—of—worker differential in the

probability of continuing to work is also readily apparent. This probability was

higher for the self-employed than for wage and salary workers at every age in both

transitions. The differential in the probability does vary with age, rising from a

very small difference at 58 and 59 to a very large one in the middle sixties.

        This paper focuses on both the switch to self—employment and the

class—of—worker differential in the probability of continuing to work.

First, the increase in the relative importance of self—employment at each

age is decomposed into its two sources. Second, the results of multiple

regressions of the probability of switching are presented. The principal

empirical section of the paper provides new estimates of the impact of

class of worker, ill health, wages, social security, private pensions,

mandatory retirement, and other variables on the labor force participation

of older males. The analysis is longitudinal and focuses on the probability

of being at work at t+2 and t+4 years conditional on working at year t.

The final set of regressions tests the hypothesis    that   the higher propensity

of the self—employed to continue to work at older ages is related to their

ability to reduce their work week to less than 35 hours.




The Data

           The data used in this paper come from the Retirement History

Study, which egan in 1969 when thesubjects were ages 58 through 63.

Responses to interviews conducted in 1971 and 1973, as well as 1969, are

included. I have restricted the analysis to white urban males in order

to eliminate complications introduced by sex and race differences in

behavior, and to avoid definitional problems concerning the labor force

participation of older farmers. Class of worker was determined by the

response to the question "Are you (a) an employee of a private company,

(b) a government employee, (c) self—employed, (d) working without pay?"

Those who responded (a) or (b) were classified as "wage—and—salary."

The very small number who responded (d) were treated as not working.

           In 1969 there were approximately 3500 white urban males in the

sample who were at work and who were retained in the sample in l97l.'

Approximately 2500 were working in 1971 and retained in the sample in 1973.

During each transition approximately 12 percent of the men who were working
                                    7




at time t were lost from the sample by t+2. Individuals were lost from

the sample through death, institutionalization, refusal to respond to

subsequent interviews, or unreported change in location. In general, men

lost from the sample did not have significantly different characteristics

from those retained. For men working at time t, the only statistically

significant predictor of being lost from the sample at t+2 is the presence

of a health—related work limitation.-" The analysis is restricted to men

who were working in the initial year of each transition in order to focus

on subsequent changes in status with a full set of observations for all

variables.




Sources of Increase in Self—employment

        One of the advantages of the longitudinal data is the opportunity

they afford for decomposing the life—cycle increase in the relative

importance of self—employment into the share attributable to a class of

worker differential in continuing to work, and the share attributable to

a net shift into self—employment.

     S2 and T+2 = the           same in terminal year;'

                  X =   number of wage and salary workers in initial year
                        who were self—employed in terminal year;


                  Y =   number of self—employed workers in initial year who
                        were wage and salary in terminal year;

                                     S
                      S+2

        This decomposition, shown in Table 3, reveals that the source of

the increase in self—employment varies considerably with age. For those

men who were 58 or 59 in 1969, all of the increase is attributable

to switching from wage and salary to self—employed status. At age 60

(cohorts 1909 in 1969, and 1911 in 1971), shifts in class of worker and

differential continuity of work are about equal in importance. Above age

60 differential work patterns become more important than shifting,

accounting for at least 60 percent and sometimes all of the increase in

the relative importance of self—employment. For the sample as a whole,

it appears that both switching and differential continuity are important.

The balance of the paper, therefore, is devoted to the questions: "Who

switches?" and "Who continues to work?"




                              Regression Analysis

Model and Variables

        In order to explore systematically whether those older men who

continue working differ in predictable ways from those who stop, and

whether those wage and salary workers who switch to self—employment late

in life are different from those who do not, a series of maximum likelihood

logit regressions were run based on the transitions from 1969 to 1971 and

from 1971 to 1973 (and sometimes 1969 to 1973). Because results for each

transition were similar, only the pooled results are reported in the paper.

The independent variables used in the regressions are defined in Table 4

and mean values are shown in Table 5. YRSPRSE, which measures previous

experience in self—employment, was obtained from social security records

that were matched to each individual. A second group of variables describes

dummies, and four dummy variables for occupation. Personal characteristics

are covered by three health status dummies, a continuous variable measuring

years of schooling, and a separate dummy variable for each single year of

age. There are four dummy variables describing private pension expectations

and mandatory retirement status, and three dummy variables for expected

social security income calculated from matched social security records

Who   Switches   to Self—employment?

          Table 6 reports the results of a regression designed to answer the

question "Who switches to self—employment?" The sample is restricted to

the men who were working as wage—and—salary workers in the initial year

(1969 or 1971) and who were also working in the terminal year (1971 or 1973)

1973).!' The dependent variable is dichotomous, taking a value of 1 if

the subject switched to self—employment, and 0 if he continued as a

wage—and—salary worker. The marginal effect of each independent variable,

evaluated at mean probability, is shown after the regression coefficient

and its standard error.

          We see that previous experience with self—employment, occupation,

and weekly hours at current job are all significant predictors of the

probability of a wage—and—salary worker switching to self—employment.

Also, wage—and—salary workers who are subject to mandatory retirement

beyond t+2 or who expect a private pension are less likely to switch.

On the other hand, expectations about the amount of social security income,

health status, education, age, and wages are not significantly related to

changes from wage and salary to self—employment status. A dummy variable

that compares the probability of switching in 1971—73 vs. 1969—71 is also

insignificant.

          It is quite clear that the men who switched to self—employment

are primarily those who have had previous e::perience in self—employment

or who are in wage—and—salary jobs that are similar in many respects to

self—employment. Managers, professionals, and salesmen, for instance,

frequently have a good deal of discretion as to how they spend their

time, and their compensation is frequently closely tied to their perform-

ance. Also, the very short (< 35) or very long ( 50) work weeks reported

by the switchers while they were in wage—and—salary employment are

characteristic of the self—employed. The contrasts among wage—and—salary

workers in the probability of switching is quite striking. Although the mean

probability of changing to self—employment is .04, the predicted proba-

bility for a blue collar worker with a 40—hour per week job, eligible for

a pension, and no previous self—employment experience, is only   .003.
On the other hand, the predicted probability for a manager with some

self—employment income in any ten years since 1951, an unusually short

or long work—week, not eligible for a private pension, and not subject

to mandatory retirement is .52.




Who Continues to Work?

        The regression results presented in Table 7 provide some intriguing

answers to the question "Who continues to workY' This formulation is used

rather than "Who retires?" for two reasons. First, it is possible to

determine with considerable accuracy whether a man is working or not at

a given time, whereas the concept of "retirement" is ambiguous. For

instance, in these data some men who state that they are "retired" are

also working. Second, other investigators are using these data to study

"retirement"; the results reported here provide some insight into the

importance of the particular formation of the question.

        The analysis is restricted to men working in the initial year who

were sampled in the terminal year. The dependent variable is dichotomous,

taking a value of 1 if the man was also working in the terminal year,

and 0 if he was not. The independent variables are the same as in the

switching regression, except that a dummy variable for self—employment

is substituted for PRVSE. The results are discussed by groups of variables.


        Class of worker and age. The regression results presented in

Table 7 confirm the inferences drawn from Tables 2 and 3 that the self—

employed are more likely to continue working than are wage—and—salary

workers. Evaluated at mean probability, and controlling for other variables,

the class of worker differential is almost 8 percentage points. In

regressions based on the transition from 1969 to 1973 (not shown here)

it is possible to compare the probability of continuing to work of men

who had been self—employed in 1969 with that of men who switched to

self—employment in 1971. The coefficients are the same to two decimal

places and the coefficients for the other variables are very sinUlar to

those shown in Table 7.

        This table also shows that age is significant, but there are

substantial discontinuities in the effect of age, probably because

of the structure of the social security law.       If withdrawal from

work were determined primarily by biological aging rather, than institu-

tionally imposed incentives and constraints, the age coefficients in

Table 7 would tend to change at a smooth rate. They do not. Instead,

we observe a significantly larger decrease for those men who reach 65

during the transition period (i.e., those who are age 63 or 64 at t), the

"normal" age for retirement under social security and many private pension
                                            18



plans. We also observe a discontinuity for men reaching 62 (age 60 at t),

the eligibility age for 'tearly" retirement under social security. This

can be seen by the large positive coefficient for age 59, indicating that

the change from 59 to 60 is almost twice as large as the change from 58

to 59. There are also some significant interactions between class of

worker and age which will be discussed after the principal results for

the other variables are presented.


         Health status, pensions, mandatory retirement, and social security.

Health status is a remarkably strong predictor of the probability of

working. This result has been found before in several cross—section

studies, but its validity has been questioned because of the possibility

that respondents offer poor health" as a rationalization for not working.

The findings in this study are less subject to that criticism because

all the men are working when their self—evaluation of health status is

ascertained. Even in the 1969—73 regression (not shown), when health

status at time t is used to predict work status four years later (and the

sample is restricted to men at work in 1969 and 1971 and still in the

sample in 1973), the health variables do very           well.   Men who report no

health—related work limitation, but are only in average or worse—than—

average health, show a marginal effect of .088 (compared to those with a work

limitation and average or worse—than—average health), while men with no

work limitation and above—average health show a differential probability

of .141. The results of tests of possible interactions between health

status and other variables are discussed below.

          Table 7 also shows the strong effect of mandatory retirement within

the   transition   period (R   t+2)   .   Eligibility   for a private pension and/or
                                       19




mandatory retirement beyond t+2 also decreases the probability of continuing

to work. Expectations about social security income do not have a strong

effect. The highest benefit category, however, has a negative coefficient

which is statistically significant at p <   .05.


        Education, occupation, hours, and wages. The effects of job—

related variables——hours, wages and occupation——and the education of the

worker are mixed. Ceteris paribus, education and occupation are quite

significant; hours and wages are not. We see that each year of schooling

adds almost one percentage point to the probability of working in the

terminal year. The occupation dummies show that white—collar workers

are much more likely to continue working than are blue—collar workers.

Most of the hours dummies are not significant, but men who work 50 hours

per week or more at time t have a significantly higher probability of

being at work at t+2. This finding is contrary to the results of

Burkhauser and Turner (based on men at younger ages); they suggested that

workers substitute between longer hours and longer labor force   participation.
Perhaps there are other unmeasured characteristics possessed by some men

who "like" to work. The wage variables are not statistically significant,

which is contrary to the cross—section results of Gordon and Blinder, who

estimated wages and included men not at work.


        The 1971—73 dummy variable. In contrast to the insignificant

transition dummy in the switching regression, the probability of continuing

to work 1971—73 was significantly lower than in l96c_71. This is the

opposite of what would be expected for cyclical reasons.     The white adult

male unemp1o\ent rate actually fell from 4,0 percent in. l7l to 2.9 percent
                                        20



in 1973 after rising from 1.9 percent in 1969. The sharper decline in

work during the 1971—73 transition is probably the result of a substantial

increase in social security benefits during that period.


          Interactions between variables. Several sets of regressions were

run to test for possible interactions among age, health status, class of

worker and pension status. Surprisingly few significant differences emerged.

The most notable interaction is between age and class of worker (see Table 8).

As previously noted (Table 2), there is little difference between self—

employed and wage—and—salary workers in the probability of continuing to

work for the younger men in the sample. At ages 61 (at t) or above, the

class of worker effect is substantial. A similar interaction with age is

observed for the PN/NOR variable. At the older ages in this sample eligibility

for a private pension has a much larger negative effect on the probability

of continuing to work than at the younger ages.

          There have been a number of suggestions that the effects of poor

health on labor force participation should vary, depending upon age,

education, class of   worker,   occupation, and the like.' These hypotheses

are not confirmed in this sample. For instance, when the sample is divided

into three groups according to health status,' the coefficients for the

other variables do not vary systematically and significantly with health

status.

          A simple summation of the principal findings of the working—not working

regression is presented in Table 9 in the form of estimated probabilities of

working for three hypothetical men: Mr. A, assumed to be a professional,

self—employed, 17 years of schooling, hours     50, no work limitation and

health    above average, no pension or mandatory retirement; Mr. B,   clerical,

collar, wage—and—salary, 10 years of schooling, hours = 40, work limitation

and health     average, pension and mandatory retirement at age 65. For all

three men the omitted class values are assumed for wages and social security

benefits.

          We observe large variation in the probability of continuing to

work among these men, especially at older ages. For Mr. A the probability

of continuing to work is close to unity at all ages through t=65. Mr. B

has a high probability at the younger ages, but it declines with age,

primarily because of the interaction between age and the class of worker

and pension effects. Mr. C has a lower probability even at 58 and 59, and

the probabilityof his continuing towork falls to virtually zero when t=65.

            A final regression was run to determine the extent to

which the class of worker differential in the probability of working is

related to greater opportunities for the self—employed to work short hours.

These regressions omitted men who were working fewer than 35 hours per week

at t and men who changed class of work, leaving 5263 observations. Three

possible states at t+2 were specified: working       35 hours per week,

working      35 hours per week, and not working. A polytoinous logit regression

was estimated by maximum likelihood. The coefficients were then used to

40 percent of the working differential of .055 is accounted for by a

differential in the predicted probability of working under 35 hours per

week. The factors that make short work weeks more viable for the self—

employed than for wage—and—salary workers need to be investigated.

                                     Summary


           This longitudinal analysis of the labor market behavior of older

white urban males confirms some previous findings, contradicts others, and

raises new questions for further study. The paper differs from most pre-

vious research in this subject by inclusion of the self—employed, by

explicit attention to changes in class of work, and by focusing on the

probability of continuing to work rather than on "retirement" per se.

           The -continuing to work regressions provide strong support for the

role of ill health in the labor force decisions of older men. Those men

at work who reported a health—related work limitation at time t were

(ceteris paribus) much less likely to be at work two or four years later.

This is a significant result because it is much less susceptible to the

criticism that "poor health" simply serves as a rationalization for not

working.

           Age has a strong effect on the probability of continuing to work,

but there are marked discontinuities in the size of the effect which seem

to be associated with eligibility for social security. The probability

of working at t+2 drops sharply when t is 63. This corresponds with the

'normal" retirement age of 65. A smaller discontinuity is observed when

t+2 is •62, the eligibility age for "early" retirement.

       Eligibility for a private pension has a significan.t negative effect

on the probability of continuing to work, and this effect increases with

age. Men working long hours ( 50) are much more likely to continue to

work. Wage rates, on the other hand, do not show a significant effect.

       The self—employed are much more likely to continue than are wage—

and—salary workers. This class of worker differential increases with age
                                     27




and seems to be about as large for those who have very recently switched

to self—employment as for those who have been in the class for some time.

A substantial portion of the class—of—worker differential in continuing to

work is accounted for by self—employed who reduce their work week from

more than to less than 35 hours.

        The probability of switching regressions reveals that men who change

to self—employment late in life are primarily those who have had previous

experience in self—employment or who are in wage—and—salary occupations

such as managers and salesmen that have many characteristics similar to

self—employment. For instance, men who switch tended to have either very

short or very long work weeks even when they were in wage—and-salary jobs.

The probability of a blue—collar worker with a 40—hour—per—week job switching

to self—employment is extremely small in either of the two—year transitions.

        With respect to the five possible explanations for labor force

withdrawal identified in the introduction to this paper,I conclude that

the age of eligibility for social security and poor health are the most

important, private pensions are of some importance, while biologic ageing

and wage effects are of lesser significance.

        This paper provides answers to some questions about labor market

behavior, but the results also raise some new questions. Why do the

self—employed continue to work when apparently comparable wage—and—salary

workers stop? Why do they find it easier or more attractive to reduce

their weekly hours below 35 than do wage and salary workers? Why do men

who are working long hours each week have a higher probability of continuing

to work than do those with a normal work week? Why is there (ceteris paribus)

a large white collar—blue collar differential and an education differential
                                      28




in the probability of continuing to work? Apparently there are factors

influencing the labor market behavior of older men that are not captured

by the age, health, wage, pension, and social security variables discussed

by Cordon and Blinder and included in this study. Do self—employment,

education, white collar, and long hours serve as proxies for the utility

or disutility associated with work? Do these variables identify men who

many years ago made life—cycle plans that included higher participation

rates at older ages? Research that helps to clarify the role of these

variables would contribute a great deal to overall understanding of the

labor market behavior of older men.

        5. Men who stated they were "looking for work" were included in

the "not working." Fewer than one—third of those "looking" in 1969 were

working in 1971, and the same is true for the 1971 to 1973 transition.

Of those not working in 1969, eight percent were working in 1971; the

comparable figure for 1971—73 is two percent.

predictor of mortality. See Taubman and Rosen (1980).

        8. A small number of workers who were classified as wage—and—

salary workers in year t but who reported only self—employment income in

t—l were excluded because of the probability that they were misclassified

in year t. When they were included in the switching regressions with a

dummy variable to identify their status, this variable had a very large

positive coefficient, the coefficient for YRSPSE was increased, and the

other coefficients were virtually unchanged.
