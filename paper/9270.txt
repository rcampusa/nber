                                           ABSTRACT

       The small open economy model with incomplete asset markets features a steady state that
depends on initial conditions and equilibrium dynamics that possess a random walk component. A
number of modifications to the standard model have been proposed to induce stationarity. This
paper presents a quantitative comparison of these alternative approaches. Five different
specifications are considered: (1) A model with an endogenous discount factor (Uzawa-type
preferences); (2) A model with a debt-elastic interest-rate premium; (3) A model with convex
portfolio adjustment costs; (4) A model with complete asset markets; and (5) A model without
stationarity-inducing features. The main finding of the paper is that all models deliver virtually
identical dynamics at business-cycle frequencies, as measured by unconditional second moments
and impulse response functions. The only noticeable difference among the alternative specifications
is that the complete-asset-market model induces smoother consumption dynamics.

1     Introduction
Computing business-cycle dynamics in the standard small open economy model is problematic. In
this model, domestic residents have only access to a risk-free bond whose rate of return is exoge-
nously determined abroad. As a consequence, the steady state of the model depends on initial
conditions. In particular, it depends upon the country’s initial net foreign asset position.1 Put
diﬀerently, transient shocks have long-run eﬀects on the state of the economy. That is, the equi-
librium dynamics posses a random walk component. The random walk property of the dynamics
implies that the unconditional variance of variables such as asset holdings and consumption is infi-
nite. Thus, endogenous variables in general wonder around an infinitely large region in response to
bounded shocks. This introduces serious computational diﬃculties because all available techniques
are valid locally around a given stationary path.
    To resolve this problem, researchers resort to a number of modifications to the standard model
that have no other purpose than to induce stationarity of the equilibrium dynamics. Obviously,
because these modifications basically remove the built-in random walk property of the canonical
model, they all necessarily alter the low-frequency properties of the model. The focus of the present
study is to assess the extent to which these stationarity-inducing techniques aﬀect the equilibrium
dynamics at business-cycle frequencies.
    We compare the business-cycle properties of five variations of the small open economy. In
section 2 we consider a model with an endogenous discount factor (Uzawa (1968) type preferences).
Recent papers using this type of preferences include Obstfeld (1990), Mendoza (1991), Schmitt-
Grohé (1998), and Uribe (1997). In this model, the subjective discount factor, typically denoted
by β, is assumed to be decreasing in consumption. Agents become more impatient the more they
consume. The reason why this modification makes the steady state independent of initial conditions
becomes clear from inspection of the Euler equation λt = β(ct )(1 + r)λt+1 . Here, λt denotes the
marginal utility of wealth, and r denotes the world interest rate. In the steady state, this equation
reduces to β(c)(1 + r) = 1, which pins down the steady-state level of consumption solely as a
function of r and the parameters defining the function β(·). Kim and Kose (2001) compare the
business-cycle implications of this model to those implied by a model with a constant discount
factor. They find that both models feature similar comovements of macroeconomic aggregates. We
also consider a simplified specification of Uzawa preferences where the discount factor is assumed
to be a function of aggregate per capita consumption rather than individual consumption. This
specification is arguably no more arbitrary than the original Uzawa specification and has a number
of advantages. First, it also induces stationarity since the above Euler equation still holds. Second,
the modified Uzawa preferences result in a model that is computationally much simpler than the
standard Uzawa model, for it contains one less Euler equation and one less Lagrange multiplier.
Finally, the quantitative predictions of the modified Uzawa model are not significantly diﬀerent
from those of the original model.
    In section 3 we study a model with a debt-elastic interest-rate premium. This stationarity
inducing technique has been used, among others, in recent papers by Senhadji (1994), Mendoza
and Uribe (2000), and Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2001). In this model, domestic agents are assumed
to face an interest rate that is increasing in the country’s net foreign debt. To see why this device
induces stationarity, let p(dt ) denote the premium over the world interest rate paid by domestic
residents, and dt the stock of foreign debt. Then in the steady state the Euler equation implies
that β[1 + r + p(d)] = 1. This expression determines the steady-state net foreign asset position as
   1
     If the real rate of return on the foreign bond exceeds (is less than) the subjective rate of discount, the model
displays perpetual positive (negative) growth. It is standard to eliminate this source of dynamics by assuming that
the subjective discount rate equals the (average) real interest rate.

a function of r and the parameters that define the premium function p(·) only.
    Section 4 features a model with convex portfolio adjustment costs. This way of ensuring sta-
tionarity has recently been used by Neumeyer and Perri (2001). In this model, the cost of increasing
asset holdings by one unit is greater than one because it includes the marginal cost of adjusting the
size of the portfolio. The Euler equation thus becomes λt [1 + ψ (dt )] = β(1 + r)λt+1 , where ψ(·) is
the portfolio adjustment cost. In the steady state, this expression simplifies to 1 + ψ (d) = β(1 + r),
which implies a steady-state level of foreign debt that depends only on parameters of the model.
    The models discussed thus far all feature incomplete asset markets. Section 5 presents a model
of a small open economy with complete asset markets. Under complete asset markets, the marginal
utility of consumption is proportional across countries. So one equilibrium condition states that
Uc (ct ) = αU ∗ (c∗t ), where U denotes the period utility function and stars are used to denote foreign
variables. Because the domestic economy is small, c∗t is determined exogenously. Thus, stationarity
of c∗t implies stationarity of ct .
    For the purpose of comparison, in section 6 we also study the dynamics of the standard small
open economy model without any type of stationarity-inducing features, such as the economy
analyzed in Correia et al. (1995). In this economy, the equilibrium levels of consumption and net
foreign assets display a unit root. As a result unconditional second moments are not well defined.
For this reason, we limit the numerical characterization of this model to impulse response functions.
    All models are calibrated in such a way that they predict identical steady states. The functional
forms of preferences and technologies are also identical across models. The basic calibration and
parameterization is taken from Mendoza (1991). The business-cycle implications of the alternative
models are measured by second moments and impulse responses. The central result of the paper
is that all models with incomplete asset markets deliver virtually identical dynamics at business-
cycle frequencies. The complete-asset-market model induces smoother consumption dynamics but
similar implications for hours and investment.
    Section ?? presents a sensitivity analysis. It shows that the main results of the paper are
robust to alternative preference specifications. In addition, it explores the relationship between the
magnitude of the parameters determining stationarity and the speed of convergence to the long-run
equilibrium.


2    Model 1: Endogenous Discount Factor
Consider a small open economy populated by a large number of identical households with prefer-
ences described by the following utility function:
                                               ∞
                                               3
                                          E0         θt U (ct , ht ),                               (1)
                                               t=0

                                                 θ0 = 1,                                            (2)
                                     θt+1 = β(ct , ht )θt          t ≥ 0,                           (3)
where βc < 0, βh > 0. This preference specification allows the model to be stationary, in the sense
that the non-stochastic steady state is independent of initial conditions (namely, the initial level of
financial wealth, physical capital, and total factor productivity).
    The evolution of foreign debt, dt , is given by

                          dt = (1 + rt−1 )dt−1 − yt + ct + it + Φ(kt+1 − kt ),                      (4)


                                                       2
where rt denotes the interest rate at which domestic residents can borrow in international markets
in period t, yt denotes domestic output, ct denotes consumption, it denotes gross investment, and
kt denotes physical capital. The function Φ(·) is meant to capture capital adjustment costs and
is assumed to satisfy Φ(0) = Φ (0) = 0. Small open economy models typically include capital
adjustment costs to avoid excessive investment volatility in response to variations in the domestic-
foreign interest rate diﬀerential. The restrictions imposed on Φ ensure that in the non-stochastic
steady state adjustment costs are zero and the domestic interest rate equals the marginal product
of capital net of depreciation. Output is produced by means of a linearly homogeneous production
function that takes capital and labor services as inputs,

                                                yt = At F (kt , ht ),                                          (5)

where At is an exogenous stochastic productivity shock. The stock of capital evolves according to

                                             kt+1 = it + (1 − δ)kt ,                                           (6)

where δ ∈ (0, 1) denotes the rate of depreciation of physical capital.
    Households choose processes {ct , ht , yt , it , kt+1 , dt , θt+1 }∞
                                                                       t=0 so as to maximize the utility func-
tion (1) subject to (2)-(6) and a no-Ponzi constraint of the form
                                                           dt+j
                                           lim Et j                     ≤ 0.                                  (7)
                                          j→∞
                                                         s=1 (1 + rs )

Letting θt ηt and λt denote the Lagrange multipliers on (3) and (4), the first-order conditions of the
household’s maximization problem are (3)-(7) holding with equality and:

                                         λt = β(ct , ht )(1 + rt )Et λt+1                                      (8)

                                         λt = Uc (ct , ht ) − ηt βc (ct , ht )                                 (9)
                               ηt = −Et U (ct+1 , ht+1 ) + Et ηt+1 β(ct+1 , ht+1 )                            (10)
                               −Uh (ct , ht ) + ηt βh (ct , ht ) = λt At Fh (kt , ht )                        (11)
                                                 J                                                 o
     λt [1 + Φ (kt+1 − kt )] = β(ct , ht )Et λt+1 At+1 Fk (kt+1 , ht+1 ) + 1 − δ + Φ (kt+2 − kt+1 )           (12)
These first-order conditions are fairly standard, except for the fact that the marginal utility of
consumption is not given simply by Uc (ct , ht ) but rather by Uc (ct , ht ) − βc (ct , ht )ηt . The second
term in this expression reflects the fact that an increase in current consumption lowers the discount
factor (βc < 0). In turn, a unit decline in the discount factor reduces utility in period t by ηt .
Intuitively, ηt equals the present discounted value of utility from period t +           1 onward. To see
                                                                                ∞ p θt+j Q
this, iterate the first-order condition (10) forward to obtain: ηt = −Et j=1 θt+1 U (ct+j , ht+j ).
Similarly, the marginal disutility of labor is not simply Uh (ct , ht ) but instead Uh (ct , ht )−βh (ct , ht )ηt .
    In this model, the interest rate faced by domestic agents in world financial markets is assumed
to be constant and given by
                                                  rt = r.                                                   (13)
The law of motion of the productivity shock is given by:

                         ln At+1 = ρ ln At +     t+1 ;      t+1   ∼ N IID(0, σ 2 );   t ≥ 0.                  (14)

A competitive equilibrium is a set of processes {dt , ct , ht , yt , it , kt+1 , ηt , λt } satisfying (4)-(12) all
holding with equality, given (13), (14), A0 , d−1 , and k0 .

                                                            3
    We parameterize the model following Mendoza (1991), who uses the following functional forms
for preferences and technology:
                                            J            o1−γ
                                             c − ω −1 hω      −1
                                 U (c, h) =
                                                    1−γ
                                             J               o−ψ1
                                    β(c, h) = 1 + c − ω−1 hω
                                             F (k, h) = k α h1−α
                                              φ 2
                                         Φ(x) =  x ; φ > 0.
                                               2
As is well known, the functional forms of the period utility function and the discount factor imply
that the marginal rate of substitution between consumption and leisure depends only on labor. In
eﬀect, combining equations (9) and (11) yields

                                         hω−1
                                          t   = At Fh (kt , ht )                                    (15)

The right-hand side of this expression is the marginal product of labor, which in equilibrium equals
the real wage rate. The left-hand side is the marginal rate of substitution of leisure for consumption.
The above expression thus states that the labor supply depends only upon the wage rate and in
particular that it is independent of the level of wealth.
    We also follow Mendoza (1991) in assigning values to the structural parameters of the model.
Mendoza calibrates the model to the Canadian economy. The time unit is meant to be a year. The
parameter values are shown on table 1. All parameter values are standard in the real-business-

cycle literature. It is of interest to review the calibration of the parameter ψ1 defining the elasticity
of the discount factor with respect to the composite c − hω /ω. Given the focus of our paper,
this parameter is important because it determines the stationarity of the model and the speed
of convergence to the steady state. The value assigned to ψ1 is set so as to match the average
Canadian trade-balance-to-GDP ratio. To see how in steady state this ratio is linked to the value
of ψ1 , use equation (12) in steady state to get
                                                   w         W    1

                                               =
                                             k          α
It follows from this expression that the steady-state capital-labor ratio is independent of the para-
meter ψ1 . Given the capital-labor ratio, equilibrium condition (15) implies that the steady-state
value of hours is also independent of ψ1 and given by
                                         ^             w         W    α        1

                                                            α        1−α

                                                           r+δ

Given the steady-state values of hours and the capital-labor ratio, we can find directly the steady-
state values of capital, investment (i = δk), and output (k α h1−α ), independently of ψ1 . Now note

                                                       4
that in the steady state the trade-balance-to-GDP ratio, tb/F (k, h), is given by 1 − (c + i)/F (k, h).
Then, equilibrium condition (8) implies the following steady state condition relating the trade-
balance-to-GDP ratio to ψ1 : β(F (k, h) − tb − i, h)(1 + r) = 1. Using the specific functional form
for the discount factor, this expression can be written as:
                                                     J                ω   o
                              tb             i        (1 + r)1/ψ1 + hω − 1
                                    =1−            −
                           F (k, h)       F (k, h)           F (k, h)

This expression can be solved for ψ1 given tb/F (k, h), α, r, δ, and ω. All other things constant,
the larger is the trade-balance-to-output ratio the larger is the required value of ψ1 .

2.1     Model 1a: Endogenous Discount Factor Without Internalization
Consider an alternative formulation of the endogenous discount factor model where domestic agents
do not internalize the fact that their discount factor depends on their own levels of consumption
and eﬀort. Alternatively, suppose that the discount factor depends not upon the agent’s own
consumption and eﬀort, but rather on the average per capita levels of these variables. Formally,
preferences are described by (1), (2), and

                                           θt+1 = β(c̃t , h̃t )θt       t ≥ 0,                                     (16)

where c̃t and h̃t denote average per capital consumption and hours, which the individual household
takes as given.
   The first-order conditions of the household’s maximization problem are (2), (4)-(7), (16) holding
with equality and:
                                     λt = β(c̃t , h̃t )(1 + rt )Et λt+1                         (17)
                                                   λt = Uc (ct , ht )                                              (18)
                                            −Uh (ct , ht ) = λt At Fh (kt , ht )                                   (19)
                                                      J                                               o
      λt [1 + Φ (kt+1 − kt )] = β(c̃t , h̃t )Et λt+1 At+1 Fk (kt+1 , ht+1 ) + 1 − δ + Φ (kt+2 − kt+1 )             (20)
In equilibrium, individual and average per capita variables are identical. That is,

                                                        ct = c̃t                                                   (21)

                                                        ht = h̃t                                                   (22)
   A competitive equilibrium is a set of processes {dt , ct , ht , c̃t , h̃t , yt , it , kt+1 , λt } satisfying (4)-(7),
(17)-(22) all holding with equality, given (13), (14), A0 , d−1 , and k0 . Note that the equilibrium
conditions include one Euler equation less, equation (10), and one state variable less, ηt , than
the standard endogenous-discount-factor model. This feature facilitates the computation of the
equilibrium dynamics.
   We evaluate the model using the same functional forms and parameter values as in Model 1.


3     Model 2: Debt Elastic Interest Rate
In Model 2, stationarity is induced by assuming that the interest rate faced by domestic agents, rt ,
is increasing in the aggregate level of foreign debt, which we denote by d˜t . Specifically, rt is given
by
                                            rt = r + p(d˜t ),                                       (23)

                                                            5
where r denotes the world interest rate and p(·) is a country-specific interest rate premium. The
function p(·) is assumed to be strictly increasing.
    Preferences are given by equation (1). Unlike in the previous model, preferences are assumed
to display a constant subjective rate of discount. Formally,

                                                        θt = β t ,

where β ∈ (0, 1) is a constant parameter.
   The representative agent’s first-order conditions are (4)-(7) holding with equality and

                                               λt = β(1 + rt )Et λt+1                                              (24)

                                                    Uc (ct , ht ) = λt ,                                           (25)
                                       −Uh (ct , ht ) = λt At Fh (kt , ht ).                                       (26)
                                               J                                                 o
            λt [1 + Φ (kt+1 − kt )] = βEt λt+1 At+1 Fk (kt+1 , ht+1 ) + 1 − δ + Φ (kt+2 − kt+1 )                   (27)
Because agents are assumed to be identical, in equilibrium aggregate per capita debt equals indi-
vidual debt, that is,
                                            d˜t = dt .                                       (28)
    A competitive equilibrium is a set of processes {dt , d˜t+1 , ct , ht , yt , it , kt+1 , rt , λt }∞
                                                                                                      t=0 satisfying (4)-
(7), and (23)-(28) all holding with equality, given (14), A0 , d−1 , and k0 .
    We adopt the same forms for the functions U , F , and Φ as in Model 1. We use the following
functional form for the risk premium:
                                                  p       ¯
                                                                 Q
                                        p(d) = ψ2 ed−d − 1 ,

where ψ2 and d¯ are constant parameters.
    We calibrate the parameters γ, ω, α, φ, r, δ, ρ, and σ using the values shown in table 1. We
set the subjective discount factor equal to the world interest rate; that is,
                                                              1
                                                      β=         .
                                                             1+r
The parameter d¯ equals the steady-state level of foreign debt. To see this, note that in steady
state, the equilibrium conditions
                                  (23) and
                                         p (24) together
                                                   Q=     with the assumed form of the interest-rate
                                            d/ ¯
                                               d
premium imply that 1 = β 1 + r + ψ2 e − 1 . The fact that β(1 + r) = 1 then implies that
     ¯ If follows that in the steady state the interest rate premium is nil. We set d¯ so that the
d = d.
steady-state level of foreign debt equals the one implied by Model 1. Finally, we set the parameter
ψ2 so as to ensure that this model and Model 1 generate the same volatility in the current-account-
to-GDP ratio. The resulting values of β, d, ¯ and ψ2 are given in table 2.

4     Model 3: Portfolio Adjustment Costs
In this model, stationarity is induced by assuming that agents face convex costs of holding assets
in quantities diﬀerent from some long-run level. Preferences and technology are as in Model 2. In
contrast to what is assumed in Model 2, here the interest rate at which domestic households can
borrow from the rest of the world is constant and equal to the world interest, that is, equation (13)
holds. The sequential budget constraint of the household is given by
                                                                      ψ3       ¯ 2,
                     dt = (1 + rt−1 )dt−1 − yt + ct + it + Φ(kt+1 − kt ) +
                                                                         (dt − d)             (29)
                                                                      2
where ψ3 and d¯ are constant parameters defining the portfolio adjustment cost function. The first-
order conditions associated with the household’s maximization problem are (5)-(7), (25)-(27), (29)
holding with equality and
                                                ¯ = β(1 + rt )Et λt+1
                               λt [1 − ψ3 (dt − d)]                                           (30)
This optimality condition states that if the household chooses to borrow an additional unit, then
current consumption increases by one unit minus the marginal portfolio adjustment cost ψ3 (dt − d).               ¯
The value of this increase in consumption in terms of utility is given by the left-hand side of the
above equation. Next period, the household must repay the additional unit of debt plus interest.
The value of this repayment in terms of today’s utility is given by the right-hand side. At the
optimum, the marginal benefit of a unit debt increase must equal its marginal cost.
    A competitive equilibrium is a set of processes {dt , ct , ht , yt , it , kt+1 , rt , λt }∞
                                                                                              t=0 satisfying (5)-(7),
(13), (25)-(27), (29), and (30) all holding with equality, given (14), A0 , d−1 , and k0 .
    Preferences and technology are parameterized as in Model 2. The parameters γ, ω, α, φ, r,
δ, ρ, and σ take the values displayed in table 1. As in model 2, the subjective discount factor
is assumed to satisfy β(1 + r) = 1. This assumption and equation (30) imply that the parameter
d¯ determines the steady-state level of foreign debt (d = d).   ¯ We calibrate d¯ so that the steady-
state level of foreign debt equals the one implied by models 1, 1a, and 2 (see table 2). Finally,
we assign the value 0.00074 to ψ3 , which ensures that this model and model 1 generate the same
volatility in the current-account-to-GDP ratio. This parameter value is almost identical to that
assigned to ψ2 in model 2. This is because the log-linearized versions of models 2 and 3 are
almost identical. Indeed, the models share all equilibrium conditions but the resource constraint
(equations (4) and (29)), the Euler equations associated with the optimal choice of foreign bonds
(equations (24) and (30)), and the interest rate faced by domestic households (equations (13) and
(23)). The log-linearized versions of the resource constraints are the same in both models. The
log-linear approximation to the domestic interest rate is given by 1_ + rt = ψ2 d(1 + r)−1 dt in Model
2 and by 1_ + rt = 0 in Model 3. In turn, the log-linearized versions of the Euler equation for debt
are λt = ψ2 d(1 + r)−1 dt + Et λ                   t = ψ3 ddt + Et λ
                                 t+1 in model 2 and λ                        t+1 in Model 3. It follows that
for small values of ψ2 and ψ3 satisfying ψ2 = (1 + r)ψ3 models 2 and 3 will imply similar dynamics.


5     Model 4: Complete Asset Markets
All model economies considered thus far feature incomplete asset markets. In those models agents
have access to a single financial asset that pays a risk-free real rate of return. In the model studied
in this section, agents have access to a complete array of state-contingent claims. This assumption
per se induces stationarity in the equilibrium dynamics.
    Preferences and technology are as in model 2. The period-by-period budget constraint of the
household is given by
                            Et rt+1 bt+1 = bt + yt − ct − it − Φ(kt+1 − kt ),                      (31)

                                                         7
where bt+1 denotes a random variable indicating the number of assets purchased in period t to be
delivered in each state of period t + 1. The variable rt+1 denotes the period-t price of an asset that
pays one unit of good in a particular state of period t +1 divided by the probability of occurrence of
that state given information available in period t. Households are also subject to a no-Ponzi-game
constraint of the form
                                          lim Et qt+j bt+j ≥ 0,                                   (32)
                                          j→∞

at all dates and under all contingencies. The variable qt represents the period-zero price of one unit
of good to be delivered in a particular state of period t divided by the probability of occurrence of
that state given information available at time 0 and is given by

                                             qt = r1 r2 . . . rt ,

with q0 ≡ 1. The first-order conditions associated with the household’s maximization problem
are (5), (6), (25)-(27), (31), and (32) holding with equality and

                                             λt rt+1 = βλt+1 .                                        (33)

A diﬀerence between this expression and the Euler equations that arise in the models with incom-
plete asset markets studied in previous sections is that under complete markets in each period t
there is one first-order condition for each possible state in period t + 1, whereas under incomplete
markets the above Euler equation holds only in expectations.
    In the rest of the world, agents have access to the same array of financial assets as in the
domestic economy. Consequently, one first-order condition of the foreign household is an equation
similar to (33). Letting starred letters denote foreign variables or functions, we have

                                            λ∗t rt+1 = βλ∗t+1 .                                       (34)

Note that we are assuming that domestic and foreign households share the same subjective discount
factor. Combining the domestic and foreign Euler equations–equations (33) and (34)–yields
                                              λt+1  λ∗
                                                   = t+1 .
                                               λt    λ∗t
This expression holds at all dates and under all contingencies. This means that the domestic
marginal utility of consumption is proportional to its foreign counterpart. Formally,

                                                λt = ξλ∗t ,

where ξ is a constant parameter determining diﬀerences in wealth across countries. We assume
that the domestic economy is small. This means that λ∗t must be taken as an exogenous variable.
Because we are interested only in the eﬀects of domestic productivity shocks, we assume that λ∗t is
constant and equal to λ∗ , where λ∗ is a parameter. The above equilibrium condition then becomes

                                                 λt = ψ4 ,                                            (35)

where ψ4 ≡ ξλ∗ is a constant parameter.
   A competitive equilibrium is a set of processes {ct , ht , yt , it , kt+1 , λt }∞
                                                                                   t=0 satisfying (5), (6),
(25)-(27), and (35), given (14), A0 , and k0 .
   The functions U , F , and Φ are parameterized as in the previous models. The parameters γ, β,
ω, α, φ, δ, ρ, and σ take the values displayed in tables 1 and 2. The parameter ψ4 is set so as to
ensure that the steady-state level of consumption is the same in this model as in models 1 to 3.

6       Model 5: The Non-Stationary Case
For comparison with the models considered thus far, in this section we describe a version of the
small open economy model that displays no stationarity. In this model (a) The discount factor
is constant; (b) the interest rate at which domestic agents borrow from the rest of the world is
constant (and equal to the subjective discount factor); (c) agents face no frictions in adjusting
the size of their portfolios; and (d) markets are incomplete in the sense that domestic households
have only access to a single risk-free international bond. This specification of the model induces
a random walk component in the equilibrium marginal utility of consumption and the net foreign
asset position.
    A competitive equilibrium in the non-stationary model is a set of processes {dt , ct , ht , yt , it ,
kt+1 , rt , λt }∞
                t=0 satisfying (4)-(7), (13), and (24)-(27) all holding with equality, given (14), A0 , d−1 ,
and k0 . We calibrate the model using the parameter values displayed in tables 1 and 2.


7       Quantitative Results
Table 3 displays a number of unconditional second moments of interest observed in the data and
implied by models 1 - 4.2 In all moments, we compute the equilibrium dynamics by solving a
log-linear approximation to the set of equilibrium conditions.3 Although the focus of the paper is
not to assess the models’ abilities to match the data, as a reference we include in the first column
of the table the observed second moments using Canadian data. As pointed out by Mendoza
(1991), the small open real business cycle model captures a number of features of business cycles
in Canada. Specifically, as in the data, all four models predict the following ranking of volatilities,
in ascending order, consumption, output, and investment. The models also correctly predict that
the components of aggregate demand and hours are procyclical, and that the correlation of the
trade balance with GDP is close to zero.4 The models overestimate the procyclicality of labor.
In the data the correlation between hours and output is 0.8, whereas the models imply a perfect
correlation. This implication of the models is driven by the assumed preference and technology
specification. In eﬀect, using the assumed Cobb-Douglas form of the production function we can
write equation (15), which holds for all models, as hωt = (1 − α)yt . Log-linearizing this expression
we get ωht = yt , where a circumflex over a variables denotes its log-deviation from the steady-state
value. It follows that corr( ht , yt )= 1.
    The main result of this paper is that regardless of how stationarity is induced in the small open
economy real business cycle model, the model’s predictions regarding second moments are virtually
identical. This result is evident from table 3. The only noticeable diﬀerence arises in model 4, the
complete markets case, which as expected predicts less volatile consumption. The low volatility
of consumption in the complete markets model introduces an additional diﬀerence between the
predictions of this model and models 1-3. Because consumption is smoother in model 4, its role in
determining the cyclicality of the trade balance is smaller. As a result, model 4 predicts that the
correlation between output and the trade balance is positive, whereas models 1-3 imply that it is
negative.
    Figure 1 demonstrates that models 1-5 also imply virtually identical impulse response functions
    2
     Model 5 is nonstationary, and thus does not have well defined unconditional second moments.
    3
     The Matlab computer code used to compute the unconditional second moments and impulse response functions
presented in this section is available at www.econ.upenn.edu/∼uribe.
   4
     Indeed, models 1-3 predict correctly that the trade balance is countercyclical. The correlation is so close to
zero, however, that its sign does depend on the solution method employed. Mendoza, for example, approximates the
solution to model 1 by discretizing the state space and finds a small but positive correlation.

to a technology shock. Each panel shows the impulse response of a particular variable in the
six models. For all variables but consumption and the trade-balance-to-GDP ratio, the impulse
response functions are so similar that to the naked eye the graph appears to show just a single line.
Again, the only small but noticeable diﬀerence is given by the responses of consumption and the
trade-balance-to-GDP ratio in the complete markets model. In response to a positive technology
shock, consumption increases less when markets are complete than when markets are incomplete.
This in turn, leads to a smaller decline in the trade balance in the period in which the technology
shock occurs.


8     Sensitivity Analysis
8.1   Alternative Preference Specification
Thus far, the analysis has focused on a specification of preferences that implies that the labor
supply is unaﬀected by variations in household wealth. This type of preferences is commonplace in


                                                  11
models of the small open economy. Nevertheless, it is of interest to investigate the extent to which
the results reported above are robust to the introduction of preferences implying a wealth eﬀect in
labor supply. To this end, we consider a period utility function of the form
                                            J ω           o1−γ
                                             c (1 − h)1−ω      −1
                                 U (c, h) =                       .
                                                    1−γ
Under these preferences, the marginal rate of substitution between consumption and leisure is given
by
                                      Uh (c, h)    1−ω c
                                    −            =            .
                                       Uc (c, h)     ω 1−h
This marginal rate of substitution depends on the level of consumption, whereas that implied by
the previously considered preferences does not.
   For models featuring an endogenous discount factor (models 1 and 1a), we now assume that
                                             J                  o−ψ1
                                    β(c, h) = 1 + cω (1 − h)1−ω      .

    We set the parameter ω at a value consistent with a steady-state value of h of 0.2. This
value for steady-state hours is commonly used in the real-business-cycle literature and implies that
households allocate on average twenty percent of their time to the labor market. As in Mendoza
(1991), we assume that the steady-state trade-balance-to-GDP ratio is 2 percent. This long-run
restriction pins down the parameter ψ1 in models 1 and 1a, the parameter d¯ in models 2 and 3, the
steady state level of consumption in model 4, and the initial wealth position in model 5. We set the
parameters ψ2 and ψ3 in models 2 and 3 so as to capture the observed volatility of the Canadian
current-account-to-gdp ratio. Finally, as before, the standard deviation of the productivity shock is
set so as to match the observed volatility of Canadian GDP and the adjustment cost parameter (φ)
is set so as to match the standard deviation of Canadian investment. All other parameter values
are those used earlier. Table 4 summarizes the calibration of the model.

                           Table 4: Wealth Elastic Labor Supply: Calibration
                γ    ω            ψ               α         φ       r     δ     ρ       σ
                2   0.22       ψ1 =0.08          0.32     0.084   0.04   0.1   0.42   0.0103
                            ψ2 = ψ3 = 0.001

    Table 5 and figure 2 present a comparison of unconditional second moments and impulse re-
sponses implied by the five models under the new preference specification. Overall, the match
between the model and the data is worse than under the baseline preference specification. More
relevant for the purpose of this paper is the fact that, as in the case in which labor supply is
independent of wealth, models 1 through 4 behave quite similarly. The only noticeable diﬀerence
is again introduced by the behavior of consumption in the complete asset market model.5

8.2    Stationarity and Speed of Convergence
The modifications to the standard small open economy model studied in this paper induce sta-
tionarity. That is, they eliminate the unit root in net foreign assets and consumption. But these
stationarity-inducing mechanisms also aﬀect the speed with which the economy is expected to revert
  5
   The perfect correlation between consumption and output in model 4 would disappear if shocks to the external
marginal utility of consumption were present.

to the steady state in response to stationary shocks. In the remainder of this section we explore the
connection between stationarity and mean reversion. We begin by studying a simple economy that
whose linearized equilibrium conditions can be solved analytically. We then perform a quantitative
analysis using the fully fledged IRBC framework presented above.
    Consider a small, open, endowment economy populated by a large number of identical house-
holds with preferences given by
                                               3∞
                                            E0     θt ln ct                                      (36)
                                                    t=0

                                                    θ0 = 1
                                               θt+1 = β(c̃t )θt ,
where θt denotes the discount factor, ct denotes consumption in period t, and E0 is the mathematical
expectation operator given information at time 0. The discount factor is assumed to depend on
the average per capita level of consumption, c̃t , which the representative household takes as given.


                                                      14
The household faces a period-by-period budget constraint of the form

                                        dt = (1 + r)dt−1 + ct − yt                                 (37)

where dt denotes foreign debt, r denotes the world interest rate, and yt denotes the endowment
income. Income is assumed to follow a first-order autoregressive process

                             (yt+1 − ȳ) = ρ(yt − ȳ) +    t+1 ;   ρ ∈ (−1, 1),                    (38)

where t distributes N IID(0, σ 2 ). In each period t ≥ 0, households are subject to the following
no-Ponzi-game constraint:
                                     lim Et (1 + r)−j dt+j ≤ 0.                              (39)
                                        j→∞

The household chooses ct and dt so as to maximize (36) subject to the period-by-period budget
constraint (37) and the no-Ponzi-game condition (39). The first-order conditions associated with
the household’s maximization problem are (37), (39) holding with equality, and
                                         1                       1
                                            = (1 + r)β(c̃t )Et      .
                                         ct                    ct+1
In equilibrium we have that c̃t = ct . Assume the following functional form for the discount factor

                                               (1 + ct − c)−ψ
                                    β(ct ) =                  ;    ψ ≥ 0,
                                                   1+r
where c is some positive constant. Then a competitive equilibrium is a pair of stochastic processes
{ct , dt } satisfying (37), (39) holding with equality, and
                                       1                        1
                                          = (1 + ct − c)−ψ Et      ,
                                       ct                     ct+1
given d−1 and the exogenous stochastic process for the endowment defined in equation (38). Let
d¯ = (ȳ − c̄)/r. If ψ > 0, the pair {c̄, d}
                                          ¯ is the non-stochastic steady state of the economy. Note that
the steady state is independent of initial conditions, so that the expected long-run levels of foreign
debt and consumption are also independent of the initial stock of foreign debt. In this sense, the
model is stationary. Linearizing the equilibrium conditions and the endowment process around the
               ¯ yields
point {c̄, ȳ, d}

                                    Et ĉt+1 = (1 − ψc̄)ĉt
                                          dˆt = (1 + r)dˆt−1 + ĉt − ŷt
                                    Et ŷt+1 = ρŷt

where x̂t ≡ xt − x̄. This is a system of three linear expectational diﬀerence equations with two
predetermined variables, foreign debt and the endowment. The non-explosive solution to this
system is
                                                            1−ρ
                             dˆt = (1 − ψc̄) dˆt−1 −                   ŷt
                                                       r + ψc̄ + 1 − ρ

                              ĉt   = −(r + ψc̄)dˆt−1 +                  ŷt

If ψ = 0, the equilibrium law of motion of net foreign debt displays a unit root. In this case the
discount factor is constant and equal to 1/(1 + r). The expected long-run level of foreign debt

given information at time 0 is limt→∞ E0 dt = d−1 − 1/(r + 1 − ρ)ŷ0 . This implies that the expected
long-run level of foreign debt (and with it consumption) depends on the initial level of foreign debt
and the initial realization of the endowment shock. Therefore, temporary shocks have permanent
eﬀects on the level of consumption and foreign debt. In this sense the model is non-stationary.
Local approximation techniques are therefore invalid.
    For positive values of ψ that are close to 0, the coeﬃcient on dˆt−1 in the equation giving
the evolution of dˆt is less than one and thus the equilibrium process for external debt is mean
reverting. Moreover, the speed of mean reversion increases with the value of ψ. Also in response
to innovations in output the change in dt is smaller the larger is ψ. Similarly, the speed of mean
reversion in consumption is also enhanced by higher values of ψ. However, the initial impact of an
output shock on consumption is larger the larger is ψ. The intuition behind these results is simple.
In this economy agents become more impatient as consumption increases. Thus, as the elasticity
of the discount factor increases, they are willing to trade oﬀ a higher impact eﬀect of an output
shock on consumption for a faster return to the steady state. Figure 3 illustrates this trade-oﬀ. It
depicts the impulse response of debt and consumption to a unit innovation in output in period 1
for two alternative values of the parameter ψ measuring the sensitivity of the discount factor with
respect to consumption.
    To illustrate how the parameters determining stationarity aﬀect the speed of mean reversion in
the context of a more realistic model with endogenous labor supply and capital accumulation, we

plot in figure 4 the impulse response of model 2 (debt elastic interest rate) to a productivity shock
for alternative values of ψ2 , measuring the elasticity of the country premium with respect to foreign
debt. We consider three diﬀerent values of ψ2 : 0.000742 (the baseline value), 0.000742×10, and
0.000742/10. It is evident from the figure that altering this parameter within a wide range around
the baseline value does not aﬀect the quantitative predictions of the model in significant ways. We
do not choose models 1 or 1a (endogenous discount factor) for this sensitivity analysis because in
these models the parameter ψ1 , governing the stationarity of the model, also aﬀects the steady-state
level of consumption and external debt. This problem does not arise in the simple version of model
1a considered above in this section. In that model, consumption and net foreign debt appear to be
more sensitive to wide variations in the parameter ψ controlling the stationarity of the model (see
figure 3). Of course, although both ψ and ψ2 determine the stationarity of their respective models,
changes in their calibrated values are not directly comparable. Performing the sensitivity analysis
with model 3 (portfolio adjustment costs) delivers identical results to those presented in figure 4.
Finally, model 4 (complete asset markets) does not feature a parameter governing stationarity, and
thus it does not lend itself to the type of sensitivity analysis conducted here.

9    Conclusion
In this paper, we present five alternative ways of making the small open economy real business
cycle model stationary: two versions of an endogenous discount factor, a debt-contingent interest
rate premium, portfolio adjustment costs, and complete asset markets. The main finding of the
paper is that once all five models are made to share the same calibration, their quantitative predic-
tions regarding the behavior of key macroeconomic variables, as measured by unconditional second
moments and impulse response functions, is virtually identical. We conclude that if the reason for
modifying the canonical nonstationary small open economy model in any of the ways presented in
the present study is simply technical, that is, solely aimed at introducing stationarity so that the
most commonly used numerical approximation methods can be applied and unconditional second
moments can be computed, then in choosing a particular modification of the model the researcher
should be guided by computational convenience. In other words, the researcher should choose the
variant of the model he finds easiest to approximate numerically. In this respect model 1, featuring
an endogenous discount factor a la Uzawa (1968) is in disadvantage vis a vis the other models. For
its equilibrium conditions contain an additional state variable.
    A second result of our paper is that, in line with results previously obtained in the context
of two-country real-business-cycle models by Kollmann (1996) and Baxter and Crucini (1995),
whether asset markets are complete or incomplete makes no significant quantitative diﬀerence.
    This paper could be extended in several dimensions. One would be to allow for additional
sources of uncertainty, such as domestic demand shocks (i.e., government purchases and preference
shocks) and external shocks (i.e., terms-of-trade and world-interest-rate shocks). A second possible
extension is to consider other characteristics of the business cycle along which to compare the various
models, such as frequency decompositions. Finally, one could study additional stationarity induces
variations of the small open economy model. For example, Cardia (1991) and Ghironi (2001)
among others bring about stationarity by introducing overlapping generations with perpetually
young agents á la Blanchard (1985).
