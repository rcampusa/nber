                                           ABSTRACT



Data revisions and the availability of a longer sample offer the opportunity to reconsider the
empirical findings that suggest that in the OECD countries national saving responds
non-monotonically to fiscal policy. The paper confirms that the circumstance most likely to give rise
to a non-monotonic response of national saving to a fiscal impulse is a "large and persistent
impulse", defined as one in which the full employment surplus, as a percent of potential output,
changes by at least 1.5 percentage points per year over a two-year period. This particular
circumstance remains the only statistically significant one even when we allow for non-monotonic
responses to arise when public debt is growing rapidly or interest rate spreads are widening. We find
that non-monotonic responses are similar for fiscal contractions and expansions. In particular, an
increase in net taxes has no effect on national saving during large fiscal contractions or expansions.
For government consumption there is a large, albeit in some specifications less then complete, offset
during expansions or contractions.

1. Introduction
The idea that fiscal consolidation can bear fruit in the short term is controversial. Not long ago,
the Financial Times described the situation very well: “In one corner we have the political left,
armed with a multiplier, and in the other we have the right, armed with a Laffer curve. The left
insists that increased public spending boosts output via demand — the famous multiplier effect.
The right asserts that tax cuts and curbs on public spending stimulate private sector effort via
supply.”

       Commenting on this remark in the FT, Rodrigo de Rato, the Managing Director of the IMF,
appropriately observed that the subject is much more complicated than that: “It is true that the
starting point should be the standard Keynesian tenet that fiscal adjustment is contractionary.
However, some years ago, in a surprising departure from this orthodox stance, Giavazzi and
Pagano (1990) pointed to Denmark and Ireland in the 1980s as examples of expansionary fiscal
contractions, as their respective fiscal adjustments were followed immediately by an increase in
growth. Their explanation was firmly rooted in the tradition of the turnaround in rational
expectations. The argument is that a decisive policy for reducing both the fiscal deficit and high
levels of indebtedness can shore up market confidence and create expectations among the public
                       1
about future income.”

      The possibility that fiscal contractions may be a source of economic growth immediately
attracts those who doubt the effectiveness of traditional Keynesian fiscal policies, arguing that
many empirical studies have shown the limited magnitude of fiscal multipliers, and point to many
instances, above all in the case of Japan, where the response of the economy to a fiscal expansion
has been weak or non-existent. But how common are expansionary fiscal contractions, or
contractionary expansions, and when do they occur? This question has induced many institutions,
including the IMF, the OECD and the European Commission, to take a closer look at episodes, in
particular of expansionary fiscal contractions.

      In previous work, we search for the circumstances in which the private sector response to
fiscal policy impulses is non-monotonic (Giavazzi and Pagano, 1990 and 1996; Giavazzi, Pagano
and Jappelli, 2000, GJP from now on). The results drawn from the experience of OECD countries
show that a non-monotonic response is more likely to arise when fiscal impulses are large and
persistent and that non-monotonic effects are larger and more precisely estimated for changes in
net taxes than for changes in public consumption.

      In this paper we reconsider, extend and update the evidence analyzed in GJP. There are
several reasons to extend and update our previous results. First of all, the data used in GJP ended
in 1996. Eight more years of data have since become available, and these include several new
episodes of fiscal contractions and expansions: among them the fiscal contractions in Europe to
meet the Maastricht criteria in the run-up to EMU and the subsequent fiscal expansions in 2000-
02; the Japanese fiscal expansion that lasted through most of the 1990s; the U.S. fiscal expansion

during the first Bush administration. By extending the sample, we are able to increase from 109
to 128 the number of episodes characterized by a “large and persistent fiscal impulse”, defined in
GJP as one in which the full employment surplus, as a percent of potential output, changes by at
least 1.5 percentage points per year over a two-year period. The updated sample includes 5 more
“large and persistent” contractions and 14 more “large and persistent” expansions with respect to
GJP.

      Secondly, since GJP was written, the OECD has revised backwards some of the relevant
series. In particular its measure of the cyclically adjusted primary budget surplus has changed
significantly, as the correlation between the old and the new series between 1970 to 1996, the
original sample, is 0.874. Some of the episodes of large and persistent fiscal impulse considered
in GJP have thus disappeared from the sample, replaced by a few new ones. The series for
potential output has also been revised, as have other variables. It is thus interesting in itself to
check whether the original results survive when using the revised data.

      Finally, we check the robustness of the results by allowing for a different source of non-
monotonic response of national savings to fiscal impulses: the possible role of the risk premium
on government bonds — either exchange rate risk premium or default risk. This channel is
suggested by the findings in Ardagna (2004) and by models of debt default (Blanchard, 1990)
and liquidity (Caballero and Krisnhamurty, 2004).

      Our findings suggest, in a nutshell, that the hypothesis of a non-monotonic response of
national savings to fiscal impulses is confirmed in the updated and revised OECD dataset. They
also confirm that the circumstance most likely to give rise to a non-monotonic response of
national saving is a “large and persistent fiscal impulse”, defined as one in which the full
employment surplus, as a percent of potential output, changes by at least 1.5 percentage points
per year over a two-year period. On the other hand, fiscal impulses that are “relatively small”
tend to be associated with Keynesian effects.

      The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We survey the relevant literature in Section 2,
present the data in Section 3, report the econometric estimates in Section 4 and summarize the
results in Section 5.


2. What have we learnt from the analysis of large fiscal adjustments ?
A recent study by the European Commission covering 14 EU countries in the period 1970-2002
finds that roughly half of the 49 episodes of fiscal consolidation they identify, have been
followed by an acceleration in growth (Giudice et al., 2003). This result is robust with respect to
the criteria used to identify the consolidation episodes and to classify such episodes as
expansionary. Using the Commission’s macroeconomic model (QUEST) to understand the
mechanisms that could give rise to an output expansion, they conclude that the source of non-
Keynesian effects mostly lies in the response of private consumption to expected future income.




                                                 2
      Similar work at the Central Bank of Poland (Rzonca and Cizkowicz, 2005) looks at seven
episodes of strong fiscal adjustment (in this case both expansions and contractions) that occurred
since the mid-90’s in eight new EU member countries: Estonia, the Czech Republic, Hungary,
Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia. The paper finds evidence that
discretionary fiscal consolidation “contributes substantially to the acceleration of output growth
even in the short run”, but is unable to identify unambiguously the channels through which non-
Keynesian effects occur.

      The IMF has also looked at the effects of large fiscal consolidations — measured as a
cumulative primary fiscal adjustment of more than 5 percent of GDP — and concluded that they
appear to be associated quite frequently with a positive macroeconomic response (Martinez,
2004). The study covers more than 160 countries in the last 30 years and identifies 155 episodes
of large fiscal adjustment. About 40 percent of these episodes were linked to an upturn in short-
term growth — although it is once again difficult to identify the likely sources of the observed
output expansion.

      Work at the OECD has examined the extent to which fiscal policy actions may be offset by
simultaneous, anticipatory changes in private saving, as well as the determinants of that offset
(De Mello et al, 2004). Based on a sample of 21 OECD countries spanning the period 1970-2002,
the study finds strong evidence of partial, yet substantial, offsetting movements in private saving.
The overall offset is estimated at between about one-third and one-half, depending on model
specification, and applies both to public consumption and to shifts in tax revenue. The
magnitudes of these estimated offsets suggest that, in response to a fiscal tightening of
approximately 5 per cent of GDP - comparable to that of the OECD area as a whole during the
upturn that occurred between 1993- and 2000 — private saving is expected to fall by about 2½
per cent of GDP over the period. The effect on national saving of a fiscal easing of this
magnitude is therefore of a rise of about 2½ per cent of GDP, other things equal. The saving
offset appears to be greater over the longer term, with changes in fiscal stance being almost
totally offset by changes in private saving, leaving national saving largely unaffected.

      As for the conditions under which such effects are more likely to occur, the OECD paper
finds that: (i) private saving offsets appear to have been somewhat lower at higher levels of
indebtedness; (ii) the revenue/expenditure composition of the fiscal shift matters for the private
saving offset; (iii) private saving appears to respond in relatively equal proportion to changes in
current revenue and expenditure, but public investment does not elicit an offsetting response of
saving.

      Investigating the response of consumers to a fiscal impulse, Giavazzi and Pagano (1996)
find that private consumption appears to respond in a non-monotonic way to fiscal impulses.
Their results suggest that such non-monotonic effects tend to be associated with large and
persistent fiscal impulses, and appear to be stronger for fiscal contractions than for fiscal
expansions.2 While in normal times an increase in net taxes (that is, taxes net of government

2
  There are several explanations for such non-monotonic effects. Spending cuts or tax increases can produce an
increase in private consumption only if they raise the market value of non-human wealth or consumers’ perception of



                                                        3
transfers) tends to depress consumption, during large fiscal contractions the effect on
consumption of an increase in net taxes is not statistically different from zero. For government
spending they find that an increase (a cut) in public spending stimulates (lowers) consumption in
normal times, but reduces (raises) it during a large fiscal impulse.

       GJP (Giavazzi, Jappelli and Pagano 2000) also study the response of consumers to a fiscal
impulse, but from a slightly different angle, that is looking at the effects of fiscal policy on
national savings. This allows them to interpret the results with reference to the predictions of
Ricardian equivalence. As is well known, models with infinite horizons imply that (for a given
level of government spending) taxes and transfers have no effect on national saving; that is, the
Ricardian proposition holds. On the other hand, the standard overlapping generations model with
finite horizon predicts that an increase in taxes (or a reduction in transfers) raises national saving.
But the sign and size of the effect of fiscal policy on national saving might also depend on the
level and sustainability of government debt, on the size and persistence of the fiscal impulse, or
on the change in composition of the budget. In some situations (for instance in the model
described in Blanchard, 1990) an increase in net taxes may even produce a decline in national
saving, by generating a boom in private consumption.

      GJP search systematically for the circumstances in which national saving responds non-
monotonically to fiscal policy impulses, using two dataset, one which includes OECD countries,
another which looks instead at emerging market economies. The results drawn from the OECD
sample show that a non-monotonic response of national saving is more likely to arise when fiscal
impulses are large and persistent and that non-monotonic effects on national saving are larger and
more precisely estimated for changes in net taxes than for changes in public consumption.
Furthermore, non-monotonic effects also appear to be asymmetric, and stronger and more
precisely estimated for fiscal contractions than for fiscal expansions; in particular, during large
fiscal contractions an increase in net taxes has little or no effect on national saving. They also
find that a rapidly growing public debt is not, per se, a good predictor of non-monotonic
responses.

    These findings about the effect of the size and composition of the fiscal impulse are not
entirely consistent with those found in other studies. Alesina and Perotti (1995, 1997) and
Alesina and Ardagna (1998) find that the private sector response is larger if the budget is cut by
slashing public sector wages and reducing social security benefits, rather than by raising taxes
and cutting public investment. Along the same lines, Ardagna (2004) finds that fiscal adjustments
effected by government spending cuts and generating a permanent and substantial decrease in
government debt are associated with larger reductions in interest rates and increases in stock
market prices — thus suggesting that the increase in the market value of non-human wealth is the
channel through which such fiscal impulses raise output growth. Perotti (1999) finds that the

their permanent income. Changes in permanent income depend on expectations. A spending cut that is sufficiently
large and believed to be persistent can signal a future reduction in the tax burden, and therefore an increase in
permanent disposable income (A point first made in Feldstein, 1982). But even small changes in public spending
could produce large changes in private consumption in the opposite direction if they signal a change in regime or are
sufficient to bring the economy over a critical threshold., as in the model of Bertola and Drazen (1993). See
Giavazzi, Jappelli and Pagano (2000) for a review of various model that produce these results.

outcome of a consolidation is more likely to be expansionary when public debt is high or growing
rapidly, but De Mello et al. (2004), as mentioned above, report findings that are more consistent
with the results shown in GJP.

       Finally, the presence of credit market imperfections constraining household borrowing may
also affect the non-monotonic response of saving and consumption to fiscal policy. A non-
monotonic response of private consumption and saving to a large and persistent fiscal contraction
requires well-functioning household credit markets. Consider the case of a large increases in net
taxes that leads households to update the estimate of their permanent income: if the household is
prevented from borrowing against the expectation of higher future income, it will be unable to
increase its actual spending. Ferraro (2005) tests whether the non-monotonic response of national
saving depends on the ease with which households can tap on financial markets and borrow. He
splits the sample in two, distinguishing countries based the maximum “loan-to-value ratio” - the
ratio between the maximum mortgage loan that a typical household could obtain, and the value of
the house for which the loan was extended (reported in Table I of Jappelli and Pagano, 1994). He
finds that non-monotonic effects are more likely to arise in countries characterized by a relatively
high loan-to-value ratio, and are smaller and less precisely estimated in countries with a relatively
lower loan-to-value ratio. This accords with the prediction that the functioning of the market for
household credit affects the presence and magnitude of the non-monotonic effects of fiscal
policy.

      Summarizing, while episodes of contractionary fiscal expansions, and expansionary
contractions, are a rather common finding, there is still disagreement on the conditions under
which a fiscal consolidation can raise output growth — or a fiscal expansion reduce it — and on
the channels through which such effects might occur. Understanding these issues is obviously
essential if one wishes to know which policies might improve the likelihood of a non-Keynesian
outcomes. One purpose of the present paper is to test the robustness of the findings which suggest
that a prerequisite for such non-Keynesian outcomes is the magnitude and persistence of the
fiscal impulse, and that the channel through which fiscal impulses affect the economy is private
consumption.


3. A first look at the data
We start with a visual impression of our data. Figure 1 plots the distribution of the first
differences in the full-employment government surplus scaled by full-employment output.
Positive numbers correspond to fiscal contractions, negative numbers to fiscal expansions. The
sample and OECD countries considered are reported in the Appendix.

       Most fiscal impulses — from one year to the next — are relatively small: contractions and
expansions that do not exceed 1.5 per cent of potential output. But there are many episodes
outside this range, particularly in the case fiscal expansions, and some contractions are as large as
5 per cent of potential output in a single year.




                                                 5
       Our definition of a “large and persistent” fiscal impulse uses a subset of the episodes in the
tails of the distribution reported in Figure 1: those that lie outside the –1.5/+1.5 range, and among
them only those where a change of at least that magnitude has occurred for at least two
subsequent years. This gives us 73 episodes of “large and persistent” fiscal contraction and 55
episodes of “large and persistent” fiscal expansion. The individual episodes are reported in the
Appendix.

                              [INSERT FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE]

     How were these “large and persistent” contractions and expansions implemented? By acting
on revenues, government consumption or public investment? Table 1 compares the growth rate of
net taxes (taxes net of government transfers), of government consumption and of public
investment (each defined as a fraction of potential output) in years characterized by large
contractions and large expansions, relative to normal times.

     Fiscal expansions are typically driven by large reduction in taxes (relative to normal times)
and by some growth in expenditure, both investment and consumption (also relative to normal
times). But tax cuts account for the lion’s share in a fiscal expansion. Instead, when governments
slash the budget, they mostly do it by cutting public investment. During a typical contraction the
growth rate of public investment, as a share of potential output, is 4 percentage points lower than
in normal times. Net taxes increase during a contraction and government consumption falls, but
by a much smaller amount than public investment.

                               [INSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE]

        Figure 2 plots the change in gross national saving during episodes of “large and
persistent” fiscal contraction (in the upper panel) and expansion (in the lower panel). The
“normal” situation would be one in which a fiscal contraction raises national saving, and a fiscal
expansion reduces it. Figure 2 shows that in the majority of episodes national savings is
unaffected by the change in fiscal policy, indicating that private saving offset the change in
public saving one for one. But there are observations on both tails.

       During episodes of large fiscal contraction (the upper panel), although the instances in
which the fiscal contraction raises national savings (along the right-hand tail) are relatively more
frequent, there is some mass in the left-hand tail, indicating episodes in which the offset is more
than one for one. Symmetrically, during episodes of large fiscal expansion (the lower panel) there
is some mass in the right-hand tail, which correspond to episodes where the private sector offset
was more than complete–although once again most of the fiscal expansions appear to lower
national saving (the left tail). The bottom line is that the “normal” response to large fiscal
impulses appears prima facie more frequent in the data, but there are also instances of non-
monotonic responses.

4. Empirical results
We estimate, as in GJP, the following reduced-form equation, whose dependent variable is the
national saving rate as a ratio to potential output:3

    St                S t −1         Yt − Yt*                    Tt                 Tt             Gt                 Gt

                                                                 Yt   *
                                                                                    Yt   *
                                                                                                   Yt   *
                                                                                                                      Yt*

Y* denotes potential output, (Yt - Yt* )/ Yt* the output gap, rt the real interest rate, T/Y* net taxes
(taxes net of government transfers) as a fraction of potential output and G/Y* government
purchases, also as a fraction of potential output.4

        The variable dt is a dummy designed to capture the conditions that may give rise to a non-
monotonic response of national saving to fiscal impulses. Since we want to discriminate across
various conditions that may trigger such non-monotonic response, our specifications include a set
of such dummies, each corresponding to one such condition, rather than a single dummy. One
dummy variable is set equal to 1 during years characterized by a “large and persistent” fiscal
impulse (as in GJP), and 0 otherwise. A second dummy is equal to 1 only if the growth rate of the
ratio of (cyclically adjusted) gross public debt to trend GDP exceeds 4 percent for two
consecutive years (as in Perotti, 1999). A third dummy is 1 only if the change in the spread
between the yield on long-term government bonds denominated in domestic currency and the
yield on U.S. 10-year Treasuries exceeds the sample mean by more than 1.5 standard deviations.
Note that each dummy dt enters equation (1) both interacted with the two fiscal variables and by
itself, to make sure that the interacted variable only captures the effect of the interaction rather
than a possible independent effect of the dummy on national saving.

       In equation (1), the lagged value of the national saving rate is expected to capture the
dynamics of the dependent variable,5 while the output gap should reflect the response of private
saving and of the government surplus to transitory changes in income. The (ex post) real interest
rate is the difference between the domestic short term nominal rate and inflation, based on the

3
  One advantage of using the national saving as dependent variable is that it does not depend on the particular
definition used for private saving. De Mello et al. (2004) find that the estimated offset of private saving depends on
the definition used. For instance, they find lower offset coefficients when using household, rather than private
saving. The finding however is sensitive to the elimination of outliers, suggesting that measurement errors may be
particularly pronounced. Measurement problems are due to the difficulty in accurately demarcating the household
and corporate sectors, given extensive household ownership of businesses via equity and mutual/pension fund
participation. These problems are avoided using national saving as the dependent variable. Furthermore, national
saving is not affected by the redistribution between private and public saving that is induced by the effect of inflation
on the public debt.

  We scale national saving and fiscal variables by potential output to avoid problems of heteroskedasticity. Dividing
by actual rather than potential output would introduce an endogeneity bias due to the correlation between the error
term and the right-hand-side variables.

  Equation (1) only allows for very simple dynamics of national saving. De Mello et al. (2004) use an error
correction model and allow for more complex dynamics in the adjustment towards the long-term equilibrium.



                                                                          7
private consumption deflator. It is introduced to control for the direct effect on saving of changes
in wealth induced by monetary policy. Since the interest rate is potentially endogenous, we use
its lagged value as instrument.

       Finally, following the specification in GJP, all regressions include a full set of country
fixed effects, to account for the possibility that the response of national saving to a fiscal impulse
might depend on the particular characteristics of a country, such as its size and degree of
openness to trade. Understanding the effects of fiscal policy maybe be easier in a small country,
and indeed some of the famous episodes of “non-Keynesian” effects have occurred in small
countries, such as Ireland and Denmark. Countries that trade more, either in goods or in assets,
may be more subject to capital market “discipline”, in the sense that it may be easier for saving to
fly out of the country when fiscal policy looks “bad”.

       One problem in estimating equation (1) is the potential endogeneity of the fiscal variables.
Such endogeneity may arise from two different sources. Because of the automatic stabilizers built
in the existing tax code, tax revenues and government transfers from and to the economy (which
enter our definition of T) fluctuate with the business cycle, and are thus affected by the same
shocks which affect national savings.6 We deal with this first source of endogeneity by using the
full-employment government surplus net of interest payments, as estimated by the OECD, as
instrument for net taxes.

       A second potential source of endogeneity arises from the possibility that the country’s
fiscal rules themselves respond to the business cycle, which in standard models is positively
correlated with national saving. Our instrumental variables procedure does not handle this
potential bias; GJP further discuss how the bias might affect the coefficient estimates.7

       Our data are an unbalanced panel of OECD countries. The sample used in the estimation
and the variables’ definitions are reported in the Appendix. For each regression we report results
for three sample periods. “Up to 1996” defines the sample that is closest to our earlier results and
thus comparable with the regressions reported in GJP, although several series have been revised.
The other two samples – “Up to 2000” and “Up to 2003” – extend our previous results to the
more recent period.


4.1. The effect of fiscal policy during large and persistent fiscal episodes

We start by estimating a benchmark specification where we do not interact the fiscal variables
with the dummy d, so that the effects of G/Y* and T/Y* are constrained to be linear. Which signs
6
   Government consumption, on the contrary, is unlikely to fluctuate systematically with the business cycle:
fluctuations in unemployment, for instance, affect government transfers, but are unlikely to be correlated with
government purchases of goods and services.
7
  There have been a few attempts at constructing measures of exogenous fiscal policy shocks that are not based on
the full-employment surplus. Blanchard and Perotti (1999) identify tax and spending shocks in U.S. quarterly data by
assuming that implementing fiscal policy changes requires at least one quarter and by relying on historical
information on large discretionary changes in fiscal policy (such as the tax cut in the second quarter of 1975).



                                                         8
should we expect on the coefficients of the fiscal variables? Finite horizon models suggest that an
increase in net taxes should raise national saving ( 1>0), whereas an increase in government
consumption should reduce it ( 1<0). In the benchmark infinite horizon model with lump-sum
taxes, taxes have no effect on national saving ( 1=0): this is the Ricardian equivalence
proposition. Also, in the infinite horizon model, for a given path of pre-tax income, Y,
                                                                        8
government consumption does not affect national saving either ( 1=0) .

         The results are in Table 2. Column (1) uses the sample that is closer to that originally used
in GJP; columns (2) and (3) update the sample to 2000 and 2003, respectively. The coefficient of
T/Y* is positive and statistically different from zero at the 1 percent level in each regression.
When we extend the sample to 2003 the point estimate becomes smaller, but so does the
coefficient of the lagged national saving, so that the long run effect of taxes - estimated as 1/(1-
 1) - is similar in columns 1 and 3 (0.51 and 0.53 respectively).


        Thus, when we constrain the effect of net taxes to be linear ( 2=0), the results run against
the infinite horizon model and are consistent with the predictions of finite horizon models.


                                    [INSERT TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE]

        The coefficient of G/Y* is negative and also statistically different from zero at the 1
percent level in both regressions. Contrary to the predictions of infinite horizon models with non-
distortionary taxes, the fall in private consumption does not fully compensate the increase in
government consumption, thereby reducing national saving. In this case too the point estimate
becomes smaller (in absolute value) when we extend the sample to 2003, but, as in the case of net
taxes, the long-run response is similar.

        The results in Table 2, however, are potentially biased because by omitting the interaction
terms they impose that the response of national saving to fiscal variables is linear. Table 3
investigates this issue and contains the main results of the paper. Each of the three regressions
reported in Table 3 tests the hypothesis that fiscal policy coefficients are stable during periods of
protracted and sizable fiscal impulse or during periods of rapid debt growth. Our hypothesis
(supported by our previous findings) is that non-monotonic responses mostly appear during
episodes of protracted and sizable fiscal impulse, as defined above.

        Consider first the sample up to 1996. In this sample (column 1) the effect of both T/Y* and
G/Y* is highly non-monotonic. During “normal” times, the effect of net taxes on national saving
is positive ( 1 = 0.684), but during sharp shifts in fiscal policy the response of private saving
virtually cancels any effect of public saving on national saving: 1+ 2= 0.684 – 0.665 = 0.019,
and we cannot reject the hypothesis that 1+ 2 =0 (the p-value of the F-test is 0.88). The same
happens for fiscal impulses induced by changes in G/Y*. During “normal” times, an increase in

 Recall that national saving is the difference between national income and total consumption (private plus public): S
= SG + SP = (T-G) + (Y -T -C) = Y - (C+G).



                                                         9
government spending reduces national saving ( 1 = – 1.060) but during sharp shifts in fiscal
policy the response of private saving greatly dampens the fall in national saving: 1+ 2= – 1.060
+ 0.777 = – 0.283; in this case the offset is less than complete, as the hypothesis 1+ 2= 0 is
rejected at the 5 percent confidence level (the p-value of the F-test is 0.027).

        National saving does not appear to respond differently to fiscal impulses carried out by
changing government consumption or net taxes: what matters is the size of the impulse, not its
composition. When we tried to split the “net taxes” variable into “direct plus indirect taxes” and
“transfers” the two coefficients were less precisely estimated, but the results suggest that most of
the action in the “net tax” variables comes from shifts in transfers, confirming one of the findings
in Alesina and Ardagna (1998) — namely that what appears to matter most are changes in social
security rules.

        On the contrary, and confirming the findings in GJP, the coefficient of the dummy for
rapid debt growth, interacted with net taxes or government consumption, is not statistically
different from zero, suggesting that a non-monotonic response of fiscal policy is more likely to
arise when the cyclically adjusted surplus changes significantly, rather then when public debt
grows rapidly.

        Columns (2) and (3), where we extend the sample to 2000 and 2003, respectively, show
that the general pattern of these results survives to the more recent data. The evidence confirms
the full offset of the tax coefficient during large fiscal episodes. In the more recent samples,
contrary to the earlier one, we no longer reject the hypothesis of a full offset of the effect of
government consumption during large fiscal episodes. Finally, the result that rapid debt growth is
not a condition giving rise to a non-monotonic effect of fiscal impulses is confirmed: in none of
these regressions are the interacted coefficients with the dummy for rapid debt statistically
different from zero.


4.2. Are the effects of large contractions different from those of large expansions?

The private sector’s response to a fiscal impulse could differ depending on the sign of the
impulse. To test for the possibility of asymmetric behavior, we interact T/Y* and G/Y* with two
separate dummies, one for large fiscal expansions and one for large fiscal contractions (the two
dummies are then also entered separately). In each regression we keep the dummy for rapid debt
growth interacted with net taxes or government consumption. The results in Table 4 report again
estimates for three samples.

                              [INSERT TABLE 3 ABOUT HERE]

       In column 1 (up to 1996), during episodes of large swings in fiscal policy, private saving
consistently offsets the effects of changes in public saving, independently of whether the fiscal
impulse is an expansion or a contraction. During contractions induced by an increase in taxes the
offset is complete, as we do not reject the hypothesis that taxes do not effect national saving: the



                                                10
sum between the tax coefficients (0.640 – 0.723 = -0.083) is not statistically different from zero
(the p-value of the test is 0.68). In case of fiscal expansions the point estimate of the sum of the
tax coefficients is also close to zero and, again, we don’t reject the hypothesis that during
expansions the difference between the tax coefficients (0.640 – 0.630 = 0.010) is not statistically
different from zero (the p-value of the test is 0.94). These results confirm the original GJP
findings with the updated series.

       During fiscal impulses induced by a change in government spending we find complete
offset during large contractions: the sum of the two coefficients on government spending (–
10.71+0.853=–0.218) is not statistically different from zero. On the other hand, in the case of
expansions induced by large increases in government spending, the offset is less than complete:
the sum of the coefficients (–1.071+0.731=–0.340) is statistically different from zero (the p-value
of the test is 0.033).

       Also when the sample is extended to 2000 and 2003 (columns 2 and 3) we find that the
response of national saving to large fiscal impulses is non-monotonic and symmetric for large
expansions and large contractions. In the case of fiscal impulses induced by large changes in net
taxes the offset is complete both in the case of expansions and contractions; in the case of fiscal
impulses induced by large changes in government spending the offset is complete in the case of
fiscal contractions and, in the sample extending to 2003, also in the case of fiscal expansions.

      Finally, in this specification too the evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that “rapid
debt growth” is not associated with a non-monotonic response of national saving to fiscal
impulses.


4.3. Interest rate spreads

For spending cuts or tax increases to produce a fall in private saving (and viceversa) either the
market value of non-human wealth must rise, or households must anticipate a higher permanent
income. This could happen if fiscal impulses affected households’ expectations. For instance, a
spending cut that is sufficiently large and (believed to be) persistent could signal a future
reduction in the tax burden, and therefore an increase in permanent disposable income (Feldstein,
1982).

      Could there be other circumstances under which a fiscal impulse could induce a change in
households’ estimate of their permanent disposable income? One possibility (discussed in
Blanchard, 1990) is that the response of consumers to fiscal impulses may differ depending on
the perceived sustainability of the fiscal regime. For instance, when the debt-income ratio is
growing rapidly, a fiscal contraction may provide the signal that a debt default will be avoided: it
this may induce a large revision in permanent disposable income.

      The results in Tables 3 and 4 have shown that a rapidly growing debt-GDP ratio is not per
se a condition for the response of national saving to fiscal impulses to be non-monotonic. One



                                                11
possibility is that consumers become concerned about rapid debt growth only when this starts
inducing the risk of a default, in other words only when interest rate spreads start widening.

      In the regressions reported in Table 5 we allow for the possibility that the response of
national saving to fiscal impulses becomes non-monotonic when the change in the spread
between the yield on long-term government bonds denominated in domestic currency and the
yield on U.S. 10-year Treasuries. Such yields reflect either expectations of currency depreciation
or default premia: when the yield widens it thus signals that the markets is becoming more
concerned about fiscal sustainability.9 In this case, our specification includes an additional
dummy that equals 1 when the spread exceeds the sample mean by more than 1.5 standard
deviations, and 0 otherwise. The specifications also include the dummies that were already
present in the regressions of Table 3, and therefore still allow for non-monotonic responses to be
associated with the size and persistence of fiscal impulses and debt growth.

                                    [INSERT TABLE 5 ABOUT HERE]

       The results in Table 5 tend to confirm that the circumstance most likely to give rise to an
offsetting response of private saving remains the size and persistence of the fiscal impulse. The
offset coefficients, however, are much less precisely estimated, possibly because of collinearity
between the dummy for rapid debt growth and the dummy for the widening of spreads. The
dummies set equal to 1 when debt is growing rapidly and when spreads widen are not statistically
different from zero. Distinguishing between expansions and contractions (as in Table 4) does not
change the results.


5. Conclusions
Data revisions and the availability of a longer sample offer the opportunity to reconsider the
empirical findings which suggest that in the OECD countries the response of national savings to
fiscal policy is non-monotonic. Our main results can be summarized as follows.

       Before considering the possibility of a non-monotonic response — that is when we
constrain the effect of net taxes to be linear — we find, contrary to the predictions of infinite
horizon models with non-distortionary taxes, that an increase in taxes raises national saving, and
that an increase in government purchases lowers it.


9
  Caballero and Krisnhamurty (2004) suggests a different reason why the effects of a fiscal expansion might depend
on the response of bond prices. In countries characterized by relatively thin financial markets a fiscal expansion that
is large enough to absorb significant amounts of liquidity will be accompanied by a sharp increase in interest rates
and corresponding reductions in households’ financial wealth. Ardagna (2004) finds that stock market prices surge
around times of substantial fiscal tightening and plunge in periods of very loose fiscal policy — and that such effects
are more likely to occur in country-years with high levels of government deficit, and when consolidations are
implemented by cutting government spending, and that generate a permanent and substantial decrease in government
debt.




                                                         12
        The new data confirms that the circumstance most likely to give rise to a non-monotonic
response of national saving to a fiscal impulse is a “large and persistent impulse”, defined as one
in which the full employment surplus, as a percent of potential output, changes by at least 1.5
percentage points per year over a two-year period. This particular circumstance remains the only
statistically significant one even when we allow for non-monotonic responses to arise when
public debt is growing rapidly or interest rate spreads are widening.

      We find that non-monotonic responses are similar for fiscal contractions and expansions.
In particular, an increase in net taxes has no effect on national saving during large fiscal
contractions or expansions. For government consumption there is a large, albeit in some
specifications less then complete offset during expansions or contractions.

Note. The table reports the yearly percent change in the ratios of taxes and spending to full employment
output (T/Y* and G/Y*) and government investment (I/Y*) during episodes of “large and persistent” fiscal
contractions and expansions. The numbers are deviation from mean growth rate in “normal times”. The
sample period is 1970-2004. Countries included in the estimation and variables’ definitions are reported in
the Appendix.
