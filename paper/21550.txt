Crowding Out in Ricardian Economies

                                              ABSTRACT

The crowding-out coefficient is the ratio of the reduction in privately-issued bonds to the increase
in government bonds that are issued to finance a tax cut. If (1) Ricardian equivalence holds, and (2)
households do not simultaneously borrow risklessly and have positive gross positions in other riskless
assets, the crowding-out coefficient equals the fraction of the aggregate tax cut that accrues to households
that borrow. In the conventional case in which all households receive equal tax cuts, the crowding-out
coefficient equals the fraction of households that borrow. In the United States, about 75% of households
borrow, so the crowding-out coefficient is predicted to be 0.75, which differs from econometric estimates
that are around 0.5. I explore extensions of the model, such as a departure from Ricardian Equivalence
or the introduction of cross-sectional variation in taxes, that might account for this difference.

    In the absence of transactions costs, any individual household could increase
its holdings of riskless government bonds and reduce its holdings of riskless
privately-issued bonds by equal amounts. Such a reallocation of riskless assets
in the individual’s portfolio might be described as government bonds crowding
out an equal value of privately-issued bonds. For an individual household, the
crowding-out coeﬃcient, which is the ratio of the decrease in privately-issued
bonds to the increase in government bonds, equals one. In a closed economy,
however, the household sector as a whole cannot simply increase its aggregate
holdings of government bonds. The aggregate supply of government bonds is
determined by the fiscal actions of the government—in particular, tax cuts or in-
creases in government purchases will increase the amount of government bonds
outstanding, and tax increases or cuts in government purchases will decrease
the amount of government bonds outstanding. I will focus on Ricardian tax
changes, which are lump-sum changes in current taxes accompanied by oﬀset-
ting lump-sum changes in future taxes of equal present value. If Ricardian
Equivalence holds, then a Ricardian tax cut has no eﬀect on consumption, in-
vestment, interest rates, or asset prices. Households will simply use the tax cut
to purchase newly-issued government bonds and then will use these bonds, with
interest, to pay for increased future taxes levied to enable the government to
pay the interest and principal on these bonds. No other net asset positions are
aﬀected and hence it would appear that the crowding-out coeﬃcient is zero.
    In a closed economy, the net supply of privately-issued bonds is zero and
hence if all households are identical, there will be no privately-issued bonds.
Barro and Mollerus (2014) introduce privately-issued bonds in a closed econ-
omy by allowing households to be heterogeneous, so that some households are
borrowers and others are lenders. They present an illuminating numerical ex-
ample in which Ricardian Equivalence holds and yet each additional dollar of
government bonds associated with a Ricardian tax cut will crowd out private
bonds by 50 cents, so that the crowding-out coeﬃcient is 0.5. This exam-
ple clearly refutes the argument above that Ricardian Equivalence implies zero
crowding out.1
    While the value of 0.5 for the magnitude of the crowding-out coeﬃcient is
consistent with the empirical findings of Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgenson
(2013, p.1) and Gorton, Lewellen and Metrick (2012, Table 1), it is important
to note that the value of 0.5 derived by Barro and Mollerus (2014) is simply an
example. At the level of economic theory, their framework, which includes Ri-
cardian Equivalence and the restriction that households cannot simultaneously
borrow and have positive gross holdings of riskless assets, does not pin down
a value of the crowding-out coeﬃcient. In this framework, the crowding out
coeﬃcient equals the fraction of the current aggregate tax cut that accrues to
   1 Incharacterizing the novelty of their finding, they state "what is surprising is that this
equivalence associates with a crowding-out coeﬃcient for private bonds with respect to public
bonds of -0.5, not -1.0." (Barro and Mollerus, 2014, p. 26) However, since their model
displays Ricardian Equivalence, the surprising aspect of their finding is that the crowding-out
coeﬃcient diﬀers from zero.



                                              1
households that borrow. That fraction can, in principle, be anywhere between
0 and 1. As I show in this paper, data from the Federal Reserve’s Survey
of Consumer Finances show that about three quarters of U.S. households bor-
row. Therefore, the crowding-out coeﬃcient in the model is about 0.75, rather
than 0.5, under the conventional assumption that all households receive equal
lump-sum tax cuts.
    Barro and Mollerus (2014) use parametric specifications of household utility
and the evolution of output. Looking beyond the particular parametric speci-
fications, the important features of their model are that Ricardian Equivalence
holds and that any given household cannot simultaneously issue riskless bonds
and hold positive amounts of riskless assets. I adopt these two features but I
do not restrict the analysis to particular parametric specifications of the utility
function or of the evolution of output. I further generalize the analysis in five
ways: (1) rather than assuming equal numbers of borrowers and lenders, I al-
low an arbitrary cross-sectional distribution of riskless asset positions, including
borrowers who have various negative positions in riskless assets and lenders who
have various positive positions in riskless assets; (2) I allow for open as well as
closed economies; (3) I analyze tax increases as well as tax cuts and show that
the crowding-out coeﬃcient for tax increases is greater than or equal to the
crowding-out coeﬃcient for tax cuts; (4) I allow tax cuts that are large enough
to induce some borrowers to become lenders and tax increases that are large
enough to induce some lenders to become borrowers; and (5) I generalize the
notion of Ricardian tax changes to allow for cross-household heterogeneity in
the size of the current lump-sum tax change.
    In a closed economy with identical households, there are no privately-issued
bonds. However, in an open economy with identical households, domestic
households can issue bonds that will be held by foreigners, and domestic tax
cuts can crowd out domestic privately-issued bonds. If all domestic households
choose to issue bonds, then a suﬃciently small bond-financed tax cut will reduce
the amount of bonds issued by domestic households by the amount of the tax
cut; the crowding-out coeﬃcient will be 10. If the tax cut is as large as
the amount of privately-issued bonds initially outstanding, it will completely
eliminate privately-issued bonds and the crowding-out coeﬃcient will also be
10. Larger tax cuts will also eliminate privately-issued bonds, and the amount
of newly-issued government bonds will exceed the reduction in privately-issued
bonds. Thus, the crowding-out coeﬃcient will be less than 10 for suﬃciently
large tax cuts. As I show, the crowding-out coeﬃcient in an open economy
with identical households can be anywhere between zero and one.2
    To examine privately-issued bonds in a closed economy requires relaxing the
assumption of identical households so that some, but not all, households borrow.
I show that if all households receive equal tax cuts, then each additional dollar of
government debt will crowd out privately-issued domestic bonds by an amount
equal to the fraction of domestic households that are borrowers. That is, the
crowding-out coeﬃcent equals the fraction of households that are borrowers. In
  2 More   precisely, it can be any rational number between zero and one.



                                              2
the examples in Barro and Mollerus (2014), half of the households are borrowers,
so the analytic results I derive in this paper indicate that the crowding-out
coeﬃcent is 0.5 in those examples.
    To obtain an empirical measure of the crowding-out coeﬃcient in the model,
both with identical tax changes across households and with cross-household
heterogeneity in tax changes, I use data from the Survey of Consumer Finances
and from the Congressional Budget Oﬃce. I find that in the conventional
case in which all households receive identical small tax cuts, the crowding-out
coeﬃcient, which simply equals the fraction of households that borrow, is 0.75.
Allowing for realistic heterogeneity in tax changes increases the crowding-out
coeﬃcient to 0.85. The values of 0.75 and 0.85 far exceed the empirical value of
0.5 emphasized by Barro and Mollerus (2014). To address this discrepancy, I
introduce a particular departure from Ricardian Equivalence, parametrized by
0 ≤  ≤ 1, where  = 0 represents Ricardian Equivalence and  = 1 represents
the situation in which households do not change their total holdings of riskless
assets at all in response to a bond-financed lump-sum tax cut. It turns out
that  = 13 reconciles the value of the crowding-out coeﬃcient in the model
under the conventional assumption of identical tax changes across households
with empirical estimates of the crowding-out coeﬃcient. With cross-household
heterogeneity in tax changes, a value of  = 0412 reconciles the model with
empirical estimates.
    I describe the menu of safe assets and safe liabilities in Section 1, and ex-
plain the implications of the restriction that individuals will not simultaneously
borrow risklessly and hold riskless assets. In Section 2, I define Ricardian tax
changes, which lead each household to increase its net position in riskless assets
by the amount of the tax cut it receives. I define the crowding-out coeﬃcient
in Section 3, and show that it is weakly decreasing in the size of a Ricardian
tax cut and weakly increasing in the size of a Ricardian tax increase. Section
4 focusses on the conventional case in which all households receive identical tax
cuts. This section also presents a closed-form solution for the crowding-out co-
eﬃcient in open economies populated by identical households who borrow from
foreign lenders. In Section 5, I introduce a class of non-Ricardian economies
parametrized by a scalar that measures the departure from Ricardian Equiv-
alence. In Section 6, I use data from the Survey of Consumer Finances to
measure the model’s crowding-out coeﬃcient if all households receive identical
tax cuts. To analyse the crowding-out coeﬃcient when there is cross-sectional
variation in tax cuts, I also use data from the Congressional Budget Oﬃce on
the share of total Federal taxes paid by each quintile of income. Section 7
presents concluding remarks.


1     Riskless Assets Held by Households
Consider an open economy populated by a unit measure of domestic households
indexed by  ∈ [0 1]. All households of a given type  are identical in all respects.
They have identical preferences and have identical opportunities to earn income


                                          3
and to hold assets and issue liabilities. Each household optimally chooses
consumption and saving and a portfolio of assets that may include both riskless
and risky assets and liabilities. In particular, households can hold government
bonds, which are riskless and can issue riskless liabilities in the form of bonds.
There are no binding constraints on the intertemporal allocation of consumption
and Ricardian Equivalence holds.3 That is, a bond-financed lump-sum cut in
current taxes that is oﬀset by a riskless future lump-sum tax increase of equal
present value will have no eﬀect on consumption or asset prices; it will, however,
increase households’ net positions in riskless assets by an amount equal to the
tax cut received.
    Let  () be the net holding of riskless assets (described below) held by
households of type . Households with   R     ()  0 are borrowers. Define the
measure  () of households so that ()0  () is the fraction of households
that are borrowers, that is, issuers of riskless private bonds.
    Domestic households of type  may hold four types of riskless assets in the
following amounts: (1)  () ≥ 0 of riskless domestic government bonds, where
the non-negativity constraint reflects the fact that households cannot issue gov-
ernment bonds and the assumption that they cannot short government bonds;
(2)  () of riskless private bonds issued by domestic households. For domestic
households that hold these bonds as assets, their net holdings are  ()  0, and
for domestic households that issue these bonds as liabilities, their net holdings
are  ()  0; (3)  () ≥ 0 of other domestic riskless assets (the superscript
 denotes assets in the home country), such as riskless physical assets, where
the non-negativity constraint reflects the assumption that households cannot
short physical assets; and (4)  () ≥ 0 of foreign riskless assets, including
foreign-issued riskless bonds, where the non-negativity constraint reflects the
assumption that domestic households cannot short foreign assets. Of course,
households in an open economy can issue their own riskless bonds, which could
be held by foreign agents; such bonds would appear as negative values of  ()
for domestic households.
    Household ’s overall holding of riskless assets,  (), is

                       () =  () +  () +  () +  () ,                        (1)

where
                            () ≥ 0  () ≥ 0  () ≥ 0.                           (2)
All four riskless assets pay their owners the same interest rate. Therefore,
a household’s allocation of a given positive total amount of riskless assets,
 ()  0, among non-negative holdings of the four types of riskless assets is
indeterminate. However, I follow Barro and Mollerus (2014) and assume that
individual households will never borrow and lend simultaneously.4 Therefore,
   3I will not specify the utility function other than that utility is an increasing concave
function of the household’s consumption and does not depend directly on taxes per se or asset
holdings per se.
   4 Barro and Mollerus (2014, p. 26) assume that "there is an infinitesimal amount of trans-




                                             4
 () cannot be negative if any of the other holdings of riskless assets,  (),
 (), and  (), are positive. That is,

                                      ()  () ≥ 0                                        (3)

                                       ()  () ≥ 0                                       (4)
and
                                       ()  () ≥ 0                                      (5)

Lemma 1 Assume that equations (2), (3), (4), and (5) hold.

   1. If  ()  0 , then  () =  ()  0 and

   2. If  () ≤ 0, then  () =  () ≤ 0.

   Lemma 1 implies that a household is a borrower, that is, an issuer of private
bonds, if and only if its net holding of riskless assets is negative. Therefore,
the aggregate amount of riskless bonds issued by domestic households is
                                Z
                         ≡ −           ()  () ≥ 0                   (6)
                                        ()0

    Statement 2 of Lemma 1 directly implies the following corollary, which states
that the aggregate amount of riskless bonds issued by domestic households,   ,
equals the negative of the aggregate value of the net positions in riskless assets
of households with  ()  0.

                                                                                      ()  ().

    In a closed economy, every outstanding privately-issued bond is the liability
                                                                           R1
of some household
                R  and an asset of otherR some other household. Therefore, 0  ()  () =
0, so   ≡ − ()0  ()  () = ()≥0  ()  (). That is, in a closed
economy, the amount of privately-issued riskless bonds can be measured ei-
ther as the aggregate amount of these bonds issued by domestic borrowers
or as the aggregate amount of these bonds held by domestic lenders. In an
open economy, some domestically-issued
                         R1                 private riskless bonds may be held by
foreign holders, so that 0  ()  () ≤ 0. Therefore, in an open economy,
action costs for bond issuance or collection of interest and principal" that prevents individual
households from simultaneously borrowing and lending. Under such costs, households may
avoid vanishingly small positive or negative positions in riskless assets and their positions in
riskless assets may be insensitive to vanishingly small tax changes. To avoid that potential
insensitivity, one could assume that households incur a fixed cost if they hold both positive
and negative gross positions in riskless assets but do not incur these costs if they hold only
one of the these gross positions. That assumption is tantamount to simply assuming that
no households simultaneously borrow and lend riskless assets, and I will simply adopt that
assumption here.

the aggregate

ing of these bonds by domestic lenders, ()≥0  ()  (), because foreigners
may hold some of these privately-issued domestic bonds.5

2        Ricardian Tax Changes
Consider a tax change that reduces the current lump-sum taxes taxes paid
by each household of type  by  () and increases that household’s future
lump-sum taxes by an amount with present value known to equal  (), where
 ()  0. The factor  () allows for cross-sectional variation in the size of the
current Rtax cut received by households of diﬀerent types. I will normalize  ()
so that  ()  () = 1, which implies that the aggregate reduction in current
taxes is . If   0, then households receive a cut in current taxes and face an
increase in future taxes. Alternatively, if   0, then households pay increased
current taxes and receive a cut in future taxes. In either case, the present value
of the current and future taxes paid by each household is unchanged by the tax
change. I will call this tax change a Ricardian tax change.6
     Assume that households do not face any binding constraints on the intertem-
poral allocation of consumption and that Ricardian Equivalence holds. That
is, in response to a Ricardian tax change, households of type  do not change
consumption or the holdings of any assets, except that they increase their net
holdings of riskless assets,  (), by  () to finance the future tax increase with
a present value of  (). These additional riskless assets are made available
by the government, which finances the aggregate tax cut by issuing additional
bonds in the amount . The following definition formalizes the definition of a
Ricardian tax cut in an economy in which Ricardian Equivalence holds.

Definition 1 Under Ricardian Equivalence, a Ricardian tax cut of aggregate
size  reduces current lump-sum taxes of type  households by  (), increases
    5 Anylending by domestic households to foreign borrowers is represented by  ()  0.
    6Iwill often use the term Ricardian tax cut to include reductions in current lump-sum
taxes (so that the tax cut, , is positive) as well as increases in current lump-sum taxes (so
that the tax cut, , is negative). When I restrict attention to the case with   0, a Ricardian
tax cut will mean that current lump-taxes decline.


                                                   6
their future taxes by an equal present value, and induces them to increase their
holdings of riskless assets by  ().
   Note that Definition 1 allows  to be negative as well as positive. When
  0, households pay increased taxes in the current period and receive a tax
cut in the future.
   Consider an initial situation, before a tax change, and use the subscript 0 to
denote the values of variables in this situation. From Corollary 1, the aggregate
amount of privately-issued domestic bonds in this initial situation is
                                   Z
                         0 = −            0 ()  () .                   (9)
                                          0 ()0

    In response to a Ricardian tax cut of  (), regardless of whether  is positive
or negative, households of type  increase their holdings of riskless assets,  (),
by  () to
                             1 () = 0 () +  ()                          (10)
and the worldwide amount of domestic government bonds outstanding increases
to
                            1 = 0 + .                         (11)


2.1     Ricardian Tax Cut: Incumbent Borrowers, Former
        Borrowers, and Incumbent Lenders
Consider the case with   0 so that households receive a cut in their current
taxes. It is convenient to put each household into one of three categories depend-
ing on whether the household borrows before and after the tax cut (incumbent
borrowers), borrows before but not after the tax cut (former borrowers), or does
not borrow either before or after the tax cut (incumbent lenders). Household
’s status as an incumbent borrower, former borrower, or incumbent lender de-
pends on 0 (), its position in riskless assets before the tax cut, and on the size
of the tax cut,  (). Households with 0 ()  − ()  0 initially borrow
more than  () and have 1 () = 0 +  ()  0 after the tax cut, so they will
continue to borrow after the tax cut. Therefore, these households are incum-
bent borrowers. Households with − () ≤ 0 ()  0 borrow an amount less
than or equal to  () before the tax cut, but since 1 () = 0 () +  () ≥ 0,
they will not borrow after the tax cut. Therefore, these households are former
borrowers. Finally, households with 0 () ≥ 0 will have 1 ()  0 after the
tax cut. Hence, they are incumbent lenders since they are lenders after the tax
cut and were lenders (more precisely, non-borrowers) before the tax cut.7
   7 When  ()  0, the allocation of an individual household’s riskless assets to the four

categories of riskless assets is indeterminate. Any one, two, or three of  (),  (),  (),
and  () can be zero. If  () =  () =  () = 0, then  ()  0 and strictly speaking
the household is not a lender (it does not lend to foreign borrowers, the domestic government,
or domestic private borrowers). Nevertheless, for ease of exposition I will use the term
"lender" to describe any household with  ()  0.


                                               7
    Consider households that are incumbent borrowers, that is, households with

 0 () = 0 ()  − (). These households are the only domestic private
issuers of bonds after the tax cut. After the tax cut, incumbent borrowers of
type  have outstanding bonds of −1 () = −1 () = − (0 () +  ()), so the
total amount of privately-issued domestic bonds after the tax cut is
                           Z
                    
                  1 ≡ −               (0 () +  ())  ()             (12)
                             0 ()−()


Before the tax cut the amount of privately-issued domestic bonds is 0 in
equation (9), so the reduction in the amount of privately-issued domestic bonds
associated with the tax cut can be calulated by subtracting equation (12) from
equation (9) to obtain
                Z                       Z
 0 − 1 = −          0 ()  () +             (0 () +  ())  ()  (13)
                 0 ()0                    0 ()−()

Equation (13) holds both for reductions in current taxes (  0) and increases in
current taxes (  0). In the case of tax reductions (  0), it can be rewritten
as
              Z                              Z
0 −1 = −                 0 ()  ()+               ()  () ≥ 0, for   0.
                −()≤0 ()0                     0 ()−()
                                                                           (14)
0 − 1 is the amount of privately-issued domestic bonds that are crowded
out by the Ricardian tax cut. The first term on the right hand side of equation
(14) is the amount bonds initially issued by former borrowers; these former
borrowers pay oﬀ these bonds completely when they receive the tax cut. The
second term is the reduction in bonds issued by incumbent borrowers; these
incumbent borrowers each reduce their bonds outstanding by  ().


2.2    Ricardian Tax Increases: Incumbent Borrowers, New
       Borrowers, and Incumbent Lenders
Now consider the case in which   0 so that households of type  face an increase
of − ()  0 in current lump-sum taxes and receive a future lump-sum tax cut
with known present value equal to − (). After the tax increase, there will
be incumbent borrowers, new borrowers, and incumbent lenders. Households
with 0 ()  0 are incumbent borrowers because they have negative positions
in riskless assets before and after the tax increase since 1 () = 0 () +  () 
0 ()  0. Households with 0 ≤ 0 ()  − () are new borrowers because
they had non-negative positions in riskless assets before the tax increase and
negative positions 1 () = 0 ()+ ()  0 after the tax increase. Households
with 0 () ≥ − ()  0 have 1 () = 0 () +  () ≥ 0 and thus have non-
negative positions in riskless assets before and after the tax increase; they are
incumbent lenders.


                                             8
    After the tax increase, the total amount of domestic privately-issued debt is
given by equation (12), which comprises the negative positions, 0 () +  (),
of incumbent borrowers (0 ()  0) and new borrowers (0 ≤ 0 ()  − ()).
Therefore, the reduction in domestic privately-issued bonds, 0 − 1 is given
by equation (13).8 Rearranging equation (13) under that assumption that   0
yields
              Z                               Z
0 − 1 =                   0 ()  () +             ()  () , for   0.
                 0≤0 ()−()                       0 ()−()
                                                                                           (15)


2.3         Shares of the Aggregate Tax Change
The impact of Ricardian tax changes depends on the shares of the aggregate
tax change accruing to borrowers of various types. To simplify notation, I will
define the function  (; ) to compactly represent the share of the aggregate
tax change that accrues to households with initial positions in riskless assets
less than  (). Specifically, let  represent the cross-sectional distribution of
 ()  0 and define                  Z
                              (; ) ≡                 ()  ()                        (16)
                                            0 ()
                                             () 

as the share of the aggregate tax cut  that is received by households with ini-
tial positions in riskless assets, 0 (), less than  (). Observe that  (; )
is (weakly) increasing in . Recall from Lemma 1 that        R if  () ≤ 0, then
 () =  (). Therefore, if  ≤ 0, then  (; ) ≡ 0 ()   ()  () =
R                                                             ()

  
   0 ()
          ()  (), which is the fraction of the aggregate tax cut  that is re-
    ()   
ceived (or, if   0, the fraction of the aggregate tax increase paid) by households
with initial net holdings of domestic privately-issued bonds less than  () ≤ 0.
Therefore,  (0; ) is the fraction of the aggregate tax change that accrues to
or from households that are borrowers before the tax cut. After the tax cut,
the set of borrowers is the set for which 1 () = 0 +  ()  0, or equivalently,
 0
()  −.      Therefore,  (−; ) is the fraction of the aggregate tax change
that accrues to housholds that are borrowers after the tax cut.
    If, as in standard analyses of Ricardian Equivalence, there is no cross-
sectional variation in changes in current taxes or in futures taxes, then  () ≡ 1.
I will use the notation  (; 1) to denote the value of  (; ) in this
                                                                     R case. It fol-
lows immediately from the definition of  (; ) that  (; 1) = 0 ()  (),
so that  (0; 1) is the fraction of households that are borrowers before the tax
change and  (−; 1) is the fraction of households that are borrowers after the
tax change. Therefore, in the case of a current tax cut,   0,  (−; 1) is the
    8 Equation
                                                        
                (15) can be rearranged as 0 − 1 = 0≤ ()−() (0 () +  ())  () +

 0 ()0  ()  (). Since   0, both integrals on the right hand side are non-positive and
hence the reduction in domestic privately-issued bonds is non-positive. That is, the amount
of these bonds increases or remains unchanged.

fraction of households that are incumbent borrowers, and  (0; 1)− (−; 1) ≥ 0
is the fraction of households that are former borrowers. Alternatively, in the
case of a current tax increase,   0,  (0; 1) is the fraction of households
that are incumbent borrowers, and  (−; 1) −  (0; 1) ≥ 0 is the fraction of
households that are new borrowers.


3    The Crowding-Out Coeﬃcient
Define  () to be the crowding-out coeﬃcient associated with a Ricardian tax
cut of size  6= 0. If   0, then  () is the reduction in the amount of privately-
issued domestic bonds divided by the amount of additional domestic government
bonds outstanding, . Alternatively, if   0, then  () is the increase in
privately-issued domestic bonds divided by the decrease in government bonds
outstanding. Formally,

Definition 2 The crowding-out coeﬃcient associated with a Ricardian tax cut
                            ¡         ¢
of size  6= 0 is  () ≡ 1 0 − 1 . For vanishingly small tax changes, define
 (0+ ) ≡ lim&0  () and  (0− ) ≡ lim%0  ().

   The following lemma presents an expression for the crowding-out coeﬃcient
that follows directly from substituting equation (13) into Definition 2.

Lemma 2 The crowding-out      ³ R coeﬃcient associatedR with a Ricardian tax cut´ of
                           1
size  6= 0 is  () =  − 0 ()0 0 ()  () + 0 ()−() 0 ()  () +
R
  0 ()−()
                 ()  ().

   Lemma 2 provides an exact expression for the crowding-out coeﬃcient as a
function of . In this section, I analyze properties of this function.

Proposition 1 If   0, then  (−; ) ≤  () ≤  (0; ).           If   0, then
 (0; ) ≤  () ≤  (−; ).

    Proposition 1, which is proved in the Appendix, states that the crowding-
out coeﬃcient lies in the closed interval between  (−; ) and  (0; ). In
the case of a tax cut,   0, so  (−; ) ≤  (0; ). Therefore, the closed
interval between  (−; ) and  (0; ) is [ (−; )   (0; )]. In this case,
 (−; ) is the fraction of the tax cut accruing to incumbent borrowers. Each
incumbent borrower reduces borrowing by the amount of the tax cut, so the total
amount of bonds issued by incumbent borrowers falls by  (−; ). Therefore,
the crowding-out coeﬃcient is at least  (−; ). The fraction of the tax
cut accruing to former borrowers is  (0; ) −  (−; ), but former borrowers
reduce their borrowing by no more than  ( (0; ) −  (−; )), so that the
total borrowing of incumbent borrowers and former borrowers is reduced by no
more than  (−; ) +  ( (0; ) −  (−; )) =  (0; ). Therefore, the
crowding-out coeﬃcient is no greater than than  (0; ).

                                         10
    In the case of a tax increase,   0, so  (0; ) ≤  (−; ). Therefore, the
closed interval between  (−; ) and  (0; ) is [ (0; )   (−; )]. In this
case,  (0; ) is the fraction of the tax increase paid by incumbent borrowers.
Since each incumbent borrower increases borrowing by the amount of the tax
increase, total borrowing by incumbent borrowers increases by − (0; )  0.
Therefore, the overall amount of privately-issued bonds outstanding increases
by at least − (0; )  0, so the crowding-out coeﬃcient is at least  (0; ).
The fraction of the tax increase paid by new borrowers is  (−; ) −  (0; ),
but new borrowers borrow no more than − ( (−; ) −  (0; )), so that the
total borrowing of incumbent borrowers and new borrowers increases by no
more than − (0; ) −  ( (−; ) −  (0; )) = − (−; ). Therefore,
the crowding-out coeﬃcient is no greater than  (−; ).

Proposition 2  () is (weakly) decreasing in  6= 0

    Proposition 2 states that the crowding-out coeﬃcient,  (), is (weakly) de-
creasing in the aggregate size of a tax cut,   0, but is (weakly) increasing in
the aggregate size of a tax increase −  0. First consider a tax cut. Increasing
the size of the tax cut, , induces more initial borrowers to pay oﬀ all of their
outstanding bonds and to become former borrowers. Further increases in the
tax cut cannot further reduce the debt issued by these households since they
have already paid oﬀ their debt. Put diﬀerently, a tax cut reduces the amount
of bonds outstanding by less for households that become former borrowers than
for households that become incumbent borrowers. Since larger tax cuts induce
more households to become former borrowers and reduce the measure of in-
cumbent borrowers, the crowding-out coeﬃcient,  (), is smaller for larger tax
cuts.
    Now consider a tax increase. Increasing the size of the tax increase, −  0,
induces some households that were not borrowers before the tax increase to
become new borrowers after the tax increase. These new borrowers do not
reduce the measure of incumbent borrowers, all of whom increase their borrow-
ing by the amount of their increased taxes. Therefore, these new borrowers
increase the amount of privately-issued domestic bonds outstanding by more
than the increase in borrowing from the incumbent borrowers. Since larger tax
increases induce more households to become new borrowers, without reducing
the measure of incumbent borrowers, the crowding-out coeﬃcient  () is larger
for larger tax increases.
    Proposition 2 immediately implies the following corollary.

Corollary 2 Starting from a given initial situation, the crowding-out coeﬃcient
for tax increases is at least as large as the crowding-out coeﬃcient for tax cuts,
with strict inequality for large tax changes.

    The following proposition presents expressions for the crowding-out coef-
ficients for vanishingly small tax cuts,  (0+ ) ≡ lim&0  (), and vanishingly
small tax increases,  (0− ) ≡ lim%0  ().

                                       11
Proposition 3  (0+ ) =  (0; ) ≤  (0+ ; ) =  (0− ), where  (0+ ; ) ≡
lim&0  (; ) 

    Proposition 3 states that for a vanishingly small tax cut, the crowding-out
coeﬃcient,  (0+ ), equals  (0; ), the fraction of the aggregate tax cut that
accrues to households that are borrowers before the tax cut. The aggregate
amount of the tax cut that accrues to incumbent borrowers is  (−; ) and
these incumbent borrowers reduce their borrowing by  (−; ). The aggre-
gate amount of the tax cut that accrues to former borrowers is  ( (0; ) −  (−; )).
For a suﬃciently small tax cut   0, the measure of former borrowers is van-
ishingly small and the aggregate reduction in domestic privately-issued bonds is
 (0; ). Dividing this reduction in privately-issued bonds outstanding by the
increase in government bonds outstanding, , yields the crowding-out coeﬃcient,
 (0+ ) =  (0; ).
    For a tax increase of size −  0, each incumbent borrower issues addi-
tional bonds in the amount of the additional tax paid. In the aggregate, in-
cumbent borrowers issue − (0; ) additional bonds after the tax increase.
New borrowers issue bonds in the amount of the increased taxes they pay,
− [ (−; ) −  (0; )], less their initial non-negative holdings of riskless as-
      R                                  R               0 ()
sets, 0≤0 ()−() 0 ()  () = − 0≤0 ()−() −()   ()  (). There-
fore, the total increase in the amountR of bonds issued by incumbent borrowers
                                                        0 ()
and new borrowers is − (−; )+ 0≤0 ()−() −()       ()  (). Dividing
this amount of newly-issued bonds by the aggregate tax increase, −, and taking
the limit as  approaches zero from below, yields  (0− ) = lim%0  (−; ) =
lim&0  (; ) ≡  (0+ ; ).
    The crowding-out coeﬃcient for a small tax cut,  (0+ ), will exceed the
crowding-out coeﬃcient for a small tax increase,  (0− ), if  (0; )   (0+ ; ),
that is, if a non-infinitesimal share of the aggregate tax change is paid by or
accrues to households with initial riskless assets precisely equal to zero. In this
situation, this positive mass of households are incumbent lenders in the event of
a tax cut, but are new borrowers in the case of a tax increase. As new borrow-
ers, they further increase the amount by which privately-issued domestic bonds
increase in addition to the increase in bonds issued by incumbent borrowers.
Therefore, if there is a positive mass of households with precisely zero riskless
assets in the initial situation, the crowding-out coeﬃcient for a tax increase
exceeds the crowding-out coeﬃcient for a tax cut, even if the tax changes are
small.


4    Identical Tax Changes for All Households
Conventional analyses of Ricardian Equivalence typically assume that all house-
holds receive identical lump-sum tax changes. Definition 1 broadens the concept
of Ricardian tax changes to allow for cross-sectional variation in tax changes.
Of course, this more expansive definition includes the conventional case in


                                       12
which all households receive identical tax change. Formally, the case with
identical tax changes for R all households is represented by  = 1, so that
 (; ) =  (; 1) = 0 ()  () is the fraction of households with ini-
tial riskless assets, 0 (), less than . Therefore,  (0; 1) is the fraction of
households that are borrowers before the tax cut. After a tax cut of size   0,
a fraction  (−; 1) of households become incumbent borrowers and a fraction
 (0; 1) −  (−; 1) of households become former borrowers.
    The framework used in Barro and Mollerus (2014) is a special case of the
framework I develop here. In particular, their analysis adopts the conventional
assumption that  = 1 and explicitly restricts attention to tax cuts that are
small enough that no borrowers receive a tax cut larger than their initial out-
standing bonds.9 That is, all of the initial borrowers become incumbent borrow-
ers after the tax cut. In this case, Proposition 3 implies that the crowding-out
coeﬃcient,  (0+ ), equals  (0; 1), which is the fraction of households that are
borrowers before the tax cut. Barro and Mollerus (2014) present an example
(plus a second example in footnote 12) in which half of the households are bor-
rowers and half are lenders. Since  (0; 1) = 05 in this example, the calculated
crowding-out coeﬃcient is 05.


4.1     Closed Economies with Identical Small Tax Cuts for
        All Households
Now consider the case of a closed economy in which all households receive identi-
cal tax cuts   0, and assume that  is vanishingly small so that all households
that borrow before the tax cut continue to borrow after the tax cut. Again,
this case is consistent with the framework in Barro and Mollerus (2014) and the
crowding-out coeﬃcient equals  (0; 1). In principle, the value of  (0; 1) can
be calculated in two diﬀerent ways. Perhaps the more obvious calculation is
simply to identify whether or not each household borrows, and then to compute
 (0; 1) as the fraction of households that borrow. An alternative calculation
is based on the ratio of the average amount borrowed by borrowing households
to the average amount of lending by lending households. I will develop that
calculation in this subsection.

as the average amount of bonds issued per household in the set of households
   9 Barro and Mollerus (2014, p. 26) assume "that the gross quantity of private bonds

outstanding was initially greater than 50% of the added government bonds." Since borrowers
receive 50% of the aggregate tax reductions, their assumption is that the tax reduction is
small enough that borrowers’ taxes fall by an amount no larger than their initial issuance of
bonds.

   Equation (19) leads to the following proposition.

Proposition 4 Consider a closed economy with nonzero private borrowing. If
all households receive identical tax cuts, i.e., if  = 1, then
                     ¡ ¢ 1 − 0      ¡ ¢ 1 + 0 

             −
where  ≡ + is the ratio of the average amount of bonds issued by borrow-
            
ing households to the average amount of privately-issued domestic bonds held
by lending households before the tax cut, and  0 ≡  (0+ ; 1) −  (0; 1) is the
measure of households that have zero positions in riskless assets before the tax
cut.

    Proposition 4 applies to any distribution of bond holdings in a closed econ-
omy. Remarkably, for any distribution of bond holdings, the crowding-out
coeﬃcients  (0+ ) and  (0− ) in a closed economy are simple functions of two
parameters:  0 , which is the measure of households that neither issue nor hold
privately-issued bonds before the tax change; and , which is a measure of the
asymmetry of the distribution of holdings of riskless bonds.
    If  0 = 0, so that there is a zero measure of households that neither issue
nor hold privately-issued bonds before the tax change, then  (0+ ) =  (0− ) is
           1
simply 1+   . If, in addtion, the distribution is symmetric, so that  = 1, the
crowding-out coeﬃcient is simply  (0+ ) =  (0− ) = 05. However, if  0  0,
then  (0+ ) = 1−2
                    0
                      and  (0− ) = 1+
                                      2
                                        0
                                          for any symmetric distribution of bond
holdings. Therefore, symmetry alone is not suﬃcient for either  (0+ ) or  (0− )
to equal 05. In the examples in Barro and Mollerus (2014), both  = 1 and
 0 = 0, by assumption, so  (0+ ) =  (0− ) = 05.


4.2    Open Economies with Identical Households
In this section I derive a simple expression for the crowding-out coeﬃcient in
open economies in which all domestic households have identical preferences, face
identical taxes, and have identical opportunities to hold and issue assets. With

                                            14
no heterogeneity in households, there is no need to index household holdings of
riskless assets,  (), by , so I will use  to denote the riskless asset holdings of
the representative household. Therefore,  =  () +  () +  () +  (),
where I have retained the household type  in the individual components of
 because households do not need to have identical holdings each of the four
types of riskless assets. They may choose diﬀerent combinations of  (),
 (),  (), and  () provided that they sum to  and satisfy equations (2),
(3), (4), and (5).

Lemma 3 If  () =  ≥ 0 for all , then  () = 0 for all .
    Lemma 3 implies that there are no domestic privately-issued bonds if  () =
 ≥ 0 in an economy with identical households. Therefore, to analyze domestic
privately-issued bonds in a homogeneous-household framework, I will confine
attention to situations in which  () =   0 for all . Lemma 1 implies that
 () =  () =   0 for all . In a closed economy, of course,  () cannot
be negative for all , because some domestic households would have to lend to
the borrowing households, and there would be no domestic lending households
when households are homogeneous. However, in an open economy domestic
households can borrow from abroad, in which case  () =  () =   0 for
all . I will use   0 to indicate the amount of bonds issued by each domestic
household.
    The aggregate amount of domestic privately-issued bonds in an open econ-
omy with identical households is
                                 = max [− 0] ≥ 0                            (20)
That is, if  ≥ 0, there are no privately-issued domestic bonds (Lemma 3), and
if   0,   = −, since  () =  () = . In the initial situation, before
the tax cut, the aggregate amount of bonds issued by domestic households is
                               0 = max [−0  0] ≥ 0                          (21)
  A Ricardian tax cut of size   0 increases  by  to 0 + , so the aggregate
amount of domestic privately-issued bonds after the tax cut is
                            1 = max [− (0 + )  0] ≥ 0                      (22)
Subtract equation (22) from equation (21) and rearrange to obtain
                   0 − 1 = min [0 +  0] − min [0  0]              (23)
                                           ¡         ¢
    The crowding-out coeﬃcient,  () ≡ 1 0 − 1 , is calculated by dividing
equation (23) by the size of the aggregate tax cut . For expositional clarity, I
will examine the crowding-out coeﬃcients for tax cuts (  0) and tax increases
(  0) separately. For tax cuts, equation (23) implies
                                             0,     if 0 ≥ 0
               for   0,       () = − 0  1, if   −0  0                (24)
                                          1,    if 0   ≤ −0

                                          15
     If 0 ≥ 0, then there are no privately-issued domestic riskless bonds before
or after the tax cut. Therefore, the crowding-out coeﬃcient for   0 is zero if
0 ≥ 0. If   −0  0, then 1 = 0 +   0, so households borrow (from
foreign lenders) before the tax cut but lend after the tax cut because the tax cut
is larger than the amount of privately-issued domestic bonds outstanding before
the tax cut. Therefore, the crowding-out coeﬃcient is positive but smaller
than one in this case. More precisely, the tax cut eliminates all privately-
issued domestic bonds so that the reduction in these bonds is −0 , while the
increase in government bonds is . Therefore, the crowding-out coeﬃcient is
− 0  1. If −0 ≥ , each household receives a tax cut   0 that is smaller
than the amount of bonds it has outstanding before the tax cut. Therefore,
these households reduce their borrowing by the full amount of the tax cut and
the crowding-out coeﬃcient equals one.
     For tax increases, equation (23) implies

                                          0,      if 0 ≥ −  0
                                          0
              for   0,     () = 1 +         1, if 0  0  −           (25)
                                               1,    if 0 ≤ 0

    If 0 ≥ −  0, households hold non-negative positions in riskless assets
both before the tax increase (0  0) and after the tax increase (0 +  ≥ 0).
Since they have no bonds outstanding either before the tax increase or after the
tax increase, the crowding-out coeﬃcient is zero. If 0  0  −, households
have positive positions in riskless assets before the tax increase but negative
positions in riskless assets (0 +   0) after the tax increase. Therefore,
the amount of privately-issued domestic bonds increases by − (0 + ) while
government bonds decrease by −, so the crowding-out coeﬃcient is 1+ 0  1.
If 0 ≤ 0, then households issue additional bonds to pay for the entire tax
increase, so the crowding-out coeﬃcient equals one.


5    The Crowding-Out Coeﬃcient in a Non-Ricardian
     Economy
In a Ricardian economy, when households of type  receive a tax cut of  () ac-
companied by an increase in future taxes with present value  (), they increase
their current holdings of riskless assets by the amount of the tax cut,  (). Now
consider a departure from this Ricardian framework and suppose that all house-
holds increase their holdings of riskless assets by a fraction 1 −  of the tax cut
they receive, that is, households of type  increase  () by (1 − )  (), where
0 ≤  ≤ 1. For instance, households may (for unspecified reasons) increase their
current consumption by a fraction  of the tax cut and use the remainder of
the tax cut to increase their holdings of riskless assets. When  = 0 Ricardian
Equivalence holds, but when   0, Ricardian Equivalence fails to hold. The
parameter  serves as a measure of the departure from Ricardian equivalence.

Definition 3 Define Θ ( ) ≡ 1 0 − 1 as the non-Ricardian crowding-
out coeﬃcient associated with a tax cut of aggregate size  6= 0, in which house-
holds of type  receive a tax cut of  () and increase their holdings of riskless
assets by (1 − )  (), where 0 ≤  ≤ 1. For vanishingly small tax changes,
define Θ (0+  ) ≡ lim&0 Θ ( ) and Θ (0−  ) ≡ lim%0 Θ ( ).

    The amount of riskless assets held by households of type  after increasing
their holdings of riskless assets by (1 − )  () in response to a tax cut of  ()
is 1 () = 0 () + (1 − )  (). Therefore, the total amount of domestic
privately-issued bonds outstanding after the tax cut is

1 = −           1 ()  () = −                      [0 () + (1 − )  ()]  () .

   First consider the case in which   0. In this case, subtracting 1 in
equation (26) from 0 in equation (9), and rearranging, yields the reduction in
the amount of private bonds outstanding

    Households with 0 ()  − (1 − )  () ≤ 0 are incumbent borrowers be-
cause they had negative positions in riskless assets before the tax cut and con-
tinue to have negative positions in riskless assets, 1 () = 0 ()+(1 − )  () 
0, after the tax cut. The first term on the right hand side of equation (27) is the
reduction in outstanding bonds issued by incumbent borrowers because each of
these households reduces its outstanding bonds by (1 − )  (). Households
with − (1 − )  () ≤ 0 ()  0 are former borrowers because they had nega-
tive positions in riskless assets before the tax cut and non-negative positions in
riskless assets, 1 () = 0 () + (1 − )  () ≥ 0, after the tax cut. The sec-
ond term on the right hand side of equation (27) is the reduction in outstanding
bonds issued by former borrowers because each of these households completely
pays oﬀ its initially outstanding bonds of −0 ().
    Now consider the case in which   0, so that taxes increase. Subtracting
0 in equation (9) from 1 in equation (26), and rearranging, yields the in-
crease in the amount of privately-issued domestic bonds outstanding following
the tax increase

    Households with 0 ()  0 are incumbent borrowers because they had nega-
tive positions in riskless assets before the tax increase and increase their borrow-
ing by − (1 − )   0 after the tax increase. The first term on the right hand
side of equation (28) is the increase in outstanding bonds issued by incumbent
borrowers. Households with 0 ≤ 0 ()  − (1 − )  () are new borrowers

                                          17
because 0 ≤ 0 () implies that these households did not borrow before the tax
increase; however, 0 ()  − (1 − )  () implies that these households have
negative net holdings of riskless assets, 1 () = 0 () + (1 − )  ()  0, af-
ter the tax increase, and hence become borrowers after the tax increase. The
second term in the right hand side of equation (28) is the aggregate amount of
bonds issued by the new borrowers after the tax increase.

Proposition 5 Θ ( ) = (1 − )  ((1 − ) ) for  6= 0. For vanishingly
small tax changes, Θ (0+  ) ≡ lim&0 Θ ( ) = (1 − )  (0+ ) and Θ (0−  )
≡ lim%0 Θ ( ) = (1 − )  (0− ).

    Proposition 5 applies to tax increases (  0) as well as to tax cuts (  0).
For vanishingly small tax changes, the non-Ricardian crowding-out coeﬃcient
is simply the Ricardian crowding-out coeﬃcient multiplied by (1 − ).


6     The Crowding-Out Coeﬃcient in the United
      States
In this section I present empirical measures of the crowding-out coeﬃcient in the
model developed here, and I compare these measures to existing econometric
estimates of the crowding-out coeﬃcient. Let b    denote an econometric estimate
of the crowding-out coeﬃcient. Barro and Mollerus (2014) refer specifically to
such estimates by Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgenson (2013) and Gorton,
Lewellen, and Metrick (2012) and summarize their findings as b     = 05. I will
analyze the extent to which the framework in this paper can account for that
value of the crowding-out coeﬃcient. First I present measures of  () under
the conventional assumption that all households receive identical lump-sum tax
cuts and then I present measures under the more general assumption of cross-
sectional heterogeneity in tax cuts. Consistent with the assumption in Barro
and Mollerus (2014), I focus on tax cuts that are small enough that no house-
holds become former borrowers after the tax cut. Formally, this assumption
implies that the crowding-out coeﬃcient of interest is  (0+ ) =  (0; ), which is
the fraction of the aggregate tax cut that is received by households that borrow.
    In the conventional case in which all households receive identical tax cuts,
 () ≡ 1 for all  and hence  (0+ ) =  (0; 1), which is simply the fraction of
households that are borrowers. Table 1, presents, at three-year intervals from
1989 to 2013, the percentage of households that are borrowers.10 The values
of  (0; 1) for these years are shown in the final column of Table 1 and range
from 72.3% to 77.0% over this 24-year period. That is, the values of  (0; 1)
are fairly tightly clustered around 0.75.

as reported in its 2013 Chartbook (unnumbered page 834 of the pdf file downloaded from

centage of borrowers in the overall population, as reported in the 2013 Chart-
book of the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances. It may diﬀer from

    It is instructive to compare the value of 0.75 for  (0+ ) =  (0; 1) reported
here to the value of 0.5 reported by Barro and Mollerus (2014). Why does
the value reported here exceed theirs by 50%? After all, their framework is a
special case of the framework presented here. The fundamental economics in
both cases is the same: (1) Ricardian Equivalence is assumed to hold and (2)
households are not allowed to borrow and hold positive gross amounts of riskless
assets simultaneously. Under these assumptions, the value of the crowding-out
coeﬃcient associated with small tax cuts is  (0; 1), which, in principle, can take
any value in the unit interval. Some additional information is needed to pin
down a particular value in this interval. Barro and Mollerus (2014) present two
simple examples in which half of the households are borrowers and the other half
are lenders, so  (0; 1) = 05 by assumption. To be clear, there is no empirical
basis nor is there a compelling theoretical reason for  (0; 1) to be 0.5. It is, of
course, true that in a closed economy the amount of dollars borrowed risklessly
equals the amount of dollars lent risklessly, but that does not imply that the
number of borrowers equals the number of lenders or that  (0; 1) equals 0.5.
The size of  (0; 1) is an empirical magnitude and the data from the Survey of
Consumer Finances indicate that  (0; 1) is tightly clustered around 0.75. The
fact that the value of 0.5 derived by Barro and Mollerus (2014) matches b    = 05
is a fortuitous coincidence.
    The framework developed in this paper can yield a crowding-out coeﬃcient
of 0.5 in the conventional case in which all households receive identical tax cuts

by considering a non-Ricardian economy of the sort introduced in Section 5.
Specifically, Proposition 5 implies that if  () ≡ 1, the crowding-out coeﬃcient
for small tax cuts is Θ (0+  ) = (1 − )  (0+ ) = (1 − )  (0; 1), where 
indicates the degree of departure from Ricardian Equivalence. The crowding-
out coeﬃcient Θ (0+ ; ) will match the econometrically estimated value b     if
             
             
1 −  = (0;1)   . Since b = 05 and  (0; 1) = 075, the implied value of  is
 = 13 , which is a substantial departure from Ricardian Equivalence.


6.1      Cross-Sectional Heterogeneity in Tax Cuts
To derive an empirical measure of the crowding-out coeﬃcient in the case of het-
erogeneous tax cuts, I will partition the households in the Survey of Consumer
Finances into 10 sets by partitioning each quintile of the income distribution
into a set consisting of households that borrow and a set consisting of house-
holds that do not borrow. Let   denote the fraction of households in the
 −  income quintile that borrow; the measure of these households is   5,
and¡ the measure
           ¢      of households in the  −  income quintile that do not borrow
is 1 −   5. Let  be the average amount of Federal taxes paid by each
household in the  −  income quintile, so that total taxes paid by households
in the  −  income quantile is  5. Therefore, the aggregate amount of Fed-
                                               P5
eral taxes paid by all households,  , is  = =1  5. Since there is a unit
measure of households in the economy, the economy-wide average amount of
                                                             5        P
taxes per household also equals  . Finally, define   ≡  =   5=1  as
the fraction of aggregate taxes that are paid by household in the  −  income
quintile.
    Consider a lump-sum tax cut of aggregate size . For now, assume that all
households  in the  − income quintile receive identical tax cuts  () = 5  .

Consistent with the assumption that the economy-wide average value of  ()
equals
   R one, it is straightforward
                        P5            to verify that the aggregate size of the tax cut
is  ()  () = =1 51 (5  ) = . Since the measure of households that
are both in the  −    R  income quintile and are borrowers is   5, the defini-
tion of  (; ) ≡ ()   ()  () implies that the fraction of the aggregate
                         ()                                          R

centage of the  −  income quintile that borrows, for  = 1 2 3 4 5, for each
year of the triennial Survey of Consumer Finances from 1989 to 2013. Table 2
reports the values of   , the percentage of total Federal tax liabilities paid by the
 −  income quantile. These data are from the Congressional Budget Oﬃce
and they do not include the year 2013. Therefore, Table 2 presents data for each
year of the Survey of Consumer FinancesPfrom 1989 to 2010. The final column of
                                                  5
Table 2 reports the value of  (0; ) = =1     , which is the value of  (0+ ),
in each of the displayed years. The values of  (0; ) are tightly clustered around
0.85, ranging from 0.836 to 0.871. Allowing for cross-sectional heterogeneity in
tax cuts increases the value of the crowding-out coeﬃcient  (0+ ) =  (0; ) by
about 0.10 from its value of the 0.75 when all households receive identical tax
cuts. Taking account of heterogeneity in tax cuts increases the crowding-out
coeﬃcient because the propensity for a household to borrow and the share of
the aggregate tax cut received by a household both monotonically increase in in-
come across income quintiles. That is,   and   are positively correlated across

    The value of 0.85 for  (0; ) exceeds the econometrically estimated value b               

Since b = 05 and  (0; ) = 085, the implied value of  is  = 0412, again a
substantial departure from Ricardian Equivalence.

6.1.1    Diﬀerent Tax Cuts for Borrowers and Non-Borrowers within
         Income Quintiles
I have assumed so far that all households in a given income quintile receive
identical tax cuts, or more generally, that within a given quintile, the size of
the tax cut received by individual households is independent of whether the
household is a borrower or not. To the extent that there is a systematic
diﬀerence in tax cuts received by borrowers and by non-borrowers
                                                         P5            within an
income quintile, the value of  (0; ) will diﬀer from =1     . Since the
                     P
value of  (0; ) = 5=1     , which is 0.85, substantially exceeds b
                                                                         = 05,
I will explore systematic diﬀerences in taxes paid by borrowers and by non-
borrowers that may reduce the calculated value of  (0; ). This exploration



                                              21
will illustrate the degree to which the assumption that tax cuts are independent
of borrowing status could possibly overstate  (0; ) 
    Let  be the average tax cut received by each borrowing household in
the  −  income quintile and let  be the average tax cut received by each
non-borrowing household in the  −  income quintile. Since a fraction   of
the households in the  −  income quantile are borrowers and a fraction 1 −  
are non-borrowers,
                           ¡       ¢
                    + 1 −    =  , for  = 1 2 3 4 5      (29)

Instead of assuming that  =  , as above, now assume that

                           =  ,     for  = 1 2 3 4 5                    (30)

with   0. Substitute equation (30) into equation (29) and rearrange to obtain

                                  
                     =       ¡     ¢ ,        for  = 1 2 3 4 5              (31)
                              + 1 −  

If all households in a given income quintile pay identical taxes, then  = 1, and
 =  . However, if   1, then    and if   1, then    .
      The tax cut received by each borrowing household  in the  −  income
                            5  
 quintile is  ()  =  + 1−          . Since the measure of households that are in the

               (    )                          (     )
for 0     1 and    0, an increase in  decreases the calculated value
of  (0; ). That is, an increase in  for a given value of  reduces the tax
 cut received by each borrower in the  −  income quintile. Table 3 reports
 the value of  (0; ) for 2010 using the values of   and   from tables 1 and
 2, respectively, and various values of . The values of  (0; ) in Table 3 fall
monotonically as  increases, as noted above. Of course, when  = 1, all house-
holds in a given quintile receive identical tax cuts, and the value of  (0; ) is
identical to its value in the final row and final column of Table 2. Note that for
 = 6, the value of  (0; ) equals 0.500. That is, in order for the calculated
value of the crowding-out coeﬃcient to equal b              = 05, the average tax cut re-
ceived by non-borrowing households in a given income quintile would have be 6
times as large as the average tax cut received by borrowing households in that
same income quintile. Such dramatic within-income-quintile variation in tax
changes is far from the spirit of the sort of lump-sum taxes typically associated
with Ricardian tax changes.

7    Conclusion
I have analyzed the crowding-out coeﬃcient under two assumptions: (1) Ricar-
dian equivalence holds so that all households increase their positions in riskless
assets by the amount of the current lump-sum tax cut they receive; and (2) no
household will simultaneously borrow and hold positive amounts of any riskless
assets. Under these two assumptions, the crowding-out coeﬃcient for small
tax cuts equals the fraction of the aggregate current tax cut that accrues to
households that borrow. That fraction can be any rational number in the unit
interval. Existing analyses of Ricardian equivalence typically add a third as-
sumption: (3) all households receive identical tax cuts in the current period.
Imposing this third assumption, in addition to the two assumptions listed above,
implies that the crowding-out coeﬃcient equals the fraction of households that
borrow. Using data from the Survey of Consumer Finances, I have shown that
this fraction is about 0.75, so the three assumptions together imply that the
crowding-out coeﬃcient should be 0.75. However, empirical estimates of the
crowding-out coeﬃcient cited by Barro and Mollerus (2014) put the economet-
rically estimated value of the crowding-out coeﬃcient at 0.5.
    One can view the disparity between the value of 0.75 implied by the three
assumptions and the value of 0.5 that is econometrically estimated to be an
informal rejection of the joint hypothesis that all three assumptions hold. This
disparity also invites investigation of how departures from these assumptions
would change the value of the crowding-out coeﬃcient in the model. In this
paper, I have explored departures from the first and third assumptions. Specif-
ically, if one replaces the first assumption by an assumption that all households
increase their positions in riskless assets by two-thirds–rather than the full
amount–of the current lump-sum tax cut they receive, the model predicts a
crowding-out coeﬃcient of 0.5, which matches the econometrically-estimated
value. This departure from assumption (1), formally setting  = 13 in the
model, is a substantial departure from Ricardian Equivalence. Indeed, if one
is willing to maintain assumptions (2) and (3), then this departure from  = 0
could be viewed a rejection of Ricardian Equivalence.
    I also explored the eﬀect of departing from assumption (3), while maintain-
ing assumptions (1) and (2) intact. Specifically, I have replaced the assumption
that all households receive identical lump-sum tax increases with the assumption
that all households receive a tax increase in proportion to the share of aggregate
taxes paid by their own income quintile. Because, households in higher income
quintiles pay higher taxes per household and have a higher incidence of borrow-
ing, this modification increases the crowding-out coeﬃcient in the model. That


                                       23
is, it exacerbates the discrepancy between the model and the econometrically-
estimated crowding-out coeﬃcient. The crowding-out coeﬃcient in the model
could be reduced by assuming that within each income quintile, non-borrowing
households pay higher taxes than borrowing households. In fact, if each non-
borrowing household receives a tax cut six times as large as the tax cut received
by each borrowing household in its own income quintile, then the model predicts
a crowding-out coeﬃcient of 0.5. However, such a large disparity of tax cuts
within income quintiles seems counter to the spirit of the tax changes that are
the focus of Ricardian Equivalence.
     Future research might usefully be directed at relaxing the second of three
assumptions above. That is, it may prove fruitful to allow households in the
model to borrow and hold positive gross positions in riskless assets at the same
time. The challenge is to understand and tractably model the determinants
of a household’s simultaneous riskless borrowing and holding of positive gross
positions in riskless assets. In addition, further extensions of the model could
go beyond household balance sheets to examine the assets and liabilities held
simultaneously by financial intermediaries.

    Proof. of Lemma 1. Proof of statement 1: If  ()  0, then equations
(2), (3), (4), and (5) imply  () =  () =  () = 0, so equation (1) implies
 () =  ()  0. Proof of statement 2: If  ()  0, then  ()  0, which
implies  () =  () =  () = 0, so  () =  ()  0. If  () = 0,
then  () cannot be negative because if  () were negative, then statement
1 would imply  () =  ()  0, which would contradict  () = 0. If  () =
0, then  () cannot be positive because equations (1) and (2) would imply
 () ≥  ()  0, which contradicts  () = 0. Therefore, if  () = 0, then
 () = 0 =  ().

the definition of  to obtain  (0; 1)  = 1 −  (0+ ; 1). Next use the definition
of  0 to obtain  (0; 1)  = 1 −  0 −  (0; 1), which implies (1 + )  (0; 1) =

again use the definition of  0 to rewrite  (0; 1)  = 1 −  (0+ ; 1), but eliminate
 (0; 1) rather than  (0+ ; 1)  to obtain ( (0+ ; 1) −  0 )  = 1 −  (0+ ; 1),

    Proof. of Lemma 3. (by contradiction) Assume that  () =  ≥ 0 for
all . Suppose that  ()  0 for some households. Then  ()  0 for some


                                                   28
other households because some households can hold domestic privately-issued
bonds only if some other households issue them. But Lemma 1 implies that
 ()  0 for households with  ()  0, which contradicts the assumption that
 () =  ≥ 0 for all  Therefore,  () ≤ 0 for all households. Suppose
that  ()  0 for some households. Again, Lemma 1 implies that  ()  0 for
households with  ()  0, which contradicts the assumption that  () =  ≥ 0
for all  Therefore,  () cannot be negative for any households. Therefore,
 () = 0 for all .

so Θ ( ) = (1 − )  ((1 − ) ), if   0.
   If   0, divide both sides of equation (28) by  and use Definition 3 to

so Θ ( ) = (1 − )  ((1 − ) ), for   0. Therefore, Θ ( ) = (1 − )  ((1 − ) ),
both for   0 and for   0.
   Finally, Θ (0+  ) ≡ lim&0 Θ ( ) = lim&0 (1 − )  ((1 − ) ) = (1 − )  (0+ )
