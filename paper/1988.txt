                        Supply Shocks and Optimal Monetary Policy




                                             ABSTRACT


This   paper demonstrates that if current shocks are observed instantaneously, output can be

stabilized perfectly for completely general supply disturbances, using simple monetary rules
based only on: (i) the current shock, (ii) the previous forecast of the current shock, (iii) the
forecast for just one period ahead. The optimal rule can be expressed in an infinite number of

ways and various alternatives are considered. With optimal wage indexation, the monetary
rule is even simpler. If current shocks are not observed instantaneously, but are inferred from

other signals, the optimal rules are of the same form, with the current perceived disturbance
replacing the actual.

   1. INTRODUCTION

        The sharp increases in the price of oil during 1973-74 focused attention on the question
  of the appropriate monetary response in the face of supply disturbances. Should monetary
  policy be accommodative and finance the higher level of prices or should it be contractionary

  to offset the inflationary effects of such disturbances? These issues have occupied the atten-
  tion of macroeconomists for over a decade now; see, e.g., Gordon (1975, 1984), Phelps (1978),

  Blinder (1981), Aizenman and Frenkel (1986), Fischer (1985). With the current fall in oil
  prices, the topic promises to be relevant for some time, although the direction of the shocks
  has been reversed.

       At this point, there does not seem to be any consensus as to what the appropriate mone-

  tary response should be. In his early study, Gordon argued for monetary accommodation in
  response to an adverse supply shock (higher oil price). On the other hand, Blinder (1981)
  argues that certain types of disturbances may require a monetary contraction. By contrast,
  Fischer (1985) argues that as long as there is no real wage resistance by workers, supply
 shocks by themselves should require no monetary response. However, his results depend
 upon very specific assumptions regarding the form of the money demand function. Marston
 and Turnovsky (1985a) show how the macroeconomic effects of supply disturbances depend

 crucially upon wages policy, while Aizenman and Frenkel (1985) stress how this in turn is
 important in determining the role of monetary policy.

      This paper analyzes the optimal monetary response to supply disturbances, taking up
 several issues which have thus far not been addressed in the literature. First, while several

 authors note the distinctions between: (i) permanent and transitory shocks on the one hand,
 and (ii) unanticipated and anticipated shocks on the other, and recognize that the required
 response to each type of disturbance will be different, a systematic general treatment of these

• different disturbances is thus far lacking. Secondly, the policy rules typically considered
 specify the adjustment of the money stock to current disturbances in supply.' Yet it is also
                                                      2


 possible and reasonable for the monetary authorities to respond to anticipations of both
 current and future supply shocks. Indeed, an important result of our analysis is that more gen-
eral policy rules of this kind turn out to require less information about the nature of the sup-

ply disturbances than do 'simpler' rules based only on information about current shocks. They

are therefore likely to lead to improved stabilization performance. Thirdly, the existing litera-
ture assumes that the monetary authorities observe and respond to the current supply distur-

bance instantaneously.2 This may not always be a plausible assumption. We therefore also
investigate the case where the stochastic disturbances impinging on the economy are not
observed instantaneously, but must be inferred from the movements of other variables, such as

the price level and the interest rate, which are likely to be observed with greater frequency. It

turns out that the optimal monetary response to a supply shock is virtually identical to that
under complete information. The only difference is that the actual disturbance is replaced by

the perceived disturbance determined by solving the appropriate signal extraction problem.

     The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Sections 2 and 3 outline the frame-
work and provide the general solution to the modeL The next two sections then determine the

optimal monetary response under the assumptions of full and imperfect information respec-
tively. The main results are reviewed in the final section.

2. THE FRAMEWORK

     Our analysis assumes a closed economy described by the following equations. These are

expressed in deviation form about a stationary equilibrium so that all constants are
suppressed.

                          Y = —d[r — (Pt1, — Ps)] + Ut            d >0                      (Ia)

                              —               —
                                  Pt = aiYt       a2rt + }Vt   > 0, a2> 0                  (ib)

                  =
                      [--J(l_r)(Pt
                                      -   P) ÷ [--]              -       + Vt
                                                                                          (1 c)

                                                           O<9<1,0<r<l,n >0

 where

            = real output, expressed in logarithms

         r = nominal interest rate,
            = price level, expressed in logarithms

         P+ = forecast of P÷1, formed at time t,
            = nominal money supply, expressed in logarithms,

         Ut = stochastic disturbance in the demand for output,

         w = stochastic disturbance in the demand for money,
           = stochastic disturbance in supply of output,

              = forecast of Vt, formed at time t—l,

         E(x) = perception of disturbance x, formed at time t, x = u, v, w.

     The model contains three stochastic disturbances u, v, and w, which in general need
not be observed contemporaneously. While our main interest is in the supply shock v, the
introduction of the two demand disturbances Ut, w, is required in order to generate a poten-
tial situation of imperfect information. If the only disturbance is v, its value can always be

inferred precisely from movements in other variables such as the interest rate, which may
more reasonably be observed instantaneously.

     Equation (1 a) is the economy's IS curve, expressed as a negative relationship between
output and the real interest rate, while (Ib) is the LM curve. Equation (ic) describes the
aggregate supply function; being less familiar, it is derived in the Appendix. Basically, it
incorporates a one-period Fischer-Gray wage contract model, in which the contract wage
adjusts to expected price movements and expected supply shocks.3 The current wage is then
determined by indexation to unanticipated movements in the price level, with the rate of
                                                       4


indexation being r. As is clear from (A.2) in the Appendix, the aggregate supply shock Vt can

be interpreted as a shock in productivity, while (1 — 9) is the exponent on labor in the under-

lying production function. The remaining parameter n is the elasticity of labor supply with
respect to the real wage. Equation (1 c) is written on the assumption that the current supply
disturbance is not observed instantaneously. In the event that v is observed, E (vi) = v and
(ic) becomes

                         =               -)(P - P1) +         +       -                            (1 c')
                             [Jz- ] (1                                             vtI]
Finally, expectations are rational so that

                                             =               for   all s


     Monetary    policy is assumed to be specified by a rule of the form

                         = ,.sEt(vt) +           +            + .A1E(u) + )t2E(w)                  (Id)


That is, on the one hand, the money stock is adjusted to perceptions of the current stochastic

disturbances, E(v), E(u), E(w). At the same time, it is adjusted in anticipation of the next
period's supply shock, as well as in response to the anticipated supply disturbance for the
present period. it can be shown that for the objective function to be introduced below, this
rule suffices to achieve minimum welfare costs. If, for example, the rule was augmented to
allow the money stock to respond to              the anticipated supply shock for time t +j, it can be
shown that the corresponding coefficient             say, in the optimal rule, would be zero; see, e.g.,
footnote 5   below.   As already noted, our main concern is with the coefficients ,             i,   i.'

which pertain to supply disturbances.4 Further, in the case where the stochastic disturbances

are observed instantaneously, the rule (id) is modified to

                                 /.LV    +           + /.t2Vt,t_j + )tiUt + .A2w                  (Id')



     To conclude the model requires the specification of a stabilization objective. As a
benchmark, we consider a frictionless economy in which wages and prices are perfectly
                                                       5

flexible so that labor markets clear. It is well known that the supply of output in such an
economy is given by


                                      i'i=                                                    (le)

In the case that firms observe v instantaneously, (1 e) reduces to

                                                   1+n
                                                   1+n9                                       (le)

The stabilization objective is then taken to be to minimize the variance of output Y about the

frictionless level Yf. This criterion can be shown to be equivalent to minimizing the welfare

losses arising from labor market distortions due to the existence of wage contracts and the
rigidities they impose; see Aizenman and Frenkel (1985).



3. THE SOLUTION

      The system outlined above is a standard rational expectations macro model. The solu-
tion procedures are familiar, enabling our description to be brief.

Taking conditional expectations of equations (1 a) - (1 c) at time 1, for time t +1, and eliminat-
ing the conditional expectations variables                       leads to the following difference

The solution to (3) is

Price   expectations therefore reflect the net discounted effects of the expected future money
stocks and the various stochastic disturbances impinging on the economy.

        Setting J = 1 and t = i—i in (3), equations (la)-(lc), (Ic) can be solved for the deviation
in output from its frictionless level, Y — Yf in the following form


         Y - Yf     * [] {( 1 - r [(Mt - M1) - (E (Z) - Z1)]
                                                        1+a2
                   + a2(1 —                 —       +
                                                            +    [E(v) — tt•il
                                                                                              (6)

                       - r)             - E(u)] - (     + ai)[v - E(v)] - [w - E(w)]]
                                                                                          }

where    D (1 — r)            (a2 ÷ a1d) + d(l + a2)> 0 and price expectations are given by (5)

and (5'). Written in this way, we see that the deviation in output from its frictionless level
depends most critically upon revisions to information between time t—1 and time t. Most
importantly, it depends upon updates to the forecast of the price level for time t + I, made
between time t — I and time t. It is through these revisions that expected future supply shocks,
                                                         7


  and the expected future monetary response, impact on the current behavior of the economy.
  But (Y — Y() also depends upon the differences between the actual and perceived distur-

  bances at time t.

         Substituting for                Z÷1 into                P+i,_1, and thence into (6), the solution
  can be expressed explicitly in terms of the policy parameters and current and expected future
  shocks as follows where

     Before determining the optimal monetary policy rules, we briefly consider the case of
full wage indexation, r =   1,   when (7) reduces to

The deviation in output about its frictionless level is independent of all monetary policy

parameters, so that monetary policy becomes totally ineffective. Or, expressed differently,

monetary policy can be effective only if wage indexation is partial, which is the reason for
imposing the constraint on r in (ic). As is well known, with full indexation, demand and
monetary shocks have no effect on the output of the economy. More interestingly, the effect

on output due to a supply shock depends solely on the revision of the estimate of the shock

between t —1 and t. Perfectly anticipated supply shocks, therefore, also have no effect on out-
put. Further analysis of the case of full indexation would require investigation of the effects

of shocks on the demand for, and supply of, labor. With failure to replicate the frictionless
level of output, and therefore with disequilibrium in the labor market, supply of labor con-

straints may become binding.

Var (Y — Yf). In fact, with full information., Y can be stabilized exactly at Yf, thereby repli-

where     is   arbitrary. The rule specified in (9) describes the general form of accommodation

A. White Noise Disturbances

     In the    case   of white noise disturbances,                    =         = 0 and the optimal rule reduces to
                                                   10


                                     l+n      a2
                                              —+a1      —
                                                                1+a2
                                                                                               (10)
                                    1 ÷ nO    d             (1 + nG)(l — r)


 This calls for monetary contraction or expansion in response to a positive supply (quantity)

 shock according to whether6


                                   (1+n)[+ai] <             [1+]                               (11)


 On the one hand, the direct effect of a positive supply shock is to raise output in an economy

 with wages fixed by contracts above that in a frictionless economy, where the rise in real
 wages resulting from the shock inhibit the rise in output. On the other hand, the positive sup-

 ply shock tends to lower the price level and this tends to reduce Y below Yf. If the former
 effect dominates, monetary contraction is required to reduce Y back to Yf; if the latter effect

 dominates, monetary expansion is required.

        The optimal rule incorporates the tradeoff between monetary policy and wage indexa-
 tion emphasized by Aizenman and Frenkel (1985) and Turnovsky (1983). For low degrees of
indexation (r 0), either the positive direct effect or the negative price effect of the supply

shock may dominate and the optimal policy may call for either monetary contraction or

expansion, depending upon which is larger. However, for a sufficiently high degree of indexa-

tion, the positive direct effect dominates, causing Y to increase above Yf, and requiring a
monetary contraction to generate a fall in price necessary to reduce Y back to the frictionless
leveL

        Fischer's (1985) analysis, calling for a passive monetary policy, was based on a classical
money demand function (a1 = 1, a2 = 0), with no wage indexation (r = 0) and with a fixed
supply of labor (n =   0).   For these parameter values, (10) implies the optimality of the passive
policy Al = 0 as welL With a classical money demand function, but with a positively elastic

supply of labor, n > 0, a passive policy will be optimal if and only if money wages are partially

indexed to unexpected price movements to the extent
                                                                     11




                                                                     1 +n                               (12)

 The reason for this is that with n > 0, the direct effect of a positive supply shock is to raise Y

 above Yf, as already noted. The amount of indexation specified in (12) will induce a suffi-
 cient rise in the real wage to cut back the rise in output to exactly that in the frictionless econ-

 omy.


 B. Genera! Disturbances

        Returning to the optimal rule (9), it is seen that the optimal adjustment of the money
 stock to supply disturbances can be expressed in an infinite number ofways, depending upon
 the arbitrary choice of jig.

        Substituting for the optimal policy parameters into (4), the expected money supply for
 timet+j is given by

                   a
                        =   a
                                    +           —
                                                            l42                  *
                                                                             Vt41,t —
                                                                                            a2     *
                                                                                                       (13)
                                                        (1 + nO)(1 — r)                 1   + a2


so that (5), (5') imply

                                a

                                a
                                        =           1
                                                                 —
                                                                           1+a2         a

The expected price for time t + I depends only upon the expected supply shock for that
period. The optimal monetary rule neutralizes the effects of anticipated supply shocks for all

subsequent periods. However, the response of the expected price level does depend upon the
chosen value of        and two values are natural to consider.

(i)   /L2 = 0:   In this case the optimal monetary response to supply disturbances is given by
                                                   12

                                                                                            a
                                                                                                      (15)

The optimal response to the current disturbance is the same as for white noise, discussed pre-

viously. But, in addition, the rule requires accommodation for the expected shock for next
period, v+. Moreover, this accommodation should be the same, whether the future shock is
expected to last just one period, or indefinitely. The reason is simply that expectations of
future supply shocks beyond one period are fully compensated for by the expected money
supply and leave price expectations P1 or                 unaffected.

      While the adjustment to the current disturbance can be either expansionary or contrac-

tionary, as we have seen, the expected positive future shock calls for monetary expansion.
The reason is that an expected positive future supply shock causes                    to fall. This in turn
means that the real interest rate will rise and that current output will decline. In order to
restore output to the level of the frictionless economy, an expansion in the money supply is
required in order to offset this contractionary effect.

     The optimal rule (15) implies further that a positive current supply disturbance which is
expected to last for at least one period into the future (i.e.,              =   v) can be stabilized per-
fectly by setting


                                   l+n      —+a         —   _________                                 (16)

Denoting the coefficient of v in (10) and (16) by u,          respectively, we see that > j; i.e.,
the monetary policy should be more accommodating or less contractionary to such a distur-
bance than to a white noise shock.7 The reason again is the negative price effect which needs
to be offset in order to avoid the contraction in output which would otherwise occur.8

component (Vt — V:_1). The response to the latter is the same as if it were white noise and

can be either expansionary or contractionary. By contrast, a positive anticipated current sup-
ply shock requires monetary expansion. This is because an expected positive supply shock
leads to a higher contract wage. This tends to reduce the demand for labor and output, unless
offset by a monetary expansion which raises the price level and stimulates output.

      It is interesting to observe that when                        is chosen in this way, the monetary authorities
need not forecast the future at all. They can simply base their policies on the anticipated and

unanticipated components of the current supply disturbance. The reason is that when
   = (1 + a.2)/(l + nO)(1   —
                                    r),   P1                       = 0. That is, the expected future price level is

fixed and is independent of future supply disturbances.


     Our analysis treats the degree of wage indexation as a given parameter. It is interesting
to note that when r is considered as a policy instrument, further degrees of freedom with
respect to the determination of optimal policy arise. For example, setting

                                                                    1 + a2
                                                1 —r=
                                                                         a2                                  (18a)
                                                              (1



                                                 =                                                           (18b)
                                                          [::] [- + ai]
the coefficients of both ye and                      in the optimal money supply rule (9) are zero. Optimal
policy will consist of partial wage indexation, together with a monetary expansion based solely
on the forecast of the supply shock at time t, formed at time 1—1, namely
                                                      14



                                 M=       1+n c       —i— + a1          v,_1                           (19)
                                           +


In effect, the indexation eliminates the need to adjust the money to the unanticipated com-
ponent of the supply shock in (17). A rule based entirely on past forecasts is obviously very
convenient in an economy where there are lags in information.


 C. Effects on Other Variables

      So far, we have focused on the monetary rules which will ensure Y = Yf, so that the
 contract economy replicates exactly the output of the frictionless economy. Combining (Ic'),
 (Id') with (5'), it is seen that the adoption of the optimal monetary rule causes the current
 price level to respond in accordance with

                        •          (v — Vtt....1)          /L2                         1
                    =        —                    =                  Vtt_j   —
                                                                                                        (20)
                                 (1 + nO)(1 — r)       1   —
                                                               a2                (1 + nO)(1   —
                                                                                                  r)

A current positive supply shock causes the current price level to fail, while to the extent that
the monetary authorities accommodate to an anticipated positive current supply shock, the
current price level will rise.

      The demand for labor generated by the supply shock and resulting policy responses
increases by an amount

                                          Yt—Vt =                n
                                    N=     1—0             1+nG

while the supply of labor


               N = n(W — P) = n(r— 1)(P — P1) +                                   =           v >0

rises by the same amount. The optimal monetary policy therefore ensures that the supply

shock has no effect on unemployment. Upon reflection, this is hardly surprising, since the
optimal rule ensures that the economy replicates the frictionless economy, in which the labor

market always clears and the unemployment rate is therefore zero.

D. A Monetary Rule Based on only Current Supply Shocks

        The striking feature of the optimal monetary rules (15) and (17) is their simplicity. Com-

pletely genera! supply shocks can be stabilized perfectly by using remarkably simple rules
based on very limited information about the transitory or permanent nature of the shocks.
The monetary authorities need consider only the current period and just one period ahead;

they need not be concerned with what might occur in any subsequent periods beyond.

        This form of rule is now compared to the usual kind of policy rule where the monetary
intervention is in response to only current disturbances in supply. Analytically, this involves

setting        ==0         in   (id').    Eliminating the demand disturbances by setting
A1 = —a2/d, A2 =    1   in (7'), the deviation in output about its frictionless level, Y — Yf, is given

by


                         d 1—0                                l+a2
                                         (I—r)(j&3—)+ l+nO (v—v,.4)

                                                                                                  (7")
                                                         00                     a
                                                                      2
                                     +(l—r)(j.—) E(Vgj,g—vt.,t...j)
                                                 j=1                l+a2

The optimal rule for stabilizing white noise disturbances is obviously still given by (10), as
before. But for any other forms of disturbances, to determine the optimal monetary response
involves forming forecasts of the supply shocks,               for all future periods t +j. The infor-
mational requirements are clearly severe.

        In fact, perfect stabilization for Y about Yf is possible for any arbitrary autoregressive

moving average (ARMA) process generating supply disturbances v. Suppose, for example, v
is generated by

                                            = PVt_i + Et + )€_i
                                                                                                 (21)

Then,
                                                            16



                                                   Vt
                                                        —
                                                            :_4 =

                                       — v•,_1 = pJl(p + A)€                I = 1, 2,
and substituting into (7"), yields



                     —    =
                                   —         (1 — r)(p   — )(1 + a2 + Acx2)   1 + a2
                                                                            +                              (22)
                              D    0                    l+a2—ptz2             1+n9

We see from (22) that perfect stability of output Y about the frictionless level Y( is attained
by choosing the parameter j in accordance with

                              l+n      a2
                                       —+a1 —                l+a2               l+a2—pa2
                              l+nG     d                     1+nO           (l+a2+Aa2)(I—r)                       23

This rule      depends upon p, A, the two       parameters        characterizing the stochastic process generat-


ing v.    It   reduces to (10) when p = A = 0 and                v is a   white noise process; it reduces to (l6

when p =       1,   A = 0, and v follows a   random walk with current shifts            expected to   be permanent.


     In   general, all parameters characterizing an ARMA process will appear in the optimal
policy rule, and perfect stabilization is possible as long as information on all relevant parame-

ters is correct. If, on the other hand, information is incorrect, perfect stabilization will not be
achieved and indeed if the information is sufficiently inaccurate, intervention may serve only
to destabilize the economy!



5. IMPERFECT INFORMATION

     We now determine the optimal degree of monetary response in the situation where infor-
mation on the current disturbances is unavailable, so that only E(v), E(u) and E(w) are
known to all agents (both private and public). In this case, returning to the fundamental
expression (7), we can easily show that Var (Y — Y() is minimized by choosing '

2' precisely as before, in accordance with (8). Thus the response to the supply disturbance is
                                                                                                         i,   ,   A1,

 This is of the same form as (9), the only difference being that the current perception of the
supply disturbance, Et(vt), replaces the actual shock. Thus the comments made previously
with respect to the optimal policy rules in response to the various forms of supply distur-
 bances applies to (24) as well.

      There are, however, two differences which need to be considered. First, the perceived
supply disturbance depends upon the information set available to agents. Secondly, the
optimal rule may, or may not, yield perfect stabilization about the frictionless level of output.9

 That too, depends upon the information set. In general, we find that the minimized value of
 Var(Y-Y()js

             (1 — r)2   Var {(u — E(u)) — ( + a1)(v — E(v)) — (w                              —




We   shall consider two examples.

      First, suppose that agents observe both the price level P and the interest rate r. Substi-
tuting (Ia) into (1 b) yields the relationship

                           —    = — cz1d[r        —         —
                                                                Pa)]   —
                                                                           a2r + aiUt + W         (25)
The observability of M,             along with r and P implies the observability of the composite
disturbance (a1u + we). Similarly, substituting the supply function (Ic) into (ib), the observa-

bility of M, P..1, v_1, E(v), along with r and P implies the observability of (ct1v + we).
Optimal predictions of u, v, and w can be obtained by regressing these variables on the two

observed composite disturbances. Assuming the underlying stochastic shocks are uncorre-
lated, the resulting expressions are given by'°

where o, ô, o, are the variances of ut,      v, and   w, respectively. Notice that the absence of
any one of ut, v, w implies the observability of the remaining two."This is because the
observations contain two independent pieces of information, enabling the remaining two ran-
dom variables to be inferred. Further, equations (26a)-(26c) imply

                                   a1E(u) + E(w) =             +w                             (27a)

 which together yield

 so that minimized Var (Y — Yf) = 0; i.e., output is stabilized perfectly about its frictionless
level.12


       Thus, if the monetary authorities observe P, r2, the appropriate prediction of the con-
  temporaneous supply disturbance is given by (26a). It is clear that because of the signal
  extraction problem

                                aE(v)   —
                                        —

                                            (a +         + oo <
  As a consequence of the inability of the monetary authorities to identify unambiguously move-

 ments in the observed variables (E(v)) with actual supply disturbances, such disturbances are

 discounted somewhat, leading to less response in the money supply than if they were observed
                                                    19



exactly.    It is also possible for movements in the supply to be accompanied by concurrent
movements in demand, so that while v > 0, the perceived supply disturbance, as determined
by (26a), is negative. In this case, the direction of the monetary response will be reversed.

         As a second example, suppose that the monetary authorities observe only the nominal
interest rate r.    In   this case eliminating Y,   Pt from   (la) - (Ic), we find that the observability
 of r,   along   with the expectations and other predetermined variables, is equivalent to the
observability of the composite term

6. CONCLUSIONS

       Supply shocks continue to impinge on Western economies.. This paper has analyzed the

optimal monetary responses to such disturbances, emphasizing the distinction between distur-

bances that are transitory or permanent, on the one hand, and anticipated or unanticipated, on
                                               20


 the other. Two main conclusions can be drawn from the analysis, although these are obvi-
 ously subject to the specific assumptions of the model.

      First, we have shown that if cufrent shocks are observed instantaneously, output can be

 stabilized perfectly for completely general supply disturbances, by using remarkably simple

monetary rules, requiring relatively little information about the nature of the disturbances.
Specifically, the monetary authorities need consider only: (i) the current shock, (ii) the fore-
cast of the current shock formed in the previous period, (iii) the forecast for just one period
ahead. They need not be concerned with what might occur in subsequent periods beyond,
and therefore do not need to determine whether an anticipated shock for the next period is
temporary or permanent. The optimal rule will completely eliminate these subsequent effects

from the current expected inflation rate, thereby neutralizing their effects on current output.
In fact, the optimal rule can be expressed in an infinite number of different ways and only (ii)
or (iii) need be considered, in conjunction with the current shock itself.

      Perhaps the most convenient form specifies the monetary adjustment in terms of an
expansion in response to the anticipated component of a (positive) current supply shock,
together with an adjustment to the unanticipated component, which may be either expansion-

ary or contractionary, depending upon the parameters. Expressed in this way, perfect output
stabilization can be achieved for any form of supply disturbance without the need to forecast

the future at all. If the degree of wage indexation is chosen optimally, the optimal monetary

rule can be simplified further by eliminating the unanticipated component of the current sup-

ply shock from the optimal monetary rule. By contrast, monetary rules based on responses to
current disturbances alone require substantially more information for optimal stabilization.
Forecasts of supply shocks for all future periods are necessary.
      Secondly, we have shown that if current shocks are not observed instantaneously, but
are inferred from other signals such as the interest rate and price level, the optimal rules are of
the same form, with the current perceived disturbance replacing the actual. The current per-
ception of the shock depends upon the information set and perfect stabilization of output may,

or may not, be possible, again depending upon the information available.

                                            APPENDIX
 Derivation of Supply Function

      The supply function is based on the one-period wage contract model. We assume that
 the contract wage for time t is determined at time t-l such that, given expectations of firms
 and workers, the labor market is expected to clear. The expected supply of labor at the con-
 tract wage is

                               N( = n(W:,_1     —                n >0                       (A.l)

  where N_1 = expected supply of labor formed at time t-l, for time t, expressed in logarithms,
                 = contract wage, determined at time t-l for time t, expressed in logarithms,
                 = forecast of P formed at time t-l.

      Output is produced by means of a Cobb-Douglas production function

                                 Y =(l—O)N + v             0<9<1                            (A.2)
 where N = employment of labor, expressed in logarithms,
           = stochastic disturbance in productivity.

      The expected demand for labor, N_1, (based on expected profit maximation), is deter-
mined by the marginal productivity condition

                            in (1—0) —   9N' + v_1 =            —
                                                                    P_1                     (A.3)

     The contract wage is determined by equating the expected demand and supply of labor
in (A.l) and (A.3), yielding

                                                in (1—8)       Vg,_j
                                 tt1 — tt4 +
                                     —
                                                    + nO
                                                           ÷
                                                               I+      9
                                                                                            (A 4)

The contract wage therefore depends upon the expected productivity disturbance as well as
the expected price leveL

     Actual employment is assumed to be determined by the short-run marginal productivity
condition, after the actual wage and price are known; This is expressed by
                                                 A.2


                                 In (1—9) — 9N   + E(v) = W —                                    (A.5)

Introducing the current perceived productivity disturbance, E (vi), into the optimality condi-
tion (A.5), allows for the possibility that firms do not observe this disturbance instantaneously.
If it is observed, then E(v) = v; otherwise they must infer it from available information on
current observable variables, using the forecasting technique discussed in the text. Combining

(A.2) and (A.5), current output is given by,

                        =
                            (1) ln(1—O) + (1-)(P — W) + (-1-)E(v) ÷ v                            (A.6)

which depends upon both the firm's estimate of v and v itself. In the event that v is
observed, (A.6) simplifies to

                               = (1) ln(1—9) +    (L-) (P — W) + --                              (A.6')


      Finally, current wages are assumed to be determined in accordance with the indexation
scheme

                                 = W.4 + r(Pt —              0 <r< 1                             (A.7)

Combining (A.7) and (A.4) with (A.6) or (A.6'), yields the following alternative forms of sup-
ply functions, which correspond to the observability or otherwise of the productivity distur-
bance,


           =        ?1l_9) + (1-r(-)(P -                                        Vt't

                                                            (-v-) {tvt    -            J
                                                                                           ÷v   (A.8)


                = (1—6) nln(l—8) + (l—r)(--—)(P —      P1) +       —                            (A.8')

Suppressing the constant and measuring everything in deviation form, (A.8), (A.8') are
equivalent to (ic), (lc') of the text.

 *    The comments of an anonymous referee are gratefully acknowledged.
      An exception is Blinder (1981) who considers a rule in which the money stock is
      adjusted in response to anticipated and unanticipated supply shocks.

2.    Aizenman and Frenkel (1985) allow for supply shocks which are not observed instan-
      taneously. But the focus of their analysis is quite different, being on the tradeoff between

      wage indexation and monetary policy, rather than on stabilizing for supply shocks them-
      selves. Marston and Turnovsky (1985b) allow for firm-specific productivity disturbances

      which may, or may not, be observed generally. Their analysis too is directed at different
      issues from those being pursued here.

3.    See Fischer (1977), Gray (1976).

4.   It is also possible to augment the rule to respond to anticipated demand shocks, analo-
     gous to those for supply. Including z'ju.it +              for example, it can be shown that
     1/1, v2,   satisfy


                                               I+        )=O
                                                    a2


     and since our interest does not lie in demand shocks, we have chosen the simplest solu-
     tion         L12 = 0.


5.   If the money supply here were augmented to include in addition a response to the
     expected supply shock two periods hence, p3v2t say, we can show that in addition to
     (8a) - (8d), the optimality conditions will include

                                   a2                          a2
                                 li-a2 )÷(j+—)( li-a2 )20
     This together with (8d) implies j = 0. The same is true for all expectations beyond two
     periods ahead.
6.   Note that whereas some authors refer to a positive supply shock in terms of an increase

     in input price, we are focusing on positive quantity shocks.

7.   It is also possible for monetary policy to be contractionary in response to a white noise
     disturbance, but expansionary to a permanent shift. This occurs if


                            (1 +a2)>(l +n)(1 —r)(-+a1)>             I


8.   With a classical supply function, a2 = 0 and price expectations disappear from the solu-

     tion (6) for output deviations. In this case (10) and (16) are identical, so that both tem-
     porary and permanent supply shocks call for the same monetary response.

9.   In the case where perfect stabilization is not achieved, so that disequilibrium in the labor

     market exists, labor supply constraints might be binding and need to be considered.

10. It is also possible to form predictions E(v) from observations on (ajvt + Wt) alone.
     However, by ignoring information, this yields a less efficient estimate than than given in

     (23a).

ii. These relationships also imply the observabiity of (u — vt).

12. Much of the monetary policy literature specifies monetary rules in terms of responses to
     the directly observed variables, which in this case are P and r. Given that our forecasts

     of current shocks are just linear combinations of these variables, our formulation is
     clearly identical in terms of its stabilization performance. However, since the focus of
     our analysis is on responding to supply disturbances, we find our specification is more

     appropriate for our purposes.
