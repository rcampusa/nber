                                              ABSTRACT

We take stock of and compare tax revenue trends in Asia and Latin America. The tax revenues to GDP
ratios increased significantly in both regions in the 2000s, although they remain visibly below European
levels. Our analysis portrays a complex picture of the tax collection challenges facing developing countries.
Overall, there remains sizable heterogeneity in the revenue performance of developing countries, and
across regions. While progress has been made, the gap between the advanced economies and developing
countries suggests ample room for future fiscal developments, and for more disaggregated studies
of the tax mobilization challenges facing developing countries in the aftermath of the global financial
crisis.

1 Introduction

       Governments play a central role in the economic growth and development of

developing countries. More specifically, they often provide key services such as

education and health care, and invest in vital infrastructure such as roads and power

plants. Such public services and infrastructure build up a country’s stock of human

and physical, which are indispensable for growth and development. Public services

and infrastructure require a lot of resources. Since most governments depend

primarily on tax revenues for fiscal resources, tax revenues enable governments to

undertake growth- and development-conducive fiscal spending. Or, equivalently,

inadequate tax revenues are a major constraint to the government’s capacity to foster

growth and development. Therefore, tax revenue mobilization is a top-priority strategic

challenge for developing regions such as Asia and Latin America.

       In addition to the basic need for tax revenues to finance growth- and

development-promoting fiscal expenditures, a number of sizable fiscal demands loom

on the horizon. In particular, many developing countries of Asia and Latin America

have joined advanced economies in the demographic transition toward older

populations. Some countries, most notably China, have experienced sudden and rapid

transitions, giving rise to concerns about getting old rich before getting rich. Population

aging tends to increase government spending on pensions, health care, and other

programs geared toward the elderly. Financing those programs will require tax

revenues. Furthermore, there are other future fiscal demands, including environmental

protection. In China, for example, there is a growing demand from the general public

for a cleaner environment, and widespread expectations of greater government

involvement in cleaning up the environment.




                                            2
       The deceleration of growth since the global financial crisis adversely affects tax

revenue collection and thus raises further concerns about the fiscal health of

developing countries. At a fundamental level, the limited institutional capacity, in

particular tax administration capacity, constrains the tax revenue mobilization of

developing countries in Asia, Latin America, and elsewhere. For example, weaker

enforcement and widespread corruption leads to large leakages and erodes the tax

base. Furthermore, the successful integration of developing countries into the global

economy, associated with expanded trade and financial integration, reduced tax

revenues from relatively easy to collect taxes which were widely used by developing

countries – import tariffs, inflation tax, financial repression taxes, and the like [see

Aizenman and Jinjarak (2009)].

       Consequently, many developing countries faced the twin challenges of lower

revenues from traditional tax sources and growing fiscal demands. In response, they

embarked on fiscal reforms, increasing the share of new revenue sources – higher

personal and corporate income taxes, sales taxes, value added taxes, and other taxes.

These fiscal reforms are necessary and welcome but require large investments in

improving tax administration and collection. But such investments are often

challenging and difficult in countries that are characterized by high enforcement costs

due to large informal sectors and other structural factors.

       Against this background, we take stock of the recent patterns of tax revenue

mobilization in Asia, Latin America and other regions, subject to data availability. Asia

and Latin America are at broadly similar income and development levels, so a

comparison of the two regions is especially significant and interesting. While the tax

ratios in Asia and Latin America were significantly lower than in Europe in the 2000s,

about 14%, 17% and 20%, respectively, tax revenues rose visibly in both Asia and


                                           3
Latin America during that time. The deepening of tax collection in Asia and Latin

America is in line with earlier studies. For example, using pre-global financial crisis

(GFC) data, Aizenman and Jinjarak (2009) found a positive association between trade

and financial openness and ‘hard to collect’ taxes, and a negative association with

easy to collect taxes.

        According to the public finance literature, understanding tax systems requires

an understanding of their interaction with the quality of institutions and economic

structure [see, for example, Auerbach et al. (2013)]. To illustrate, if a large share of

the GDP is produced by a few commodity exporters, for example oil firms in oil

dependent economies, tax collection can be centralized. At the same time, in any

economy, the quality of institutions matters in enforcing tax payment and minimizing

the leakages of taxes. For a given quality of institutions, tax collection is more

challenging in countries with a large informal sector and an agricultural sector

dominated by small farms. 5 In this paper we add some controls to account for

institutional quality and structural factors - government effectiveness (as a proxy for

the quality of institutions), trade openness, urban population, and manufacturing value

added (as a proxy for economic structure).

        The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a review of

the relevant literature. Section 3 portrays the patterns of tax revenues in Asia, Latin

America, and elsewhere in recent years. Section 4 empirically analyzes the




5A recent illustration of these considerations may be Brazil: “where the state collects a hefty 36% of
GDP in taxes and offers mediocre public services in return, tax-dodging is a national sport. The latest
scam unearthed by police, treasury and finance-ministry sleuths sets a record. On March 26th they
revealed that over the past ten years the government had been cheated of at least 5.7 billion reais ($1.8
billion) in back taxes and fines from firms, and perhaps as much as 19 billion reais. That would be
enough to pay three-quarters of the bill for last year’s football World Cup. It is nearly twice the suspicious
payments in a separate corruption scheme involving Petrobras, a state-controlled oil company.”

2 Literature Review

      More inclusive growth that benefits broader segments of the population rather

than just the privileged elite has become a strategic objective of developing countries

around the world, especially in largely middle-income Asia and Latin America. For

example, according to ADB (2012) and Kanbur, Rhee and Zhuang (2014), while Asia

has reduced poverty at unprecedented scale and speed, partly as a result of its

sustained rapid growth, it now faces the problem of widening inequality in countries

that collectively account for over 80% of the region’s population. Consequently, there

has been growing popular demand for Asian governments to leverage fiscal policy to

tackle inequality [see ADB (2014)]. Relative to Asia, Latin America has much more

experience in using fiscal policy to promote equity. In particular, successful cash

transfer programs such as Brazil’s Bolsa Familia or Mexico’s Opportunidades and

Progresa have helped to mitigate inequality [see Lee and Park (2014)]. Equity-

promoting fiscal programs in Asia, Latin America and elsewhere – for example, public

spending on education, health care, and subsidies and transfers – require plenty of

fiscal resources and hence effective tax revenue mobilization.

      As noted earlier, we can expect population aging to impose significant fiscal

burdens on the governments of developing countries. Older populations will increase

the demand for public spending on pensions, health care, and other programs that

benefit the elderly. Therefore, even in developing Asia, which has more fiscal space

than Latin America and other parts of the world [ADB (2014)], fiscal space today is no

guarantee of fiscal space for tomorrow. For example, Lee and Mason (2014) find that


                                          5
Asian governments spent 2.4% of GDP on health care in 2010, but that figure is

projected to rise sharply to 7.3% by 2050. Similarly, public spending on social security

and welfare is projected to escalate from 2.5% in 2010 to 6.7% in 2015. Since Latin

America is also undergoing demographic transition, we can expect demographic

pressures to tighten fiscal space there as well [see Lee and Park (2014)]. In both

regions, population aging and other future fiscal demands such as environmental

protection will render tax revenue mobilization a top priority in the coming years.

       While Latin America has more experience than Asia in using fiscal policy to

reduce inequalities, another group of countries – the advanced economies – have

even more experience with inclusive fiscal policy. In fact, in the advanced economies,

redistribution of income via progressive taxation and pro-poor public spending has

long been one of the main objectives of fiscal policy. [see Heshmati, Kim, and Park

(2014)] A number of studies confirm that fiscal policy had a significant pro-equity

impact in advanced economies. Bastagli et al. (2012) found that, on average, 25

OECD countries experienced a 15% decrease in the Gini index of inequality due to

taxes and transfers in 1985-2005. Seven countries saw their Gini index fall by over

20% while five others achieved around 10% decrease through the successful

implementation of fiscal measures. Similarly, Joumard et al. (2012) found that taxes

and transfers reduced disposable income gaps in OECD countries.

       More broadly, the emergence of the redistributive state or welfare state in rich

countries is closely related to a well-known stylized fact. The relative size of the

government tends to increase as countries grow richer due to growing demand for the

government to provide key services such as education and health care. For example,

Mitchell (2007) documents a rise in the tax revenues to GDP ratio from 10% to 25%

over time for a group of 18 OECD countries during the course of the 20th century. The


                                           6
tax revenue expansion was made possible by a progressive strengthening of tax

administration capacity, and hence collection and enforcement. The expansion of tax

revenues was accompanied by a change in the structure of tax revenues in OECD. A

common pattern has been the sharp decline in the share of trade tax in total tax

revenues, and their replacement by income tax at first and subsequently by value

added tax (VAT), sales taxes, and other indirect taxes.

       We can expect the developing countries to follow in the footsteps of the

developed countries as they grow richer and their citizens’ demand for public services

grow. This is especially true for largely middle-income Asia and Latin America. Their

embrace of globalization – i.e. trade and financial integration – will reduce the relative

importance of trade tax, inflation tax, and financial repression, and increase that of

income taxes, VAT, and sales tax. Extensive structural change in the developing world

will impinge on tax revenue mobilization. For example, urbanization and the decline of

the informal sector will widen the tax net, and the emergence of large firms in urban

areas will facilitate collection. Another conducive factor is financial sector

development, which gives rise to transparent accounting procedures [Tanzi (1987,

1992), Burgess and Stern (1993)]. These developments put to the fore the key role of

administrative capabilities and effectiveness in inducing tax compliance, which, in turn,

is shaped by political economy factors [Cukierman, Edwards, and Tabellini (1992),

Slemrod and Yitzhaki (2002)].

3 Pattern of Tax Revenue Trends in Asia, Latin America, and Other Regions

       In this section, we take a look at recent tax revenue trends in Asia, Latin

America, and other parts of the world. Tax statistics are drawn from two data sources:

(i) Government Finance Statistics 2013 publication provides a cross section of

disaggregated tax/GDP for year 2012; (ii) World Development Indicators database


                                            7
provides panel data of total tax/GDP for years 1993-2012. In addition, we draw a

number of economic and demographic control variables from the panel data of the

World Development Indicators.

       Our empirical analysis centers on tax/GDP, which is a policy outcome, and its

determinants. We consider “time to prepare tax” as a proxy of tax collection and

administration across countries. We note that while this variable is informative, it is not

a replacement for measures of tax evasion and avoidance (see Slemrod and Yitzhaki,

2002, for a thorough discussion of these variables).

       Table 1.1 shows average tax/GDP during 1993-2012 by country and region.

Table 1.2 shows VAT and sales taxes rates across countries in 2015. A cross section

of disaggregated tax/GDP for year 2012 is shown in Figure 1. The blue-color bars

denote Asia, while red-color bars denote Latin America. Figure 1.1 shows that

tax/GDP is 20 percent or below for the majority of countries in Asia and Latin America.

Income tax/GDP is equal to less than 10 percent, below the level of OECD countries

(Figure 1.2). The pattern is mixed for goods and services tax/GDP (Figure 1.3) and

property tax/GDP (Figure 1.4). Trade tax/GDP is below 3 percent for most countries

(Figure 1.5). Social contribution/GDP is clearly higher in OECD countries than

elsewhere (Figure 1.6). A number of Latin American countries depend on grants and

other non-standard sources of government revenue (Figures 1.7 and 1.8).

       Figure 2 shows the composition of revenue collection, as share of GDP, for

Asia vis-à-vis Latin America, 2012. Tax revenues include income, goods, property,

and trade taxes. Income taxes include taxes on income, profits, capital gains, on

individual and corporations. Goods taxes include general taxes on goods and

services, and excises. Trade taxes include taxes on international trade and

transactions. Social contributions include social security contributions and other social


                                            8
contributions. Grants include revenues from foreign governments and international

organizations. The comparison suggests that the relative share of goods taxes is

higher in Latin America is higher than Asia.

       Figure 3.1 shows panel data of total tax/GDP for 1993-2012 for each 5-year

period. The average tax/GDP in Europe is 20 percent, higher than the rest of the world,

which is 10-15 percent. For Asia and Latin America, tax/GDP is trending higher, and

averaging to 14.8 percent and 17.9 percent, respectively, during the past five years.

On the other hand, North America and Sub-Saharan Africa witnessed declining

tax/GDP over the past decade.

       Figure 3.2 shows a proxy for complexity of the tax system, average time to

prepare and pay taxes, across regions. Over the past decade, tax preparation time

declined in all regions. During 2008-2012, North America had the shortest time of tax

preparation (155.4 hours), followed by Middle East (205.7 hours) and Europe (244.9

hours). On the other hand, tax preparation time is the longest in Latin America (383.0

hours), followed by Sub-Saharan Africa (316.6 hours) and Asia (245.4 hours).

       Institutional quality varies significantly across the regions, and the differences

persist over time. Figure 3.3 shows a summary index of government effectiveness,

where a higher number indicates stronger government effectiveness. Government is

most effective in North America, followed by Europe. On the other hand, Latin

America, Asia, Middle East, and Sub-Saharan Africa have relatively much weaker

institutional quality throughout the past two decades.

4 Determinants of Tax/GDP: Empirical Analysis

       In this section, we report and discuss the results of our regressions that explain

the tax/GDP ratio with a number of economic and demographic variables, along with

institutional quality or government effectiveness.


                                           9
        Denoting i for country and t for period (t=1, 2, 3), we estimate the following

equation:

(Tax/GDP)it = a0 + b1(Initial capita GDP)i0 + b2(GDP growth)it-1

              + b3(Population growth)it-1 + b4(Urban population)it-1

              + b5(Manufacturing value added)it-1 + b6(Openness)it-1

              + b7(GINI index)it-1 + b8(Average time to prepare tax)it

              + b9(Government effectiveness)it-1

              +   uit

where a0 is a constant term, b’s are coefficients to be estimated, and u it is an error

term.

        The sample period is 1993-2012. We use average 5-year panel observations:

1993-1997 (t=0); 1998-2002 (t=1); 2003-2007 (t=2); 2008-2012 (t=3). The initial capita

GDP is of the 1993-1997 period (t=0). For the average time to prepare tax, since the

data series start from 2005 and there is small year-to-year variation in each country,

we use the 2005-2012 average as a control. The regression is estimated on 5-year

average observations, t=1, 2, 3 (panel data of 3 periods per country), using ordinary

least squares (OLS) estimator.

        The above econometric specification is a simple one, but can provide us with

useful first-order information about the determinants of tax revenue collection.

Nevertheless, we take note of relevant empirical challenges, including tax

composition-economic growth feedback (Acosta-Ormaechea and Yoo, 2012), non-

rate tax system aspects (Robinson and Slemrod, 2012), and measurement of informal

sector and threat of financial disintermediation (Gordon and Lee, 2009).

        Table 2 reports our baseline regression estimates. Using the whole sample of

observations, we find that initial capita GDP, openness, GINI index of inequality, and


                                           10
government effectiveness are all positively associated with the level of Tax/GDP, while

manufacturing value added and population growth are negatively related. With North

America as a base region and controlling for other variables controlled, we find

evidence of regional effects. Our econometric specification is able to explain about

half of variation in the data. Our regression results suggest that there is no significant

relationship between tax/GDP and a number of other variables such as higher GDP

growth, larger urban population, and faster time to prepare tax.

       Table 3 shows the estimates for the Asian and Latin American sub-samples.

Compared to the whole-sample results, there are notable differences. More openness,

lower population growth, and higher government effectiveness are associated with

higher tax/GDP in Asia. On the other hand, for Latin America, lower manufacturing

value added, more openness, and lower population growth are associated with higher

tax/GDP. While the sub-sample regressions are able to explain more than half the

variation for Latin America and almost one third for Asia, they indicate that there is no

one-size-fits-all econometric specification for explaining tax/GDP collection across

Asia and Latin America.

       Figure 4 shows the economic significance of the coefficient estimates. The

figure reports economic significance of the variables that explain tax/GDP (%). Each

bar in the figure is a product of coefficient estimate of column (1) in Table 2 and the

corresponding variable’s sample standard deviation. The figure indicates that

openness, initial GDP per capita, GINI index of inequality, and population growth are

the most economically significant variable; one standard deviation increase is

associated with more than 2 percent increase in tax/GDP. In order of their economic

significance, a one standard deviation increase in the GINI index is positively

associated with Tax/GDP collection by 2.2 percent, initial GDP per capita 2.1 percent,


                                           11
population growth -2.1 percent, and openness 2.0 percent. A standard deviation

increase in government effectiveness, our variable of interest and a proxy for

institutional quality, is associated with 1.7 percent increase in Tax/GDP, a non-trivial

relationship.

       To perform a robustness check on the government effectiveness and regional

influences, we add controls for share of commodity exports – i.e. ores and metals,

fuels, and food – and its interaction with government effectiveness, along with

interaction terms for government effectiveness and regional dummy variables. Table

4 reports the results of this exercise. In most developing countries, the exports of

commodities are controlled by a state monopoly taxing exports, such as an export

board, or by a large foreign multinational that is taxed by the state. This may explain

some of the big values of the regional dummies in Africa and Latin America. The

results suggest that the significant effect of government effectiveness on tax/GDP

could partly reflect the government’s control of commodity export income.

       Due to data constraints, we are able to capture only a partial picture of cross-

regional differences. For example, in the case of Asia, Araki and Claus (2014) find that

tax collection and administration performance is influenced by institutional

arrangements of tax revenue bodies, the budget and expenditure process, as well as

tax audits, dispute settlement, and review systems, which vary across countries.

Regional differences also depend on the political economy and its interaction with

fiscal capacity. In the presence of inequality, for instance, income tax capacity is

influenced by income inequality – i.e. GINI index – and the relative political power of

the low-income and high-income groups (Besley and Persson, 2013). In addition, tax

revenues may react to economic growth in Latin America differently than in Asia, when




                                          12
there is a trade-off between growth and volatility of tax revenues (for the case of Latin

America, see Fricke and Sussmuth, 2014).

5 Concluding Observations

       In both Asia and Latin America, two largely middle-income regions of the

developing world, the share of tax revenues in GDP has risen in recent years, for a

number of reasons. Above all, as countries grow richer, the government tends to

expand in response to the citizens’ demand for more and better public services.

Further contributing to the growth of the state in the two regions are structural changes

such as population aging – which induces more public spending on health care, for

instance – and widening inequality – which brings about equity-promoting

expenditures such as transfers to poor households. Given the heterogeneity of both

Asia and Latin America, it is difficult to make sweeping comparative generalizations.

Nevertheless, Latin America collects more tax revenues than Asia, and the goods and

services tax plays a bigger role. Our empirical analysis of the determinants of tax

revenue performance reveals both differences and similarities between the two

regions. More openness and low population growth boosts revenues in both regions,

but higher government effectiveness and lower manufacturing value added does so

only in Asia and Latin America, respectively.

       Overall, our analysis yields a highly complex and nuanced picture of the tax

revenue mobilization challenges facing developing countries at a time when many of

them, especially in Asia and Latin America, face large and growing demands for fiscal

spending. The tax revenue mobilization performance of developing countries is

characterized by a great deal of heterogeneity. While progress has been made, the

revenue gap between the OECD countries and developing countries suggests room

for expanding revenues in developing countries, even though a large part of the gap


                                           13
reflects the larger size of the government in richer countries. Our study also validates

the key importance of government effectiveness and the quality of institutions. Adding

more disaggregated controls for various dimensions of institutional quality and

economic structure, which can help explain the sizable effect of continental dummies

in some of our regressions, would be a valuable future research agenda.

        The VAT is especially important because it can help broaden the tax base into

a more comprehensive and less distortionary structure. According to Keen (2013), in

both Asia and Latin America, the average central rate of the VAT increased by about

2% from 1993 to 2012, reaching about 11% and 14%, respectively. Yet the average

VAT revenue to GDP rose by 2 % GDP points in Latin America, while it fell by about

1% in Asia. This remarkable gap in de facto VAT collection can probably be explained

by divergent trends in the variation of the actual VAT rates across different economic

sectors and VAT enforcement. But without more disaggregated data, we are simply

unable to make clear inferences from the divergent trends between these two regions.6

Quantifying and understanding the importance of these factors in accounting for the

heterogeneous tax revenue performance across different countries and regions

remains an important future research agenda.

on depending the VAT tax collection in the Americas and Caribbean may be greater than in Asia/Pacific.
Second, the VAT collection efficiency, defined by the ratio of VAT revenue to aggregate consumption
divided by the standard VAT rate, is affected by the economic and the political structure, as well as by
the development and institutional patterns of countries. Aizenman and Jinjarak (2008) found that a one
standard deviation increase in urbanization, trade openness, and the share of agriculture is associated
with a rise of the VAT collection efficiency by about 13%, 4%, and -5%, respectively. A one standard
deviation increase in GDP/Capita is associated with a rise of the tax efficiency by about 8%. A one
standard deviation increase in durability of political regime, and in the ease and fluidity of political
participation, is associated with a rise of the VAT collection efficiency by about 3% and 4%, respectively.
Qualitatively identical results apply for an alternative measure of VAT collection efficiency, defined by
the ratio of VAT revenue to GDP divided by the standard VAT.

Table 2: Baseline Estimation Results.
This table reports OLS estimation, using the whole sample of observations. The
dependent variable is Tax/GDP (%). The sample period is 1993-2012. We use average
5-year panel observations: 1993-1997 (t=0); 1998-2002 (t=1); 2003-2007 (t=2); 2008-2012
(t=3). The Initial capita GDP is of the 1993-1997 period (t=0). For the Average time to
prepare tax, as the series start from 2005 and there is small year-to-year variation in each
country, we use the 2005-2012 average as a control. Higher Government effectiveness
indicates stronger performance. The regression is estimated on 5-year average
observations, t=1, 2, 3 (panel data of 3 periods per country), using the ordinary least
squares estimator. Standard errors are in parentheses (***, **, * signifies 1, 5, 10 level).

Table 3: Regression Results of Sub-Samples of Asia and Latin America.
This table reports OLS estimation, using Asia and Latin America sub-samples. The
dependent variable is Tax/GDP (%). The sample period is 1993-2012. We use average
5-year panel observations: 1993-1997 (t=0); 1998-2002 (t=1); 2003-2007 (t=2); 2008-2012
(t=3). The Initial capita GDP is of the 1993-1997 period (t=0). Higher Government
effectiveness indicates stronger performance. The regression is estimated on 5-year
average observations, t=1, 2, 3 (panel data of 3 periods per country), using the ordinary
least squares estimator. Standard errors are in parentheses (***, **, * signifies 1, 5, 10
level).

Table 4: Robustness.
This table reports OLS estimation, using the whole sample of observations. The
dependent variable is Tax/GDP (%). The sample period is 1993-2012. We use average
5-year panel observations: 1993-1997 (t=0); 1998-2002 (t=1); 2003-2007 (t=2); 2008-2012
(t=3). The Initial capita GDP is of the 1993-1997 period (t=0). Higher Government
effectiveness indicates stronger performance. Share of commodities in exports covers
ores and metals, fuels, and food in merchandise exports. The regression is estimated on
5-year average observations, t=1, 2, 3 (panel data of 3 periods per country), using the
ordinary least squares estimator. Standard errors are in parentheses (***, **, * signifies 1,
