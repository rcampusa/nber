                                          ABSTRACT

We examine how substance use disorder (SUD) treatment providers respond to private insurance
expansions induced by state equal coverage (‘parity’) laws for SUD treatment vis-à-vis general
healthcare services. Economic theory suggests that such laws will lead to changes in provider
behaviors. We use data on licensed specialty SUD treatment providers in the United States
between 1997 and 2010 in a differences-in-differences analysis. During this period, 12 states
implemented laws that require equality in coverage for SUD treatment. Following the passage of
a state parity law we find that providers are less likely to participate in public markets, are less
likely to offer price discounts to patients, and increase the quantity of healthcare provided.
Further we find evidence that treatment intensity declines following passage of a parity law and
heterogeneity in effects across ownership status.

I. Introduction
         State-level equal coverage (‘parity’) laws for substance use disorder (SUD) treatment in

private insurance plans prohibit discriminatory coverage of SUD treatment services vis-à-vis

general healthcare services. Standard economic models (Sloan, Mitchell et al. 1978, Mcguire

and Pauly 1991) suggest that parity laws can induce changes in the insurance markets in which

providers participate as well as the quantity and intensity of treatment provided. In this study we

test these predictions using data on specialty SUD treatment providers between 1997 and 2010.

         There are several reasons why understanding factors that affect SUD treatment provision

is important beyond simply testing the predictive power of economic models in real-world

healthcare markets. These reasons relate to the financial and non-financial costs SUDs impose

on individuals and society. In terms of direct financial costs, the U.S. spends nearly $28B per

year on SUD treatment, 1 the majority (69%) of which is financed by public payers (Substance

Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2013) with specialty SUD treatment

representing roughly 70% of treatment received in the past year (Center for Behavioral Health

Statistics and Quality 2016). 2 The full costs of SUDs extend beyond financial costs of addiction

treatment, however. For example, SUDs are linked with morbidity and mortality (Carpenter and

Dobkin 2009, Carpenter and Dobkin 2011), increased use of general healthcare services (Balsa,

French et al. 2009), employment problems (Terza 2002), crime (Carpenter 2007), violence

(Markowitz and Grossman 2000), and traffic accidents (Adams, Blackburn et al. 2012).

         Not surprisingly, the total annual economic costs of SUDs in the U.S. are large: $519B

(Caulkins, Kasunic et al. 2014). 3 In addition, the U.S. is the midst of an alarming and

unprecedented rise in opioid use disorders (OUDs) with 115 overdose deaths per day attributable

to this drug. Indeed, both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Department of

Health and Human Services have classified this rise in OUDs as an epidemic (Centers for

Disease Control and Prevention 2017). The economic burden of non-medical prescription opioid

use to the U.S. economy is estimated to be $63B per year (Birnbaum, White et al. 2011). 4

Moreover, the emergence of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl and the re-emergence of heroin as

substances of abuse are deeply concerning to healthcare providers, advocates, and policymakers.

           Although SUDs place a great burden on both the affected individual and society,

treatment has been shown to reduce SUDs and their associated harms among treated patients

(Rajkumar and French 1997, Lu and McGuire 2002, Stewart, Gossop et al. 2002, Kunz, French

et al. 2004, Reuter and Pollack 2006, Popovici and French 2013, Volkow, Frieden et al. 2014,

Swensen 2015, Bondurant, Lindo et al. 2016). Thus, understanding how SUD providers respond

to changes in treatment coverage, such as those induced by insurance expansions, is important

for promoting public health and minimizing social costs.

           To study this question, we use data on the near universe of licensed specialty SUD

treatment providers in the U.S. between 1997 and 2010. Over this time period, 12 states

implemented laws that compel private insurers to provide equal coverage for SUD treatment

services vis-à-vis general healthcare services, offering a quasi-experiment with which to study

parity impacts on the supply side of treatment. Using a differences-in-differences design, we

examine provider response along several margins: participation in specific insurance markets,

use of price discounts, charity care provision, treatment quantity, and treatment setting.

    This estimate is inflated by the authors from 2009 dollars to 2017 dollars using the Consumer Price Index.

                                                            3
           Our findings suggest that SUD providers alter their care practices following the

implementation of a state SUD treatment parity law. Following passage of parity laws, providers

are less likely to participate in public insurance markets, are less likely to offer price discounts to

patients, increase the quantity of healthcare provided, and are more likely to offer less intensive

treatment – measured by setting (outpatient vs. inpatient). We observe heterogeneity in effects

by ownership status (for-profits vs. non-profits).

           This manuscript proceeds as follows: Section 2 describes state-level SUD treatment

parity laws and related literature. Section 3 outlines the conceptual framework that guides our

empirical analysis. Data, variables, and methods are outlined in Section 4. In Section 5 we

present our main findings and Section 6 reports robustness checks. Section 7 concludes.

2. Background and related literature

2.1 Government efforts to expand SUD treatment coverage in private insurance markets

           Historically SUD treatment benefits have been covered less favorably than general

healthcare benefits in private insurance plans (Starr 2002). 5 Federal and state governments have

attempted to address this coverage disparity.

           The federal government has implemented two key coverage changes. The 2008 Mental

Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) became effective in 2010. MHPAEA

prohibits differences in treatment limits and cost-sharing, and extends coverage requirements to

SUD treatment services in a range of public and private health insurance plans (Medicaid,

Medicare, group and individual private plans). However, the Act does not mandate that plans

provide SUD coverage; rather it regulates coverage generosity within plans that cover SUD

services. The ACA, effective January 1st 2014, lists coverage for SUD treatment as one of ten



5
    Public insurance coverage has historically been less generous as well.

                                                            4
required benefits for private insurance offered for sale on online health insurance exchange

marketplaces and individuals newly insured through expanded Medicaid programs. This Act

extends MHPAEA by mandating equal coverage for SUD treatment in all affected plans rather

than requiring parity only for plans that offer SUD benefits.

       States have also attempted to address less generous coverage for SUD treatment in

private markets by mandating coverage for such services (‘parity laws’). There is substantial

heterogeneity in terms of how states choose to regulate SUD coverage. Some states simply

require insurers to offer a set of benefits to beneficiaries (‘mandated offer’), place few limits on

what benefits must be covered, and allow for substantial disparity between SUD treatment and

general healthcare services in terms of cost-sharing and service limits. On the other hand, ‘full

parity’ laws require insurers to cover SUD treatment and prohibit any discriminatory coverage

for SUD treatment vis-à-vis general healthcare treatment in terms of cost-sharing and service

limits. Hence these laws are designed to ensure equal coverage across the two groups of

services. Finally, some states opt for a compromise: insurers are required to cover a specified set

of benefits with restrictions on cost-sharing and service limits but differential treatment between

SUD and general healthcare service coverage is permitted (‘mandated benefits’).

       We examine the effects of full parity for both alcohol and illicit drug treatment. We

choose to study full parity laws offering coverage for both alcohol and illicit drug treatment as

these laws are likely to have the most impact on provider behavior as the majority of providers

treat both alcohol use and illicit drug disorders. In our data, the shares of patients in treatment

for alcohol, illicit drugs, and both are 23%, 23%, and 53%.

2.2 Evidence on private insurance expansion effects




                                                  5
         Recent studies have relied on several regulatory changes to study the effect of private

insurance expansions on SUD treatment use: 6 the 2006 Massachusetts healthcare reform that

increased both public and private insurance coverage, the ACA 2010 dependent coverage

provision (which requires that many private insurers offer coverage to dependent children of

beneficiaries through the child’s 26th birthday), MHPAEA, and state parity laws.

         Meara, Golberstein et al. (2014) examine changes in inpatient hospital care among young

adults after the 2006 healthcare reform law in Massachusetts. The authors find declines in SUD-

related emergency department use and inpatient hospitalizations, which could be attributable to

expanded access to SUD treatment services in other settings (e.g. outpatient). Maclean and

Saloner (2018) find some evidence that admissions to specialty SUD treatment increase post-

reform, but the finding is not entirely stable across different specifications.

         Golberstein, Busch et al. (2015) document that the ACA dependent coverage provision

leads to an increase in SUD admissions to hospitals. However, Saloner and Cook (2014) find

that the provision has no effect on SUD treatment use in the National Survey of Drug Use and

Health (NSDUH). Akosa Antwi, Moriya et al. (2015) document that SUD hospital admissions

among young adults, relative to a sample of slightly older adults, are not appreciably affected by

this provision. Finally, Saloner, Akosa Antwi et al. (2018), using a national database of

admissions to specialty SUD treatment, find that the provision decreases admissions, which

could suggest that the provision allows patients to receive care in other settings.

         Busch, Epstein et al. (2014), McGinty, Busch et al. (2015), and Ettner, Harwood et al.

(2016) use insurance claims to examine the effect of MHPAEA. Findings from these studies


6
  There are numerous studies that examine individual decisions to obtain insurance, but we focus our attention here
on studies that examine changes in Federal or state laws as they are most comparable to our analysis. There is also a
literature that examines the effect of public insurance (e.g., Medicaid) expansions. See for a review Maclean and
Saloner (2017) of these studies.

                                                         6
suggest a modest impact of MHPAEA on SUD treatment use overall, but increases in the use of

out-of-network services (McGinty, Busch et al. 2015). Access to out-of-network services is

important in the context of SUD treatment, as many networks do not offer adequate access to

specialist addiction treatment providers.

       Dave and Mukerjee (2011) show that parity laws increase the number of admissions to

SUD treatment using a national database of admissions to specialty treatment. Wen, Cummings

et al. (2013) and Wen, Hockenberry et al. (2017) find that state parity laws increase admissions

using the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services, the same dataset we employ.

3. Conceptual framework

       The starting point for our empirical analysis is the Sloan, Mitchell et al. (1978) mixed

economy model. Although the Sloan model was developed in the context, and has been

primarily applied to analyses, of state Medicaid programs (Sloan, Mitchell et al. 1978, Baker and

Royalty 2000, Garthwaite 2012, Buchmueller, Miller et al. 2016), the model offers predictions

for private insurance market changes; see Table 1 in Sloan, Mitchell et al. (1978).

       In the Sloan model healthcare providers are hypothesized to operate in a healthcare

market with two types of insured patients – the privately insured and the publicly insured – and

uninsured patients. In our context, this third patient group includes patients who self-pay (either

because they do not have insurance or their insurance does not cover SUD treatment services),

and poor uninsured patients who do not pay for treatment and instead receive free care (`charity

care’). The assumed order of reimbursement rates in the Sloan model is as follows: privately

insured, publically insured, and charity care. Providers prefer to treat patients in this order and

will only treat lower reimbursement rate patients when there are no higher reimbursement rate




                                                  7
patients remaining in the market. Of course, provider j will only treat patients within group i if

𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖 ≥ 𝑀𝑀𝐶𝐶𝑗𝑗 ; where 𝑖𝑖 ∈ {𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖, 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖, 𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢}.

           Figure 1 graphically depicts our conceptual model adopted from Sloan, Mitchell et al.

(1978). The marginal revenue curve faced by the provider is kinked; in particular there are three

segments which capture patient groups that offer different levels of reimbursement. The leftmost

downward sloping segment of the marginal revenue curve, 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑝𝑝 , captures the privately insured

market. The horizontal segment, 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑚𝑚 , captures the public market; e.g., Medicaid, Medicare,

state-financed, and other public insurance programs. Finally, the rightmost downward sloping

segment of the marginal revenue curve (𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑐𝑐 ) reflects the market segment that offers the lowest

reimbursement rate to providers, the charity care market. Where a provider chooses to operate –

that is his mix of privately insured, publicly insured, and uninsured patients – is determined by

his marginal cost curve. In Figure 1 providers with marginal cost curves 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀1 will treat only

privately insured patients while providers with marginal cost curves 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀2 and 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀3 will treat a

mix of privately and publicly insured patients. Finally, providers operating with marginal cost

curve 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀4 will treat patients in all three markets (private, public, and uninsured).

           In our study, we explore how, all else equal, providers respond to changes in the share of

the private insurance market that covers SUD treatment services. In the context of the Sloan

model, a state parity law in the private insurance market can be depicted as an outward rotation

in the 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑝𝑝 segment of the marginal revenue curve to 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑝𝑝′ . That is, a larger share of the

privately insured now has access to SUD treatment benefits. 7 We assume for simplicity that

individuals who gain private insurance coverage for SUD treatment services through the



7
 Basic demand theory implies that a decrease in price should increase the quantity demanded, while changes in the
market size should lead to a change in demand. We focus on the latter change here: an increase in the market size.

                                                                       8
expansion have, on average, comparable SUDs and preferences as those individuals who held

private coverage for these services prior to the expansion. 8 Relatedly, as the private insurance

market expands, the uninsured market declines (those individuals who gain private coverage for

SUD treatment services in our context held private insurance that did not cover these services

prior to the expansion). Thus, the uninsured portion of the marginal revenue curve (𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑢𝑢 ) should

rotate inward to 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑢𝑢′ . There is no change in the size of the public market (𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑚𝑚 ).

         The impact of this expansion on the providers’ mix of patients and quantity of healthcare

services is predicated on where the marginal cost curves of providers are located prior to the

expansion of private coverage for SUD treatment services. Specifically, providers with marginal

cost curve 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀1 who treated only privately insured patients in the pre-expansion period will

continue to participate in the private market only, but will increase the quantity of services they

provide (𝑄𝑄1 to 𝑄𝑄2 ). Providers with marginal costs curves 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀2 will increase the share of

privately insured patients; indeed they will leave the public market entirely, and increase the

quantity of services provided (𝑄𝑄3 to 𝑄𝑄4 ). Providers with marginal cost curves 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀3 – participate

in the private and public market in the pre-expansion period – will shift their patient mix toward

privately insured patients, but will continue to participate in both the private and public market

and provide the same quantity of healthcare post-expansion. Finally, providers with marginal




8
  It may be that individuals who hold private insurance coverage contracts that are compelled to provide SUD
treatment services through state mandates are different, particularly in terms of the prevalence or severity of SUDs,
than comparable individuals who had private coverage for these services prior to the expansion. To the best of our
knowledge, there is no evidence on this question. However, Busch, Meara et al. (2013) show that individuals who
gain access to Medicaid insurance through the ACA-related expansions have somewhat higher SUD prevalence
rates than individuals holding Medicaid insurance prior to these expansions. These findings suggest that there may
be differences in SUD treatment needs, and therefore in marginal cost of treatment, between those individuals
gaining insurance through state parity laws and those individuals previously holding private insurance. If the newly
insured were more costly than the previously insured, this higher marginal cost would offset a part of the benefit in
terms of their higher reimbursement rate (i.e., marginal revenue).

                                                          9
cost curve 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀4 , who participate in all three markets pre-expansion, exit the uninsured market,

and increase quantity (𝑄𝑄6 to 𝑄𝑄7 ).

         Thus, the Sloan model leads to several market-level predictions regarding the impact of a

private insurance expansion for SUD treatment services.

Prediction 1: Patient mix will shift toward the privately insured.

Prediction 2: Patient mix will shift away from the uninsured.

Prediction 3: The quantity of healthcare services will increase.

         The effect of parity laws on provider participation in the public market is ambiguous as

the effect will be determined by the responses of providers with marginal cost curves 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀2 and

𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀4 . While the Sloan model does not offer predictions for treatment setting or services offered,

we can turn to additional theories. For instance, provider-induced-demand (PID) theory suggests

that, while providers may induce excess treatment pre-expansion, there may be more scope for

inducement as the share of patients with private coverage for SUD treatment increases (McGuire

2000). Moreover, models that allow heterogeneity across the types of patients providers treat

open the door to the possibility that inducement may vary across patients of different types

(Mcguire and Pauly 1991, Howard, Hockenberry et al. 2017). This pathway implies that

treatment intensity will increase post-expansion. 9 We note the possibility raised by Chen (2014)



9
  The discussion thus far has assumed that the populations covered by specific insurance plans and the uninsured
will remain stable following the passage of the parity law. If instead individuals previously insured through
Medicaid substitute private for public insurance then the 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑝𝑝 will rotate farther outward and the 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑚𝑚 segment of
the marginal revenue curve will shrink. Similarly, if previously uninsured individuals take up private insurance to
gain access to the newly covered benefits, this behavior will lead to an additional outward rotation of the 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑝𝑝
segment and the 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑢𝑢 segment will rotate farther inward. We test the hypothesis that passage of a parity law
induces individuals to take up private insurance or substitute private for public insurance by regressing the
proportion of the state with any insurance, private insurance, and public insurance using Equation (1), outlined later
in the manuscript, and data from the Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the Current Population Survey
over our study period (1997 to 2010; dropping 1999 and 2001 to align with our study period which is discussed
later). We find no evidence that passage of a parity law leads to changes in overall insurance coverage or private
coverage. Surprisingly, we find some evidence that public insurance coverage increases post-expansion. It is

                                                          10
that charity care may be a normal good. If charity care is a normal good and parity laws increase

provider income overall, we may find that, post-expansion, charity care provision increases.

         In the canonical Sloan model all uninsured patients are assumed to offer lower

reimbursement rates to providers than either the privately insured or the publicly insured.

However, numerous studies within health economics show that the uninsured self-paying

patients pay higher prices for services than the privately insured. In particular, physicians charge

uninsured self-paying patients on average 2.5 times the amount most insurers are charged

(Tompkins, Altman et al. 2006, Anderson 2007, Melnick and Fonkych 2013, Bai 2015,

Dusetzina, Basch et al. 2015). 10 Given this disconnect between the patient groups outlined in the

Sloan model and reimbursement rates offered by self-paying patients, we separately consider the

self-pay market and the charity care market. Because self-pay patients plausibly offer higher

reimbursement rates to providers than other patients, we expect no change in provider

participation in the self-pay market post-expansion.

4. Data and methods

4.1 National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS)

         We use the N-SSATS as our primary source of data. These data provide information on

all licensed providers known to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration

(SAMHSA) that offered specialty SUD treatment between 1997 and 2016. 11 SAMHSA defines

a specialty SUD treatment facility as a hospital, a residential facility, an outpatient treatment

facility, or other facility with an SUD treatment program that offers the following services:

outpatient, inpatient, or residential/rehabilitation treatment; detoxification; opioid treatment; and



possible that this increase could reflect well-established reporting error in the CPS (Lo Sasso and Buchmueller
2004). See Supplementary Table 1.
10
   Insurers arguably have a stronger bargaining position vis-à-vis providers than a single patient.
11
   Due to survey re-designs there are no data for 1999 or 2001.

                                                         11
halfway-house services. This care reflects roughly 70% of SUD treatment received in 2015

(Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality 2016). We focus on years 1997 to 2010.

We truncate the sample in 2010 as MHPAEA became effective in this year and this federal law

supersedes state laws (Dave and Mukerjee 2011). Moreover, early private provisions of the

ACA became effective in late 2010 (Tello-Trillo 2016) and several states expanded Medicaid in

advance of the ACA between 2010 and 2011 (Sommers, Arntson et al. 2013).

        The N-SSATS data provide a ‘snap shot’ of one day of a provider’s operations, where a

provider is a facility that delivers specialty SUD treatment services. Between 1997 and 2000 the

survey day is near the end of September, and the end of March thereafter. Administrators send a

survey to all known licensed specialty SUD providers each year. A staff member familiar with

the provider’s operations completes the survey. Over our study period the N-SSATS response

rates are over 85%. The N-SSATS is an unbalanced panel, we observe a provider on average 5

times, and our analysis dataset consists of 158,049 provider/year observations. Due to missing

responses to outcome variables, our sample sizes vary to some extent across regressions.

4.2 Outcome variables

        We consider several possible margins along which specialty SUD treatment providers

may respond to changes in coverage for SUD treatment. First, we examine accepted forms of

payment: self-pay, private insurance, and public insurance (Medicaid, Medicare, other state

financed, and military). 12 These variables proxy for provider participation in particular markets.

Additionally, we explore the provision of price discounts, which is proxied by the use of a

sliding scale that allows some patients to pay a reduced fee. We consider this outcome to

explore whether, post-expansion, providers have less incentive to accept discounted fees from


12
   We group all public insurance forms in one group for brevity, but we explore specific public markets formally
later in the manuscript.

                                                        12
self-pay patients (who plausibly offer the highest reimbursement rates) as the number of patients

with private insurance increases. Finally, we investigate the provision of free care to the

uninsured as measured by provision of free care to some or all patients (‘charity care’). Payment

variables were added to the N-SSATS in 2000 while charity care variables were added in 2003.

        Second, we examine treatment quantity: past year admissions and number of patients on

the survey day. Third, we consider treatment setting, outpatient and inpatient/residential

treatment. Not all providers offer treatment in both settings. However, we expect that passage

of a parity law does not affect the propensity of offering treatment in these settings. 13 14

4.3 State parity laws

        Our source of variation is changes in state parity laws that compel private insurers to

provide equal coverage for both alcohol and illicit drug treatment, and general healthcare

services between 1997 and 2010. 15 To construct our parity measures, we use data from

Robinson, Connolly et al. (2006), Barry and Sindelar (2007), and Wen, Cummings et al.

(2013). 16 Between1997 and 2010, 12 states passed a full parity law. Specific states that passed a

parity law and associated effective dates are reported in Table 1. We match law effective dates

to the N-SSATS survey day; hence our N-SSATS effective dates depart from actual effective

dates in some years (details available on request from the corresponding author).

        These law changes include states that implemented a parity law for the first time and

states that altered existing statue; i.e., increasing the strength of the law from mandated offer or


13
   We have estimated our quantity, setting, and offered services and programs regressions on the period 2000-2010
to match the market participation and charity care provision analyses. Results are broadly unchanged, although
somewhat less precise as there are fewer changes that we can leverage. See Supplementary Tables 2, 3, and 4.
14
   See Supplementary Table 5. We regress the probability that a provider offers outpatient and inpatient care using
Equation (1); which is outlined later in the manuscript.
15
   In previous versions of this manuscript we relied on effective dates provided by the National Council of State
Legislatures (2017). However, we learned that there were some errors in these data and therefore updated our
coding scheme following the recent literature. More details are available on request from the corresponding author.
16
   We thank Hefei Wen and Jason Hockenberry for providing updated information on state parity laws.

                                                        13
minimum mandated benefits. Table 1 also indicates the type of law change (e.g., no law to full

parity, minimum mandated benefits to full parity). We note that the treatment ‘dose’ will vary

across states to some extent; e.g., the dose is larger for states that transition from no law to a full

parity law than for states that transition from minimum mandated benefits to a full parity law.

Henceforth, we refer to full parity laws as simply parity laws.

4.4 Control variables

        We merge several state-level variables into the N-SSATS to control for state

characteristics in our regression models. First, we merge in the share of the population that is

employed by a small firm, defined as less than 100 employees; as larger firms are more likely to

self-insure and thus be exempt from state insurance mandates (Kaestner and Simon 2002), from

the Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the Current Population Survey (ASEC). We

merge state-year level demographic (age, sex, race, ethnicity, education, and family income)

variables from the ASEC. We include variables that potentially proxy state-level preferences

toward substance use and addiction treatment: the beer tax per gallon from the Brewers’

Almanac (The Beer Institute 2012), marijuana decriminalization (Pacula, Chriqui et al. 2003), 17

legalization of medical marijuana (Sabia and Nguyen 2016), a prescription drug monitoring

program (PDMP) (Ali, Dowd et al. 2017), and annual funding from the Substance Abuse

Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) block grant program (obtained from SAMHSA). 18 We

control for the Medicaid income eligibility for a family of three (Hamersma 2013) 19 and Health

Insurance Flexibility and Accountability (HIFA) waivers (Wen, Hockenberry et al. 2017).




17
   We thank Rosalie Pacula for sharing updated marijuana decriminalization data with us.
18
   We thank Brandy Lipton for providing these data to us.
19
   We are grateful to Sarah Hamersma for kindly sharing Medicaid income eligibility with us. We match the
Medicaid income data using the 4th (1st) quarter information between 1997 and 2000 (2002 and 2010).

                                                       14
        We control for social policies: the effective state minimum wage, maximum Temporary

Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) benefit for a family of four, and the state Earned Income

Tax Credit (EITC) as a proportion of the federal EITC, and Governor parity (University of

Kentucky Center for Poverty Research Center 2016). 20 We include the state population from the

U.S. Census Bureau. We inflate all monetary values to 2010 terms using the Consumer Price

Index. Finally, we include provider-level controls: primary focus, solo practitioner, ownership,

located within a hospital, and government financing (not including public insurance payments).

4.5 Empirical model

        We estimate the relationship between state parity laws on SUD provider outcomes with

the following differences-in-differences (DD) regression model:

(1)      𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝐿𝐿𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠−1 + 𝛽𝛽2′ 𝑋𝑋𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝛽𝛽3′ 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 + 𝜏𝜏𝑡𝑡 +𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

         𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a measure of specialty SUD treatment for provider i in state s in year t. 𝐿𝐿𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠−1 is an

indicator variable that takes on a value of one if state s has passed a parity law in year t-1 and

zero otherwise. We lag this variable by one year to allow for a time delay between the passage

of a law and our outcomes. 21 𝑋𝑋𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is a vector of state demographics and policies, and 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a

vector of provider characteristics. 𝑆𝑆𝑠𝑠 and 𝜏𝜏𝑡𝑡 are vectors of state and year fixed effects. 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the

error term. We cluster standard errors around the state. 22 We estimate linear probability models

(LPM) when the outcome is binary and OLS when the outcome is continuous. 23

5. Results



20
   We follow Maclean and Saloner (2018) and treat the major of DC as the de facto mayor of that locality.
21
   Moreover, our admissions variable pertains to the past year. We have estimated a version of Equation (1) that
uses the contemporaneous parity laws. Results are very similar. See Supplementary Tables 6, 7, 8, and 9.
22
   The N-SSATS includes all states in all years and we have 51 clusters (Cameron and Miller 2015).
23
   We have estimated binary outcome regressions with a probit model and continuous outcomes with a Poisson
model an OLS model in which outcomes are log transformed (we add one to zero values, but results are robust to
adding smaller values such as 0.5. These results are available on request from the authors). Results are robust to
these alternative specifications. See Supplementary Tables 10, 11, 12, and 13.

                                                                      15
5.1 Summary statistics

         Table 2 reports summary statistics for the full sample and for states that pass and do not

pass a parity law. In terms of market participation and acceptance of discounted payments, in the

full sample 91%, 66%, and 68% of providers participate in the self-pay, private, and public

markets while 64% offer price discounts through the use of a sliding scale and 52% provide

charity care. 24 The average number of annual admissions is 309 and the number of patients

receiving treatment on the survey day is 88. There are 25 patients receiving inpatient care and 96

patients receiving outpatient care; the sum of patients receiving inpatient and outpatient care

does not equal the average number of total patients as not all facilities offer both inpatient and

outpatient treatment. 13% of the state/year observations have a full parity law in place. State

demographics and policies are similar to a national sample.

         We next examine states that do and do not pass a parity law by 2010. Participation in the

insurance markets we study and acceptance of discounted payments is fairly similar across the

two groups of states. States that pass a parity law are more likely to provide charity care than

states that do not pass such a law: 58% vs. 52%. Moreover, there is a stark difference in the

number of annual admissions: 284 in states that pass a parity law and 314 in states that do not

pass such a law. Patient volumes, both overall and in particular treatment settings, are similar

across these two groups of states.


24
   We note that the percentages in the analysis sample do not match the shares of patients treated by providers in the
Sloan model. In particular, based on the Sloan model we would expect the following order of participation in
specific markets: private insurance > public insurance > charity care. However, we find that the share participating
in the public market is greater than the share participating in the private market. We suspect that this difference is a
result of our variable coding (which we elected in an attempt to maintain a tractable manuscript; otherwise we would
report results for four public markets rather than one public market in all analyses of market participation). The
Sloan model focuses on Medicaid participation and we group all public insurance together in our main analysis and
code a provider as participating in the public market if he/she accepts any form of public insurance. As we show
later in the manuscript, participation in any specific public market is lower than participation in the private market as
predicted by the Sloan model. For example, the share of providers participating in the Medicaid market is 54%,
which is less than the share participating in the private market (66%).

                                                           16
       Overall, the two groups of states are broadly comparable in terms of demographics.

However, there are important differences in terms of state policies and size. For example, states

that pass parity laws have lower beer taxes, are less likely to decriminalize marijuana or legalize

medical marijuana, are less likely to have a PDMP, have less generous Medicaid coverage, and

have lower SAPT block grant funding. Finally, states that pass parity laws are less likely to have

Democrat governors and are smaller in terms of population. The majority of the differences in

outcomes and control variables between states that pass and do not pass a parity law by 2010 are

statistically different from zero; see Column 4 in Table 2.

5.3 Regression analysis of provider participation in specific insurance markets

       Table 3 reports regression results for the effect of parity laws on market participation,

discounted payment acceptance, and provision of charity care. We find that, post-expansion,

providers in expanding states are 2.6 percentage points (4.1%, we compare the estimated beta to

the sample proportion/mean to construct relative magnitudes throughout the paper) less likely to

offer price discounts and 3.3 percentage points (4.9%) less likely to participate in the public

market relative to providers in non-expanding states. We find no statistically significant

evidence that parity law passage leads to changes in self-pay or private market participation or

provision of charity care among providers in expanding states.

       In Appendix Table 1, we consider the effects of parity laws on participation in distinct

public markets: Medicaid, Medicare, other state financed, and military. Our results for public

market participation are driven by a reduction in the probability of participating in the Medicaid

and other state-financed insurance markets. In particular, post-expansion providers in expanding

states are 4.0 percentage points (7.5%) less likely to participate in Medicaid and 3.5 percentage

points (9.9%) less likely to participate in other states health insurance programs than providers in



                                                 17
non-expanding states. We find no statistically significant evidence that passage of state parity

laws leads to changes in provider participation in the Medicare or military markets.

       We also consider parity effects on separate forms of charity care: providing care at no

charge to patients who cannot pay and offering free care to all patients in Appendix Table 2. We

find no statistically significant evidence that passage of a parity law leads to changes in the

probability of offering either type of charity care.

5.4 Regression analysis of treatment quantity

       Table 4 reports results for treatment quantity. Post-expansion, treatment quantity

increases among providers in expanding states relative to non-expanding states. More

specifically, following the passage of a parity law, there are 28.4 (9.2%) additional admissions

each year and there are 12.9 (14.7%) more patients receiving treatment on the survey date.

5.5 Regression analysis of treatment setting

       We next report estimated effects of parity laws on treatment setting (Table 5). These

variables serve as proxies for treatment intensity. We find no statistically significant evidence

that the number of patients receiving care in inpatient settings is altered by the passage of a state

parity law, although the coefficient estimate is negative which suggests that this number

declines, 95% confidence intervals include positive values, however. Post-expansion, the

number of patients receiving care in outpatient settings increases by 14.1 (14.7%).

6. Robustness checks

6.1 Heterogeneity by ownership status

       Research on hospitals and SUD treatment providers suggests potential differences in

expenditures, treatment offerings, and quality of care by ownership status (Sloan, Picone et al.

2001, Richter, Choi et al. 2004, Silverman and Skinner 2004, Horwitz 2005, Bachhuber,



                                                  18
Southern et al. 2014). In particular for-profit hospitals are more likely than government or non-

profit hospitals to respond to incentive changes to minimize costs and maximize revenues. 25

Ownership-stratified estimates for market participation, treatment quantity, and treatment setting

are reported in Appendix Table 3, 4, and 5. We group government and non-profit providers as

non-profits due to the small number of government-owned providers (14.1% of the sample).

         Examination of the mean values for our outcome variables across providers of different

ownership statuses provides prima facie evidence of differences in behavior across the two

groups and supports an ownership-stratified analysis. For example, 23.9% of for-profits provide

charity care while 63.7% of non-profits provide this type of care, and there are on average 257

admissions to for-profit providers and 329 annual admissions to non-profit providers.

         We document heterogeneity in the effects of parity laws on market participation,

acceptance of discounted payments, and provision of charity care (Appendix 3). First, we find

that the decline in the probability of accepting discounted payments observed in the full sample

is driven entirely by for-profits: coefficient estimates are precise and large in magnitude within

the for-profit sample, and small and imprecise within the non-profit sample. More specifically,

passage of a parity law leads to a 7.7 percentage point (15.4%) decline in the probability that a

for-profit provider offer price discounts through a sliding scale in expanding states relative to

non-expanding states. While we find no evidence in the full sample that passage of parity leads

to changes in the probability of providing charity care, we find that passage of a parity law leads

to a 4.6 percentage point (19.2%) reduction in the probability of providing such care among for-




25
   We explored the possibility that passage of a parity law could lead to changes in ownership status. Interesting, we
find evidence that passage of a state parity law leads to a 7% decline in the probability that a provider is for-profit.
While we are uncertain as to what lies behind this somewhat unexpected finding, this finding does suggest that
stratifying the sample on ownership status may lead to conditional-on-positive bias in our estimates and we urge
readers to interpret stratified findings with some caution. See Supplementary Table 14.

                                                          19
profits. The relative effect size (i.e., comparing the estimated beta to the sample proportion) of

the decline in the probability of participating in the public market is comparable across for-

profits and non-profits. Similarly, we find no statistically significant evidence that either type of

provider alters participation in the self-pay or private market post-expansion.

       Turning to our measures of treatment quantity (Appendix Table 4), we find evidence that

quantity increases post-expansion among both types of providers. However, coefficient

estimates are only statistically significant in the non-profit sample and the relative effect sizes are

larger among non-profits than among for-profits. For example, post-expansion, the number of

admissions increases by 3.7% among for-profits and 12.0% among non-profits. In terms of

treatment setting (Appendix Table 5), we observe statistically significant evidence that passage

of state parity leads to changes in the number of patients treated in inpatient and outpatient

settings among non-profits. Comparable to the full sample, post-expansion we find that the

number of inpatients decreases by 9.1% and the number of outpatients increases by 15.7%.

6.2 Patient characteristics

       We explore whether there are changes in the composition of patients receiving treatment

post-expansion. We have limited patient information in the N-SSATS, which is specifically

designed to track SUD services (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration

2016). However, N-SSATS provides information on the shares of patients in treatment for

different types of SUDs: alcohol, illicit drug, and alcohol and illicit drugs. We regress these

shares on parity laws and results are reported in Appendix Table 6.

       We find that, post-expansion, the share of patients in treatment for illicit drugs only

increases by 3.5 percentage points (15.2%) while the share of patients in treatment for alcohol

and illicit drugs declines by 3.1 percentage points (5.8%). There is no statistically significant



                                                  20
evidence that the share of patients in treatment for alcohol use disorder only changes post-

expansion. Thus, collectively these estimates suggest that, post-expansion, the patients in

treatment may shift away from those who have both alcohol and illicit drug use disorders and

towards illicit drug disorder only. Based on clinical evidence that documents patients with poly-

SUDs have more severe disorders, patients in treatment post-expansion may have less severe

SUDs (Dutra, Stathopoulou et al. 2008, Martinotti, Carli et al. 2009). 26

6.3 Policy endogeneity

         We next estimate event studies to assess policy endogeneity (Autor 2003, Lovenheim

2009, Kline 2011). That is, given that healthcare policies (including the parity laws we study

here), are determined within states’ political economies, it is plausible that policymakers may

implement policies in response to changes in health outcomes or healthcare use (e.g., increasing

SUD prevalence). Such a phenomena would imply that, instead of parity laws leading to

changes in provider behaviors, such behaviors would lead to implementation of parity laws.

         We conduct an event study to test for the existence of policy endogeneity and to examine

dynamics in the post-period. We first center the data around the event (i.e., parity law passage)

for states that pass a parity law by 2010. Next, we construct an event window that includes the

period seven years in advance of the law passage and after the law passage; that is we apply

endnotes following Kline (2011). Observations for states that pass a parity law outside the event

window are excluded. We create bins seven years pre-law, five to six years pre-law, three to

four years pre-law, one to two years pre-law, year of the law passage, one to two years post-law,

three to four years post-law, five to six years post law, and seven years post-law. We omit the



26
   We note that this hypothesis is in line with our finding that outpatient treatment, which is arguably less intensive
than inpatient treatment, increases post-expansion. However, we interpret these findings cautiously as we lack
clinical detail on patients and hence cannot draw firm conclusions regarding disease severity.

                                                           21
period one to two year pre-law passage. States that do not pass a parity law by 2010 are coded as

zero for all bins. We report event study results graphically for each of our outcomes in Appendix

Figures 1 through 9. We include a vertical line that divides each figure into the pre- and post-

law period. 95% confidence intervals that account for within-state clustering are reported with

vertical lines for each parameter estimate.

       Overall, our event studies do not reveal evidence of policy endogeneity. Although some

coefficient estimates do rise to statistical significance in some specifications, in general – where

we observe statistically significant leads – the estimates change in sign and do not reveal a clear

pattern. Moreover, even if we do observe evidence of policy endogeneity, controlling for the

leads can allow us to recover causal estimate on the lags, the objects of primary interest.

       Interesting, the event study for participation in the self-pay market suggests that overtime

providers are more likely to participate in this market. Our event study findings support our DD

findings for use of price discounts, private and public market participation, and provision of

charity care. Turning to our measures of quantity (total admissions and the number of patients),

we document that, post-expansion, providers increase quantity of healthcare, and these effects

increase in the post-law period. Our event studies provide evidence that declines in the number

of patients treated in inpatient settings and increases in the number of patients treated in

outpatient settings (our proxies for treatment intensity) escalate with time after the expansion.

6.4 Offered services and programs

       We next investigate whether passage of a state parity law alters the services and programs

offered by SUD treatment providers. Specifically, we consider measures of offered services and

programs: the number of offered services (e.g., employment assistance), the number of special

programs for particular populations (e.g., pregnant and post-partum women), and the use of



                                                 22
medication in treatment (e.g., buprenorphine; a prescription medication indicated for opioid use

disorder). These variables may proxy for measures of treatment intensity not captured by

treatment setting and/or differences across patients in the types of treatment demanded.

Appendix Table 7A provides more information on these variables.

         In Appendix Table 7B we report selected coefficient estimates from the regressions of

our services and programs on passage of a state parity law generated in Equation (1). We find no

statistically significant evidence that passage of a parity law leads to changes in these outcomes.

6.5 Between-state heterogeneity

         In our primary specification, we control for between state differences by including a wide

range of time-varying control variables and state fixed effects. A concern with this specification

is that some of the control variables may themselves be influenced by parity laws and including

these variables in the regression model may lead to bias (Angrist and Pischke 2009). On the

other hand, these models may not offer sufficient control for between state heterogeneity. To

address this concern, we estimate first models that exclude all time-varying controls and second

include state-specific linear time trends. Finally, we augment Equation (1) with provider fixed

effects, which leverage within-provider variation in parity laws. 27

         Results are reported in Appendix Tables 8 (market participation), 9 (treatment quantity),

and 10 (treatment setting). Overall, while we lose precision in some specifications as

coefficients decline in magnitude, our findings are broadly robust to these alternative

specifications. Exceptions to this pattern are that our estimates for treatment quantity and

treatment settings are somewhat sensitive to inclusion of state-specific linear time trends and




27
   More specifically, we replace state fixed effects with provider fixed effects as provider fixed effects subsume state
fixed effects. More details available on request from the corresponding author.

                                                          23
provider fixed effects. However, 95% confidence intervals for these estimates overlap with our

baseline estimates and hence we cannot rule out the possibility that results are stable. 28

6.6 Providers whose primary focus is SUD treatment provision

         All providers in our sample offer a specialized program in SUD treatment. However,

SUD treatment is not the primary focus of all providers in our sample, roughly 14% of providers

have a non-SUD treatment primary focus (e.g., mental healthcare services). We next retain only

those providers that list SUD treatment as their primary focus and re-estimate Equation (1).

Results are reported in Appendix Tables 11 to 13 and are in line with our main findings. Listing

SUD treatment as a primary focus is not affected by parity law passage. 29

6.7 Changes in the number of providers

         A concern with our analysis thus far is that parity laws may induce some providers to

enter (or perhaps exit) the market, which would lead to compositional-on-positive bias (Angrist

and Pischke 2009). We explore this possibility by regressing the number of total, for-profit, and

non-profit providers in our sample on state parity laws using Equation (1). We find no

statistically significant evidence that state parity laws alter the number of providers in our sample

(Appendix Table 14). However, the coefficient estimates carry a negative sign and suggest that

parity laws, if anything, may lead, unexpectedly, some providers to exit the market.

7. Discussion

         In this study we apply insight from standard health economic models (Sloan, Mitchell et

al. 1978, McGuire 2000) to the context of substance use disorder (SUD) treatment providers.




28
   For example, the 95% confidence interval in the total admissions regression that includes state-specific linear time
trends is [-24.853, 17.901] and the 95% confidence intervals surrounding our baseline total admissions DD estimate
is [-0.989, 57.856]. Hence, there is non-trivial overlap across these intervals.
29
   We regressed the probability of listing SUD treatment as a primary focus on parity laws using Equation (1) and
found no relationship that rose to statistical significance. See Supplementary Table 15.

                                                          24
Specifically, we test whether private health insurance expansions for SUD treatment services

impact the insurance markets in which providers are willing to participate, price discounts,

provision of charity care, the quantity of healthcare provided, and setting in which treatment is

received. Our findings suggest that private health expansions lead providers to reduce their use

of price discounts and participation in public insurance markets; in particular Medicaid and other

state-financed insurance programs. Moreover, post-law, providers increase the quantity of

healthcare provided in terms of annual admissions and number of patients in treatment, and care

becomes less intensive as measured by treatment setting.

       Our findings for participation in the self-pay and public market are in line with

predictions from our conceptual model. However, findings for private market participation and

treatment intensity depart from our predictions. While our data will not allow us to explore these

disconnects between the model and the empirical findings, we can offer some hypotheses. In

terms of private market participation, we are only able to examine the extensive market

(participate/not participate) and thus we miss the relevant margin to private market participation

effects: the number of patients/patient mix (i.e., the intensive margin). While we expected

treatment intensity to increase, it is possible that well-established capacity constraints within the

SUD treatment delivery system (Carr, Xu et al. 2008, Buck 2011) prevent such a response.

       Because our analysis is intent-to-treat, we must consider whether the size of our

estimated effects is reasonable. One possible way to examine the plausibility of our estimated

treatment effect magnitudes is to consider the extent to which private insurance is used to pay for

SUD treatment services by patients themselves. As noted earlier in the manuscript, historically

private (and public) insurance has played a relatively smaller role in the financing of SUD

treatment relative to general healthcare services in the U.S. However, this differential does not



                                                 25
imply that private insurance is not an important source of financing within the SUD treatment

delivery system. Indeed, data from the 2010 – the last year of our study period – National

Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) suggests that 40% of patients receiving specialty SUD

treatment in the past year used private health insurance as a source of payment for their last

treatment episode (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2010). 30

         Another approach to thinking about our estimated effect size is to consider the share of

the population that is affected by state parity laws. According to Jensen and Morrisey (1999),

this share ranges from 33% to 43% of the population. More recent evidence from the Medical

Expenditure Panel Survey suggests that during our study period 49% to 57% of private-sector

workers insurance beneficiaries worked for a self-insured firm, suggesting that 51% to 43% of

such employees were potentially impacted by the policies we study here. 31 Finally, in our

sample, 42% of employees worked for a small firm – 100 or less workers – (see Table 2).

         We can also examine estimated effect sizes within the related literature. A clinical study

by Wen, Cummings et al. (2013) document that passage of a state parity law leads to a 9%

increase in SUD treatment admissions, with even larger increases when only those facilities that

accept private insurance are considered. Our comparable estimate suggests that passage of a

parity law leads to a 9.2% increase in admissions, which is very similar to the estimate of Wen

and colleagues. While not definitive, we believe that collectively these statistics suggest that the

magnitude of the treatment effect estimates we generate are indeed reasonable.

   This estimate potentially understates the true role of private insurance in the financing of SUD treatments as it
does not include those individuals who received multiple SUD treatments but did not use private insurance as a
source of payment in the last treatment episode.

       Our study has limitations. First, we lack information on the extent to which a provider

participates in a particular health insurance market; instead we know whether or not a provider

participates. While we lack data on this important margin of treatment provision, we can turn to

a previous study by Dave and Mukerjee (2011) which explores, among other outcomes, the

effect of state parity laws for SUD treatment on the probability that patients will use private

insurance to pay for treatment services. The authors document that, following passage of a state

parity law, the probability that a patient uses private insurance to pay for treatment increases.

This finding suggests that the share of patients in treatment may shift toward the privately

insured following passage of a state parity law. Second, our analysis relies on variation from 12

parity law changes. While we have argued that these changer states are comparable to non-

changer states in terms of many observable characteristics (see Table 2), the generalizability of

our findings is not clear. Third, our findings represent a combination of supply and demand side

factors. Our reduced form methods will not allow us to isolate the relative contribution of these

factors. Fourth, we lack a standard measure of treatment intensity, e.g., length of stay (Kolstad

and Kowalski 2012). Fifth, we focus on specialty SUD treatment and the generalizability of our

findings to other settings is unclear.

       In summary, we offer new evidence on how SUD providers respond to private health

insurance markets expansions. These findings may have implications for understanding how

expansions that impact specific segments of the healthcare market, either at the state or federal

level, impact provider behaviors and, in turn, the type of patients who are able to access care, and

the amount and intensity of care provided. If regulations allow for inequalities across insurance

markets in terms of coverage generosity, reimbursement rates, etc. then these regulations may

lead to differences in access to care and, in turn, outcomes for patients. These findings may be

useful to policymakers who are currently considering re-shaping the future directions of the U.S.

healthcare delivery system.
