                POST-WAR ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE
            GROUP-OF-FIVE COUNTRIES: A NEW ANALYSIS
                            ABSTRACT

     An inter—country aggregate production function is estimated
using annual data for the post—war period drawn from the Group—
of—Five (G—5) countries: France, West Germany, Japan, United
Kingdom and United States. It is assumed that all countries have
the same underlying production function, not in terms of the
measured outputs and inputs, but in terms of efficiency—
equivalent units of outputs and inputs. The measured quantities
of outputs and inputs of each country may be converted into
efficiency-equivalent quantities of outputs and inputs by the
multiplication of country and commodity-specific and time—varying
augmentation factors. These augmentation factors are estimated
simultaneously with the parameters of the aggregate production
function.
     Within this framework, the traditional assumptions for the
measurement of productivity-—constant returns to scale,
neutrality of technical progress and profit maximization——are
tested and all are rejected. Additional hypotheses about the
nature of technical progress are also tested. It is found that
technical progress may be represented as purely capital—
augmenting. In particular, the rate of augmentation is estimated
at between 14 and 16 percent per annum for France, West Germany
and Japan, and between 8 and 10 percent per annum for the U.K.
and the U.S. for the period under study. It is also found that
technical progress is capital-saving rather than labor—saving and
is therefore unlikely to be a cause of structural unemployment.
     Using the estimated production function parameters, a
growth-accounting exercise is carried out and the results are
compared with those obtained from the conventional approach.
Technical progress is found to be the most important source of
growth, accounting for more than 50 percent, followed by the
growth of capital input. Together they account for more than 75
percent of the growth of real output in the Group—of—Five (G—5)
countries in the period under study. An international and
intertemporal comparison of the productive efficiencies is also
undertaken. It is found that the United States had the highest
level of overall productive efficiency for the whole period under
study. However, the productive efficiencies of France, West
Germany and Japan rose rapidly from less than 40 percent of the
U.S. level in 1949 to two—thirds of the U.S. level in 1985.
There is thus some evidence of convergence.

1.     Introduction

       The objective of this study is to apply a new spprosch to the analysis

of post-war economic growth in the Group-of-Five (C-f)                 countries.    The

framework used provides meaningful comparisons of the levels              g   the rates

of growth of productivities across countries.                  This new approach also

enables us to identify separately not only the degree of returns to scale

and the rate of technical progress in each country but also their biases,             if

any.     The results of our empirical analysis        are used as the basis for a new

assessment of the         relative contriburicns of capital,        labor and technical

progress co econcmic growth that does not depend on the conventional strong

assumptions of growth accounting--constant returns to scale,              neutrality of

technical progress and prcfit maximization with competitive output and

faccor uarketa.

       The new approach is board on the Lau-Yotcpoulos (1989) modification of

the concept of the meta-production function,          introduced by Haysmi and Ruttan

(1970,    1985),      throogh the   uae of time-varying, country- and commodity-

specific augmentation factors.            An empirical aggregate meta-production

function ia estimated from pooled inter-country time-series data.             The basic

asaumptiona for         this factor-augmentation approach to the meta-production

function are:

        (1)    All countries have the same underlying production function            F()
but may operate on different parts of it.         The production function,     however,

applies       to   "efficiency-equivalent quantitiea of outputs        and inputs,   that

ta:




(1.1)                      F(Xia       'rn)   '   i   =   I ,.,,n
where               and
                           X'a           are tha "effioiency-equivaient quantities of
                                                                                      output
 and inputs respectively of the ith
                                    country at time                             t,   a    is the number        of
 inputs,      and    n         is the number of countries.                 The assumption of a meta-

production function implies that                        F(')       does not depend on            i    (but may

depend on       t)

        (2)     The "efficiency-equivalent quantities of
                                                         output and inputs                                     of
each country are not directly observable.
                                          They are, however, linked to the
measured quantities of outputs,         and
                                 Y1's,      inputs, X.'s, through tima-

varyihg, country- and commodity-specific augmentation factors                                              i
                                                              A(t)'s,

We note that in terms of the measured quantities of                                        the production
                                                    outputs,

function may be rewritten as:



(1.4)                Y.        —
                                   A0(ri'F(x1               X*t),     i   — 1        n,



so that the         reciprocal of the output-augmentation factor                          A10(t)      has the

interpretation of                  the   possibly       time-varying level           of    the       technical

efficiency of production, also referred ro as output efficiency, in the ith

country at time           t.

     There are many reasons why these commodity augmentation factors are not

likely to be identical across countries. Differences in climate,
                                                                 topography
and infrastructure; differences in definitions and measurements; differences

in quality:     differences in the composition of outputs;                     and differences in

the technical efficiencies of production ate some examples.                             The commodity

augmentation factors ate introduced precisely to capture these differences

across countries.            In this study,      the   commodity augmentation factors are

assumed to have the exponential form with respect to time.                         Thus:




                         —

where the     A5's, A,'s, c5's, and               c's       are constants. We shall refec to

che A55 'a and          'a as augmentation level            parameters and
                   A5                                                              c55 'a and       c,5 '5

as augmentstion rate parameters. For at least one                     country,     say the ith, the
constants     A5      and                 can be set identically at unity (or some other
                              A5's
arbitrary constants),             reflecting     the   fact     that    "efficiency"-equivalent

ourpucs and      inputs can           be    measured only       relative to            some     standard.


Econometrically this means that the constants                        A5 'a   and           's cannot    be
                                                                                   A55

uniquely identified without some normalization. Without loss of generality

we   take the           and
                A50             A53's for the United States to be identically unity.
The most important observation, howevet,                   is that the augmentation level and

rate    parameters       ate        all    potentially estimable             subject       to    such    a

normalization--there is thus no need to rely on arbitrary assumptions or

extraneous information,              These country and commodity-specific augmentation

level and rate parameters provide the basis for en international as well as

intertempotal comparison of productive efficiencies. However, they may not
be identifiable for an individual country if there ia an insufficient
                                                                      number
of observations. For           example,        with one output and two inputs, the number of

augmentation level            and       rate parameters ia               increased by   six   for each
additional country,           hence a minimum of seven observations per
                                                                        country is
required.

        (3)    The wide ranges of variation of the inputs
                                                          resulting from the use
of inter-country data necessitate the use of a flexible
                                                        funttional form for
F(.) above.       In addition,          a flexible          functional form is needed to allow the

possibility of non-neutral returns                       of scale       and technital progress.1     In
this     study,    the    aggregata production function is specified to be the

Christensen, Jorgenson and Lau (1973)                       .   For a production function with two
inputs,       capital (K) and labor              (L),       the translog production function, in

terms of "efficiency-equivalent output and
                                           inputs, takes the form:

        Our new approach is applied to pooled
                                              inter-country rime-series date.

respect to the inputs.   Moreover, the commodity augmentation factors cannot
be separately identified and thus the               will be

scale with       time in the data of a single country, csn be more resdily

identified.       (At any given point in time,              production at different scales is

observed,       The same scale of production may be observed at different points

in time.)       In addition, such pooling allows               the identification of not only

the rates hut also the biases of technical progress as well as the biases of

the scale economies, if any.               Moreover, inter-country deta typically have

greater variability in the              quantities 9f inputs than intra-country data,

thus     facilitating      the   identification and            estimation of    the   aggregate

production function,             Fot   example,       in data from a single country,        the

quantities of capital and labor are likely to move quite closely together,

the consequence     of a fairly constant capital-labor ratio, whIch may in turn
be due to fairiy stable relative ptices.                   This multicollinearity may make it

impossible to       identify and         esti..,ate       the effects of capital and      labor

sepatately without iaposing some assumption such as constant returns to
scale.     With inter-country data,           there is likely to be greater variability

in the capital-labor ratio across               countries, thus mitigating the possible

effects of aulticoilinearity.

       From a practical point of view,             the prisary advantage of our approach,

which is based on the            econometric estiaation of an aggregate production

function, is that it does not depend on the assuaptions of constant returns

to     scale,    neutral     technical       progress        and   profit   maximization with

cosporitive output and input markets,                 assucprions which underlie most growth

accounting exercises. Instead,             these assu,sption are directly tested.

       In section    2,    we present our rodel of a transcendental logarithmic

prodacrion function with               rice-varying, country-         and   commodity-specific

augaenration factors.            Io aectioca          3   and 4. we discuss the       stochastic
specification and the data respectively.                    Readers not interested in the

technital details can akip to aection 5, in which we tepott the results of

our teata of hypotheaea.          The model eatimatea are preaented in section 6.

In section     7,    we carty out a growth accounting exercise based on our

eatimatea and        compare    our   results with          those   using   the   conventional

approach.     In section g, we undertake an international and
                                                              intertemporal
comparison of the productivities of the Group-of-Five countries based on our

estimates.    Finally,      some concluding remarks are made in section 9.



2.   The Model

     We     employ    the    transcendental logarithmic production                function   in

equation (17).         We do not assume constant returns              to scale2    or neutral

technical     progress.3        We    also   do       not   assume    instantaneous    profit
maximization with respect to capital or labor.                Equation (1.7) is written in
terms of the "efficiency"- equivalent quantities of
                                                    output and inputs.                       By

substituting equations (1.5) and (1.6)            into      equation (1.7),   we obtain the

translog production function in terms of measured quantities of output and

inputs:




      2host measurements of technical progress (or total factor productivity)
assume constant returns to scale.     However,   it is an arbitrary assumption
and the resulting estimate of technical
                                          progress is sensitive to the assumed
returns to scale.    In generel, the higher the degree of returns to scale
assumed, the lower the estimate of technical progress. Denison (1967) does
not assume constant returns to scale. Me assumes that the returns to scale
are 1.1.

      3Most measurements of technical progress (or total factor
                                                                productivity)
assume neutrality implicitly.     Otherwise,  such measurements of technical
progress cannot be simply cumulated over time. Under non-neutral technical
progress,  the magnitude of technical progress depends on the
                                                                quantities of
the inputs.

B,.         All the other parameters, given tha hypothesis of a single meta-

production function,           are unrestricted.              This provides a basis far testing

the hypothesis of commodity augmentation.                      The number of restrictions is          n

where    n   is the    number      of countries.
        Equation   (2.3)       or equivalently equation (2.6)                is    the most     general

specification possible under our maintained assumptions.                           We    shall refer to
this    model as our "Base Model."                it specializes to more restrictive forms
under different hypotheses on (1) the returns to scale;                          the neture of
                                                                           (2)

technicel progress; snd (3) the structure of
                                             technology.
        Constant returns to scale of the production function
                                                             implies that:



             F(AK,AL,c)          AF(K,L,t),   V X > 0, V K, 0, t

A necessary condition for constant returns                to scale is homogeneity, which

implies,    for rhe translog production function:



(2.7)        B55   +   B51 — 0

and                +        — 0.
             B51       B1

The number of restrictions implied by
                                      homogenaity, given che hypotheses of a

sinEle    mete-production function            and commodity augmentation, is        2.   Under

homogeneity, the matrix             B   is    singular   end   not ell     of the    cosssodiry
augmentation factors can be uniquely identified. In particular, at most two

out of the three commodity mugeentetion
                                        factors--output, capital end labor--
can be uniquely          identified for        each country.4               without loss
                                                                   Thus,                    of
generality, we may take under homogeneity:



(2.B)              = 1, V   i
             A40

                   —0,   Vi


Under homogeneity, equation (2.1) simplifies into

or,   the production function must be                   a    generalized Cobb-Douglas production

function,    with the restrictions given in equation (2.2D).                                 The number of

augmentation, is 2.          We shell refer ro the restrictions in equetion (2.24)

as the neutrality      of   technical          progress restrictions and the restrictions in

equation      (2.20)        as        generalized        cobb-Douglas         production        function

restrictions, to be reared as an hypothesis on the structure of technology.

      In addition to the aggregate production function,                       we also consider the

behavior of the share of labor coats in the value of output:

where    w,   is the nominal wage tate and                        is the price of output in the

ith   country at time            t.    Uoder competitive output and input markets, the

assumption of profit maximization with                         respect to      labor,   which     is   s

necessary condition          for overall profit maximization, implies                       thst the

elasticity of output with respect to labor is equal to the share of labor

cost in the value of output:



                                           a   In
(2.26)                                 —

In  other words, the parameters in equation (2.26) are identical to the
corresponding ones in equation (2.6). If we do not maintain the hypothesis
of profit maximization with respect to labor, the parameters in equation
(2.2g)   do notnecessarily have to be the same as those in the aggregate
pcoduction function. Equation (2.26) may be written in the form:




                                                         17

(2.27)                      —   a + a11       En K.1    +    En      +



Profit maximization with respect to labor then implies:



(2.28)           a a;  —           V i

                            g11          11• — 811; Vi
                        —
                            B.1; Vi

This provides a basis for testing the hypothesis of profit maximization with

respect to labor.      The number of restrictions implied by profit maximization

with respect to labor is 4n.

     Constant returns to scale,- neutrality of technical progress and profit

maximization are the three principal maintained hypotheses in the empirical

measurement of        total       factor   productivity (or       equivalently    technical

progress).    We test these three hypotheses in psrallel,                conditional on the

hypotheses of a       single      meta-production function (identical second-order

production function         psrameters) and        a    commodity auzmentation form     of

technical progress.

     Next,   we proceed to          examine   hypotheses on the     nature of technical

progress.    First,   with respect to the augmentation level parameters, we test

whether they ate the same across              tha different countries separately for

capital and labor,         Given our normalization of                 and         — 1, the

hypotheses of identical augmentaciun level parameters are thus represented

by respectively:




                                                   lg
2.29)                  In    — 0, V    i        and



(230)                  In ALL — 0, V   i




The number nf restrictions is equal to                     (n-l)     for each of the hypotheses.

If either or both hypotheses ate rejected,                    we proceed to test whether the

augmentation level parameters are identical scross the European countries--

France, West Germany and          U.K. -   -within    our sample separately for capital and

labor.       The hypothesis          of equal      augmentation level             parameters across
countries must be interpreted carefully because differences in definitions

and measurements, in addition to differences in the underlying qualities,

will     also show up        as   differences in the               estimated augmentation level

natameters

       Second,    with respect to the augmentation rate parameters, we begin by

testing     the hypothesis of whether technical progress can be adequately

represented by two rather than three augmentation rates.                          (Note that if the

hypothesis of homogeneity is                  accepted,      it     automatically implies       that

technical progress ten be represented by two rates.)                        We test the two-rate

hypothesis by testing separately the hypotheses that the augmentation rates

for output,       capital,   and labor are respectively equal to zero,                     If gjj of

the    three separate        component hypotheses are                 rejected,     then   technical

progress cannot be represented by only two rates.                      If any one of them is not

rejected,        the    hypothesis     that     technical progress           can     be    adequately

represented by two rates is not rejected.

       If the two-rate hypothesis is not rejected,                   we proceed to test whether

technical    progress can be adequately represented by a single augmentation


                                                      19
 rate.     We test the one-rate hypotheaia by testing
                                                      separately the hypotheses
 that pairs of the augmentation rates of output, oapital,                      and labor are equal
 to zero.     There are three suth possible pairs of zero rates.                     If   jj   of the

 three separate component hypotheses are rejected,                         then technical progress

 cannot be represented by only a single                     rate.      If any of them is not

 rejected,    then technical progress can be
                                             adequately represented by a single
rate.

         The two-rate hypothesis takes the form:



(2.31)        Either    c.5
                              — 0; V        i
              Ot        c.        0;    V   i


              or
                        C•t0;V1

In   other words,      at least one of the three                    sets    of augmentation rate

parameters are equal to zero.               The one-rate hypothesis takes the form:



(2.32)       Either     t.0
                              —   o.    = 0; V i

             or         i0         kL        0;   Vi
             or         o=c=O;                    Vi


We note that the restrictions implied by the last alternative are identical

with those implied by neutrality of technical
                                              progress.

     Depending on the outcome of the tests of the two-rate and one-rate

hypotheses, we proceed to test whethar the augmentation rate parameters are

identical aoross all countries              or across European countries. The hypothesis

of equal augmentation rate parameters across                    countries must likewise be


                                                       20
interpreted carefully becauae they may reflect changes in the definitions,

measurements (e.g. depreciaticn ratea), utiliration retea, and improvementa

in the quality of complementary inputa over time, in addition to changes in

the underlying quality of the inputs.                         Moreover,      one cannot in general

associate an improvement in the quality of an input with an increase in its

augmentatiom factor.          For example,        an increase         in the number of individuals

who can type may ahow up aa an augmentation of capital (an increaae in the

effective number of typewriters) rather than labor.                             Better roads may also

show up as an augmentation of capital (an increase                           in the effective number

of vehicles)

      Finally, one may be             interested in hypotheses on the structure of

technology.            We proceed to test             first    the    hypothesis that         the mete-

production function is of the Cobb-Douglas form, which implies                                           —
                                                                                             35k   B11

      —   C, a total    of 3 restrictions.            Under the Cobb-Douglas hypothesis, only

a single augmentation factor can be                   identified.         (However,    the Cobb-Douglas

hypothesis is cettain to be rejected if the hypothesis of homogeneity is

rejected.) We test next the hypothesis that the production function is of

the       generalimed      Cobb-Douglas          form,        which       implies      the   independent

restrictions in equation (2.2D)              ,    a    total of       2   restrictions.       Under the

generalimed Cobb-Douglas hypothesis, only two augmentation factors can be

identified. The Cobb-Douglas and the genetaliced Cobb-Douglas hypotheses do

not imply each other and are tested in parallel.



3.     The Stochastic Soecification

       We introduce stochastic distutbance terms                       E1LI'5    and    e21'a into the

       Labor is messured as the number of person-hours worked.            The labor

supply of the economy is measured by the civilian lsbor force.         The data are

taken from Labor Force Statistics (1968, 1986) published by the DECD except

for the period of 1948-1955        for   the    United States,   data for which are

estimated by splicing the published data on civilian labor force from the

U.S.   Department of Commerce,   Historical Statistics of the United Stetes,

Colonial Times to 1970 to those of Labor Force Statistics.
                                                                       Unemployment
rates are obtained from the same sources.            Employment is estimstsd as the
labor force times one minus the unemployment rate.         It is then multiplied to

the average number of hours worked per year cc obtain labor hours.

       The share of labor in the value of output is estimated
                                                              by dividing the
current labor income (compensation of employees paid
                                                     by resident producers)

by the current CDP of each country,       data for which are obtained from DECO,

National Accounts, except icr the period 1948-1955          for the United Scares.
Current labor income data icr the United States for this period are obtained

from National Income and      Product     Acccunrs of the United States,      U.S.

Department of Commerce and COP in curtent prices are obtained from        5jyp
Current Business, 1980.      The compensation ci employees paid by resident

producers includes "all payments    by resident producers of wages and salaries
to   their employees, in kind and in cash,          and of contributions, paid or

imputed,   in respect of their employees to sccial         security schemes and to

private pension, family allowance, casualty insurance,           life insurance and

similar schemes."


       (3) Capital (K)

       Capital is measured as utilired capital.        4ip.f fixed capital stock at
the beginning of the year is used as a measure of                          Thedata

80 and 1960-85 except for U,S,                   (1948-55)     and Japan (1957-63); the former is

 aken from BEA, Survey of Current Business,                      1986,    while the latter is based

on Table 1-2 from Oenison and Chung (1976).                               For Japan and the United

States,    the gross         fixed capital stock data                    include only private non-

residential capital.           For France,          the   data include private non-residential

and public capital.6               For West Cermany and the United Kingdom,                     the data

include    private non-residential, private residential and public capital.

These data are converted into U.S. dollars using 1980 exchange rates.                                   The

data   on capacity utilicarion are also                         taken from OECD,          Main Economic

Indicators:     Historical Statistics (1960-79,                      1964-1983) and Main Economic

backward extrapolation.                   Capacity utiiication rates              for the       U.S.    are

)htatned    froa      the    Rcoromic       Report ot          the   Fresident, 1989.            Capacity
utilication totes for tie UK, are constructed by the peak- to-peak aethod.

The estic,oted utilicotion rates for U.K. (average of 96.81 percent)                             are much

;iigher than    those        for    the    other countries (averoge              of 81.13       percent),

hecouse    of   the     different methodologies used.                       In    order    to    maintain

comparability of the data,                 the    estimated utilication rates for U.K. are

moltiplied by the ratio 81.13/98.81.                      Utiliced capitol is estiaated as the

capital stock at the beginning of the year times the capacity utilization

rate




     °The original data for 1157-1965 include only private non-residential
capital but have been adjusted so that they ace cospacable to data including
both private non-residential capital and public capital.

        The instrumental variables used in the estimation include:                         real output

lagged one and two periods;                   lagged capital stock;           lagged labor force;

5,     Empirical Results--Tact of Nvoorhasas

       The results of the nonlinear instrumanral variables estimation indicate

that    rica   non-firsr-differanced modal has a Durbin-Warson statistic that is

                                                       26
close to unity for the labor share equation (1.03), suggesting serious mis-

specification.      The first-differenced model,       however, has Durbin-Watson

statistics that are much more reasonable--1.94 for the aggregate production

function and 1.83 for the labor share equation.              Thus we present only the

results from the first-differenced model,

      We first undertake a     series   of tests of hypotheses.         We use as our

criterion function the weighted sum of squares of residuals of the system of

equations projected in the       space spanned by the         instrumental variables.

Asymptotically, the difference between the weighted sum of squares with and

without the restrictions icplied by the null hypothesis is distributed as

the   x°   distribution   with the appropriate degrees of freedom under the null

hypothesis. These are the test-statisticsused in this study.                 We choose as

the   overall level of significance for      our   study       a —   0.10.     We assign

different levels of significance to the different (groups of) hypotheses of

interest so that their sum is 0.10, which assures that the overall level of

significance of our study is at least 0.10.            The test statistics for the

different null hypotheses are presented in Tables 5.1 through 5.3.



The Maintained Hypotheses of the Study

      We first   test the basic caintained hypothesis of our study,           namely that

the   aggregate production functions of sil five countries are identical in

terms of 'efficiency-equivalent inputs,          hac   is,   there is a single mets-

production function.       We assign a level of significance of 0.01 to this

hjpothesis.    The test-statiscin, x'     divided by    the degrees of freedom,       has

a value of 0.78,     with 12 degrees cf freedom.         This hypothesis cannot be

rejected at any level of significance.


                                            27
     We next test the hypothesis thst techniosl progtess oan he reptesented

in the commodity-augmentation form with eeoh augmentation factor being                en

exponentiel funotion of time oonditionsl on the single mets-production

function hypothesis.         We assign a level of significance of 0.01 to this

hypothesis.        The test-statistic has a value of 0.31 with          5    degrees of
freedom.      This hypothesis cannot be rejected at any level of signifioance.

     The non-rejection of these two hypotheses lends            empirical support to
the validity of the mete-production function with commodity augmentation

factors     approach adopted in this study.



Conventional Maintained Hypotheses

     We then proceed to        test   the hypotheses maintained under conventional

approaches to the measurement of total factor productivity and technical

progress,     conditional on the validity of our maintained hypotheses of s

single mets-production function and commodity augmentation.                 We assign a

level of significance of 0.02 to this series of tests, allocating it equally

among the tests of homogeneity of the production function,'          constant returns

to scale     of   the production function,   neutrality of technical progress, and

profit maximization with respect to lsbor.5            We find that all of these

hypotheses        can   be separately rejected at      their    assigned     levels   of




      'Hots that the restrictions implied by homogeneity are a subset of the
restrictions implied by constant returns to scale.                 tf homogeneity is
cej acted, constant returns to scale will be rejected at the same level of significance.

     51n the first differenced form, the parameters a's of the labor
share equation are not estimated.        Thus,   the  hypothesis of profit
maximization implies restrictions on only 3n, or 15 parameters.

agnificance, o.ots. This            series of tests suggest that the conventional

approach to the measurement of total fsctor productivity and technical

progress may he based on false premises,          at least for the countries and time

periods under study.

        The results of these tasta are presented in Table 5.1,                  In Table    5.4,

tha    critical values of the tast-ataristica for alternative values of the

laval     of   significance ara presented.             Tha reader may wish           to select

alternativa levels of aignificance for particular hypotheses.

        Having eatabliahed the validity of our current approach,                we proceed to

explora the natura of technical progreas.              Pa   teat   whether:   (1) augmentation

leve. parameters are idenroal across aolneries; (2) technical progress can

be    represented by     two aeta of   aagc.entation   ratea;      and finally (3)   technical
progreas can be repreaanted by a         lngle set      of augmentation rates for output

or an input.          The purpose of these tests is to establish the levels,               rates

and biases of technical progress as well as to obtain a parsimonious

specification.         Under the commodity-augmentation hypothesis the number of

independent parameters required to reprasenr                 technical    progress is g per

country.       The question is whether a smaller number will suffice.                It should

be    noted    that    under   the hypothesis or homogeneity of               the production

function,      technical progress ran       always be    represented by two sets of
augmentationrate parameters. However,                the nvporhesia of homogeneity is
ulte decisively rejected in this study as evidenced in Table 5.1,
     The hypothesis of profit maximirorion with respect to labor can be
tested separately for each country. The test-statistics are 2.23, l,g7,
i3.15, 1.97 and 1.40 for France, West Germany, Japan, U.K. and U.S.
respectively, However, this does not imply that the hypothesis can be
accepted for all countries except Japan because the    's turn out to be
very different from the o '5. See the discussion in Section g and Table
8,2,

on the nature of teohnioal progress.            For the equality of augmentation level

parameters aoross oouncries, we alloosce 0.005 each for oapitsl and labor

respeotively.          We find that we cannot reject the hypothesis of identical

capital augmentation level parameters across countries at any level of

significance.          We also cannot reject the hypothesis of identical labor

augmentation level parameters across countries at the assigned level of

significance. This implies that in the base year <1970), the "efficiencies"

of capital and labor were not significantly different across countries. In

fact, because the definitions          of   the capital stocks ste the least inclusive

for Japan and the United States         and the most inclusive for West Germany and

U.K.   ,    it   implies that the efficiencies of capital are highest in Japan snd

the United States,        followed by France and then West Germany and U.K. in the

base yesr.

           Next,   we test the null hypothesis that technical progress can be

represented by two <instead of three) sets of augmentation rates, that is,

at least one set of augmentation rate parameters are zero.                       For this

hypothesis, we examine the three separate component hypotheses, namely,              that

the set of output,          capital,   and   labor augmentation rate parameters are

respectively zaroes.          The null hypothesis is true if and only if at least

one of the three component hypotheses is true,              Let the desired level of

significance of the two-rate hypothesis be set at              a.   The probability of

falsely rejecting this hypothesis when it is true is thus             a.   The decision

rule       that is adopted is that Ii all ni the three component hypotheses are

separately rejected at the same level of significance, say                 0*,   then the

null hypothesis as a whole is rejected at a level             of significance of       a.


                                                 30
The question is, at what level should               o    be set?    It turns out that          o*

should be set equal to             a.

       The reasoning is as follows.            The null hypothesis is that at least one

of    the   three sets of augmentation rate paraaeters are equal to zero.                      If

rnly    one     set of paraaetets are sotually           zero,   then the    probability of

falsely rejeoting the null hypothesis is exaotly equal to                   ak.   If two sets

are artually zero,           then the      ptobahility of falsely rejeoting the            null

hypothesis, under the adopted deoision rule,              is lees than or equal to         0*0,

If all three sets         artually zero, then •the probability of falsely
                             are
rejeoting the null hypothesis is less than or equal to 0*0. In any event,
the level of signifioanoe is less than or equal to a*. By setting a* a,                    —



the    level of signifioanoe of the null hypothesis is guaranteed to be at

least       a    Thus,   eaoh one of the oomporent       hypotheses is allorated a level

rf    signifioanoe       equal 'o 0.01.       At this level of signifioanoe,        the    null

hypothesis of °wo rotos ronnot be            rejerted.

       As the two-rae h'zpothcsis is not rejeoted, we proread to test the null

hypothesis that terhnirol progress ran be represented by a single (instead

of two)     set of augmentation rate parameters.           For this hypothesis,     we    again
examine the      three separate         romponent hypotheses, namely,   that the sets of
output and  rapital, output and labor, and rapira. and labor augmentation
rate parameters are resperrively zeroes. Terhnizal progress in these "one-
rare" models may be identified as Harrod-neutral, Solow-neutral, and Hirks-
neutral terhnioal progress resperrively. As in the two-rate rase, earh
rssp nenr hypothesis is allorarrd a level of signifiranre equal to 0.01. At
this level of signifioanre, Wa rajert the hypotheses of zero output and


                                                   II
capital rates and zero capital and labor rates,10            but we cannot reject the

hypothesis of zero output and          labor   rates.     We conclude that    technical

progress     can be repreaented by a aingle act of
                                                   augmentation rates for
capital,     that is, technical progress is capital-augmenting.

      Hawing determined       that   technical progress can       be   represented as

capital-augmenting,we proceed to rear whether the capital augmentation rate

parameters are identical across countries.            (We do not need to test whether

the   output and labor      augmenrarion rates are        identical across countries
because the hypothesis of zero output and labor
                                                augmentation rates cannot be
rejected.)     The hypothesis of identical capital augmentation rate
                                                                     parameters

the hypothesis    ef   zero output and labor augmentation rate

rejected at the assigned level ef significance.            The results of this series
of tests are presented in Table 5.2.



European Communality

      Another series of hypotheses of interest            have to do with whether a

certain group of countries,
                            specifically European countries, have identical

augmentation level and rate parameters.             We assign a level of significance

of 0.01 to this series      of tests, to be allocafad equally between identical

augmentation levels and identical         augmentation rates,     which are further

allocated proportionately among the coaponent hypotheses within each
                                                                     group.

parameters for labor is not tested, given that rhe hypothesis of zero output

end labor augmentation rated is nor rejected.



The Structure of Technology

       Finally, we explore the structure            of   the       technology as represented by
the mete-production function.               The hypotheses of interest sre whether the

production function is Cobb-Douglas, that is,

end whether the production function is generalized Cobb-Douglas, that is:

We    ussign a level of significance of            COl    to this        series of rests,   to be

allocated equally betweeo             toe   Cobb-Douglas and generalized Cobb-Douglas

hypotheses.        Both hypotheses, conditional on the maintained hypotheses of

the   study,   are rejected.         The results    of tests of European communality end

the arrucrure of technology are pceseotcd in Table                    iS.

first column of Table fl.             The estimsted cepital sugmentstion retes are

statistically significent end positive for all countries.             West Germany has
the highest rare--15.7 percent
                               per annum and the United States has the
lowest rsce--6.2 percent per annum.           As mentioned previously, the eslimares

of augmentation level and rare paramerera should be
                                                    interpreted carefully.
For example,      an increase in computer literacy may be reflected as en

eugmenracion of capital (en incremse         in rhe effective number of computers).

      We   furrhet note        that the   estimated capital augmentation mates for

France,    West   Gemaany and Japan ere very similar.              This similarity is
consistent with       the   hypothesis of ccnvemgence of technology among these
industrializedcountries. We teat and cannot reject the
                                                       hypothesis that the
capital augmentation rates of the three countries ere identical (the value

of    x2   divided by the degtees         of freedom is 2.94).     We thus impose the
restrictions implied by the hypothesis of convergence for these countries on

the   estimation end report the results         in the    second column of Table 6.1.

(Recall,   however,     them    the hypotheses of identical       capital augmentation
rates for all or European countries have been                         The estimates in

the two columns do not differ appreciably.



Functions of Parameters of Intemest

      in Table 6.2 we compute some parameters of the
                                                     aggregate production
function of interest for the diifetent countries in 1970.             We note that our

                                               34
estimates       of capital elasticities are lower than those estimated from the

more conventional factor share method under the                  assumptions of constant
returns     to scale and profit maximization with competitive markets.                 Our

estImates       of the labor elasticities are comparable to the actual shares of

labor    costs   in total output for France      West Germany,    and Japan and somewhat

lower    for the United Kingdom and the United States.               This finding suggests

that labor may possIbly be paid more than its marginal product in both the

1K. and the U.S.          But capital is probably also paid more than its marginal

pruduct    in    all five countries    because there are decreasing returr,s to scale
and   caoital Is the residual claimant to output.
        Wa have previously rejected the hypotheses of homogeneity and constant

returns    to scale in production. This implies that the degree of returns to

scale    not only Is not unity but also depends on the quantities of capital

and labor.       At the   1970 values of the independent variables of each country,

statstically significant decreasing returns to scale are exhibited for all

ocunrries.Lo        the   estimated degrees of returns     to scale range between 0.7

and .1.75        This finding may possibly be attribued           to omitted factors   of

production such as land,          public capital stock   ,in the case of Japan and the

Ur.irsd Stares),     huaon capital,     R&D capital rock. and the environment.

        The degree of local returns to scale             for   thu    lth country may be

computed as:

What this equation says               is    that       the degtee of local retutns to sosie

inoreases    with the quantities of capital and labor,                    and time, particularly

with tespect to labor.            However,        for the period under study,             the degree of

local retutns    to scale is significantly less than unity,                      that is, returns to

scale are sharply decreasing.

        The rate of local technical progress reeliced may be computed as:

What this equation says is thet the rate of local technical progress,                                 given

the    rate of capital augmentation, declines                   with the level of capital and

time    but rises with the level                of labor.      Thus,   even though the rates of

capital     augmentation are exogenously determined, the rate of technical

progress reslired depends on the quantities of capital snd labor and to that

extent may be regarded as endogenous.

        The degrees of local returns to acale and the rates of local technical

progress are plotted against time for each country in Figure 6.1 and Figure

6.2 respectively.              It is interesting to note                    that     locally,    for every

country,    the degree of returns to scale is less than unity but rising over

time.      By cor.rraar, the rate of technical progress declines with time.                                In

fact,      the    rates    of    local    technical              progress     show      strong    signs    of

convergence, over time,            despite significant differences in the rates of

growth of the inputs and in the                    rates of capital augmentation across

coontries.         This decline in the rate of local                    technical progress may be

largely arrributed to the diminishing marginal productivity of capitel due

ro increases in both capital and in time.                          However,    the convergence in the

local rates of technical progreos oaliced, which depend on the quantities

of inpucs ae well           as time,      sn.uld be carefully distinguished from the

convergence in the rates of copirar augmentation, which are eseumed fixed

and     exogenous in rhia study.              doth types           of convergence must be further

Jiutiuguished       from   rio    c nsergence      of        levels   or rarea of growth of reel

level    as the United States on the                loS 'e.            (Could this have partially

together.'            (Could this    be due        to     increased capital mobility within

Is Technicsl Progress Capital-Saving or Labor-Saving?

          One    interesting question         is     whether capital-augmenting technical

progress is also capital saving,               in the sense that the              (cost-minimizing)
demand for capital relative to               labor,
                                                    ' at         given quantity of output and

prices of capital and labor,                 is reduced as a result of the technical

progress.          In Appendix 1, it is shown that capital-augmenting technical

progress is capital-saving if and unly if the elasticity of substitution
between capital and labor is less than unity in absolute value.                          In Table

6.3, we present estimates of                                 which are all   negative,   indicating

that      technical   progress has been capital-saving rather than labor-saving in

all       of the   countries.      One implication of the oapidal-saving nature of

technical       progress is that structural unemplo'menr for the aggregate economy

elements of the gredient and the Hessisn matrix of the production function

for the five countries in 1970.          The first partial derivatives are all

positive.      The own second-partial derivatives are         all negative and the

determinants of the Hessian marries are all positive.            Thus the estimated

trer.slog production    function is mcnotonically increasing and concave at

least within a convex neighborhood of the 1970 values            of the independenc

variables,



Purcnasing Pcwcr Parity Adjustment

     We have uct made explicit     purchasing-pc'4er-parity     (PPP) adjustments on

the data,     Several considerations ace relevant.     Pirst,   given our assumption

    s country-specific, commodity-augmentation form of technical progress,

rerely substituting the PEP exchange rates for the market exchange rates in

fiSO in the conversipn of the investment and COP data from constant local

currency to constant U.S.     dollars has   g effect on       our results exceot the

estImates of the augmentatirn Level parameters,         Thus,    a serious effort at

PPP adjustment requires separate adjustment factors for real output and for


                                            39
 real investment for each of the countries for each
                                                    year of the sample
 period.      Second,   to the extent that      such adjustments are (separately for

 real output and capital)     either approximately proportional or trended across

countries, they would also have already been reflected in the country- and

commodity-specific time-varying augmentation factors,                 Third,   there is one

theory of purchasing power patity which says that the true gap in the real

output between two countries is overstated by the market
                                                         exchange rates;16

where      Y     is the 'true"    real output of the ith country at time            t   and
        is the measured real output of the ith
                                               country at time            t, converted at

the market exchange rates.             tquation (f,3)   implies that the second-order
parameters of the translog production function in terms                  of the measured
output and inputs are proportional to, but not identical with,                 one another

parameters identical.        However,      since the hypothesis of a single mats-

production function with identical          saoond-otdar parameters across countries

cannot be rejected,      we conclude that the differences among the
                                                                                  S's, if
any, are not statistically significant and a PPP adjustaanr is not likely to

alter the qualitative nature of our results.

        One application of the estimated production function parameters is to

use them to compute alternative estimates of the rate of technical progress,

without relying on the assumptions of constant returns                                 to scale,     neutral

technical progress and profit maximization.                            In Table 7.1, we present a

summary of the data cn the five countries over the sample periods.                                  The data

show that Japan had the highest average annual rate of growth of real ODP

and the United Kingdom the lowest.                          Japan also hsd the highest average

annual rate of growth of capital stock end U.K.                           the lowest.           The United

Stares had the highesr rate of growth of the labor force and West Germany

the   lowest.           In Table 7.2, we compare our estimates of the average annual

rates of technical progress (or equivalently rates of growth of total factor

productivity) with estimates obtained using the conventional method.

        Our estimates of the average annual rates of technical progress are

calculated as follows,                Let     Jn()          be the estimated translog production

function.       Let         r — 0    be the initial period and             r   —   T     be the terminal

period.        Recall that technical               progress is the rate of growth of output,

holding     inputs constant.                Thus,     the    average    annual     rate    of      technical

progress maybe estimated as;

period.         The two estimates A,        and   A,    will in general not coincide unless

technical progress is neutral.               In this study,     the average annual rate of

technical progress is estimated as the average of                     and
                                                  A,                        A,

The validity of equation (7.5)                depends on the assumptions of ccnatant

returns to scale and profit maximization with competitive markets.                             The

average annual rate of technical progress between period                    0    and period      T

may be estimated, under the assumption of neutrality, by:

Moreover,    the    second and third         terms on the right-hand side of equation

(7.6) may he intetpteted as the contributions due to the growth of capital

snd labot respectively.

       We note significant differences between the two alternative seta of

estimates of technical progress in Table 7.2.                   Our estimates are much

higher, partially reflecting our finding of a lower capital elasticity and

hence docreasing recurns               to scale for the five countries, and show much

greater disparsion. Tho rankings              of the countries by the rate of (realized)

technical progress also change significantly,                 with,   for example, Japan

moving from  last place to first place                and the United Kingdom from   third
place to last place.
       In Table 7.3,          we   present   two   alternative sets of estimates of the
relative    contributions of the different sources            of growth for each of the

five countries, first using our estimated aggregate production functions end

secondly using the conventional approach.                 Our estimates of the    average

annual contributions of capital are calculated as follows.                First, we have,

for an estimate of the average annual contribution of capital,

(7.8)               -        [n (,4,T)               -    £n



As in the oase of teohnioal                progress,           the average annual oontribution due to

ospital is taken to be the average of                             G0        and        .    The average annual

oontribution      due to labor        oan be similarly               estimated.

        We find     that     over    the    period        under      study,       technical progress          is the

most important souroe of econdmio growth,                                   aooounting for          more     than 50

peroent (more than 80 peroent for the European countries),                                      and oapital is

the   seoond most important souroe of eoonomio                              growth (exoept,         by   1   peroent,

for the U.S.).          Labor aooounts for less than                    5   peroent exoept for the United

States.        These       resulta    may be oontrasted to those                           of the    conventional

approach which identify capital as the most important source of economic

growth (more than 40 percent)                ,   followed by            technical progress (between 15

and   52 percent).             By either         approach,             capital and          technical progress

combined account for more than 95 percent of the economic growth of France,

West Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom.                             In the United States, where the

labor force grew more rapidly than in other countries during this period,

they still account for 75 percent of the economic                                 growth.

      The reason why the               combined contributions of capital and technical

progress are similar by either approach is because the contributions of

labor are very similar by either approach--our estimated output elasticities

with respect to labor are not that different from those obtained by the

factor share method.                 However,            our approach yields much                   lower output

elasticities with respect to capira than those obtained by the factor share

                                                                44
method under the constant returns to scale assumption. Thus, our estimated

contributions        of    the    remaining    factor,    technical progress,        must   be

correspondingly higher.            Another way of understanding our results            is   to

observe that our low estimated cspitsl elasticities lead to decreasing

rather than constant returns to scale                  and thus   the estimated rates of

technical progress must be higher to be consistent with the same rates of

growth of real output and inputs.

      We should emphasize, however the complementary nature of capital and

technical progress.         A growth decomposition exercise is essentially a first-

order one and cannot take             the   complemenrariry into account.         Given our

finding      that     technical     progress     is    capital-augmenting, capital          and

technology are            inextricably      intertwined and       are   both   indispensable

ingredienrs    for   economic growth,

     Finally, we plot our estimates of the rates of capital augmentation
against the rates of growth of capital for rhe different countries in Figure
7.1. It is apparent that rhere is a positive, but non-linear, relationship
between     the rare of capital augmentation ,Solow-neurral technical progress)

and   the rate of growth of capital.             however,   there also appears to      be an

asyaprore    to the capital augmentation care so that, beyond              a certain   point,

increases in the rate of growth              of capital have no effect on the rare of

capital augmentation.            One conjecture that ia consistent with the scatter-

diagram in Figure 7.1 is that at any given time there is only so much new

technology ready for immediate           exploitation--once rhis is exhausted, further
Increases     in     investment have         little    effect   in raising     the    current

echno1ogical        level even    though they cay     raise real output.

8.   InnationalandJntertemporalcomparison
     A second application of the estimated production function parameters          is

to compare the evolution of the prcductivities of the different countrias

cver rime.     In Figure 8.1, we plot the real output per labor-hour of each of

the five countries against time.            The United Stares    had the highest real

output per labor-hour until it was overtaken by France and West Germany in

the mid-l970's.      The United Kingdom fell behind France and West Germany in

the late 1950's.         Japan starred in the last place at a very low level but by

1985 had narrowed the gap considerably. However,            real output per labor-hour

ray differ across countries because of differences in capital intensity

(capital    stock per unit labor)        and scale,     s   well as in efficiency and

technical    progress.     In Figure 8,2, we plot the quantity of the real capital

stock per worker in the labor force of each of the five countries,
                                                                   adjusted
for coverage,    against time.'0        We note that the U.S. had the highest level

of capital stock per worker until around 1970, when it was overtaken
                                                                     by the
European    countries, due in part to the higher rate of growth of the labor

force in the United States.         However,    the measured capital stock per worker

of the United States was still significantly higher than that of Japan as of

1985 even though the rate of growth of the Jspsnese capital stock was three

times that of the United States.            As of 1985, West Germany had the highest

measured capital stock per worker, followed by Frsnce and the U.K.

     In Figure 8.3 we plot the quantity of real output per unit of the

reasured capital stock of each of the five countries, again adjusted for

coverage,    against      time.    We   note    that   ospital productivity showed a

generally declining trend          except for        the   United States where      it    was

approximately constant.       What this implies is that the capital-output ratio,

the reciprocal of capital        productivity, must have been rising over time,

except for the United States.

        Figures 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3 are all based on the conversion from constant
local currency units into conatant U.S. dollars
                                                by the market exchanga rates
prevailing in 1880.          In Appendix 3, we assess the effect of using the

"purchasing-power-parity'exchange rates of Summers and Hesron (1988) on the

relative levels of reel output pet labor-hour across the five countries.

        tn order to compare productive efficiencies across
                                                           countries, we must
net out the effects of capital intenaity and scale.              We note that within our

framework, in terms of "efficiency"- equivalent quantities of output and

inputs,     the   production functions of           the    different countries     are,   by
definition, identical.        In terms of the measured quantities of output and

inputs,   however, they are not identical.           We therefore pose the hypothetical

question:     if all countries have the same quantities of measured inputs of

capital and labor as the United States, what would have been the quantities

of their real outputs and how would they evolve over time?                  In other words,

we compare their productive efficiencies h..lding inputs constant.

        To answer this question we project the time-series of hypothetical real

outputs for each country by the formula:

-in        's    reflect the output augmentation levels (or efficiencies) of the

different countries relative to the United States in the base year, as well

as possible differences in definitions and measurements of the variables.

We find that in the base year (1970),              the United States had the highest

output efficiency, followed by France,            West Germany,   Japan and the United

Kingdom,        in that order.     France, Wear Germany and Japan were actually very

close to one another-       -all   of them had an output efficiency of approximately

60    percent of       the United States.         The United Kingdom had       an output

efficiency of slightly mere than 40 percent of the United States.

      Similarly, the        implied estimates of       ar's can be computed from      the

labor share equation,        given the estimated values of the parameters from the

first-differenced form.          The results are presented in Table 8.2, along with

the directly estimated values of the                      from the aggregate production

additional information on the validity of the hypothesis.                  Unfortunately,

they turn out to be quite different, further undercutting the validity of

thm hypothesis of profit maximization.

       In Figures 8.4 through 8.8          we compare the time-series of the         teal

outputs predicted for each of the five countries from our modal using the

estimates of the parameters in oolumn         1   of Table 6.1 with that of the actual

real outputs.         This provides an indication of the goodness of fit of the

model of ospital-mugmenriog reohoicel progress.             Overall,   the model seems to

fit quite well.

        Given the estimated values of           £n   ,     -in            and the parametets of

the     aggregate production function,         equation (8.1)        is used to project the

level    of real output      that would have been produced           by each country in       each

period if it had the measured inputa of the United States                      in that period.

The results are plotted for each country in Figure 8.9.

        Figure 8.9 shows      that     in 1949 the United States had the highest level

of overall productive efficiency, the United Kingdom the second highest (but

considerably lower, than the United States)           ,    and West Germany the     lowest.     By
the mid-l950's France,          Weat Germany and Japan had overtaken the                   United

Kingdom.     As of 1985, the United Statee           remained in the first place and the

United Kingdom in last place,             with France,      West Germany and Japan closely

clustered together.          Sc-acting at less than 40 percent of the productive

efficiency of the United States              in 1949,      the   latter three countries had

reached approximately can-thirds of the productive efficiency of the U.S. by

1995.       The   gap becween the        United Kingdom end the            United States      only

narrowed very slightly during this period.

        In Figure 8,10 we plot the relative productive efficiency of                     each   of

the     four countries      ag-ainsc    time, using the Uniced States level as the
reference (that       is,   with U.S. productive efficiency nocmaliced at unity).
Figure     8.10 provides the same picture as Figure 9.9, namely,                  that France,

West Germany and Japan have closed the gap significencly but not the United

Kingdom.     The two interesting questions           that emerge sce:        What accounts for

the     initial and still considerable U.S.               edge   (sice,    lend input,   natural

resources, greater degree              of economic competition, economic and social

mobility,    etc.)?    And why is the U.S. losing ground to France, Uest Germany
and Japan     (declining educational atandarda,         falling   ratio of public to

private investrsent)?19      Theae questiona await further atudy.

      One natural definition of convergence acroaa countries is based on

their production technologies.       Two countries     are said to have converged to

each other,    if,    riven the same inouts, they produce approximately the same

output.     gased on this definition of convergence,      the country with the lower

          of productive efficiency should have a higher rate of technical

progress     (or   equivalently growth of total       factor   productivity)   .   Figure
gb,    whioh shows the differences in produotive efficiency narrowing among

nations over time, provides empirical evidence         in support of this hypothesis

of oonvergenoe.



9.    Oonolusion

      We have ptesented a new analysis oi the characteristics of post-war

eoooomio growth,       such as the rates   and patterns    of technical progress and

scale economies, using pooled time           series    data from the Oroup-of-Five

oountries.     We have found that the empirical       data are inconsistent with the

hypothesis of oonstant returns to sosle, at rhe aggregate,                national level.

In fact,    there are aharply decreasing local returns to scale.             Moreover, we
havefound that technical ptogress is non-neutral. tn              fact,    it is ospital-

augmenting.2°        We have also found that the empirical date are inconsistent

with the hypothesis of profit maximization with respect to labor under


     lOIn the context of the irsoework here, this is equivalent to asking
why the augmentation rate for ospital is so much bowet in the United States
compared to Franoe, West Oermsny sod Jspko.

     °°Oavid end van de Kbundert (1965) have also found non-neutral
technical  progress in their study but with a bias that is opposite in
direotion to what is found bore.

competitive conditions. All of these hypotheses sre, however,                           necesssry for

the validity         of the conventional method of measuring                 the rate     of growth of

total factor productivity and of growth accounting.

        Based on our new approach,              we have obtained alternative estimates of

the rates of growth of total                factor      productivity as well as alternative

decompositions of economic growth into its                         sources- -capital,       labor snd

technical progress--that are independent of the conventional assumptions.

We have found much higher and aore dispersed rates of realized technical

progress,        We have also found that technical progress                    is   by far the most
important source of economic growth of the industrialized countries in our

sample,    accounting for more than 50 percent.

        What are the implications of capital-augmenting technical progress? It

implies that the aggregate production function can be written in the form:



(9.1)        Y   —   F(A(r)K,   0).




Thus,    the benefits of technical              progress   are higher the higher the level of

the capital stock.            A country wich a luw level of            capital      stock relative to

labor will not benefit aa much from technical                      progress    aa a country with a

high level of capital relative                  to labor.        Capital and technical progress

are,     in a word,        complementary.            Moreover,     capital-augmenting technical

progress implies that the care of                    cealiced    technical    progress,     defined as

the growth       in real output holding inpucs constant,

depends on the elasticity of output with respeot to measured capital as well

as   the   rate of capital augmentation.         The former in turn depends on the

actual     quantities of capital and labor.          In our model,    the rate of capital

augmentation, A(t)/A(t), is taken to be exogenous and equal to a constsnt
                                                               8 2n Y
for each country, but the rate of realized technical progress,        , which
varies with       the   quantities of     capital,      labor   and    time,     through    the

elasticity of output with respect         to capital,   is endogenous.

      The    consequence of     this    capital-technology oomplementsrity can be

readily appreciated from our empirical results.                   Consider France,         West

Germany and Japan.       They all have almost the               estimated rate of capital

augmentation of between 14 and li percent                annum.    However, according to

our estimates in Table 7.2, Japan has the highest average annual rate of

(realized)     technical progress,     followed by France and then West Ceraaoy,            in

the same order as their respective rates of growth of capital stock (See

Table 7.1).      This is precisely the oomplementarity of capital and technical

progress at work.

      However,    we should emphasize that a zero rats of labor augmentation

does not necessarily mean that the quality of labor has not izproved over

time, or that all the      invesiments in human capital have gone to waste.                 As

mentioned earlier,       improvements in the          quality of      labor      may manifest

themselves in the form of capital-augmenting technical               progress.

      At    the aggregate level,   one izplication of capital-augmenting technical

progress is the importance of ospital to long-term economic growth.                        The

benefits of technical      progress to the economy are directly proportional to
the size    of the capital   stock.    An increase    in the saving rste which results

in a higher level of capital formation may also bring about an acceleration
in   the rate of economic growth in the short and intermediate runs,                   A second

implication, given that the elasticity of substitution between capital and

labor has been found to be less than unity,                  is that technical   ptogress is

capital-saving tathet than labor-saving, in the sense that                       the    desired

capital-labor ratio for given prices of capital and labor and quantity of

output declines with technical           ptogtess (See Appendices 2 and 3).            Capital-

augmenting technical          ptogtesa is       thus     less likely to cause structural

unemployment thtough the            technological displacement of workers.             tn fact,

given that     F0,     the     ctoss-psttisl detivative of output with respect to

capital and labor, is positive (see Table 6.3), capital-augmentingtechnical

ptogtess is likely to enhance emplysott,                 in the intermediate and long runs,

      Capital-augmenting technical ptogress also has implications for optimal

investment, depending on whothor technical                 ptogtess is anticipated or not
and how its benefits sod costs           re    allocated.

      The   results of        our    growth accounting exercise          identify technical

progtesa as      the   most    importanr       source of economic      growth.   While this

finding may be reminiscent of the findings of a lsrge unexplained "residual"

in early studies of economic growth,              they are,    in fact, quite different on

at least two counts.           FIrst,    ohm early studies       typically assume constant

returns to scale,      neutrality of technical           progress,   and profit maximization

with competitive matkers.           Second,    while tecinical progress is, in the form

of capital augmentation, assumed to oa exogenous in our model, as in the

early studies,     we have found it to ha complementary to capital so that it

does a country with a lam local                of capital stock much less good than a

country with a high level.              this      Ital-terhnology oomplementarity, which




                                                    SI
implies a positive interaotive effect of capital and technical progress,

distinguishes our results from others.

        Thus,   it would be wrong to interpret        our finding to mean that capital

is not an important source of economic growth.               In addition to its direcr

contribution, capital also enhances the effect               of    technical    progress on

economic growth.

        Technical progress (specifically the rates of commodity augmentation)

is taken as exogenous        in this    study.   Moreover,   the rates of augmentation

are assumed to be constsnt over time.             It is, however,        remarkable that the

rates of augmentation of capital turn out to be almost identical for France,

West Germany and Japan-- the hypothesis of convergence among these countries

cannot be rejected--indicating that the three countries have neatly the same

access    to advances in technology. it will be of interest to explore why the

convergence hyothesis does not seem to apply to the U.K. and the U.S. and
acre generally to investigate the determinants of the observed variations in

the     tate and pattern of technical progress (can it be satisfactorily

explained by capital accumulation, education, R&D expenditures, the ratio of

public to private         investment,    or other     factors?).          It will   also   be

interesting to allow the possibility of augmentation rates that vary over

time.       We have    already seen some evidence that             the    rates of capital

augmentation appear to be related to the rates of growth of capital (Figure

?.l),     It may well be the case that they ate related to the rates of growth

of human    capital   as well.

        We have also not made explicit adjustments for the quality of capital

or labor,       as were done by Jorgenson, Gollop and Fraumeni (195?),              Instead,

we allow any trend of improving input quality to be captured
                                                             by the rates of

technical ptogresa include what otheta may atttihute to the imptovement in

the qualitiea of the inputs.

      Our findinga also indicate that the rate of growth of real output ia

lower in che United Statea than in Japan not only becauae of the lowet rate

of growth of the capital input (capital accumulation), but alao hecauae of a

lower rate of capital augrentation (S percent for the United Statea
                                                                    compared
with 14 percent for Japan).         This   lower rate of capital        augmentation may
reflect tncreasing constraints in the efficient utilization of capital in

the   United States.     Among   the factors   commonly    put forward to explain the
low efficiency of capital are: tie deteriorating capital infrastructure,
declining educational standards, inr"-asing probleos in the natural and
legal environments, rising "agency casts" and generally declining "social
capability" .'    However,    this also suggests       that the United States economy

is operating well within the meta-prcducticn possibilities frontier and has

the   potential of achieving significant increases                in real output through

icprovemenrs in the efiiciency, or the rate of augmentation, of capital

without increases in the physical irpura.              U'nether and how     this   can he

                    When Is Capital-Augmenting Technical Progress
                                 Also Capital-Saving?


        We begin with a definition of capital-saving technical                                progress.

Technical progress is said to be capital-saving if the demand for capital

relative to labor,            at given prices of capital and labor and given quantity

of   output,    is reduced as a result of technical                                     Under capital-
                                                                            progress.

augmenting technical progress,                 the production function rakes the form:

                      The Effect of "Purchasing-Power-Parity"

      What   is     the    iapact    on   out     findinga     if     "purchasing-pc-wet-parity"

exchange rates of Summeta and Weston (1988) ate used Instead of the aarket

exchange races in 1980 fnr the cnnvataicn into constant (1980) U.S. dollars?

As discussed in section 6,            this      will have nn impact on out finding of

capital-augmenting pccgcess            nut      on      the   magnitudes     of    the   estimated

augmentation tates but may have an impact nn                  Sn       and   Sn A0's.

      In Table A3,l         the     matket exchange tates             used in this study ate

compated with       the putchasing-powet-parity exchange tatea                    of Summera and

Heston (1988)   .     It   indicates that         the     ccunttiea    whose teal oucpuca     pet
labot-hout will he sensitive to alternative exchange catee are Ftance and

West Germany--theit teal outputs will have to be scaled down by 20 percent.

The net teeult is that as of 1985,               the United States        would atill have the

higbeot teal output per labor-hour among the five countries                       and Japan would

arill have the lowest.        (See Figure A3.1),                -
