       This paper shows that extremely small degrees of altruism on the part of voters can explain the

ubiquitousness of anti-trade commercial policies designed to protect inefficient sectors. Many sectors

that receive protection are neither infant-industries nor monopolistic sectors whose protection may

lead nations to garner rents. Rather, they are “traditional” sectors whose members suffer from free

trade. In my model, altruistic voters increase their own utility by averting this suffering.1

       The happiness of altruists depend on what I term the “material payoffs” of others,2 presumably

because they experience vicariously the pleasure and pain of others. If altruists care equally about

the material payoffs of all domestic residents, they want to transfer resources from individuals

whose marginal material payoff from income is low to those whose marginal material payoff from

income is high. I show that this can easily rationalize a desire to transfer resources from exporting

to import-competing sectors so that tariffs emerge if this policy is put to a vote of the whole

population.

       This model is far from the first model where political processes lead to the protection of relatively

inefficient sectors. Indeed, Rodrik’s (1995) survey shows that this literature is vast. The key

difference between the literature surveyed in Rodrik (1995) and the model I present here is that I

suppose that politicians carry out the wishes of altruistic voters, rather than assuming that they

deal exclusively with selfish individuals. This serves several purposes. First, it provides a link

between the existing political economy literature and the older tradition of deriving tariffs from the

maximization of a “social welfare function” (as in Corden 1974, p. 106). The utility of altruistic

voters has some common elements with a social welfare function since it depends on the payoffs

of all other agents. On the other hand, it is reasonable to imagine that even individuals who are

altruistic place more weight on their own satisfaction than on that of others. Thus, just as in the

case of models with individualistic voters, people’s preferences differ and a model of the political

process is needed to determine policy outcomes.

       In addition, the incorporation of altruism into political economy models can help resolve the
   1
     Altruistic voters have been used to explain other government policies, particularly those associated with transfers
to the poor and the elderly (see Hochman and Rogers (1969), Hansson and Stuart (1989), Coate (1995) and the
references cited therein). As has been repeatedly emphasized, the act of voting itself may well be altruistic in nature
as the direct private benefits from voting seem small relative to the direct private costs.
   2
     I use this term to avoid the apparent circularity that stems from saying that an altruists’ utility function depends
on others’ utility levels.


                                                           1
two key puzzles that, as stressed by Rodrik (1995), political economy models have encountered as

positive theories of commercial policy. First, models of political economy based on selfish agents

do not find it easy to explain why trade barriers tend to be strongest against goods whose import

penetration is high. They cannot even explain why commercial policy is biased against trade (i.e.

tends to protect import-competing firms) rather than for trade (by subsidizing exports). Levy

(1999), for example, shows that the well known Grossman-Helpman (1994) model of protection

based on political contributions by individual sectors implies that export subsidies will exceed

import tariffs so that the bias of commercial policy will be favorable to trade.

       The reason for this is straightforward. In addition to being concerned with contributions from

lobbyists, the Grossman-Helpman model assumes that policy makers also care about general welfare.

Suppose, as they do, that tariffs and subsidies are offset by lump sum taxes and transfers. Then,

an x percent import tax on a good whose domestic consumption represents y percent of domestic

income has welfare effects that are comparable to the effects of an x percent export subsidy on a

good whose domestic consumption also represents y percent of domestic income. However, such

an export good can be expected to have a larger total volume of production than this “equivalent”

import competing good (which is why it is exported). This means that the relevant producers gain

larger rents from the export subsidy than from the import tax. Exporters are thus more likely to

win the lobbying competition by offering politicians larger contributions.3

       Altruism can explain anti-trade policies if the individual income of those who are stuck in the

protected import-competing sector is smaller than the income of those who are stuck in the export

sector. I show this in the context of the two sector specific factors model of Jones (1971). Each

sector produces output with specific (immobile) capital and mobile labor. I let labor be unbiased

in the sense of Jones and Ruffin (1977) so that it neither gains nor loses from a small tariff. Since
   3
     This conclusion hinges on the standard assumption that tariff proceeds are redistributed in lump-sum fashion.
Maggi and Rodriguez-Clare (2000) show that, if the proceeds are kept by the government or are assigned either
to domestic importers (as in the case of certain quotas) of foreign exporters (as in the case of voluntary export
agreements), and the government puts sufficient weight on these uses of funds, it is possible to rationalize the
government’s preference for making tariffs highest on goods whose import penetration is high. The reason is that, if
these funds are valued highly, the government prefers to levy tariffs on goods that generate large amounts of these
funds.
   The political process can also yield tariffs with selfish voters if, as in the first model of Mayer (1984), the majority
of the population gains from such tariffs. As Mayer (1984) himself notes, however, this approach is not very attractive
as most tariffs benefit only a small minority of the population.


                                                            2
such a tariff has no effect on aggregate income, it simply redistributes income from the owners of

the capital that is used in the export sector to those whose capital is used in the import-competing

sector. At the same time, the forces that lead one sector to export in one country while the

other sector exports from another tend to imply that owners of export-sector-specific factors are

richer than owners of import-sector-specific factors. This means that the losses in vicarious utility

experienced by workers when the the income of exporters falls as a results of a tariff tend to be

smaller than the gains they obtain from the increased income of import-competing factors.

   The empirical relevance of the theory then turns on whether protection is indeed more common

in sectors where the income of immobile factors is low. There is an extensive literature which

studies the characteristics of industries that tend to receive protection. This literature is surveyed

in Anderson and Baldwin (1987) and its key results are also discussed in Rodrik (1995). One

common finding in this literature is that protection is more common in labor-intensive sectors as

well as in sectors with low wages. This fits well with the model I develop as long as one regards the

workers earning these low wages as immobile, which seems plausible. The empirical literature has

also tended to find that protection is positively correlated with both the level and the change in

import penetration. A high import penetration in a sector implies that the value of the domestic

production of the good is relatively low so that this too is consistent with a low level of income for

the immobile factors that work in the sector. Immobility of these factors is particularly likely to

lead to a loss of income when import penetration rises so that the connection between this variable

and protection is particularly natural in my model.

   A tariff can always be thought of as a combination of a production subsidy and a consumption

tax of equal magnitude. As stressed by Mayer and Riezman (1987), the existing political economy

models provide a logical explanation for the existence of production subsidies (namely that the

producers who benefit offer contributions in exchange for these subsidies) but provide no direct

reason why this producer subsidy ought to be coupled with a consumer tax of the same magnitude.

Even if one accepts that such subsidies cannot be financed by lump sum taxes this particular

combination is not easy to rationalize in the context of these models, particularly as the consumer

tax actually raises more revenues than are needed to pay for the production subsidy.


                                                  3
      The model with altruism can explain this coupling under some conditions. What is required is

that producers be heterogeneous in size and they be required to incur a fixed cost to demonstrate

that they qualify for a production subsidy. Governments that wish to grant production subsidies

must naturally verify that applicants have actually produced the relevant goods. It is reasonable

to imagine that this verification also requires some effort on the part of the producer and that this

effort is not a great deal bigger for large firms, which tend to have well established reputations,

than for small firms. If the cost to the producer of proving his production is independent of the

size of his output, linear production subsidies must be quite high in percentage terms if they are to

help the smallest producers significantly. This, in turn, entails significant production distortions.

By contrast, tariffs help small producers even if the tariffs are small. Thus tariffs can make up for

the consumption distortions they introduce by reducing the size of production distortions that are

needed to help small producers.

      The argument is not that tariffs involve smaller total administrative costs.4 I show tariffs can

remain more desirable to altruistic voters than subsidies even if the total administrative costs of

the tariff are as large as the administrative costs of a subsidy that is claimed by all producers.

Rather, the difference between tariffs and subsidies that I am stressing involves the distribution of

administrative costs across agents. Subsidies, I suppose, require that some of these costs be borne

by the individuals that the subsidy is meant to help and this can make such subsidies less attractive

to voters than import taxes.

      The voting patterns of legislators are sometimes viewed as containing evidence suggesting that

protectionist legislation is passed because politicians are captured by self-interested industries (see

Baldwin 1985, for example). In this paper I show that many aspects of campaign contributions,

lobbying activities, and legislative voting are quite consistent with altruism being the basis of

protection. For this purpose I construct a model of indirect democracy that tries to capture some

key aspects of the way commercial policy is changed in the United States. In particular, the model

tries to rationalize the fact that campaign contributions and lobbying for commercial policy tend to

be directed at legislators that are already on the same side as those who contribute and lobby. The
  4
      Corden (1974) points out that tariffs would be superior to subsidies if their total administrative costs were lower.



                                                             4
extensive study of trade policy by Bauer, Pool and Dexter’s (1963) stresses this aspect of lobbying

behavior. In addition, the concordance of the views of contributors to campaigns with the views of

the recipients of these contributions is documented in Kau, Keenan and Rubin (1982) and Baldwin

and Magee (1998).

      My model rationalizes these observations by supposing that it is costly for a legislator to learn

the relevant facts on an issue, even if he has strong a priori views on it and even if he has access to

interested lobbies. I thus equate listening to lobbyists with the costly acquisition of information.

One reason legislators have for acquiring this information is that some of the facts they learn may be

crucial for convincing uncommitted legislators. I show that, if legislators find it relatively costless

to transmit a small amount of credible information to their colleagues, it makes sense for lobbyists

to talk mainly to legislators on their side. The reason is that these legislators are more willing

to listen and thus, effectively require smaller campaign contributions in exchange for providing

“access”. My model thus fits well with Bauer, Pool and Dexter’s (1963, p. 442) observation that

“The tactical basis of pressure group activities seemed to be to assist men already on their side to

do the job of persuading fellow legislators.”

      The concerns of my model of indirect democracy are related to those of Austen-Smith (1990,

1995), though my model differs from his in several respects. Austen-Smith (1990) considers the

transmission of information from one legislator to another. He studies the case where this infor-

mation is “soft” so that the model is one of “cheap-talk.”5 By contrast, I consider the case where

the information that legislators provide to each other is “hard.” Austen-Smith (1995) considers a

formal model where campaign contributions buys access to legislators. In his model, this access

has no indirect effects on other legislators, it only allows the lobbyist to convince the legislator

who is listening to him. I suppose instead that the legislator who listens to the lobbyist acquires

information that he can use to convince other legislators.

      While he does not consider information transmission at all, the logic of my argument is much

closer to Stratmann’s (1992) informal explanation for the fact that legislators who are staunch

supporters of farmers (because they represent districts with very high farm populations) receive
  5
      The result is that such information exchange has relatively small effects on outcomes.



                                                           5
large contributions from farm lobbies. He suggests this comes about because these legislators require

smaller payments to make the effort necessary to get pro-farm legislation passed than do legislators

who are less favorable to farmers. In my model, the nature of this effort is made explicit, and it

takes the form of absorbing and transmitting credible information to relatively neutral legislators.

One advantage of this approach is that it rationalizes simultaneously the lobbying activities of

contributors.

        The paper proceeds as follows. In the first two sections of this paper, I let tariffs be determined

by direct democracy as in Mayer (1984), so that the desires of the median voter determine trade

policy. Section 2 presents the specific factors model and shows how arbitrarily small levels of

altruism can lead the median voter, who tends to be an owner of the mobile factor, to vote for

import taxes rather than export subsidies. Section 3 compares tariffs to production subsidies

assuming that producers of import-competing goods face individual costs of demonstrating that

they are entitled to the subsidy. Section 4 presents my a model of indirect democracy and Section

5 concludes.


1        Altruistic voters’ preference for anti-trade policies

I consider the two-sector specific-factor model of Jones (1971).6 The capital stocks K1 and K2 can

only be used in sectors 1 and 2 respectively while labor is mobile across sectors. There are L̄ workers

and each worker supplies one unit of labor inelastically. In addition, the population includes N1

individuals who own some units of K1 and an additional N2 individuals who own some units of

K2 . I assume at first that the two capital stocks are evenly distributed among the individuals who

own them. Denoting by Kji the individual holdings of Kj for j equal 1 or 2, Kji is equal to Kj /Nj .

        Given fixed international prices P1∗ and P2∗ , the effect on workers of a tariff on good 1 is generally

ambiguous. The increase in the price of good 1 makes them worse off as consumers but it increases

sector 1’s demand for labor and this raises their real wage. To focus on the effect of altruism, I

consider a production structure such that, using the terminology of Ruffin and Jones (1977), labor

is “unbiased” so that it neither gains nor loses from a small tariff whose revenues are rebated in
    6
        Jones (1975) extends the model to n goods and n specific factors.

lump sum fashion.

   This requires that the ratio of the elasticity of substitution to the share of labor compensation

in total revenue be the same in all sectors and that the fraction of labor employed in each sector

be equal to the fraction of national income produced in that sector. It is possible to satisfy these

two conditions for any vector of prices if both production functions take the Cobb-Douglas form

with the same exponent on labor. I thus suppose that output of good j, Xj satisfies

                                           Xj = Lαj Kj1−α                                        (1)

where Lj is the amount of labor employed in sector j and I am normalizing goods so as to avoid

multiplying the function on the right hand side by a constant.

   I suppose that perfectly competitive firms have access to these production functions so that the

demand for labor in sector j is given by

   Ignoring the interdependence of preferences for one moment, I let all consumers’ “material

payoffs” be represented by the same homothetic function. The relevant function for consumer i is

                                               U (C1i , C2i )                                    (5)

where C1i and C2i are individual consumption levels. If the level of altruism is small enough, no

individual offers any voluntary transfers. Individual i then chooses C1i and C2i to maximize (5)

                                                    j

where I i is the individual’s income and the P̂j ’s are the prices paid by all consumers. The homo-

theticity of U then implies that all consumers spend the same share of their income on good 1 and

this helps ensure that labor is unbiased.

       I write the maximized value of the “material payoff” function U as


                                              V i = f (g(P̂1 , P̂2 )I i )

where f is an increasing function and g is both non-increasing in its two elements and homogeneous

of degree -1. I write it in this way because the function g captures all the effects of U on demand

while the function f plays a crucial role when individuals use their preferences to determine optimal

redistribution programs.

       I capture altruism by supposing individual i’s utility (or “psychological payoff”), Ωi equals

                                                   X
                                    Ωi = V i + γ          Vk              0<γ<1                                  (6)

Thus each person experiences vicariously the welfare of others, at least to a limited extent.7 Sup-

posing that people care about others’ own subjective assessments of material payoffs, rather than

about the components of other individuals’ consumption bundles seems like a reasonable starting

point for this type of analysis, even though it is obviously restrictive.

       Equation (4) implies that production levels depend only on the relative price received by do-

mestic producers. The homotheticity of preferences ensures that the ratio of total consumption of

good 1 to total consumption of good 2 depends only on the relative price paid by domestic con-

sumers. Since the value of production at international prices must equal the value of consumption

at these prices, consumption levels depend only on the two domestic and the international relative

price. I now consider policies that keep the two domestic relative prices equal to each other but let

this relative price depart from its international counterpart. Without loss of generality, I focus on
   7
    Nothing would be changed if I followed Starks (1993) and let individual utility be the sum of their own “material
payoffs” (which he calls “felicity”) and other agents’ utilities.

policies that raise the domestic price of good 1 P1 while assuming that P1 = P̂1 = P̃1 . If, in the

voting equilibrium that raises this price good 1 is exported, this distortion can be thought of as

constituting an export subsidy, otherwise it can be thought of as a tariff.

   I suppose that tariff revenues, or export subsidy costs are offset by taxes or transfers that

are proportional to individual income. Because factors are supplied inelastically, this is the same

as assuming that these revenues (or costs) are offset by lump sum taxes or subsidies which are

proportional to (the equilibrium value of) pre-tax income. The purpose of this assumption is to

focus on the redistributive effects of the tariff or export subsidy while not introducing additional

redistribution through the policies that keep the government budget balanced. This assumption

implies that workers, who are paid a fraction α of all revenues from sales, also receive a fraction α

of all tariff proceeds (or pay this fraction of the cost of export subsidies). Thus, recognizing that

producers of good 1 are paid P̂1 for their output, the income of individual workers, I w is

that g1 I w /g is equal to −C1w . This establishes that my assumptions on tastes and technology are

   The effect on the material payoffs of workers of an increase in P1 is intermediate between the

effect on owners of capital of type 1 and the effect on owners of capital of type 2. Since the utility

obtained as a result of altruism is the same for all agents, this means that the median voter on

proposals of this type is a worker as long as both N1 and N2 are smallers than one half of the total

population N1 + N2 + L̄. This requires that L > |N1 − N2 |.

   Equation (6) implies that the utility of workers is

                             Ωw = [1 + γ(L̄ − 1)]V w + γN1 V 1 + γN2 V 2 .                          (13)

   In the case where material payoffs are linear in income so that the derivative of f with respect to

its argument is constant, f 01 = f 02 , so this expression equals zero. In this case, pure redistribution

holds no attraction to workers since all agents have the same marginal utility of income. Since a

small tariff neither increases nor reduces total income, it is neither beneficial or detrimental. As

usual, tariffs that are strictly greater than zero reduce welfare.

   The case of diminishing marginal utility of income is more plausible, however. Then, if the level

of altruism as measured by γ is arbitrarily small, workers prefer a small increase in P1 to free trade

if and only if I 1 is smaller than I 2 or when

                                            P1∗ X1  P ∗ X2
                                                   < 2     .                                        (14)

   Thus, with the same number of owners of type 1 capital as owners of type 2 capital, the good

whose relative price is increased by the median voter is the one which has a smaller value of

output. Tariffs will be imposed on imports if the value of production of the import competing

good is smaller than the value of production of the export good. More generally, tariffs will be

imposed if individuals who own capital that is used in the import competing sector are poorer than

individuals who own capital in the export sector. The level of altruism itself determines the level

of the optimal tariff but does not determine whether having a small tariff is attractive or not. This

result hinges on the fact that a small tariff provides essentially costless redistribution. When (14)

                                                   11
is satisfied, workers support tariffs because they take from owners of type 2 capital and give to

owners of type 1 capital.8 In the case of small tariffs, this “Robin Hood” policy costs the workers

nothing. The desirability of the policy for workers does not even hinge on whether owners of type 1

capital are poorer than the median voter. It hinges only on such owners being poorer than owners

of type 2 capital.

       Given the ubiquitousness of protection, this raises the question of whether factors specific to

export sectors earn generally more than factors that produce import-competing goods. Because the

specificity of factors is hard to gauge, this question is not easy to answer. However, it is common

to observe (see Gaston and Trefler 1994, for example) that workers in export sectors tend to earn

more than those employed in import-competing sectors. This suggests that, indeed, the factors

specific to the import sector have lower incomes.

       There also exist an a priori argument suggesting that, typically, import competing factors ought

to be relatively poor. To see this, consider a two country version in which, as in the Heckscher-Ohlin

model, endowments of the three factors are exogenous. It follows from (4) that the relative outputs

of the two goods at common international prices are independent of the labor endowments and

are simply proportional to the relative endowments of the specific factors. Thus, countries tend to

export the good which uses the specific factor that they have in relative abundance.

       The country that has a relatively high value of K1 /K2 must either have a high value of N1 /N2

or its owners of K1 must have relatively high endowments relative to its owners of K2 . The latter

can be thought of as capturing international differences in the knowledge that specific factors have

about how to produce their goods. Consistent with this interpretation, suppose that, within each

country all owners of specific factors are equally wealthy. Imagine then that countries draw both

their N1 /N2 and their residents’ individual endowments of specific factors from a set of common

distributions. It then follows that one can expect the country with the higher value of K1 /K2 to

have residents whose individual endowments of K1 are relatively high in comparison to its residents’

individual endowments of K2 . This means that the relative income of the owners of the factor which
   8
    This approach to justifying redistributive policies with altruistic voters is thus somewhat different from that
pursued in Miller (1988) and Coate (1995) who are interested in understanding the conditions under which altruists
would vote to tax themselves in order to finance a welfare state.



                                                        12
is specific to good 1 can be expected to be relatively high in the country that produces relatively

more of good 1. Therefore, if the median voter in the country that exports good 1 wishes to raise the

domestic price of good 1, the same can be expected of the other country. Moreover, if the difference

in individual endowments is large, each country will wish to protect its import-competing sector.

       Since this is only a statistical argument, it does not exclude situations where the main difference

between countries whose K1 /K2 differ is a difference between their N1 /N2 . In this case, one would

expect both countries to try to raise the same domestic price so that one country would offer an

export subsidy for this good while the other would institute a corresponding tariff. In practice, this

might correspond to what takes place in certain agricultural products.

       The evidence on the connection between import penetration and protection is somewhat mixed

(see Maggi and Rodriguez-Clare (2000) for references) though much of it indicates that sectors

with higher import penetration have more protection.9 If one continues to regard the country-

specific individual endowments as being drawn from a common distribution, a high level of import

penetration suggests the presence of particularly small individual endowments and this can be

expected to lead to protection. Given the immobility of specific factors, an increase in import

penetration is particularly likely to lead to a reduction in the income of the factors that are specific

to the import competing sector. Thus the model is particularly consistent with the fact that such

increases seem to be associated with increased protection. Indeed, U.S. law contained for a long time

a procedure that made it relatively easy for industries whose import penetration rose significantly

to obtain protection.10

       Lastly, it is worth mentioning that the tendency of wages to be low in protected sectors would

seem to fit the model if these wages reflect payments to immobile factors.11 Since low wages are

at least somewhat indicative of immobility, this fact seems broadly consistent with the model. It

would be desirable, however, to study in more detail a model where both a subset of the labor
   9
     Goldberg and Maggi (1999), for example find an insignificant negative relation between import penetration and
protection for sectors that make large campaign contributions and a strong positive relationship for the others.
  10
     Section 201 of the U.S. 1974 Trade Act allowed the International Trade Commission to impose tariffs and quotas
when imports of a product rose substantially as long as the domestic producers of this product could demonstrate
that this caused them “substantial injury”. While the President could reject the commission recommendations for
protection, this triggered a vote in Congress in which a simple majority could override the President.
  11
     Gaston and Trefler (1994) interpret this correlation as suggesting that protection causes low wages. However, it
seems difficult to rule out the opposite direction of causation.

input and capital are immobile so as to learn the conditions under which tariffs are particularly

desirable because they help low-paid workers.

   Returning to the theory, it is worth noting is that the policy of raising P1∗ can be attractive to

workers even if they would be unwilling to make any voluntary contributions to owners of capital

of type 1. A voluntary contribution of this sort would increase the worker’s utility by


                                            −g[f 0w − γf 01 ]


Even if owners of capital of type 1 are poorer than workers (something that is not required for

workers to favor tariffs on good 1), workers would be unwilling to make voluntary contributions to

these owners unless the marginal utility of income of these owners exceeded that of workers by a

factor (1/γ), which is greater than one.

   Even in cases where the redistribution induced by tariffs is more costly, tariffs can be attractive

to workers. To see this, consider the case where tariff revenues are simply lost, as they would be if

altruism did not extend to foreigners and the country signed a voluntary restraint agreement that

gave the quota revenues to foreign producers and governments. This implies that the income of

workers, owners of capital of type 1 and owners of capital of type 2 does not include the last terms

of (7), (10) and (12) respectively.

   Differentiating the resulting expression for V w with respect to P1 and evaluating at P1∗ , one

obtains

          dV w                                      m                           P1∗ (C1 − X1 )

    In this logarithmic case, the number of owners of capital of type 1 plays a crucial role. If this

is large enough, workers benefit from tariffs even if γ is arbitrarily small. The reason is that, with

N1 sufficiently large, the term in brackets has the same sign as

                                                P2∗ X2

    This is necessarily positive because the ratio of imports to national income m must be less than

the ratio of the output of all exportables to national income P2∗ X2 /(P1∗ X1 + P2∗ X2 ).

    So far I have only showed that altruistic workers may prefer tariffs to free trade as a means of

redistribution when no other method of redistribution is available. In many ways this parallels the

argument for tariffs that is based on maximizing a social welfare function. The most important

difference is that the social welfare function that leads to tariffs here is not the result of an arbitrary

aggregation procedure but represents the tastes of the median voter. Interestingly, this focus on

the median voter can lead to relatively high tariffs because this tax has a relatively minor effect on

the median voter’s material payoffs. Still, my approach to tariffs seems vulnerable to a criticism

that is usually applied to rationalizations of tariffs that are based on social welfare functions. This

criticism is that there are better ways to redistribute income than via tariffs. This criticism may well

be empirically valid. However, tariffs do have some attractive features relative to other methods of

redistribution and I show this next.


2    Personal costs of claiming subsidies

In this section I show that linear subsidies to production may be less attractive to workers than

tariffs when there are personal costs associated with claiming one’s entitlement to subsidies. One

central problem with schemes that redistribute income is that they are subject to fraud and abuse.

Individuals and firms seek to benefit from redistributive programs whether they are originally


                                                      15
intended to benefit from them or not. Thus, safeguards must often be taken to ensure that only those

agents which satisfy certain requirements gain access to these programs. One advantage of tariffs

as a redistribution program is that such safeguards are unnecessary, the benefits go automatically

to those who gain from an increase in the price of imported goods. This does not mean that

tariffs involve no administrative costs - indeed they require that borders be patrolled and that

individuals stand ready to inspect cross-border shipments. The difference between tariffs and

direct redistribution is that the intended beneficiaries do not have to incur administrative expenses

in the case of tariffs.

       My formal analysis considers only tariffs and linear subsidies, in part because such comparisons

are carried out in both standard textbooks and in Mayer and Riezman (1987). Before I carry

out this analysis, however, I give some reasons why other types of subsidies may be even more

problematic than linear production subsidies.

       The least distortionary method for increasing the income of owners of capital of type 1 is to

give these individuals a transfer that is independent of their actions. In some cases, this may be

feasible.12 Often, however, it is very difficult to determine how much capital of type 1 an individual

possesses. This is likely to be particularly true when the relevant capital is human capital which is

difficult to employ in alternate activities. It is hard to establish whether an individual who claims

to be unable to produce anything other than goods of a certain type is telling the truth or not.13

       This means that transfers to owners of capital of type 1 must be contingent on having these

agents demonstrate that they are indeed producing goods of type 1. If it is difficult to distinguish

between those agents engaged in the production of good 1 that are mobile and those that are not,

all producers have to be treated symmetrically so that the relevant subsidy must be a subsidy to

all those involved in the production of the good.
  12
      This may be particularly true in the case of agricultural land. However, it is often nontrivial to ascertain the
extent to which a piece of land can be used for certain crops without information on past yields of these crops so that
land subsidies end up depending on the actual use of the land.
   13
      A related difficulty can reduce the desirability of transferring resources from individuals whose total income is
high to individuals whose income is low. In the simple model I consider, any increase in the income of individuals
with low income automatically gives a high vicarious marginal utility to altruists. But one can imagine an extension
where this vicarious marginal utility is low when the individuals whose income is increased are perceived as “lazy”
i.e., are regarded as having low income because of their own choices rather than because their endowment is low.
In such an extension, altruists might well prefer to transfer resources to individuals who demonstrate that they are
stuck in low-paying industries rather than transferring resources to all individuals whose income is low,


                                                          16
       Now suppose that there is an additional difficulty in offering such subsidies. This is that any

owner of type 1 capital that wishes to demonstrate his involvement in the production of good 1

must incur a cost θ. This cost is most easily thought of as the absorption of θ/P2∗ units of good 2.

In addition, let each firm be associated with one (and no more than one) owner of capital of type 1

while, on the other hand, there is no limit to the number of “firms” that an owner of type 1 capital

can establish. Regardless of the number of firms he runs, the total cost he incurs to obtain subsidies

remains θ. This captures the idea that there are exogenous reasons why certain firms producing

import-competing goods are small but that firms can break themselves up into subsidiaries and

still take advantage of their knowledge of the procedure one must follow to collect the government’s

subsidy.

       Under these conditions, the government can effectively only offer incentives that are linear in

the amount produced. To see this, suppose that the government tries to offer a transfer of S to a

small firm and seeks to offer a transfer smaller than nS to a firm that has n times as much capital

of type 1. Then the owner of the larger firm can break his firm up into n firms of equal size and

receive nS. Thus the government has nothing to gain by making the subsidy nonlinear.14

       What is essential in the argument above is that there are economies of scale in demonstrating

that one qualifies for a subsidy. Large firms find it relatively easy to establish systems that demon-

strate their production whereas small firms must make special efforts to distinguish themselves

from agents who seek subsidies by fraudulent means. At the same time, it may well be difficult for

the government to offset this disadvantage of small firms by offering such firms significantly larger

subsidies relative to their sales. The reason is that this encourages larger firms to break themselves

up. The result is that it is impossible to transfer resources to small firms without transferring large

resources to bigger firms. If, instead, one seeks to keep subsidies small, only large firms go through
  14
     Feenstra and Lewis (1994) also consider a model where the government has limited information about producers.
Relative to my model, the information they endow the government with is ampler in some respects and more limited in
others. On the one hand, they suppose the government can condition its transfer to an individual on that individual’s
net trade. Thus individuals cannot decompose their trades into trades carried out by two “firms”. The result is that
the optimal policy they derive differs from a standard (linear) tariff because the marginal price paid or received by an
individual varies with his total purchases. On the other hand, they do not let the government know the endowment
of individuals (which corresponds to a firm’s total output in my model). This second requirement means they do not
really consider conventional production subsidies as an alternative to the policies that they do study. Even so, their
optimal policy has some elements of a subsidy because the marginal subsidy per unit sold for those who sell the good
in question is larger than the marginal tax per unit bought for those who are net buyers.

the trouble of collecting these subsidies.

     I now show this more formally by considering linear subsidies explicitly. With such subsidies,

the price received by firms in sector 1, P̃1 , differs from the price P̂1 paid by consumers. Absent

other policies, the latter is simply equal to the international price P1∗ .

     In this section I suppose that N1` individuals own K1` units of capital of type 1 while N1h own

K1h units. Further, I let

                                                            K1` < K1h

so that owners of K1` are relatively poor.

     Given a fixed cost θ of claiming the subsidy, no producer claims it if (P̃1 − P1∗ ) is sufficiently

small. For a firm owned by an individual who owns K1i to claim the subsidy, it must satisfy

                      max[P̃1 z α (K1i )1−α − W z] − θ ≥ max[P1∗ z α (K1i )1−α − W z]

and analogously for both the amount of good 2 produced and the amount of good 1 produced by

firms that do not claim the subsidy (X1 − X̃1 ).

     Inequality (15) makes it clear that owners of large amounts of K1 apply for the subsidy even

in cases where the subsidy is too small to be attractive to owners of smaller amounts of K1 . Thus,

                                                                  18
as the subsidy is increased from zero, the first ones to apply are firms whose owners have an

endowment of K1h . As more of these owners claim their subsidy, (16) implies that the wage rises

and this hurts all owners of capital. As can be seen from (15) this also tends to discourage further

owners of capital of type 1 from applying for the subsidy. The reason is that firms that collect the

subsidy increase their output but, with higher wages, this increase in output is less profitable.15

       The minimum subsidy such that all owners of K1h apply for the subsidy ensures that (15) holds

with equality when the wage W satisfies (16) with K̃1 equal to N1h K1h . Denoting this minimum

subsidy by ξ h , it is defined implicitly by
                                                                    1       1                   1        1

Note that an increase in ξ h that raises the left hand side by one percent raises the right hand side

by less than α percent. Thus, increases in the right hand side due to changes in other parameters

raise ξ h . In particular, ξ h is zero for θ equal to zero and rises continuously with θ. For much of the

analysis I will consider values of θ that are quite small so that they correspond to small values of

ξh.

       Even if the subsidy is increased slightly beyond ξ h , it is still claimed only by owners of K1h .

There does exist a strictly higher level of subsidy, which I call ξ¯` such that owners of K1` start

requesting the subsidy because they are indifferent between doing so and not doing so. When these

firms start requesting the subsidy, the wage rises (because K̃1 rises) and other owners of K1` are

discouraged from requesting the subsidy. Thus, there is a range of subsidy levels such that some

but not all owners of K1` request the subsidy. Using the logic above, the minimum subsidy at which

all such owners do so, which I denote by ξ ` satisfies
                                                                                1           1

It is worth noting that ξ ` can be large even with θ arbitrarily small as long as K1` is sufficiently

small that θ/K1` is large.

     This effect would presumably continue to be present if some of the workers in the industry were immobile across
industries as well. Thus, workers who are mobile across firms but immobile across sectors might well gain relatively
little from small subsidies.


                                                                19
   To understand the effects of production subsidies on welfare, I suppose that, as in the case of

export subsidies, these are financed by taxes which are levied in proportion to each agent’s income.

As before, these taxes are non-distortionary in this model. Thus, the income of workers is

                   α                                                           α
            Iw =      [P̃1 X̃1 + P1∗ (X1 − X̃1 ) + P2∗ X2 − (P̃1 − P1∗ )X̃1 ] = [P1∗ X1 + P2∗ X2 ].   (20)
                   L̄                                                          L̄

This implies immediately that a subsidy of ξ h must reduce the utility of workers relative to a

zero subsidy. The reason is that workers do not gain any material welfare from such a change.

Moreover, all owners of capital lose because such a subsidy raises wages. This loss due to high

wages is experienced even by those who are indifferent between claiming and not claiming the

subsidy, namely the owners of K1h . Thus, only subsidies above ξ h have the potential for increasing

worker utility.

   If θ is sufficiently small, ξ h is small as well which means that the derivative of worker’s material

welfare with respect to P̃1 remains close to zero when the subsidy equals ξ h . I now consider the

effect on the owners of capital. The income of owners of K2 equals
                                                                                         !

   Let X1h and X1` denote the aggregate amounts of good 1 produced by owners of K1h and K1`

respectively. For subsidies between ξ h and ξ¯` , X̃1 is equal to X1h . Thus, the income of those who

own K1` units of capital of type 1 is

     When the subsidy is between ξ h and ξ¯` , equations (22) and (23) together with (17) imply that

the changes in income for the three types of owners of capital are

                         =                                      +                    .
                  Ih + θ   1 − α P̃1 X1h + P1∗ X1` + P2∗ X2 P̃1   P1∗ X1 + P2∗ X2
     If θ is small (so ξ h is too) one can approximate these changes in income by evaluating these

derivatives at the point where P̃1 is equal to P1∗ and θ is zero. This means that the last term in both

equations can be ignored. The (right) derivative of worker utility at ξ h can then be approximated

as
                          γg P1∗ X1h P1∗ X1` (f 0h − f 0` ) + P1∗ X1h P2∗ X2 (f 0h − f 02 ) dP̃1
                 dΩw ≈                                                                           .    (26)
                         1−α                       P1∗ X1 + P2∗ X2                          P1∗
     For this to be positive, the marginal utility of income of owners of K1h must be higher than

at least one of the other capital owners’ marginal utility of income. Thus (26) is negative for K1h

sufficiently high even if good 1 is imported and the total value of its output is significantly lower

than the value of the production of good 2. If good 1 is produced by a few large producers and a

great many small producers, a small subsidy is not attractive to workers. The importance of the

number of small producers becomes even clearer in the case where f is logarithmic. The change in

worker utility from an increase in P̃1 evaluated at P1∗ is then

                               γ  N1h (P1∗ X1` + P2∗ X2 ) − (N1` + N2 )P1∗ X1h dP̃1
                      dΩw =                                                                           (27)

which is negative if N1` is large enough.

     If dΩw /dP̃1 < 0 for small P̃1 , a higher value of P̃1∗ cannot make the expression on the right

hand side of (26) positive since it reduces f 0h relative to f 0` and f 02 . Moreover, with a higher value

of P̃1 , increases in the subsidy also lower the value of national output evaluated at world prices

(P1∗ X1 + P2∗ X2 ). This has the effect of reducing the material payoffs of all agents. It follows that, if

the parameters are such that small increase in the subsidy above ξ h lowers worker utility, increases

in the subsidy until it equals ξ¯` are also unattractive to workers.

                                                       21
   The same is true for increases in the subsidy from ξ¯` to ξ ` . These may be good for owners of

K1h units of capital but make owners of K1` worse off. These are now indifferent between claiming

and not claiming the subsidy but the increase wage that results from the fact that some of these

owners claim the subsidy makes all such owners worse off.

   I now turn to the effects of raising the subsidy beyond ξ ` . When the subsidy is so large that all

owners of capital of type 1 claim it, X̃1 is equal to X1 and K̃1 is equal to K1 . Thus, differentiating

(21), (24) and (25), one obtains

                         dI 2     1        P̃1 X1     dP̃1 d(P1∗ X1 + P2∗ X2 )

   The expression      P1∗     is at least equal to ξ ` /P1∗ . This means that, the material payoffs of owners

of capital of type 1 decline when the subsidy is increased beyond ξ ` if ξ ` is sufficiently large. A

sufficient condition for this to occur is

where the quantities on the right hand side are those that would prevail at international prices. The

reason (30) is sufficient to ensure that the bracketed expression in (29) is negative is that increases

in P̃1 raise X1 relative to X2 thereby lowering the value of the expression in brackets. Increases

in subsidies can actually hurt owners of capital of type 1 because, when subsidies are already very

high, further increases lead to such large declines in the value of output measured at international

prices that these offset the gain in the share of income that goes to owners of capital of type 1.

If the income of all owners of type 1 capital declines with increased subsidies, workers would not

favor such subsidies. So, high values of K1h and ξ ` are sufficient for both small and large subsidies

to be politically unattractive.

   I now turn to the question of whether tariffs would be equally unattractive if they were subject

to the same overall administrative costs. To study this question I assume that any nonzero tariff

requires the expenditure of N1 θ in administrative costs. Again, this is most easily thought of as

involving the absorption of N1 θ/P2∗ units of good 2. Unlike in the case of subsidies, these costs

need not impinge disproportionately on those who are being favored by the policy. Rather, they

can be thought of as involving expenditure by the government which is financed with tariff revenue

or by lump sum taxes. In the presence of such expenditures, and supposing that tariffs are strictly

positive so that P1 > P1∗ , (7), (10) and (12) become

where z = K1h /K1 . Thus tariffs remain attractive as long as a weighted average of the marginal

utilities of producers of good 1 is higher than the marginal utility of producers of good 2. It should


                                                      23
be clear that if f 0` and ξ ` are sufficiently high, tariffs can be attractive to workers even when small

subsidies are not. The reason is that small tariffs transfer resources to small producers of good

1 while small subsidies do not. What is more, the same force that makes f 0` high, namely the

poverty of the small producers of good 1, also makes ξ ` high because it implies that the fixed costs

of claiming a subsidy loom large for these producers. Thus, a key force that makes tariffs attractive,

renders subsidies unattractive.

   The limiting cases where one can be sure that tariffs dominate subsidies are particularly clear

when f is logarithmic. In this case, the workers’ utility gain from small tariffs is

                       N1 θ[1 + γ(L̄ − 1) + γ(N1 + N2 )] γ(N1 P2∗ X2 − N2 P1∗ X1 ) dP1

                                P1∗ X1 + P2∗ X2           (1 − α)(P1∗ X1 + P2∗ X2 ) P1∗

   Fix N1` to a large positive value so that the second term in (39) is positive while (27) is negative.

There is then a value of θ low enough so that workers gain utility from a strictly positive tariff while

they gain nothing from small subsidies if owners of K1` do not take advantage of them. For this θ,

a low enough value of K1` (and a correspondingly high value of K1h ) ensures that ξ ` is arbitrarily

large, so that it satisfies (30). This means not only that owners of K1` do not claim small subsidies

but that the only subsidies that these owners claim are high enough that increases in subsidies

beyond ξ ` actually reduce their income. It is worth noting that, as one reduces K1` to raise the

value of ξ ` , the number of owners of K1` rises so that (27) implies that one is also reducing the

extent to which workers find small subsidies desirable.

   So far I have presented sufficient conditions for voter to prefer tariffs to subsidies. These

sufficient conditions are far from necessary, however. In particular, comparing (26) and (38) it is

apparent that once the costs θN1 have been paid for, small increases in tariffs are actually better for

workers than small increases in partial subsidies. Thus, it is possible that positive tariffs are simply

more desirable than the best possible partial subsidy even under conditions that make this partial

subsidy better than free trade. Similarly, the globally most preferred tariff can be more attractive

to workers than the globally most preferred subsidy even if small increases in subsidies beyond ξ `

make workers better off. The reason is that the subsidy of ξ ` can itself be quite costly and the

marginal benefits of increasing subsidies beyond ξ ` can be quite low even if they are positive.


                                                   24
   Carrying out such a global analysis is difficult in general and I have thus pursued some numerical

experiments under the assumption that f is logarithmic while


                                        g(P̂1 , P̂2 ) = P̂1−β P̂2β−1


so that the demand functions are the same as those from a Cobb-Douglas utility function. The

advantage of focusing on this case is that it leads to very simple expressions for income even in the

case of tariffs. In particular, aggregate consumption of good 1 is then


                         P̂1 C1 = β[P̂1 X1 + P2∗ X2 − (P̂1 − P1∗ )(C1 − X1 )]
                                                                   P̂1
                                = β(P1∗ X1 + P2∗ X2 )                           .                 (40)
                                                          βP1∗   + (1 − β)P̂1

   This expression can be plugged into (31), (32), (33) and (12) to obtain the incomes of all four

types of agents once one knows X1h , X1` and X2 as a function of P̂1 . Since these output levels can

be computed from (4), computing the level of utility of workers is straightforward. In the case of

subsidies, the outputs can be obtained from (17) after using the cutoffs (18) and (19) to determine

which agents collect subsidies. The income levels I w , I h , I ` and I 2 can then be obtained directly

from (20), (23) or (24), (22) or (25) and (21).

   Consider then a situation where α = β = .5 while P1∗ = P2∗ = 1. There are 20 workers and

10 owners of capital of type 2, each of which owns 3 units of capital. The total endowment of

K1 is only 6 but 2 individuals have 2.1 units each while an additional 18 individuals each have an

endowment of K1` = .1. Finally, I let the altruism parameter γ equal .01 and θ equal .05. This

means that the owners of K1` do not collect subsidies until P̃1 equals 1.56. Because there are so few

owners of K1h , lower subsidies actually provide less utility to workers than free trade (which gives

them a utility of -.9851). As subsidies are increased beyond 60%, utility rises, but even the best

such subsidy (which is around 122%) is worse than free trade. By contrast, the best possible tariff

for workers equals a more modest 46% and this increases worker utility above its free trade level

(to -.9750).

   If all other parameters are kept constant but θ is lowered to .04, the optimal tariff for workers

remains the same but total utility at this tariff is now -.9648. Owners of K1` start applying for the


                                                    25
subsidy when it equals 48%, though of course they don’t benefit from the subsidy program until

subsidies are somewhat higher. The best production subsidy from the point of view of workers

equals 114% and gives them a utility of -.9662. This is larger than the utility under free trade but

is not as high as the utility under the best tariff. Further reductions in θ ultimately lead subsidies

to dominate tariffs, as one would expect. In particular, if θ is lowered to .03, the best subsidy

(124%) actually gives workers more utility than the 46% tariff.


3     Lobbying and Campaign Contribution

I now present an extremely simplified and incomplete model of representative voting for trade

policy in which tariffs play the same role as they do in the previous sections. While the model is

crude, it fits with some of the most interesting observations concerning lobbying for changes in the

commercial policy of the United States. In their extensive study on the subject, Bauer, Pool and

Dexter (1963) report that lobbyists who favor protection mostly lobby those representatives who

already favor protection in the first place. On p. 442 they say, for example, “... lobbyists tended

to establish liaison only with the congressmen and senators on their own side.”16

    The evidence also suggests that campaign contributions tend to flow to representatives whose

ideological positions are close to those of donor individuals and political action committees. This

evidence can be found, for example in Kau, Keenan and Rubin (1982) and Baldwin and Magee

(1998). This does not mean that contributors expect nothing in return for their contribution. On

the contrary, Snyder (1992) provides compelling indirect evidence that many contributors invest in

politicians with the expectation of receiving services from them. In particular, it is often claimed

that contributors buy “access”, i.e., the opportunity to make presentations on particular policies.

Sabato (1985, p. 127) for example says “PAC officials are adamant that all they get for their
   16
      Several other studies have reached similar conclusions. By contrast, Austen-Smith and Wright (1994) report that,
in the case of the Judge Bork’s nomination for the Supreme Court, lobbying was more even-handed with a great deal
of lobbying activity directed at representatives who help opposite prior positions than the lobbyists. They also provide
an interesting model of this type of lobbying. The question of why these different settings elicit different lobbying
activities seems quite interesting in its own right. One difference may be that, in the case of trade, the opponents
of protection are not generally experts in the industry in question so that they prefer not to engage in arguments
having to do with the plight of those employed in import-competing sectors. Rather they prefer to champion free
trade by pointing to the benefits that it brings. By contrast, the factual knowledge of proponents and opponents of
a particular judicial nomination may be much more similar.



                                                          26
investment is access to congressmen - a chance to ’tell their story’. Political analysts have long

agreed that access is the principal goal of most interest groups, and lobbyists have always recognized

that access is the key to persuasion.”

       An alternative view is that contributors buy more not only access but also votes so that pro-

tection is “for sale.” It might be thought that this hypothesis is particularly plausible given that

Baldwin and Magee (1998) show that legislators tend to vote in the direction desired by those

individuals from whom they receive substantial contributions. Nonetheless, I now show that the

association of contributions, lobbying activity and legislative votes is consistent with a quite benign

interpretation. For this purpose, I construct a very stylized model of incomplete information.

       I suppose that all legislators are uncertain about the parameter Z such that the total number

of owners of capital of type 1 equals (1 + Z). In particular, they are unsure whether Z equals Z H or

Z L with Z H > Z L . Legislators do know the parameters of the model including the administrative

costs of tariffs (which I treat as independent of Z)17 , the total amount produced of both goods and

also the aggregate amount of K1 and K2 . They also know that one owner of K1 owns K1s which is

much higher than the endowment of all other owners of capital of type 1. The other Z owners all

own (K1 − K1s )/Z so that uncertainty about Z translates also into uncertainty about the wealth of

the other owners of K1 .

       I suppose that there are three legislators who differ in their tastes. One legislator has an

expected utility function which, under certainty, is identical to the utility of workers (13). Under

uncertainty about Z, this utility function is


                 Ωn = [1 + γ(L̄ − 1)]V w + γ{V s + Qn Z H V H + (1 − Qn )Z L V L + N2 V 2 }                 (41)


where Qn is this legislator’s subjective probability that Z equals Z H , V s represents the material

payoffs of the individual with endowment K1s while V H and V L represent the material payoffs of the

other owners of good 1 if their endowment equals (K1 − K1s )/Z H and (K1 − K1s )/Z L respectively.

       The other two legislators are either more or less favorable to the protection of producers of good
  17
   This is intuitively appealing as the administrative costs involve border controls which are independent of the
number of producers affected. It does mean that, notationally, I am holding N1 θ constant in this section.




                                                       27
1. In particular, I suppose that there is a liberalization-biased legislator whose utility is given by

          Ωa = [1 + γ(L̄ − 1)]V w + γ{V 1s + Qa Z H V H + (1 − Qa )Z L V L + [1 + B]N2 V 2 }            (42)

and a protection-biased legislator with utility

          Ωb = [1 + γ(L̄ − 1)]V w + γ{V 1s + [1 + B][Qb Z H V H + (1 − Qb )Z L V L ] + N2 V 2 }         (43)

where the bias B is strictly positive while Qa and Qb represent, respectively, the liberalization and

the protection-biased legislator’s subjective probabilities that Z equals Z H .

   This is a simple way of capturing differences in legislative tastes. In a more complete model,

one might be able to derive this heterogeneity in the desires of legislators from heterogeneity in the

composition of voters. For example, the more extreme legislators might be representing districts

with either a disproportionately large or a disproportionately small number of producers of good 1.

This fits with Baldwin’s (1985) evidence that legislators from districts with disproportionately high

employment in “import-sensitive” sectors are more predisposed to vote against trade liberalization.

While Baldwin (1985 p. 176) sees this as evidence that “political pressures exerted on government

officials by common-interest groups affect political behavior on trade policy issues” it might also be

the result of “local altruism” in which voters care more about the welfare of their near neighbors

than they care about the welfare of people who live farther away.

   In this section I only consider tariffs so that P1 = P̂1 = P̃1 . Thus, for fixed model parameters

and total levels of the two endowments, the welfare of legislator i depends only on P1 and his

assessment of the likelihood of Z h , Qi . I therefore write these welfare levels as functions Ωi (P1 , Qi ).

   The results from section 2 imply that, if P1 is slightly above P1∗ and administrative costs are

small,

           Ωb (P1 , Q) − Ωb (P1∗ , Q) > Ωn (P1 , Q) − Ωn (P1∗ , Q) > Ωa (P1 , Q) − Ωa (P1∗ , Q).        (44)

This follows directly from the fact that the material welfare of owners of capital of type 1 increases

with P1 so that putting increased weight on this material welfare makes tariffs more attractive.

   The analysis of section 3 implies that if, in addition Q0 > Q00 and the administrative costs are

small

               Ωi (P1 , Q0 ) − Ωi (P1∗ , Q0 ) > Ωi (P1 , Q00 ) − Ωi (P1∗ , Q00 )   i = a, b.n           (45)

                                                         28
   To see this, it must be noted first that, for P1 close to P1∗ , (35) and (37) continue to describe

the percentage changes in the income of workers and of owners of K2 . Similarly, (36) continues to

give the percentage change in the income of owners of capital of type 1, whether they hold K1s ,

(K1 − K1s )/Z H or (K1 − K1s )/Z L . This means that, ignoring the administrative costs, the analysis

that gives (38) now gives

                      γgP1∗ X1 P2∗ X2      
                                                0s            n 0H         n 0L       02 dP1

         dΩn =                               zf    + (1 − z)[Q f   + (1 − Q )f  ] − f               (46)
                 (1 − α)(P1∗ X1 + P2∗ X2 )                                                P1

where f 0s , f 0H and f 0L represent, respectively, the derivatives of f with respect to its argument for

owners of K1s , for owners of (K1 − K1s )/Z H and for owners of (K1 − K1s )/Z L . Because Z H > Z L ,

f 0H > f 0L so that increases in Qn raises the expression in (46). The analysis for Ωb and Ωa is

identical. Intuitively, the reason (45) holds is that a higher level of Z H means that there are more

owners of capital of type 1 so that their typical holding is smaller. This means that they are poorer

and that the altruistic legislators gains more utility from transferring resources to them.

   I now suppose that the owner of K1s units of K1 can try to lobby legislators. Lobbying involves

the transmission of verifiable information about τ binary variables. The assumption that the

information is verifiable is critical for what follows. Examples of verifiable information can include

information that is contained in documents produced by third parties or testimony by credible

witnesses.

   I suppose that, in addition, the transmission of any one of these variables requires time and that,

as is often stated in the qualitative literature, legislators’ time is extremely valuable to them. A

legislator who receives information about τ variables thus incurs a cost of cτ . As stressed in Bauer,

Pool and Dexter (1963) this opportunity cost of the time of legislators arises because legislators can

also use their time either to raise funds directly or to acquire other kinds of information, including

information on how to get reelected. To simplify, I suppose that these costs are in the same units

as both the income of the legislators and the welfare functions (41), (42) and (43).

   While I suppose that it is costly for legislators to acquire information, I assume they can cost-

lessly transmit a subset of this information to other legislators. In particular, I imagine that, when

legislators make speeches in their legislative chambers, they can costlessly and credibly transmit


                                                   29
the information they have received from lobbyists on one binary variable. This captures the idea

that legislators who worry about an issue by discussing it with lobbyists learn a great deal more

about the issue than those who do not, even though the latter do learn something from listening

to their colleagues.

    Thus, legislators can be thought of as filters of information: they receive a large numbers of

bits of information from lobbyists and let one through. The social value of this filtering function

stems from its ability to reduce the resources that legislative bodies require to absorb information.

I capture this value by focusing on an extreme example, though this value would obviously remain

under much weaker assumptions. In the extreme example I consider, only one of the τ binary

variables has any chance of being informative to all legislators. Legislators recognize an informative

realization of a variable when they hear it but lobbyists do not know which, if any, realization of the

variables they transmit will prove informative (either because they do not know what legislators

know or because they do not know the “model” that legislators use to process the data they

receive).18

    What lobbyists do know is that there is a probability λ that one of the τ variables they transmit

raises the subjective Qi of the legislator who learns about it from Q to Q1 . This means that the

hearing of the τ variables has a probability (1 − λ) of lowering the Qi of the legislator who hears

them from Q to Q0 where

                                              λQ1 + (1 − λ)Q0 = Q.

It does not matter for the analysis whether this reduction in Qi results from the existence of a

single variable that lowers this subjective probability or whether the absence of any variable that

raises Qi to Q1 is sufficient to lower the legislator’s assessment to Q0 .

    I now consider an extensive form game with the following sequence of moves. First, the owner

of K1s decides whether to offer a contribution of size r (which he chooses) to a particular legislator
   18
      One can imagine that lobbyists have already suppressed information that they regard as obviously unfavorable
to their cause so they transmit only information that has a chance to be favorable. What they do not know, however,
is the extent to which the favorable data points they transmit are in fact persuasive. An alternative interpretation is
that, once lobbyists visit legislators, the latter are allowed to ask questions that expose further credible information.
One can then interpret the binary signals I consider as combinations of bits of information such that the lobbyist is
unsure how legislators will react to the particular combinations that he finds in practice.

in exchange for hearing out his information on the τ binary variables.19 The legislator then accepts

or rejects this offer. If he rejects it, the game proceeds to the voting stage. If he accepts it, the

legislator then has the opportunity of transmitting one of these bits of information to the other

legislators. The voting stage with which the game ends involves a vote among the three legislators

between setting P1 to the free trade level of P1∗ or setting it to a higher level P1∗ + t.20

       The most important property of the equilibrium of this game is that, under certain circum-

stances, the owner of K1s does find it profitable to spend resources lobbying. When he does so, he

lobbies the legislator most favorable to protection and this can indeed result in an increase in tariffs.

While this combination of contributions, lobbying and voting for protection may seem suspicious,

workers desire this tariff increase.

       For the setting to be interesting, it must be the case that,


            Ωn (P1∗ , Q) > Ωn (P1∗ + t, Q)               and            Ωn (P1∗ , Q1 ) < Ωn (P1∗ + t, Q1 )


so that the neutral legislator prefers free trade with no information while he prefers the positive

tariff when he receives information that raises his assessment of the likelihood of Z H .

       I solve the game backwards starting with the voting stage. If, at this stage Qn and Qb equal

Q1 , both the neutral and the protection-biased legislator vote for setting P1 equal to P1∗ + t and

the tariff passes regardless of the views of the legislator biased against tariffs. If Qa and Qn remain

equal to Q because no information is revealed to them, or if one or more of these probabilities

becomes equal to Q0 , the neutral and the anti-protection-biased legislators vote for free trade and

this passes regardless of the information available to the protection-biased legislator.

       I now turn to the stage where a legislator with information chooses whether to reveal this

information to others. If either the neutral or the protection-biased legislator have information

that raises their Qi to Q1 , they reveal it because they both prefer the outcome with positive tariffs

in this case and they ensure this outcome by revealing the information. If the liberalization-biased
  19
      An obvious variant of this model would be to allow the number of binary variables that are transmitted to vary.
It might be attractive, for example, to stop transmitting variables as soon as the lobbyist has transmitted the one
variable which is informative. This raises the complication of modeling the process by which it becomes common
knowledge that a variable that the lobbyist has transmitted is indeed informative.
   20
      One could also consider an agenda setting stage where the tariff is chosen optimally but this does not seem central
to the issues considered here.


                                                           31
legislator has this information, he may or may not reveal it depending on whether Ωa (P1∗ + t, Q1 ) >

Ωa (P1∗ , Q1 ). If either the neutral or the protection-biased legislator has information that lowers

their Qi to Q0 , it does not matter whether they reveal it or not, as free trade passes in equilibrium.

   Given this pattern of information revelation, one can ask for the value to each legislator of

hearing the N bits of information from the owner of K1s under the assumption that, if he does

not listen to this information himself, no other legislator will. Using the same superscripts as for

Ω, I denote these values by ψ i . Consider first the neutral and the protection-biased legislators.

If hearing the lobbyist leads them to update their Qi so that it equals Q0 , the outcome does not

change. Thus, the only benefit of hearing the lobbyist arises when this leads Qi to be equal to Q1 .

Hence,

                       ψ i = λ[Ωi (P1∗ + t, Q1 ) − Ωi (P1∗ , Q1 )] − cτ        i = n, b.

   If i is replaced by a, the first term in this expression would be negative if the liberalization-

biased legislator prefers free trade even when Qa = Q1 . He would then withhold this information

from the other legislators. Thus

                        ψ a = max{0, λ[Ωa (P1∗ + t, Q1 ) − Ωa (P1∗ , Q1 )]} − cτ

   The inequalities in (44) then imply immediately that

                                               ψb > ψn > ψa                                       (47)

   Now consider the owner of K1s . His income I s is given by the formula for I h in (32) with K1h

replaced by K1s . This income depends on P1 both directly as well as through the dependence of

X1 , X2 and C1 on P1 . I thus use the function I s (P1 ) to describe how this income varies when,

holding constant the total endowments of K1 and K2 and keeping the price of good 2 equal to P2∗ ,

P1 varies together with the production and consumption of both goods. This means that the gains

to this individual from raising the domestic price from P1∗ to P1∗ + t equal Gs where

                      Gs = V (g(P1∗ + t, P2∗ )I s (P1∗ + t)) − V (g(P1∗ , P2∗ )I s (P1∗ ))

Since the percentage change in I s for a small tariff is given by (36), Gs is positive if θ and t are

small.

                                                      32
   This owner’s actions depend on the levels of ψ b and ψ n as well as on the relationship between

Gs and ψ b . Take first the case where ψ b < −Gs < 0. The lobbyist is then unwilling to make the

smallest contribution that gets a legislator to hear his τ variables. He thus makes no contribution

and free trade passes in equilibrium.

   Now suppose Gs > −ψ b > 0. Then, the owner of K1s makes a contribution of r = −ψ b to

the legislator who is biased for protection in exchange for having him listen to his τ informational

variables. By doing so he gains Gs + ψ b relative to not lobbying at all and this is positive. The

neutral legislator requires a larger campaign contribution to listen to these informational variables

and this makes him a less attractive lobbying target.

   Third, consider the case where ψ b > 0 > ψ n . In this case, the legislator who is biased towards

protection is willing to listen to the τ informational variables even if the owner of K1s makes no

campaign contributions. By contrast, the neutral legislator would require a campaign contribution

to do so. Thus, the owner of K1s chooses to make no campaign contribution and lobbies the

legislator most favorable to his case. The existence of this case is consistent with the fact that a

great deal of lobbying involves no campaign contributions even when it is directed at legislators

who are favorably predisposed towards the policy outcomes desired by those who lobby them.

   Lastly, in the case where ψ n is positive as well, even the neutral legislator is willing to listen to

the owner of K1s . Therefore the model makes no prediction as to which legislator is lobbied in this

case. The strongest prediction of the model is thus that, when campaign contributions are coupled

with lobbying (so that they buy access), they are directed at favorable legislators.

   What is missing from the model is a rationale for why many different representatives would

receive contributions from the same self-interested constituencies. One extension of the model that

might account for this is to suppose that representatives only succeed in transmitting information

to other representatives with a probability that is smaller than than one. Contributors might then

make payments to several representatives to increase the likelihood that the relevant information

reaches undecided legislators.

   It is not clear, however, that such a model can explain the rather large fraction of representa-

tives that appear to receive substantial contributions from farm lobbies in Stratmann (1992). In


                                                  33
his statistical study, large contributions are predicted to flow (in about equal magnitude) to all rep-

resentatives whose rural population is above some cutoff proportion of the population. Somewhat

less than 50% of legislators are predicted to receive these large contributions in his study, and this

suggests that there is a role for the sort of persuasion that I consider in my model. More impor-

tantly, his study amalgamates the contributions of all farm PAC’s into a single variable. It is thus

possible that substantially fewer representatives are receiving contributions from the constituency

for any particular type of farm legislation.


4    Conclusions

This paper has presented a benign theory to explain the existence of policies that are biased against

international trade. In this theory, commercial policy arises because it is exactly what the altruistic

median voter wants. This voter takes into account the relevant efficiency losses but simply puts

more weight on the distributional gains. This is to be contrasted with the more standard, and more

pessimistic, view expressed for example in Mayer (1984) and Grossman and Helpman (1994). In

this view, tariffs would be opposed by the majority if the majority bothered to cast a vote so that

tariffs emerge only because interested minorities are able to capture the political process.

    One reason to be interested in the more optimistic view I present is that it ought to lead to

sharper tests of the more standard view by providing an alternative that fits at least some of

the known facts about commercial policy. A second advantage of the theory is that it provides

an explanation for the kinds of arguments that are used in lobbying for protection. A common

argument that is used for this purpose is that there exist some individuals who would suffer greatly if

the tariff were not imposed. Interestingly, this argument is used even when it can be demonstrated

that the vast majority of the benefits of protection flow to a few relatively rich individuals (as

Johnson (1974) shows to be true in the case of the U.S. sugar program). My paper shows that the

argument can be compelling nonetheless since tariffs that generate such uneven benefits may be

better than subsidies at redistributing income in ways that the median voter desires.

    An issue that deserves further work is the evolution of tariffs in dynamic versions of this model.

This is particularly interesting in light of the analyses of Mayer (1974) and Mussa (1974). They


                                                  34
treat the specific factors model I consider as a short run model and suggest, quite plausibly, that the

specific factors reallocate themselves in the long run in response to differences in factor rewards.

The endogenous tariffs that I analyze presumably slow down this adjustment, as they raise the

rewards to the specific factor whose income is lower. On the other hand, these endogenous tariffs

do not in general equalize rewards across sectors. This means that factors may continue to reallocate

themselves even in the presence of altruistic voters and that the long run equilibrium may be the

same with and without endogenous protection.
