                     Money and the Terms of Trade



                               ABSTRACT



     This paper examines the connection between money and the terms of

trade in the context of a simple monetary equilibrium model with flexible

prices. Money is held for transactions purposes. Because carrying out

financial transactions is costly, households visit their financial inter-

mediaries only occasionally. An important feature of the model is that

different households visit the financial intermediaries at different times.

This is sufficient to ensure that even though the model features perfect

foresight and competitive markets, monetary policies affect output under

both fixed and flexible exchange rates. Moreover, in the latter regime

expansionary monetary policies tend to worsen the terms of trade while

this is not the case under fixed exchange rates.

I Introduction



       This paper studies the connection between money and the terms of

trade in the context of a simple monetary general equilibrium model with

flexible prices. In this model money is held for transactions purposes. As in the

models of Baumol (1.952) Tobin (1956) and Helpman and Razin (1982) but in contrast

to the open economy model of Stockman (1980) households are allowed to hold

interest bearing capital in addition to barren money. In fact their

portfolio includes claims on both foreign and domestic capital.

Households pick consumption paths which maximize their utility. Because

it is costly to carry out financial transactions they engage in these

transactions only sporadically. However households are not allowed to

time these transactions optimally. Instead, for tractability, I assume

the length of the period during which no financial transactions are

carried out is constant.

       However, as in the models of Grossman and Weiss (1982) and Rotemberg

(1982) as well as in all actual free market economies, different people

visit their financial intermediaries at different times. This assumption

is crucial to make monetary policy affect the terms of trade. This

occurs even though the model features competitive markets and perfect

foresight. In this model, under flexible exchange rates, as long as the

technologies in the two countries are similar expansionary open market

operations tend to worsen the terms of trade. This, as can be seen In

Branson (1979), is also true in the simple textbook models with capital

mobility. However, it stands in sharp contrast to the neutralities
                                    —2—


reported by Stockman (1980), lielpuian and Razin (1982), and, for the money in the

utility function model, by Obstfeld (1981). This non—neutrality can be explained as

follows. When money increases in the home country, it tends to raise

prices at home. This reduces the purchasing power of the money held by

those households who visited their financial intermediary in the past.

Since these households can't reschedule their financial transactions,

they must reduce their current consumption. As long as local households

are keener on the consumption of domestic goods than their foreign

counterparts this reduction In consumption is translated into a

larger excess supply of domestic goods than of foreign goods. This,

in turn, worsens the terms of trade.

       On the other hand, under fixed exchange rates the terms of trade

are unaffected by open market operations since these change the monetary

holdings of the whole world's residents.

       The paper is organized as follows: Section II presents the

model while Section III derives Its equilibrium. The effects of

monetary policy under flexible exchange rates are presented in Section IV

while those which prevail under fixed exchange rates are discussed

in Section V. Section VI presents some conclusions.

II The Model



         The model is basically a two country version of the model which

is presented in more detail in Rotemberg (1982). Competitive firms in

the home country produce good 1 while those of the foreign country produce

good 2. Total output of good i at t depends, via a constant returns to

scale production function on the amount of labor hired in the relevant

country at t and on the amount of good i invested at t — 1.      To abstract

from imports of intermediaries only the local good is used in the local

production of goods. Since an amount of labor which is normalized to

equal one is supplied inelastically in both countries,



                        =
                               t—i               I = 1,2             (1)




where       is output of good i at t, K.    is the amount of good i
                                           t—l
Invested at t—l while the f1 are increasing and concave functions.
Workers are assumed to be paid their marginal product. Therefore the
total   amount of good I at t obtained from investing one unit

of good i at t—1 is f(K1 t—l where primes denote first derivatives.

        There Is an even number of households in each country. At

time t households in the home country are assumed to maximize the utility

functIon given by:



                  v =   r        [ctln CT + (1—cL) in C]            (2)




where      and C are the consumptions by household j at t of goods 1

and 2 respectively while c and p are parameters between zero and one.
                                     —4—

Instead the residents of the foreign country maximize the utility function

given by


                             T—t
                    =
                        Tt         [ in C + (l—) in C]             (3)




where C and C are the consumptions at T of household j     while
Is a parameter between zero and one.

       The households at home have access to three assets, home money

and claims on both capitals. There is thus perfect capital mobility.

Local money is the only means of local exchange. Since money of the

foreign country is rate of return dominated by foreign capital and cannot

be used to carry out transactions in the home country it will never be

held at home. Visits to the financial intermediary for the purpose of

converting claims on capital into money are costly. Therefore, as in the

models of Bauniol (1952) and Tobin (1956), households find it optimal to

visit their intermediaries only sporadically. As in Rotemberg (1982)

I assume that households exchange capitals for money every two periods.

The assumption that the timing of household's financial transactions is

unresponsive to events is made f or tractability. Except in stationary

environments, the optimal timing of financial transactions is extremely

difficult to find when households pick their consumption optimally.

       Without loss of generality consider a household who engages in

financial transactions at T, At this time it withdraws an amount

of money balances. For simplicity I assume that wages are received in

the form of claims on capital. Moreover, since money is rate of return

dominated there is no reason for a household who withdraws money at T

to carry money over until period T+2. Thus,     must be equal to total

expenditures at T and T+l:

                                                                  CT
                                                              2T+l 2T+i
                                                                        —
                                                                            T         (4)




where iT is the home price of good i at T while CT and CT+l are the

consumptions of good i at T and T+l of a household that visits the financial

intermediary at T.

       Once the household has picked optimally the sequence of monetary

withdrawals it must choose consumption at T and T+i to maximize:



      ct ln C + (1—ct) in CT + p a in CT+l + pCi—ct) in CT+l



subject to (4). This yields:


                                  T               T
                        —   P1C1          _,P1T+1C1T+l
                              T                   T
                 1—ct P2C2                     P2+1C21+i

and




                 PP1TC1T              =    1                                    (7)
                     1T+1 C1T+l

                          T       T+2
The relationship between CIT and CIT+2 can be obtained by a simple

perturbation argument. These are the consuxnptions at two consecutive

dates in which the household visits the financial intermediary.

Hence the household shouldn't be able to make itself better off by con-

suming one unit less of good i at T, investing it in claims on capital of

industry i, reinvesting the proceeds at T+l in similar claims and con—

suming the proceeds at T+2. The reverse transaction also should not
                                              —6—

increase utility. Hence:



                     2T
                    P C.                               =

                                                           1   1 =   1,2   (8)

                     CjT+2



These relationships which state that the product of the marginal rate

of substitution between consumption in two periods times the return from

holding an asset between the periods is equal to one have been derived by

many authors including Grossman and Shiller (1981) and Hansen and

Singleton (1981).

        It is easy to verify that suitably modified versions of equations

(6) —   (8) hold for the foreign country as well. In particular:


                                       *

                         IT+2


where P is the price of good i at T in the foreign country's currency

while CIT+l is the consumption of good I at T+1 by a household of the

foreign country who visits his intermediary at T.

           Costs of transporting goods between countries as well as tariffs

and other trade barriers are neglected. Therefore, the relative price

of the two goods at T (or terms of trade) must be the same in both

countries. In particular let R denote the number of units of good 2

one can buy with one unit of good 1. Then;


                                                         *
                                   P                P
                              —        lT    —           1T

                                                         2T


Note that dividing (8) by (8') one obtains that:



                     T                  T+2
                    CiT
                               =                                    1=1,2         (9)
                        T*              T+2*
                    C.                 C.
                        iT              1T+2

But, since the terms of trade are the same in both countrie (6) and

(6') imply that:



                        T
                                   CiT                                    (l—a)
                        T
                              —
                                     T*       '     "
                                                 I •4'                —
                                                                          (l—)    (lO
                                                                                    -'
                    C               C
                        2'r             2T

Therefore, if CT/C* is equal to kTthen CT/CT is equal to

Moreover (9) implies that kT is equal to some constant, say ke for

r   even   and to another constant k for T odd. The k's themselves are
                                                    0
determined    by the relative wealths of the residents of the home and

foreign countries. Loosely speaking (9) and (10) state that the

consurnptions of the residents of the two nations are proportional, The

factor of proportionality thus depends on which country is richer.
                                     —8—

This fact is illustrated in the Appendix. In the remainder of the paper

I assume for simplicity that ke and k0 are equal to k and I neglect the

effects of monetary policy on these k's. Stockman (1980) also ignores

these effects.

       The intermediaries in both countries hold in the name of the house-

holds the private sectors' claims on the two capitals. In addition the

intermediaries are allowed to issue a certain quantity of money. In

particular, the monetary liabilities of the home country's intermediaries

between T and T+1 must be equal to the quantity of outside money (or

deposits at the Fed) given by NT. Similarly, the monetary liabilities

of the foreign intermediaries between T and T+l must equal NT. Since

households are allowed to spend at r the money they withdraw at T, these

assumptions ensure that not all of either country's households visit their

intermediaries the same day. This is so since if all households in the

home country visited the intermediary at T no one would hold money between

'r+l and T+2. Here, it is assumed that half the households in both

countries visit their intermediaries at T while the other half visits

theirs at t+l. The fact that different people perform financial transactions

at different times is the crucial feature of reality the models of

Rotemberg (1982) and this paper seek to capture. As suggested in the

introduction, this fact seems to be crucial in ensuring that monetary

policy affects the terms of trade.

       The governments of this model have no expenditures. However,

they levy taxes, issue local money and hold claims on capital. The evolution

of the capital stocks held by the government is given by:

Here KIT and KIT are the capitals of type i held at T by the home and

ality these taxes are levied in the form of capital of sector 1. An

increase in money which is used to buy capital is called an open market

III Equilibrium Under Flexible Exchaflge Rates



             Under flexible exchange rates the governments of the two countries
                        *
set the paths of MT and MT. An equilibrium is a path for the terms of

trade, the prices of good 1 in both countries, and the two real rates

of interest such that:

             a) The sum of consumptions and investment of good i demanded

by households and governments at T is equal to the output of good i

at T:

       b) The amounts of money that households who visit their

       Condition b) requires that:

                 N [P11 C1T+l + P21 C21] =                      MT




Since households who visit the intermediary at T maximize
      I                     T
a in C1T+i + (1—a) in C2T+l            subject to (13) in equilibrium:

On the other hand, using (7) and (14):


                                T+1
                                              N

Hence:


                                                N
                         Pt            —        T       T+].
                                                                               I =   1,2

Using the same argument it is straightforward to establish that:



                         T*           —         N    T+l*
                         CIT+i

                                            N


Using the proportionality of CIT and C, total consumption of good i

at T   is    given by:


                                            M           *

                                                                   NT+l

Therefore, using (8) and the equilibrium condition (12):

Equations (19) and (20) are very similar to the equation which
characterizes the closed economy equilibrium of Rotemberg (1982). The

knowledge of the sequence of capitals obtained from these equations

directly yields the sequence of rates of return. The sequence of aggregate

consumptions can be obtained from (12) while the sequence of individual

consumptions follows from (10), (16), (17) and knowledge of k. Finally,

the sequence of prices can be computed using (15) and the equivalent

relationships for the foreign country.

        Note that (19) and (20) are uncoupled difference equations in

Kit and K2T. This lack of coupling reflects the considerable simplifi-

cation of assuming that only good i is required to produce good i.

These equations are nonlinear third order difference equations with only

one initial condition, namely Kit_i. Hence they have infinitely many

solutions which are indexed by Kit and Kit+i,        the two "arbitrary"

initial conditions. As explained in Rotemberg (1982) there are two
                                      t        t+l
arbitrary conditions because both C1 and C11 can be chosen at will.

 On the other hand, as will be apparent below, near the steady state there

 is only one equilibrium path which is nonexplosive and which has no

 arbitrary oscillations in the steady state. Before proceeding with the

 linearization of (19) and (20) which establishes this fact, it is

apparent from these equations that certain government interventions are

neutral while others are not.

       Consider as the base case a situation in which money is constant

in both countries. Then (19) and (20) become:



       f(K1T+l) -            = p2                                            (19')
                                    f(K1) fi(K1T÷l) [f(K1T1)      KiT]



       f(K2+1) — K2+2 = p2 f(K2) f(K21) [f(K2T1) -                           (20')
                                                   K2T]


Consider a particular set of equilibrium paths for
                                                        KiT and K2T
given by CK1T} and {K2}. Suppose either government engages in exchange

market interventions at t. These do not affect (19) or (20) and hence

{K1_} and {K2} are still equilibrium paths. The neutrality of these

Interventions is due to the fact that the two capitals are perfect sub-

stitutes in households' portfolios.2

       Suppose instead that starting at t, the rate of growth of either

money stock unexpectedly increases to a new constant higher level. Then,

as long asM /    M1 is       still equal to Mt+. /
                                                     M+ji   and Mt /
                                                                       M1   is still

equal to M÷j /   Mt+.i   ,   equations (19') and (20') still represent the
equilibrium. Hence such increases in the rate of monetary growth are

consistent with {K1T} and {K2T}, they are neutral. This must be contrasted

with the money—in—the_utility_function model of Obstfeld (1981) in which

changes in the growth rate of money have real effects.
                                         — 14 —



          Instead,   again in contrast to Obstfeld's (1981) model, open

market operations have real effects even when, as here, the government

earns interest on its holdings of claims on both domestic and foreign

capital. This can be seen by considering the effects of increasing Mt

(decreasing           I   M) and leaving unchanged all other ratios of the form

Mtfj I   M+i.        Then suppose that Klt    Klt+l, 2t and K2+i are still
equilibrium levels of the capital stocks. Then by (19) and (20),

         and         will not be equilibrium levels of the capital stocks.

The open market purchase affects capital and hence output. The actual

effects of small open market operations near the steady state will be

considered in the next section. First the equations (19) and (20) need

to be linearized around the steady state values of K and K          .   As
                                                  iT      2T
shown in Rotemberg (1982) there is a unique steady state in which both

production and consumption of the two goods is positive? This steady

state is given by K1 and K2 where



                     p f'. (i)    =1                  i   1, 2          (21)




Moreover, in the steady state it is assumed that monetary growth is constant

in both countries. Then, using (21) and the linearization of (19) and

(20) around K1 and 1(2 yields:

Inspection    of these last three equations establishes that one of the roots,

say y1 is equal to minus one. Instead, (A1 — 1) (1 —                     i1) is     positive as

are X111 and (A1 + P1). Therefore A. and 11 are both positive and while

one of them (say A1) Is less than one the other is larger than one.

Blanchard and Kahn (1980) establish that for a unique nonexplosive solution

to (24) to exist, the number of roots at or inside the unit circle must
                                     — 17 —



be equal to the number of predetermined variables. Here two roots are

at or inside the unit circle and there is only one predetermined variable

(Kji). There thus exist an infinity of nonexplosive paths. However,

since one of the roots is equal to minus one, there exists only one path

which does not oscillate in the steady state. This equilibrium path can

be found using techniques analogous to those of Blanchard and Kahn (1980):



       KIT =    X   KIT_i
                            l±p j0
                                              —   (l)   KiT+l+j + (l—X1)
                                                                               (25)
                                                           T =   t,   t+l

Note that the coefficient of F.+i is zero in (25). Moreover as long as

money in both countries grows at the same rate at t as it does in future

periods, F1+i÷. is zero. For this case equation (25) asserts that the

capitals converge at the rates X. to their steady state values. This

speed of convergence differs across countries if A1 is different from A2.

Similarly the impact of monetary shocks differs if         is different from

2• Hence, given the relationships below (24), nontrivial dissimilarities

in the technologies of the two countries are translated into differences

in the dynamic behavior of their capital stocks. On the other hand,

differences in the population of the two countries do not affect the

roots A. and ii..

       Even when the technologies of the two countries are identical

differences in tastes can insure that the effect of a monetary shock

is different in the two countries. This is studied in the next section.

IV Monetary Policy and the Terms of Trade


       Suppose the two countries have identical technologies so that

is equal to   while X. is equal to X. Now consider a once and for all

open market purchase of capital at t which takes place only in the home

country. This induces a once and for all increase in M.        This reduces

      and F2t+2 leaving all F's beyond t+2 unaffe-cted. Note that unless

  is equal to one the effect on Fit+2 is different from the effect on

2t+2 Hence the effect on the two capitals is different unless          •is one.


  is equal to one if and only if a is equal to .      If households in the
home country have a more pronounced preference for home goods than do

households in the foreign country a exceeds   and 1    is   smaller than one.

This is the case that will be considered in this section. When         is smaller

than one the fall in Flt+2 after a monetary expansion at home is bigger

than the fall in F2+2. The coefficient of Fjt+2 in the equation (25)

which gives K. is —l/.i which is negative. Therefore an increase in the

money supply at t raises capital at home and raises it by more than it

raises capital abroad. The intuition behind this result is straightforward.

An increase in    raises prices at home. Therefore it reduces the real

value of the purchases made by residents of the home country who visited

the bank at t—l. Since these residents buy relatively more home goods, the

consumption of home goods falls relative to the consumption of foreign

goods. In this equilibrium model what isn't consumed is invested. Thus

there is more capital accumulation in the home country. In turn, this

raises output in the home country and this increase is, again, larger

than the increase in the foreign country. In any event the flexibility

of exchange rates does not insulate the foreign country from our monetary
                                         — 19 —



inj ection.
        Since capitals and outputs are differentially affected it appears

likely that the terms of trade respond to monetary expansions. To see

that this is so, using (6) and (18) the terms of trade at t can be

written as:




              =
                  -jj                                                  (26)




The term in brackets is unaffected by the monetary expansion. Instead,

both levels of capital at t are affected and therefore the ratio of

consumption C1 I        is likely to change inducing a change in the terms

of trade. Suppose in particular that at t—l both capitals were equal to

their steady state values. Also suppose that, before the monetary ex-

pansion, K.t was expected also to equal i, the common steady state value of

capital. Then the monetary expansion increases Klt relative to               and

thus reduces the ratio C1 / C2 .          It leads to a real depreciation.
Intuitively, when a exceeds        the monetary expansion leads, as prices

rise at home to a larger excess supply of good 1 than the excess supply

of good 2. This puts downward pressure on the relative price of good 1.

The monetary expansion also leads to a nominal depreciation. The nominal

exchange rate at t, e, is given by                  .   Using (19) and the equivalent
relationship for the other country:

                                * t_l*
                        =
                            aN C1
                            N
                                  ti
                                 C1 Mt
                                         *                              (27)
                                      — 20 —




Employing the proportionality of        and C as well as (16) and (17):


                   oN
                     *
                      (M) N
                           2*
         e =k           *2
                   N (Mt) Mtl


Therefore money is a central determinant of the exchange rate. The home

exchange rate depreciates as money at home rises relative to money abroad

and relative to money the previous period. Also the exchange rate de-

preciates as the population at home falls relative to the population

abroad and as the home country increases its taste for home produced

goods.



V Equilibrium Under Fixed Exchange Rates


                                                              *
         Let   the exchange rate be set at e so that P1 = e       *



This section establishes mainly that the terms of trade effects of
monetary policy are absent in a regime of fixed exchange rates when the

technologies of the two countries are identical. This is so because

an increase in either country's money simply leads to an increase in the

world money supply. Hence all households who went to the bank the period

before the increase in the money supply must reduce their consumption.

So, neither good is in more excess supply than the other and their

relative price need not change.

         Under fixed exchange rates the governments do not control their

local money supply. Instead, their collective open market operations
                 *
only fix    + e Mt which will be called Mt , the world money supply

measured in home currency. This has been established by numerous authors

including Swoboda (1978). Hence equilibrium under fixed exchange rates
                                           — 21 —




requires   in addition to the conditions a) and b) of the equilibrium

under flexible exchange rates that:

         c) The sum of the money valued in home currency that all households

who visit their intermediaries at T want to carry over to T+l must

equal N
         The analysis of the model is considerably simplified by the fact

that one of its implications is that the fraction of          held by domestic

residents is constant. Since e is constant (27) becomes:


                           *
                          aN N C1

                  e =           *                                      (29)

                          N N CiT


On the other hand, using (7) and (7'):



                   T_l*            *              T_l*
                   C           P           P     C
                    l-t   —        lt—l     it     iT—i   1

                    iT                 iT PiTi it—i


Where the last equality follows from the fact that exchange rates don't

change between 'r—i and    and from the proportionality of         and C'T

Hence:

       Since households at home who visit their intermediaries at T must

still carry over MT units of money from T to T+l and similarly for

foreign households, equations (19) and (20) remain valid in equilibrium.

effect   on the consumptions of the two goods at t. Therefore, by (26)

the terms of trade are unaffected by the monetary change.



VI Conclusions



         This paper has presented a simple two country equilibrium model

in which money is held for transaction purposes. While the model is very

simple it is able to give a monetary explanation for the substantial

fluctuations in the terms of trade that have characterized the floating

exchange rate period of the 1970's. The model also predicts that monetary

forces induce fewer fluctuations in the terms of trade under fixed

exchange rates. It must be noted that previous models with flexible

prices like those of Stockman (1980) and Obstfeld (1981) give no

explanation for the higher variance of the terms of trade under flexible

exchange rates. On the other hand, models with sticky prices like

the one in Dornbusch (1976) can also give a monetary explanation for this

variability. It is an open empirical question which of sticky prices

and staggered visits to financial intermediaries is more important in

generating the variability of the terms of trade.

         The model of this paper can be extended in several directions.

First, it can be used to analyze both the steady state and the non—steady

state effects commercial policies as well as of devaluations. Second,

it may be able to shed light on the effect of various monetary insti-

tutions on the behavior of the balance of payments and the terms of trade.

Monetary institutions of interest include commodity standards and various

intervention rules.

Polemarchakis (1982) make it likely that this neutrality would prevail

even if the two capitals had different stochastic returns.

       3mis will be the only steady state considered below. There

are two other steady states. One has zero capital and hence zero output

and consumption. The other has zero consumption because investment is

equal to output. This latter steady state isn't consistent with

individual rationality since households can make themselves better off

by running down their wealth.

                                    APPENDIX



        The purpose of this appendix is to show that k and k depend

on the relative wealths of the two countries. The total monetary withdrawal

at T, M, of a household who        visits   the intermediary at T         is   given by

                                                     Therefore, using (6) and (7):
P1TCT + P2TCT + P1T+lCTl + P2T+14T+l




                    MT =
                     T

                                       + P)                                        (Al)




Similarly for foreign households:



                    NT     =   P* CT* (.LL2)     •                                 (A2)
                     T          1T1T p

The evolution of the capital holdings of the domestic household who

visits his intermediaries at T is given by:

                                                                 MT

                                                         T       P
                                                                     it




where     is noncapital income of household j at T, which, for simplicity

is assumed to accrue in the form of capital of type 1. Note that (A3)

assumes that the proceeds from investments in capital of type 1 at (t—2)

are   reinvested   in capital of type 1 and similarly for investments in
                                                 — 26 —




capital   of type 2. Using (6) and (8):




                     RT =       f(K2T2) f(K2Tl)
                                f'(K
                                 1 1T—2 )
                                                 f'l(K1T1)     RT_2
                                                                                                         (A4)



which is the "real" version of uncovered interest arbitrage. Therefore

(A3) becomes:


                                                                                                        NT

                                                                                            +   T
                                                                                                    —           (A5)
                                                                               T—2




and,   using the natural constraint which avoids explosive paths of debt:



                               K3
                                iT
                                   +I(
                                     2r
                                        /RT
                     urn                                  =                                              (A6)
                               T
                     T-
                               h=t


Therefore, using (Al), the lifetime budget constraint for a household

who visits the intermediary at t becomes:


                                                           t+21

Similarly      for the foreign households:



                                                                     i*

where      is the noncapital income at T of the foreign household while
Wis     its wealth at t if it visits the intermediary at t. Therefore,
since    for t even, ke is given by C1 /                             while      k is given by
 t+l           t+l*
C11 / C11                  ,       the   k s    are   given by:

                                                                          t+l
                      cWt
          ke     =                                         ko

So, as claimed, the k's depend on the relative wealths. Note that these k's

only change when the paths of consumption and of noncapital income change. This

must be contrasted with the model of Helpman and Razin (1982) in which the

relative wealth changes when the nominal exchange rate changes. This occurs

because, in their model, households hold nominal bonds instead of claims on

real capital.
