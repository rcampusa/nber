Liquidity Risk of Corporate Bond Returns: A Conditional Approach

                                              ABSTRACT

We study the exposure of the US corporate bond returns to liquidity shocks of stocks and Treasury
bonds over the period 1973 - 2007 in a regime - switching model. In one regime, liquidity shocks have
mostly insignificant effects on bond prices, whereas in another regime, a rise in illiquidity produces
significant but conflicting effects: Prices of investment-grade bonds rise while prices of speculative-grade
(junk) bonds fall substantially (relative to the market). Relating the probability of these regimes to
macroeconomic conditions we find that the second regime can be predicted by economic conditions
that are characterized as “stress.” These effects, which are robust to controlling for other systematic
risks (term and default), suggest the existence of time-varying liquidity risk of corporate bond returns
conditional on episodes of flight to liquidity. Our model can predict the out-of-sample bond returns
for the stress years 2008 - 2009. We find a similar pattern for stocks classified by high or low book-to-
market ratio, where again, liquidity shocks play a special role in periods characterized by adverse
economic conditions.

1. Introduction

    This paper shows that the pricing of liquidity risk in the bond market is conditional on the
state of the economy, with liquidity risk becoming more important in times of financial and
economic distress. Using a regime-switching model, we find a significant (absolute) increase

in the exposure (“beta”) of corporate bond returns to liquidity shocks in stocks and Treasury
bonds, after controlling for term and default risks. We provide an econometric time-series
model that predicts the likelihood of regime in which liquidity matters more for asset pricing,

show that the likelihood is greater in times of macroeconomic and financial distress, and use
the prediction to generate a conditional forecast of bond returns. We further find that stocks
with high book-to-market ratio, which reflects persistent distressed performance and lower
liquidity, also exhibit an increase in their (absolute) liquidity betas in times of economic

distress.
    Liquidity shocks affect realized returns because expected liquidity affects expected returns

(Amihud and Mendelson, 1986, 1991). Given the persistence of illiquidity, a positive illiquidity

shock raises future expected illiquidity and expected return which in turn lowers prices. This

usually generates a negative liquidity beta.1 These relations between illiquidity shocks and

returns have been documented for stocks by Amihud (2002), Pastor and Stambaugh (2003),
Acharya and Pedersen (2005), and Sadka (2006), and for corporate bonds by de Jong and

Driessen (2007), and Lin, Wang, and Wu (2011). This paper contributes to these studies by

showing that the impact of liquidity shocks on asset prices is conditional, being significantly
stronger in adverse economic times.
    The relation between liquidity shocks and adverse economic and financial episodes has
been noted by Acharya and Pedersen (2005).2 In times of adverse economic and financial
conditions, the greater demand for liquidity and the rise in its value reduces asset prices
   1
      This holds under reasonable assumptions on the asset cashflows; see a formal model in Acharya and
Pedersen (2005).
    2
      Over the period 1963 to 1999, Acharya and Pedersen (2005) identify these shocks to be 5/1970 (Penn
Central commercial paper crisis), 11/1973 (oil crisis), 10/1987 (stock market crash), 8/1990 (Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait), 4 - 12/1997 (Asian crisis), and 6 - 10/1998 (Russian default, LTCM crisis).


                                                     1
by more than usual, and this applies particularly for the less liquid assets. Yet, these
episodes may be coupled by a flight to liquidity, by which securities with higher liquidity

become relatively more valuable. Then, unexpected rise in illiquidity may raise, rather
than depress, the prices of assets that provide greater liquidity in adverse economic times
relative to the prices of less liquid assets. This is indeed what we find for investment-grade
(IG) corporate bonds, which are known to be more liquid than speculative (junk) bonds.

Analogously, we also find that in times of economic distress, the effect of adverse liquidity

shocks is positive (relative to the market) for stocks with low book-to-market ratio, which
have stronger sustained profitability and higher liquidity, whereas the effect is negative for
stocks with high book-to-market ratio.

   Formally, we estimate a regression model of bond returns on four pricing factors—term

spread returns, default spread returns (or the bond market excess returns), and liquidity

shocks on stocks and Treasury bonds. We study the association between changes in corporate
bond price shocks and changes in the illiquidity of stocks and Treasury bonds. We show

that this response varies over time, switching between two regimes which we characterize as

“normal” and “stress.” Employing Hamilton’s (1989) methodology, we first identify statistically

the two regimes between which there are variations in the liquidity betas as well as the betas
of the term risk and default risk. We then show that these two regimes can be predicted by

macroeconomic and financial variables. The regime which we call “stress” is associated with
adverse macroeconomic conditions such as recessed economic activity and adverse financial
market conditions such as negative stock market returns, heightened volatility, and shrinking

balance-sheets of financial intermediaries.
   Employing our economic prediction model of being in the normal or in the stress regime,
we provide an out-of-sample forecast of corporate bond returns for the years 2008 - 2009.
In regressions of monthly realized returns on predicted returns that are conditional on the
pricing factors, R2 is 76% and 77% for junk and IG bonds, respectively, and the coefficients
indicate unbiased prediction: the slope coefficients are close to one and the intercepts are


                                              2
close to zero. As shown in Fig. 5, the predicted return does a reasonable job at predicting the
returns of March 2008 (Bear Stearns’ collapse) and September to December 2008 (Lehman

Brothers’ collapse and the post-Lehman phase). In another out-of-sample test for the second
half of the sample,3 we again obtain that the prediction has significant power with an
accuracy of over 88%.
    Importantly, we find that in the stress regime, the sign of liquidity betas is quite the

opposite for IG and junk bonds. Junk bond returns respond negatively to illiquidity shocks

while IG bond returns respond in a positive and significant way (these effects are relative
to the effect of liquidity shocks on the bond market excess return). In this regime, there
is a large significant difference in the return-illiquidity shock relation between IG and junk

bonds, whereas in the normal regime, this difference is smaller and less significant. This

pattern is robust to controlling for maturity and default risk. The evidence thus suggests

that in the stress regime there is a “flight to liquidity” wherein investors prefer (or price
more favorably) more liquid assets such as IG bonds rather than the less liquid junk bonds.

To further confirm this flight to liquidity, we show that Treasury bill yields fall relative to

the federal funds rate during the stress regime and become more sensitive to bond liquidity

shocks.
    This analysis is extended to stocks sorted on their book-to-market ratio. Fama and French

(1995) show that the profitability of stocks with high book-to-market ratio is persistently
distressed, with the opposite holding for stocks with low book-to-market ratio. And, Fang,
Noe, and Tice (2009) show that stocks with higher book-to-market ratio are associated

with lower liquidity, because lower liquidity depresses stock value. Thus, stocks with higher
book-to-market ratio are similar to junk bonds in the sense that they have greater economic
distress and lower liquidity. Similar to our findings for corporate bonds, we identify statistically
two regimes which differ mainly in the effect of stock liquidity shocks on the excess returns
   3
     For each month, we progressively estimate the best econometric fit using macroeconomic and
financial-market variables that explain the model-implied probability of being in the stress regime until
the previous month, and use it to predict the statistically identified probability of being in the stress regime
in that month obtained from the time-series regressions of bond returns on the pricing factors.


                                                       3
of stock portfolios constructed based on their book-to-market ratio. Again, we find that the
probability of being in these regimes is predictable by the same macroeconomic and financial

market variables that predict the liquidity risk regimes for corporate bond returns. The
probability of being in the regime where stocks – particularly those with high book-to-market
ratio—have greater stock liquidity risk is significantly related to market conditions that
indicate economic and financial stress.

   Finally, we directly relate the returns on stocks sorted by their book-to-market ratio to

returns on stocks sorted on their likelihood of default, using Altman’s Zscore as modified
by Hillegeist et al. (2004). We form portfolios of high and low default-risk stocks. Then
we relate the return on high-minus-low book-to-market stocks (HMLBM) to returns on

high-minus-low default-risk stocks (HMLDEF), adding the two liquidity shock variables.

This enables us to test the effect of liquidity risk after controlling for default risk, captured by

HMLDEF. We obtain that the control for default risk completely accounts for the well-known
HMLBM premium, while the risk of stock liquidity shocks is highly significant in times of

adverse economic conditions but not otherwise. The time periods in which the liquidity

risk is significant are strongly related to the time periods associated with adverse economic

conditions for liquidity risk in returns on bonds and stocks. This further substantiates our
proposition that liquidity risk is conditional on the state of the economy.

   In summary, our conditional approach to modeling the liquidity risk of securities exposed
to default risk and distressed performance yields new explanations for understanding asset
prices. A large body of recent literature (e.g., Brunnermeier and Pedersen, 2009; He and

Krishnamurthy, 2012; Acharya and Viswanathan, 2011, among others discussed in Section
4), has stressed that financial intermediaries reduce liquidity provision in response to adverse
liquidity shocks, especially in times of economic and financial stress, when they exhibit a
flight to liquid assets. The results in our paper are consistent with some of the theoretical
predictions.
   (a) There is a conditional response and differential response (between junk and IG bonds,


                                                 4
or between stocks with low and high book-to-market ratios) of default-risky securities to
market-wide liquidity shocks;

   (b) There is a phenomenon of “flight to liquidity” that is separate from flight to quality;
   (c) There is a highly significant relation between the probability of the distress regime,
during which liquidity shocks have the greatest impact, and dealers’ (or financial intermediaries’)
inventories and their interaction with market volatility.

   Our analysis shows that default exposure as regimes change is really separate from

exposure to illiquidity shocks. Therefore, the exposure that otherwise would have been
attributed to default risk is in fact exposure to liquidity risk.
   We also provide a new methodological procedure to study episodic changes in exposure of

securities prices and their economic and financial causes. We begin with a statistical first-step

to identify significant “regime” shifts in exposures in a statistical first-step and then, in a

second-step analysis, we relate the probability of being in regimes to macroeconomic and
financial conditions. The second step enables an unconstrained examination of the factors

affecting the regimes, which is more flexible and broad than in methods that incorporate

predetermined factors into the one-step regime-switching analysis. This methodology could

be used in future work for conditional analysis of other factor exposures of asset prices.
   The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the data we employ. Sections 3 and 4

present results for our unconditional and conditional liquidity risk tests, respectively. Section
4 also reports results of the out-of-sample tests. Section 5 presents results on stock portfolios
constructed according to their book-to-market ratio. Section 7 discusses additional related

literature. Section 8 offers final conclusions.


2. Data

   Our bond data are extracted from the Lehman Brothers Fixed Income Database distributed
by Warga (1998) and supplemented by the Merrill Lynch corporate bond index database
used by Schaefer and Strebulaev (2008). We follow closely the data extraction methodology


                                                  5
outlined by Bharath and Shumway (2008) for the Warga (1998) database. The Warga
(1998) database contains monthly price, accrued interest, and return data on all corporate

and government bonds over the period January 1971 - March 1997. We use the data from
the 1973 - 1997 period when coverage became widespread. This is the database used by
Elton et al. (2001) to explain the yield spread on corporate bonds, and by Gebhardt et
al. (2005) in their study of the cross-section of bond returns. In addition, the database

contains descriptive data on bonds, including coupons, ratings, and callability.

    This study uses a subset of the data in the Warga database by employing several
selection criteria. First, we include only bonds that were priced by traders or dealers and
eliminate bonds that were matrix-priced.4 This rule is similar to that behind the CRSP

government bond file, which is the standard academic source of government bond data.

Next, we eliminate all bonds with special features that would result in them being priced

differently. This means that we eliminate all bonds with options (e.g., callable bonds or
bonds with a sinking fund), with floating rates, with an odd frequency of coupon payments,

and inflation-indexed bonds. In addition, we eliminate all bonds not included in the Lehman

Brothers bond indexes, because researchers in charge of the database at Lehman Brothers

indicated that the care in preparing the data was much less for bonds not included in their
indexes. This also results in eliminating data for all bonds with a maturity of less than one

year.
    These data are supplemented by data on monthly prices of corporate bonds that are
included either in the Merrill Lynch Corporate Master Index or in the Merrill Lynch Corporate

High Yield Index used by Schaefer and Strebulaev (2008). These indexes include most rated
US publicly issued corporate bonds. The data cover the period from December 1996 to
December 2007. The selection criteria used for the Lehman database were also used with the
    4
      For actively traded bonds, dealers quote a price based on recent trades of the bond. We eliminate bonds
for which a dealer did not supply a price because they have prices determined by a rule of thumb relating
the characteristics of the bond to dealer-priced bonds. These rules of thumb tend to change very slowly over
time and do not respond to changes in market conditions. For matrix prices, all that our analysis uncovers
may be the rule used to matrix-price bonds rather than the economic influences at work in the market.



                                                     6
Merrill database. Thus, during the overlapping period between the two databases (December
1996 to March 1997), the constituent bonds in the two databases are nearly identical. In

the Lehman database all bonds have missing data in August 1975 and December 1984, and
their prices are replaced by interpolated prices. Most bond issues are rated by both S&P
and Moody’s and the ratings agree with each other. We eliminate unrated bonds and bonds
whose rating by S&P and Moody’s is not the same for the broad letter-based categories.

   The monthly corporate bond return as of time τ + 1, rτ +1 is computed as


                                   Pτ +1 + AIτ +1 + Cτ +1 − Pτ − AIτ
                         rτ +1 =                                     .                    (1)
                                                Pτ + AIτ

Pτ is the quoted price in month τ ; AIτ is accrued interest, which is just the coupon payment
scaled by the ratio of days since the last payment date to the days between last payment and

next payment; and Cτ +1 is the semiannual coupon payment (if any) in month τ + 1. For the
bond return indexes that we use, we value-weight the monthly returns of all eligible bonds in

each rating class by the total amount outstanding of each bond. This reduces significantly
price errors for particular bonds. In our sample over the period 1973 - 2007, there were on
average 2,234 bonds in each month, with a minimum number of 245 and a maximum number
of 9,286. The maximum number of months in our sample period is 420, but data are missing

for some rating classes in some months.


   ENTER TABLE 1

   Table 1 Panel A reports the summary statistics of the value-weighted returns on corporate
bonds aggregated into portfolios by rating classes. The weights are based on face value
outstanding and returns are in basis points, denoted bps. As expected, the mean and

standard deviation of bond returns are greater for bonds with greater default risk. The
monthly mean return on AAA-rated bonds is 67.2 bps with standard deviation of 134.5 bps,

and for CCC bonds, the mean and standard deviation are, respectively, 160.3 bps and 332.0
bps. For most of our analysis, we rely on groupings into investment-grade (“IG,” BBB-rated

                                                7
and above) and high-yield speculative (“junk,” below BBB-rated) bonds. For this grouping,
we find that the returns on IG and junk bonds are, respectively, 67.6 and 97.6 bps and the

respective standard deviations are 127.3 and 177.9 bps.
    We follow Fama and French (1993) in using two common factors for corporate bonds,
TERM and DEF, which reflect unexpected changes in the term structure of interest rates
and in default risk. Fama and French (1993) justify these choices by an Intertemporal

CAPM setting in which these two factors are hedging portfolios.5 Following Gebhardt et al.

(2005), we calculate the factor TERM as the difference in the monthly long-term 30-year
government bond return (from Ibbotson Associates) and one-month T-bill returns (from
the Center for Research in Security Prices, CRSP), and the factor DEF as the difference

between the monthly return on an equally weighted market portfolio of all corporate bonds

with at least one year to maturity and the average return on government bonds. The latter

is the average returns on one-year and 30-year government bonds because corporate bonds
whose returns are used to construct DEF have maturities from one to 30 years. Thus, DEF

is the bond market excess return; the equal-weighting better captures the extreme default

outcomes each month.

    We add to the model two liquidity risk factors which are innovations in the illiquidity on
stocks and bonds. The stock illiquidity index is the market’s average price-impact measure

of Amihud (2002), as modified by Acharya and Pedersen (2005). It is calculated as the
equally weighted average of the daily ratio of absolute stock return to its daily dollar volume,
and averaged over the days of the month to provide the monthly stock illiquidity measure,

using NYSE and Amex stocks.6 The bond illiquidity measure is the equally weighted quoted
bid-ask spread on on-the-run short maturity Treasuries.7 The innovations in the stock (bond)
   5
      Following the suggestion and results in Gebhardt et al. (2005, footnote 2), we do not include the stock
market factor which they found empirically to have almost no explanatory power for corporate bond returns
in the presence of default and term risk factors.
    6
      To make ILLIQ stationary, the series is modified by the normalization formula due to Pastor and
Stambaugh (2003) and Acharya and Pedersen (2005): the ratio of the capitalizations of the market portfolio
at the end of month t - 1 and of the market portfolio at the end of July 1962.
    7
      These data are as in Goyenko (2006). We thank Ruslan Goyenko for providing us the data.

indexes are the residuals from an autoregressive model with AR(3) (AR(2)) specification,
with the lag length being selected to ensure that the residuals are serially uncorrelated.8 We

call the innovations in the stock and bond illiquidity indexes Silliq and Billiq, respectively.
   Panel B of Table 1 presents summary statistics on the four factors that we use in this
study. The mean risk premium for the default factor (DEF) is 9.5 bps per month with t =
1.72, while the average risk premium for the term factor (TERM) is 17.7 basis points per

month, which is insignificantly different from zero. The mean of the two liquidity factors

is practically zero. Panel C of Table 1 shows the pairwise correlations between TERM,
DEF, and the two liquidity risk factors. TERM and DEF are highly negatively correlated
(correlation = -0.529), whereas the two liquidity risk factors are less correlated with each

other (correlation = 0.086), and they are also not highly correlated with TERM and DEF

(the correlations of DEF with Billiq is -0.057 and with Silliq it is -0.153). This helps with

a clean interpretation of the liquidity risk effects we identify.

be more variable during the early 1980s, the early 1990s recession, and late 1990s. Fig. 2

stock market illiquidity innovations. The measured innovations in market illiquidity are
high during periods that were characterized by liquidity crises, for instance, the oil shock of

1973, the 1979 - 1982 period of high interest rates, the stock market crash of 1987, the 1990
recession, and the 1998 LTCM crisis.


3. Unconditional liquidity risk of bond returns

   In this section, we first examine as a benchmark the unconditional effect of liquidity
factors on corporate bond returns divided into categories by ratings.
   8
      The estimated AR model coefficients employ the Shaman-Stine (1988) correction for finite sample
coefficients. The estimation period of this model coincides with the data period.

3.1. Methodology and results

   First, we estimate the following time-series specification:


                        Rj,t = αj + βj,T × T ERM + βj,D × DEF

                               + βj,Si × Silliq + βj,Bi × Billiq + ǫj,t ,                   (2)


for Rj,t being the value-weighted return on corporate bonds of rating class j in excess of the
30-day T-bill return j ∈ {AAA, ..., CCC & below}. This specification is similar to that of

Fama and French (1993), augmented with the two liquidity risk factors.

   ENTER TABLE 2


   Table 2 Panel A presents the coefficient estimates. For all ratings, the loadings on TERM
and DEF are positive. The TERM factor loading is statistically significant for all rating

classes and it is higher for the IG group of bonds (BBB and higher) than it is for junk bonds

because the duration of IG bonds is generally higher. The DEF loadings are monotonically

increasing down the rating groups (except for the CCC group), consistent with worsening of

credit quality.
   Of primary interest to this paper, the liquidity risk loadings βSi and βBi for both stocks

and bonds, Silliq and Billiq, are negative for all ratings below BBB and are positive for

highly rated bond classes (the coefficient of Silliq is positive for all investment-grade bonds
and the coefficient of Billiq is positive for bonds above A-rating). Notably, the model
includes the factor DEF, the bond market excess return over government bond return,
which itself is negatively affected by illiquidity shocks (shown in Table 7 below). Then,
the coefficients βSi and βBi measure the effects of liquidity shocks on returns in each rating
class (conditional on the effects of these shocks on DEF, the bond market excess return). The
positive coefficients βSi and βBi then mean that the effects of illiquidity shocks on returns of
highly rated bonds is less negative than their effect on the average bond market return and


                                               10
the negative coefficients βSi and βBi on junk bonds mean that these bond prices fall by more
than average in response to illiquidity shocks. Overall, the coefficients on liquidity risks are

almost monotonically declining from positive to negative values as we move from AAA down
to CCC bonds. This pattern suggests a “flight to liquidity” phenomenon: When illiquidity
rises, there is a flight from low-rated bonds which are generally less liquid to the more liquid
higher-quality bonds. Consequently, the prices of high-rated corporate bonds rise and the

prices of low-rated bonds fall, both effects being measured relative to the average bond

market return. The explanatory power of our model is reasonably high for bonds rated BBB
and above (adj-R2 is between 75% and 82%), but it deteriorates substantially for below-BBB
bonds (adj-R2 falls from 51% for BBB to 11% for CCC and below).9

    Table 2 Panel B reports the economic magnitudes of the different factor loadings. In

particular, it reports for each factor loading and each rating class how many standard

deviation in returns arise from a standard deviation shock to the factor. The calculations
employ the summary statistics reported in Table 1 and the coefficients estimated in Panel

A of Table 2. For BBB and above, the liquidity risks are not economically significant: a

one standard deviation shock to liquidity risks produces a meagre 0.6% to 9% of standard

deviation in returns for these rating classes. The effects of TERM and DEF appear much
more significant than those of liquidity risks for BBB and above, with the effect of TERM

being the largest. But for junk bonds (BB and below), liquidity risk has greater economic
significance for bond returns than its significance for IG bond returns (between 10% to 40%),
while the effect of TERM declines. Notably, the effect of DEF does not rise substantially for

bonds with rating lower than BBB.
    In summary, Table 2 shows the existence of unconditional liquidity risk in corporate bond
   9
     de Jong and Driessen (2007) estimate a bond return model with similar liquidity factors, using the stock
market excess return instead of our two bond-market-based control variables, TERM and DEF, which render
the market factor insignificant; see Gebhardt et al. (2005). Unlike in our results, their estimated coefficients
of the illiquidity factors do not switch from positive for high-rated bonds to negative for lower-rated bonds
which suggests flight to liquidity, and their liquidity factor coefficients are not as monotonic in the rating
classes as we show them to be. This may be because their model does not include the bond market excess
return factor DEF which itself has negative βSi and βBi , as we show in Table 10, Panel A, column 1.

returns, which is substantially higher for junk bonds than it is for investment-grade bonds.
The switching signs of the liquidity risk as we move from high-rated to low-rated bonds

suggests the phenomenon of flight to liquidity which we analyze in detail below.


4. Conditional liquidity risk of bond returns

   Most of the current academic literature has focused on unconditional liquidity risk as

we have also analyzed thus far. However, recent theoretical literature suggests that market
liquidity and its impact on asset prices should be conditional as they fluctuate due to funding

conditions. Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2009) show that funding illiquidity in the market
adversely affects market liquidity when negative wealth shocks make margin constraints
binding for financial intermediaries and force liquidations, or if margin constraints rise in
times of higher volatility. Acharya and Viswanathan (2011) propose an endogenous link

between wealth shocks and adverse market illiquidity. In their model, negative value shocks

raise the leverage of financial intermediaries, which in turn can induce their managers

to risk-shift (“gamble for resurrection”) in order to gain at the expense of debt holders.

As these firms need to roll over their short-term debt which continuously matures, they
become capital-constrained because lenders are less willing to provide capital, knowing the

risk-shifting propensity of the managers. Then, highly leveraged intermediaries are forced to

liquidate their risky positions and asset markets can clear only at “cash-in-the-market” prices
(see Shleifer and Vishny, 1992, Allen and Gale, 1994, 1998). He and Krishnamurthy (2012a,b)
consider households which invest through intermediaries. Then, a negative wealth shock
makes households rebalance their portfolios and allocate money away from risky to riskless
assets, thus lowering intermediary wealth, causing capital constraints on intermediaries, and
forcing asset sales and systemic liquidity problems.
   This recent literature suggests that a given market liquidity shock generates greater
effects on asset prices following negative wealth shocks to the economy (which are generally
coincident with a rise in aggregate volatility) and especially shocks to financial intermediary


                                              12
capital. In normal times, liquidity shocks can be absorbed by financial intermediaries as
they are far from their funding constraints and thus have ready capital for this purpose. But

in times of adverse economic conditions and financial sector stress, financial intermediaries
become more capital-constrained. Then, a given-size liquidity shock generates a greater
effect on asset prices because liquidity providers are constrained all at the same time and
require a higher liquidity premium, which in turn means greater asset price discount for a

given liquidity shock. Further, in a bid to improve the liquidity of their balance sheets in

such times, financial intermediaries exhibit greater aversion to holding less liquid assets and
opt for more liquid ones.
    This generates a link between adverse economic shocks and financial sector stress on

the one hand and the return-liquidity risk relation on the other. Of particular relevance to

corporate bonds is the fact that financial institutions are usually the marginal price-setters in

these markets, so that this link should be more pronounced.10 We therefore test the following
conditional effect of liquidity risk on corporate bonds: In episodes of adverse economic

conditions, a rise in market illiquidity leads to a decline in all bond prices; however, in

such periods investors substitute from less liquid to more liquid bonds, so that the effect

of liquidity risk is exacerbated for less liquid (junk) bonds, while liquid (investment-grade)
bonds become more desirable.11


4.1. Regime-switching model of bond betas

    We perform a regime-switching analysis of corporate bond betas on various risk factors,
separately for investment-grade and junk bonds. In essence, we let the data tell us whether
there is a set of times when betas are substantially different than in other times. This method
is used by Hamilton (1989) to study the apparent tendency of gross domestic product (GDP)
  10
      This intuition is consistent with Garleanu and Pedersen (2009) who show that an asset’s required return
depends not only on traditional risk factors, but also on the asset’s exposure to conditions that cause some
of its marginal investors to face rising funding constraints, and on the share of such constrained investors
among the asset holders.
   11
      Amihud (2002, p. 45) provides a similar analysis for stocks.

growth to behave quite differently during economic downturns. This differential behavior
is a prevalent feature of financial data as well and the regime-switching approach has been

used to examine how they could be detected in asset prices, as in Ang and Bekaert (2002a).
Watanabe and Watanabe (2008) suggest a regime-switching pattern of the cross-sectional
pricing of liquidity risk of stock returns, with the regime-switching being based on market
turnover. Ang and Timmermann (2011) estimate regime-switching models for stocks (the

S&P 500 excess returns), the three-month T-bill yields, and the foreign exchange excess

return, suggesting that financial markets often change their behavior abruptly with the new
behavior of financial variables persisting for several periods after such a change.


4.1.1. Methodology

   We estimate a Markov regime-switching model for corporate bond betas, allowing the

intercepts and the slope coefficients (betas) of bond return models to vary between two

regimes. The model also allows the variance-covariance matrix to change between the two
regimes. We use two value-weighted portfolio return series, one of investment-grade (IG)

bonds and one of junk bonds.

   Investment-grade bond excess returns (over the 30-day T-bill return) in Regime k (st = k)

for k ∈ {1, 2}, are assumed to be generated by the process:


                              k     k                k
                     RIG,t = αIG + βIG,T × T ermt + βIG,D × Deft
                              k                  k
                           + βIG,Si × Silliqt + βIG,Bi × Billiqt + ǫkIG,t .              (3)


   The state variable st determines whether it is regime 1 or regime 2 and the Markov
switching probability for state transition is specified as:


                               P (st = 1 | st−1 = 1) = p , and                           (4)

                               P (st = 2 | st−1 = 2) = q .                               (5)



                                               14
   Similarly, junk grade bond excess returns (over the 30-day T-bill return) in Regime k
(st = k) for k ∈ {1, 2}, are assumed to be generated by the process:


                           k       k                  k
                RJunk,t = αJunk + βJunk,T × T ermt + βJunk,D × Deft
                             k                    k
                          + βJunk,Si × Silliqt + βJunk,Bi × Billiqt + ǫkJunk,t .               (6)


   The Regime Dependent Variance-Covariance Matrix is specified as (st = 1,2):



                                                                        
                                        2
                                       σIG,s t
                                                       ρst σIG,st σJunk,st 
                      Ωst =                                               .
                            
                                                             2
                                 ρst σIG,st σJunk,st        σJunk,s t



   This flexible covariance structure is intended to capture the notion that variance of both

the IG and junk returns as well as the correlation between the two can be different across

the two regimes. The model is estimated using maximum likelihood estimation. Since the

estimation procedure is standard (Hamilton, 1994), we do not provide details here but only
the results. We test for linear hypothesis about the coefficients H0 : Lβ = c where L is a

matrix of coefficients for the hypotheses and c is a vector of constants. The Wald chi-squared

statistic for testing H0 is computed as χ2W = (Lβ̂ − c)′ [LV̂ (β̂)L′ ]−1 (Lβ̂ − c). Under H0 , χ2W

has an asymptotic chi-squared distribution with r degrees of freedom where r is the rank of

L and V is the variance-covariance matrix of the coefficients. Two points are in order before
we proceed. One, the probabilities of state transition are assumed to be constant rather
than varying with some exogenous condition. In this sense, the conditionality of this model

arises purely from the regime switch rather than from the likelihood of the regime switch
being based on some economic variable. We will however relate the estimated probability of
being in regimes to macroeconomic and financial market variables. Second, the model also
allows for residuals to be heteroskedastic across the two regimes.




                                                 15
4.1.2. Results

     The results in Table 3 Panel A show a clear pattern of two regimes in IG and junk bonds
with the factor betas varying, especially for the two liquidity variables. In regime 1, the

liquidity betas are mostly insignificant. For IG bonds, both liquidity betas are statistically
insignificant and for junk bonds, the beta of Silliq is significant while that of Billiq is not.
The liquidity betas in regime 2 present quite a different picture than they do in regime 1.
For junk bonds, the betas of Silliq and Billiq become more negative with high statistical
significance. The beta of Silliq rises threefold and that of Billiq rises fivefold compared to

their magnitude in regime 1. In contrast, for IG bonds, both liquidity betas become positive
with high statistical significance. The coefficient of Silliq rises more than fourfold and that
of Billiq turns from practically zero to positive. This means that the effect of illiquidity

shocks on IG bond returns is significantly less negative than the effect of these shocks on the

bond market excess return DEF.

     ENTER TABLE 3

     Panels B and C of Table 3 show statistical tests of significance for the differences in the

liquidity betas. Importantly, the joint effect of the two liquidity variables is significantly

different between the two regimes for both IG and junk bonds (Panel B), and it is also

significantly different between IG and junk bonds in either regime 1 or regime 2 (Panel C).
The difference between IG and junk bonds is less significant in regime 1 than it is in regime

2.
     The factors TERM and DEF too have some of their coefficients changing between regimes.

Notably, while the beta of DEF rises in regime 2 for IG bonds, it remains practically
unchanged for junk bonds. Comparing IG and junk bonds in regime 2 (Panel C), we note
that while there is a significant difference between the effect of DEF on their values in regime
1, this difference disappears in regime 2. Then, both IG and junk bonds are similarly affected
by DEF, in spite of their different likelihoods of default. The same applies to the betas of


                                               16
TERM: in regime 1, they are significantly different between IG and junk bonds while in
regime 2 there is no significant difference between them. We examine whether there are

lagged effects of the four explanatory variables by adding their two lagged values to the
regime-switching model. We find that the lagged variables are not statistically significant.
   A noteworthy difference between the two regimes is captured by the change in the sign of
ρSt which measures the correlation of residual returns between IG and junk bonds. While in

regime 1 we obtain a small positive estimated value, estimate ρ = 0.10, in regime 2 we obtain

quite the opposite: ρ = -0.40. That is, in regime 2, the returns which remain unexplained
by our model go in opposite directions.12 This pattern is consistent with flight to quality
and to liquidity in regime 2 by which investors switch from the riskier and less liquid junk

bonds into IG bonds which are better in these two characteristics.

   The picture that emerges from the results is as follows:

   1. There is a sharp difference in regime 2 between the effects of liquidity shocks on prices

       of IG and junk bonds. The effects go in opposite directions, being positive for IG bonds
       and negative for junk bonds. This directional difference is absent in regime 1.

   2. There is no significant difference in the effects of TERM and DEF between IG and junk

       bonds in regime 2, while in regime 1 there is a significant difference between them.

   The model’s alpha (the intercept), which measures the excess return after accounting for
the TERM and DEF premiums, is higher for junk bonds than for IG bonds, being statistically

significant only in regime 1. The higher alpha of junk bonds may reflect a premium for

liquidity risk, which is higher for these bonds. The smaller premium (alpha differential
between junk and IG bonds) in regime 2 may be caused by the negative realizations in junk
bond returns in that regime, which is associated with economic stress (see below).13
  12
      Pastor and Stambaugh (2003) show that in months when liquidity falls severely there is negative
correlation between stock and fixed-income returns.
   13
      Our model’s results are robust if we control for default risk using each firm’s equity returns
value-weighted in the portfolio as in Shaefer and Strebulaev (2008) instead of DEF and change in equity
market volatility as additional control variables.



                                                  17
   Next, we assess the contribution of the regime-switching model to the in-sample accuracy
of estimation by regressing actual bond returns in each regime on predicted returns. Ideally,

the intercept in this regression should be zero and the slope coefficient should obviously be
1.0. We generate predicted returns in two ways: (a) from the regime-switching model for
that regime, and (b) from an unconditional model whose coefficients are the same for the
entire sample period, obtained by estimating our model with fixed coefficients over 1973 -

2007.

   Table 3 Panel D shows the estimated coefficients from the regression of actual returns on
predicted returns. There are four regressions: for each of the two regimes, we do a regression
for IG and junk bonds. Whereas the conditional model produces predicted returns that

result in a slope coefficient of practically 1.0 (as trivially expected) and an intercept of zero,

the predicted returns from the unconditional model result in a slope coefficient which is away

from 1.0. In regime 1, the coefficients of the predicted returns are significantly below 1.0 for
both IG and junk bonds, meaning an underestimation of positive returns and overestimates

of negative returns. In regime 2, it is the opposite. The predicted slope coefficient is greater

than 1.0, implying that the predicted returns overestimate positive returns and underestimate

negative returns. Altogether, the results from this table show the extent of improvement in
the predictive power of the model when using our regime-switching regression.

   As for the economic significance of the effect of liquidity risk on bond returns, we obtain
that the effect roughly doubles in the stress regime.14 We measure the economic significance
of the liquidity factors as Coef f ∗ σf actor /σreturn , where Coef f is the slope coefficient of

the respective factor. Coef f and the two standard deviations are calculated separately for
regimes 1 and 2. We observe that the economic significance of the effects of the two liquidity
factors, Silliq and Billiq, is quite low in regime 1 but it greatly rises in regime 2. For IG
bonds, the effect of Silliq rises from 2% to 8% and that of Billiq rises from 0.9% to 7%. For
junk bonds, the rise in the effect of Silliq is from 8% to 14% and for Billiq the rise is from

4.1.3. The economic identification of regimes: Stress and macroeconomic factors

    So far we have derived the regimes from a purely statistical procedure without any

economic input. The greater sensitivity of bond prices to default risk and liquidity risk
in regime 2 suggests that regime 2 is associated with periods of economic stress. We now
formally investigate this important issue. We undertake an economic identification of the

regimes, using macroeconomic variables and confirm that regime 2 is indeed associated with
economic conditions that can be collectively defined as “stress.”

    ENTER FIGURE 4

    In Fig. 4, we plot the model-implied probability of being in the stress regime.15 The

stress regime picks up most data points of being in a recession during the 1970s (picking

up the oil-price shock of the mid-70s and the high interest-rate regime of the late 70s) and

early 1980s (again, during the high interest-rate environment) and the financial market stress
and the ensuing recession during the period 1998 - 2003. The regime-switching model also

appears to pick up stress in 1989 leading up to the NBER recession of 1990 and 1991, and

does not identify the mid-90s as a stress period. Yet, the Russian default and LTCM episode
of 1998 are identified as being in the stress regime. The collapse of the Internet bubble
in March 2000 and the economic downturn that followed (including the aftermath of the
9/11/2001 attack) are also identified as stress regimes. Finally, the probability of being in a

stress regime rises starting in 2007 but not as dramatically (we later present out-of-sample
analysis for 2008 - 2009).
    We formally estimate the economic determinants of being in regime 2 by a multivariate
regression model where the dependent variable is the probability of being in regime 2, denoted
  15
     This probability of being in state 2 is calculated at time t as the sum of two products: the product of
the transition probability from state 1 to state 2 with the probability of being in state 1 at time t-1, and
the product of the transition probability from state 2 to state 2 with the probability of being in state 2 at
time t-1. This sum is then multiplied by the ratio of the density under state 2 at time t to the conditional
density of the t th observation. See Hamilton (1994) for details.

                                                     19
P 2. This probability is modeled as a function of economic and financial variables associated
with market conditions and business cycles, observed with (at least) one-month lag. These

variables are as follows (described in greater detail in Appendix A):
   (i) NBER recession dummy variable: equals one in quarters defined by the NBER to
be a recession. We exclude this variable from some of our estimations because the NBER
declares a recession ex post with significant delay, while we want the information about the

variables to be contemporaneous.

   (ii) SW index: the Chicago Fed’s CFNAI index a follow-up measure of the Stock and
Watson (1989, 2002) recession index. Larger numbers indicate better business conditions.
   (iii) Prob(Recession)-Hamilton: a dummy variable that equals one if the probability of

recession estimated from a Hamilton (1989) model on US GNP growth rates is greater than

70% (see Appendix B for its construction, also employing a regime-switching model).

   (iv) Negative market return dummy variable: equals one if there have been three consecutive
months of negative market returns (including the given month), based on the CRSP value-weighted

market return.

   (v) Business conditions index, due to Aruoba, Diebold, and Scotti (2009): it is designed

to track real business conditions at high frequency. The average value of this index is zero.
Bigger positive values indicate better-than-average conditions.

   (vi) Paper-bill spread: the difference between the three-month nonfinancial commercial
paper rate and the three-month T-bill secondary market rate. This spread indicates adverse
financial and economic conditions.

   (vii) TED spread: the difference between the interbank loan rate and the T-bill rate.
This spread indicates adverse financial and economic conditions. Since the TED spread is
highly correlated with the paper bill spread, we use the component that is orthogonal to the
paper bill spread.
   (viii) EE measure: the growth in balance-sheet of broker-dealers, as a measure of risk
appetite of financial intermediaries motivated by Adrian and Shin (2010), and employed


                                             20
by Etula (2009). We use the growth in intermediaries’ (aggregate broker-dealer) assets
relative to household asset growth as a measure of aggregate speculators’ ease of access to

capital. This variable is constructed from the US Flow of Funds data which are available
only at quarterly frequency for the full sample period. In our prediction, we use the growth
rates based on the past one year’s data. A rise in EE measure indicates expectations of
good business conditions. However, when growth in this variable is coupled with equity

market volatility, it indicates worsening conditions and involuntary increase in broker-dealer

inventory.
   (ix) Equity market volatility: the square root of the monthly average of the squared daily
returns on the CRSP value-weighted index with dividends.

   We do a pair of tests using two dependent variables. One is the probability of regime 2

for month t, P 2t , which is estimated from our regime-switching model (see Hamilton, 1994).

We employ a standard logit transformation of this probability, log[(P 2t + c)/(1 − P 2t + c)],
where c = 0.5/419 is a constant that is added in order to accommodate the cases where we

estimate P 2 = 1 or P 2 = 0.16 The second is a dummy variable that equals 1.0 if P 2t > 0.70

(this threshold is also used by Hamilton, 1989). The first model is estimated by OLS and

the second by logit.

   ENTER TABLE 4

   The estimation results, presented in Table 4, show that regime 2 is associated with
economic downturns. The signs of all the macroeconomic and financial variables are consistent

with the probability of regime 2 being higher in times of adverse economic conditions. We
obtain positive coefficients for the NBER recession, Prob(Recession)-Hamilton, Negative
market return dummy, Paper-bill spread, TED spread, and Equity volatility. These variables
increase in value under economic stress. And, we obtain negative coefficients for SW index
and for Business conditions index that rise in value in economic upturn, so their negative
coefficients mean that the probability of regime 2 is associated with economic downturn. The
  16
       See Cox (1970, p. 33).

                                             21
negative coefficient of the EE measure suggests that as broker-dealers foresee the good times
and increase their inventories, or increase their risk appetite when the economy is headed

into good times, regime 2 is less likely. But the interaction between Equity volatility and
the EE measure is positive and significant.17 This means that in times of high volatility,
a rise in the EE measure may indicate involuntary increase in intermediaries’ inventories
which is associated with a greater likelihood of the stress regime, which subsequently induces

deleveraging events as observed in 2007 and 2008 in financial markets.

    In general, the robust conclusion that emerges is that regime 2 is associated with adverse
macroeconomic and stock market conditions. Hence, we call it the “stress” regime and
regime 1 the “normal” regime. When employed in isolation, the explanatory power (R2 ) of

the regime determinants is of the order of 11% to 28%. When all variables are used to explain

the model-implied probability of being in the stress regime, the R2 exceeds 40%. In the model

with all variables (excluding the NBER recession dummy, which is known only ex post), those
that emerge as having the greatest statistical significance are Prob(Recession)-Hamilton,

Business conditions index, TED spread, EE measure, Equity volatility, and the interaction

of the last two. In the logit regression with the stress regime dummy variable, the variable

Negative market return dummy is also significant.
    These results provide a measure of confidence that our regime-switching results on liquidity

betas of bonds (Table 3) have sound economic foundations. In this light, it is clearer why in
regime 2-the stress regime-there is greater sensitivity of bond returns to liquidity shocks and
why bond returns become more sensitive to TERM and DEF, the term factor and the default

risk factor. These two factors already reflect information about the business cycle.18 Notably,
our result on shifts in regimes as business conditions change is obtained after controlling for
the business cycle information captured by the changing values of TERM and DEF.
   17
    See Comerton-Forde et al. (2010) on the interaction between dealers’ inventories, liquidity, and volatility.
   18
    For example, Fama and French (1989) identify the default spread as a business cycle variable, and Ang
and Bekaert (2002b) find that short- and long-term government-bond interest rates exhibit regime-switching
behavior which corresponds to business cycles (recessions) in the US

4.2. Out-of-sample regime prediction during 1990–2007

   The economic foundations of the stress regime (regime 2) enable us to predict its probability
based on economic time-series and subsequently to predict corporate bond returns. We

provide a prediction of the probability of being in regime 2 of the Markov regime-switching
model of Table 3 using the economic variables identified in Table 4. First, we use a model
similar to model (14) in Table 4 that includes all the economic indicators except the NBER
recession (which is determined with hindsight) to predict the stress regime, employing only
the data for the first half of our sample period, 1/1973 to 12/1989. After estimating the

coefficients in this model, we predict the probability of being in the stress regime, P̂ 2, for
the second half of the sample period, 1/1990 to 12/2007, using a rolling estimation, month
by month. That is, we roll forward every month, using the data available until the previous

month to develop a predictive model for the stress regime and then use this model to predict

stress regime for the current month, repeating this process until the end of the sample. For
example, we predict the stress regime for the month 1/1990 using data until 12/1989 and

coefficient estimates of a model similar to model (14) in Table 4. Then, for month 2/1990,

we use all data until 1/1990 to re-estimate this model and generate P̂ 2, and so on.

   After having obtained the series P̂ 2 for the period 1/1990 - 12/2007, we do a logit

regression of the likelihood of being in regime 2, obtained from our statistical model of
Table 3, Panel A, on the predicted probability P̂ 2. The dependent variable is a dummy
variable that equals one if the actual probability of being in regime 2, estimated from the

regime-switching model, is above 70%.

   ENTER TABLE 5


   The results in Table 5 show how well the likelihood of being in regime 2 is predicted by the
economic series-based estimated regime-2 probability P̂ 2. The coefficient of P̂ 2 is positive
and significant, and its pseudo R-squared is 27%. We demonstrate the performance of the
model by its accuracy in discriminating regime-2 months from normal months, employing


                                              23
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The ROC curve analysis works
as follows. For every possible cut-off point or criterion value selected in the logit model

to discriminate between the two regimes, there is some fraction of cases with the stress
months correctly classified as “True Positive” (TP) and some fraction of cases with the
stress months classified “False Negative” (FN). Also, some fraction of normal months will
be correctly classified as non-stress months or “True Negative” (TN) while some fraction of

normal months will be classified as stress months or “False Positive” (FP). In an ROC curve,

the TP rate (Sensitivity) is plotted as a function of the FP rate (1-Specificity) for different
cut-off points of P̂ 2. Each point on the ROC plot represents a sensitivity/specificity pair
corresponding to a particular decision threshold. A completely random guess would produce

a point along a diagonal line (called line of no-discrimination) from the left-bottom to the

top-right corners. A test with perfect discrimination (no overlap in the two regimes) has

an ROC plot that passes through the upper-left corner (100% specificity, 100% sensitivity).
Therefore, the closer the ROC plot is to the upper-left corner, the higher the overall accuracy

of the test.

   We present a figure that displays the ROC curve to assess the accuracy of this logit

model to predict regime 2, the stress regime. In the Y -axis we plot the true positive rate
(sensitivity), i.e., the proportion of actual stress regime months correctly classified by the

model. In the X -axis we plot the false positive rate (1-specificity), the proportion of normal
regime months, incorrectly classified as stress regime months by the model. Points above
the diagonal (random guess) indicate good classification results. The area under the curve

measures the accuracy of the model. The model has an accuracy rate which is quite high,
88.81%. That is, using lagged economic conditions in real time, the model is able to predict
the stress regimes in corporate bond returns with high accuracy.

4.3. Out-of-sample predictions of bond returns during 2008–2009

   We now test the accuracy of out-of-sample prediction of bond returns based on our
regime-switching model during the financial crisis of 2008 and the relatively less stressed

period of 2009. We predict the probability of a given month during 2008 and 2009 being
in the stress regime by using the macroeconomic and financial market variables included in
model (14) in Table 4 and the coefficients of that estimation model to obtain the predicted
probability of being in regime 2. Then, we calculate the predicted bond returns for each
regime in each month of 2008 and 2009 using the coefficients estimated on TERM, DEF,

and liquidity risk factors in each regime shown in Table 3 Panel A and employing the realized
values of TERM, DEF, and liquidity risk factors. Finally, we calculate the average return
in the month by weighting the regime 1- and regime 2-predicted returns by the respective

regime probabilities obtained in the previous step. This weighted-average return constitutes

the predicted bond return for that month, conditional on the realized values of the four
factors. For realized bond returns in each month of 2008 and 2009 for IG and junk bonds,

we use data on iShares investment-grade and high-yield bond index, which are the most

recent data available to us.19

   ENTER TABLE 6, and ENTER FIGURE 5


   In Table 6 Panel A we present the estimated values of P̂ 2, the regime-2 probability.
Notably, the period with the cluster of values equal or close to 1.0 is the second half of 2008,
especially following the Lehman Brothers collapse in September 2008. Later in 2009, P̂ 2 is

mostly lower.
   Table 6, Panel B presents results on the test of the quality of the predicted returns. We
do that in a regression model of the actual bond return as function of the predicted bond
return. In such a regression with an ideal predictor, the intercept should be zero and the
slope coefficient should be 1.0. Our results satisfy these criteria. The slope coefficients on the
  19
       The Merrill Lynch data on corporate bonds available to us end in December 2007.


                                                    25
predicted returns are statistically indistinguishable from 1.0 (at the 0.10 level) for both IG
and junk bond grades, and the constant is not different from zero in both these regressions.

The regression has a reasonably good fit of 77% for the IG bonds and 76% for the junk grade
bonds. Fig. 5 plots the actual-predicted return relation against the 45% line of perfect fit
and shows that the two are quite close. In addition, the root mean squared error (RMSE) of
the regression is very close to the RMSE of the 100% fit, again suggesting that the predicted

returns do a good job in explaining the actual returns.

   Overall, we conclude that our regime-switching model provides a good description of
bond returns during the financial crisis year of 2008 as well as the relatively less stressed
period of 2009. The model captures the dynamics of corporate bond returns both in regime

2, which in 2008 corresponds to all months except January and June, as well as in regime 1,

corresponding to six months in the year 2009.


5. Conditional liquidity risk of stock returns

   We extend our examination of conditional liquidity risk to stock returns of firms classified

by their book-to-market ratio. Fama and French (1995, p. 154) state: “Firms with high
BE/ME (a low stock price relative to book value) tend to be persistently distressed. They

have low ratios of earnings to book equity for at least 11 years around portfolio formation.

Conversely, low BE/ME (a high stock price relative to book value) is associated with
sustained strong profitability.” This follows from their finding that firms with high book-to-market

ratio tend to have low earnings on book equity which persist for at least five years before
and five years after book-to-market equity is measured. High book-to-market stocks are
also associated with lower liquidity. Fang, Noe, and Tice (2009) find in a cross-firms study
that stocks which have higher illiquidity (measured by the effective bid-ask spread or by the
Amihud illiquidity measure) have significantly lower market-to-book ratio (or, conversely,
have higher book-to-market ratio) after controlling for firms’ characteristics. It follows
that high book-to-market stocks share the same characteristics as junk bonds: They are


                                              26
associated with greater economic distress and greater illiquidity. We test whether the impact
of liquidity shocks on returns of stocks classified by their book-to-market ratio varies over

time in the same way that it does for bonds, and whether these variations are also related
to macroeconomic and financial conditions of stress, as we find that it is for bonds.


5.1. Methodology

   We construct two portfolios of stock returns differentiated by book-to-market ratio and
apply our regime-switching methodology to estimating the factors that affect their return.

In every month (between 1973 - 2007), we use the classification of Fama and French of
non-financial firm stocks in the CRSP database (NYSE, Amex, and Nasdaq) into the lowest
and the highest book-to-market (BM) quintile portfolios and their returns in excess of the

risk-free rate as our dependent variables in our regime-switching model.

   We then estimate the following model that includes two sets of equations (Eq. 7 and Eq.

10), one for excess returns on low BM stocks and one for excess returns on high default-risk
stocks. The model allows the coefficients as well as the variance-covariance matrix to change

between the regimes. BM stock portfolio excess returns (over the 30-day T-bill return) in

Regime k (st = k) for k ∈ {1, 2}, are assumed to be generated by the process:




                    k      k                         k               k
          rLow,t = αLow + βLow,Rmt (Rm,t − Rf,t ) + βLow,T T ERMt + βLow,D DEFt
                     k                  k
                  + βLow,Sit Silliqt + βLow,Bit Billiqt + ǫkLow,t .                       (7)


   The state variable st determines whether it is regime 1 or regime 2 and the Markov
switching probability for state transition is specified as:


                                P (st = 1 | st−1 = 1) = p , and                           (8)

                                P (st = 2 | st−1 = 2) = q .                               (9)



                                                 27
   Similarly, high book-to-market stock portfolio excess returns (over the risk-free rate) in
Regime k (st = k) for k ∈ {1, 2}, are assumed to be generated by the process:


                   k       k                          k                k
        rHigh,t = αHigh + βHigh,Rmt (Rm,t − Rf,t ) + βHigh,T T ERMt + βHigh,D DEFt
                   k                  k
                + βLow,Sit Silliqt + βLow,Bit Billiqt + ǫkLow,t .                       (10)




The Regime Dependent Variance-Covariance Matrix is specified as (st = 1,2):



                                                                         

                                                       ρst σLow,st σHigh,st 
                    Ωst =                                                  .
                          
                                                              2
                                ρst σLow,st σHigh,st         σHigh,s t



   The explanatory variables include the market excess return Rm − Rf , the value-weighted

return on all NYSE, Amex, and Nasdaq stocks (from CRSP) in excess of the one-month

Treasury bill rate (from Ibbotson Associates). We also include the variables TERM, DEF,
Silliq, and Billiq that have been included in the bond return models. TERM and DEF

are documented to have significant effects on stock returns (see Chen, Roll, and Ross, 1986;

and Fama and French, 1989). Fama and French (1989, p. 48) state: “[t]he default spread
is a business-conditions variable” and “the term spread is related to shorter-term measured

business cycles.” Indeed, the default yield spread (between AAA and BAA corporate bonds)
is used by Bernanke (1983) as a proxy for financial and economic crisis, and the term yield

spread is shown by Estrella and Mishkin (1998) and Estrella and Hardouvelis (1991) to
predict real economic activity (particularly recessions). Stock and Watson (2002) review
the extensive literature on the use of the default yield spread and of the term yield spread
as predictors of output growth. In the context of our model, which estimates the effects
of illiquidity shocks on stock expected returns, DEF and TERM serve to control for future
business conditions which affect firms’ expected cash flows.



                                                 28
5.2. Results

   The estimation results of the regime-switching model of stock returns are presented in
Table 7, which is analogous to Table 3 in its structure. Here, returns on stocks with low

and high book-to-market (BM) ratio replace the returns on bonds that are of investment
grade and junk rating, respectively. We first focus on the coefficients of Silliq and Billiq
which measure the effects of shocks in stock and bond illiquidity. In general, these effects
have the opposite signs for the two stock portfolios. The coefficients of Silliq and Billiq are
positive for low BM stocks and negative for high BM stocks (all conditional on the market).

In regime 2, the effects of Silliq are significant and the difference between the coefficients
for high and low BM stocks is significant as well (see the test in Panel C). The result here
on the opposite relative effects of Silliq on stocks with high and low BM is similar to the

result on the opposite relative effect of Silliq on junk and IG bonds, respectively, reported

in Table 3. The coefficient of Silliq changes significantly between regimes only for the high
BM stocks (see Panel B). In regime 2, the effect of Silliq on high BM stock returns becomes

about five times more negative than it is in regime 1. As noted earlier, in regime 2, the effect

of Silliq differs significantly between the low and high BM stocks at the 1% level whereas

in regime 1, there is no significant difference in the effect of Silliq between the low and high

BM stocks (see Panel C).

   ENTER TABLE 7

   Notably, the documented effects of Silliq are conditional on the positive effect of Rm −Rf ,
which itself is negatively affected by both Silliq and Billiq. Thus, the results mean that the

effect of Silliq on returns of stocks with low BM is less negative than it is for the market, and
the effect on high BM stocks is more negative than it is for the market. Estimating a model
with only the two liquidity variables, Silliq and Billiq, we obtain that both variables have
negative coefficients for both stock portfolios in both regimes. It is indeed expected that
the beta of illiquidity shocks is negative because expecting higher illiquidity in the future


                                               29
following a rise in illiquidity, stock prices fall (see Amihud, 2002; and Acharya and Pedersen,
2005).

   In this model, the coefficients of Silliq in regime 1 for low BM and high BM stocks are
-267 and -273, respectively, and in regime 2 they are -484 and -933. All coefficients are
significantly different from zero. These results mean that while in regime 1 the coefficients
of Silliq are almost the same for both stock portfolios, in regime 2 the liquidity beta of high

BM stocks is twice larger (more negative) than it is for low BM stocks. Also, the impact

of illiquidity shocks is much higher in regime 2 than in regime 1, particularly for high BM
stocks. It follows that in normal times, illiquidity shocks have low and similar effects on both
stock portfolios whereas in times of adverse economic conditions, there is “flight to liquidity”

which makes low BM stocks relatively more desirable. This offsets part of the negative effect

of Silliq for low BM stocks and augments its negative effect for high BM stocks.

   The variable DEF does not have its effect changing between the two regimes for either
portfolio but its effect is significantly different between the low and high BM stocks in both

regime 1 and regime 2 (at the 1% and 10% levels, respectively). The effect of TERM also does

not change significantly between the two regimes. The market excess return has a highly

significant effect on the returns of both stock portfolios, but this effect does not change
between the regimes.

   To summarize, the significant rise in the effect of Silliq in regime 2 for high BM stocks
and the difference in its effect between the two stock portfolios in regime 2, highlight the
importance of liquidity risk, given that we control for the effects of business conditions and

the likelihood of default. The effect of Billiq does not change significantly between the
regimes but it is significantly different between the two portfolios in regime 1.
   It is well known that the return on stocks with high book-to-market ratio is higher than
the return on stocks with low book-to-market ratio—this is the well-know HML premium. In
our regime-switching model, we compare the conditional means of the two stock portfolios,
measured by the models’ intercepts (alphas), which measure the return in excess of the


                                              30
premium due to Rm − Rf , TERM, and DEF. Here, we observe that the difference between
the intercepts is significant only in regime 1 but not in regime 2. Given our result on

higher liquidity betas for high BM stocks, the higher conditional mean on HML may reflect
compensation for the greater liquidity risk of high BM stocks.                        In regime 2, which is
associated with adverse economic conditions, the difference in the conditional means becomes
insignificant because of greater realized losses on the high BM stocks which Fama and French

(1995) classify as distressed stocks.

      It is therefore possible to regard the well-known HML premium as compensation (at
least in part) for higher liquidity risk, earned mainly in the “normal” regime, regime 1. This
premium disappears in regime 2. We observe in Panel C that the constant of the model—the

excess return after accounting for the risk premia—is significantly higher for high BM stocks

in regime 1, whereas in regime 2 the difference in the constants is quite insignificant.


5.3. The economic identification of regimes: Stress and macroeconomic factors

      Next, in Table 8 we estimate the economic determinants of being in regime 2 in the

case of stocks by a multivariate regression model, similar to that presented in Table 4 for

the case of corporate bonds. The dependent variable is the probability of being in regime

2, denoted P 2. This probability is plotted in Fig. 6, with the NBER recession indicator
which shows a good overlap between these variables. Thus, this probability is modeled as a
function of economic and financial variables associated with market conditions and business

cycles with one-month lag, the same as those that we have used for the corporate bond-based

regime-switching model. We do two estimations, one is an OLS estimation of a standard
logistic transformation20 of P 2, and the other is a logit estimation of a dummy variable that
equals 1.0 if P 2t > 0.70 a threshold used by Hamilton (1989).


      ENTER TABLE 8
     20
          We again employ log[(P 2t + c)/(1 − P 2t + c)], where c = 0.5/419 is a constant. See discussion of Table
4.



                                                          31
   The estimation results show again that regime 2 is associated with times of adverse
economic conditions. This is consistent across all variables. We obtain positive coefficients

for Prob(Recession)-Hamilton, Negative market return dummy, and Equity volatility. These
variables rise in value under economic stress. And, we obtain negative coefficients for SW
index and for Business conditions index, which rise in value in economic upturns. The
negative coefficient on the EE measure suggests that as broker-dealers foresee good times

and increase their inventories or increase their risk appetite, regime 2 is less likely. But

during volatile times, greater broker inventory growth is associated with a greater likelihood
of subsequent stress regime (the interaction between Equity volatility and the EE measure
is positive and significant), similar to the deleveraging events observed in 2007 and 2008 in

financial markets.

   When all variables are used to explain the model-implied probability of being in the

stress regime (excluding the NBER recession indicator, which is known only ex post), the
R2 is 30% in the OLS regression of the probability of regime 2, and 21% for the logit

regression. The evidence thus shows that regime 2, in which illiquidity shocks as well as

default shocks become significantly more important in pricing stocks of high and low default

risk, is associated with worsening macroeconomic and financial market conditions.


5.4. Direct relation to default risk

   The model estimated in Table 7 uses conventional measures to control for cash-flow risk

and default risk. We now provide direct control for default risk, calculated as the return

premium on stocks sorted on their default probability. With this control we test whether the
book-to-market return is explained by the default premium and whether, after controlling
for default, we still observe conditional liquidity risk in times of adverse economic conditions.
This will then highlight the fact that liquidity risk has a separate effect from default risk.
   We construct two portfolios of stock returns differentiated by default risk. In every
month (between 1973 - 2007), we classify non-financial firm stocks in the CRSP database


                                               32
(NYSE, Amex, and Nasdaq) into 25 (5x5) portfolios sorted on stock return volatility and on
their modified Z -score (an estimate of the likelihood of default, not based on stock market

values). This is done so as not to confound the effect of default with that of volatility,
given the positive correlation between them across firms, documented by Campbell et al.
(2008), and the negative effect of return volatility on expected return, shown by Amihud
(2002) and Ang et al. (2006).21 For each month we calculate for each stock the modified

Z -score,22 using the most recent accounting data and end-of-month market value data, and

the standard deviation of daily stock returns from that month. Then we sort stocks into five
equal volatility-based quintiles and within each quintile we sort the stocks into five equal
portfolios based on the modified Z -score. We then calculate the value-weighted return for

each of the 25 portfolios. The low (high) default-risk stock return is the average return

of the five portfolios with the highest (lowest) modified Z -score, respectively. We use an

accounting-based measure of default risk in order to avoid issues with stock return-based
measures of default-risk, given that our dependent variable is itself a stock return. For

example, because debt levels change very little in the short run, using a stock-market-based

measure of default probability, which is based on equity market value and volatility, may

capture the effects of past stock returns and volatility on current returns even if this is
unrelated to default.

    The excess return on high book-to-market stocks is known to be positive and significant
(Fama and French, 1993), and so it is in our sample. We calculate the excess return HMLBM
which stands for high-minus-low book-to-market, the differential return on the two extreme

quintile stock portfolios Hi BM and Lo BM. The mean HMLBM is 50 basis points (per
  21
      By classifying on both volatility and the likelihood of default, we follow the methodology of Fama and
French (1993, pp. 8 - 9) who construct their HML index so as not to confound the book-to-market effect
with the size effect.
   22
      The modified Z-score, which relates to that of Altman, follows the specification of Hillegeist et al.
(2004): -4.34-0.08*wcta+0.04*reta-0.1*ebitta-0.22*mvliab+0.06*sata. wcta is the ratio of working capital
to total assets (Compustat item (actq-lctq)/atq). reta is the ratio of retained earnings to total assets
(Compustat item req/atq). ebitta is the ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to total assets (Compustat
item (piq+xintq)/atq). mvliab is the ratio of market value of equity to total liabilities (Compustat item
prccq*cshoq/ltq). sata is the ratio of sales to total assets (Compustat item saleq/atq).

month) with t = 2.96. We also calculate HMLDEF, the differential return on the two
extreme quintile stock portfolios sorted on their default probability. HMLDEF thus captures

the return premium due to default risk, unrelated to liquidity risk. We examine the relation
between HMLDEF and liquidity shocks by regressing it on Silliq and Billiq and find that
the coefficients are insignificantly different from zero. The mean HMLDEF is 58 basis points
with (t = 2.42), about the same as that HMLBM.

   We then estimate a regime-switching model where HMLBM is regressed on HMLDEF,

Silliq, Billiq, and a constant, allowing for the estimated parameters to vary between the
regimes as we do in Eqs. (7) - (9) (we skip the detailed presentation to save space). The
estimation results are presented in Table 9.


   ENTER TABLE 9

   The positive and highly significant coefficient of HMLDEF in both regimes suggests that

the well-known HMLBM return premium is largely explained by the default premium. The
models’ intercepts, the alphas, become insignificantly different from zero in both regimes; in

regime 1, the “normal” regime, the intercept is even negative though quite insignificant. The

coefficient of HMLDEF rises in regime 2, but the difference between the coefficients is not

statistically significant (see Panel B). The only significant difference between the estimated

coefficients in the two regimes is observed for Silliq. Its coefficient is 9.38 in regime 1 with
t = 0.05, being practically zero, whereas in regime 2 the Silliq coefficient becomes highly

negative, -433.39, with t = 4.89, highly significant. The difference between the coefficients

of Silliq in the two regimes is statistically significant (see Panel B). The coefficient of Billiq
also becomes more negative in regime 2, but it is insignificantly different from zero in both
regimes.
   In conclusion, the difference between the two regimes is mainly driven by the significant
increase in the stock liquidity risk: its coefficient becomes negative and highly significant in
regime 2, which is associated with adverse economic conditions, after accounting for default


                                               34
risk, which is captured by HMLDEF.


5.5. Relation between stress regimes for bonds and stocks

   The estimations of the three regime-switching models in Tables 3, 7, and 9 produce

monthly estimates of the probability of being in regime 2. We now relate these estimates of
the probability of the “stress” regime-regime 2-to each other. Notably, they are estimated
separately from corporate bond and stock returns in different models. For convenience,
denote the variable P rob(Regime 2)Bond
                                   t    , estimated from the model for bond returns in

Table 3, by BP 2, the variable P rob(Regime 2)Stock
                                              t     , obtained from the model for stock
returns in Table 8 by SP 2, and the variable P rob(Regime 2)Def
                                                            t
                                                                ault
                                                                     , obtained from Table
9, by Def P 2. If these three series indeed reflect similar economic conditions, they should

be positively correlated. Indeed, Tables 4 and 9 show that BP 2 and SP 2 are predicted by

the same economic variables. This can also be seen by visually inspecting BP 2 and SP 2 in

Figs. 4 and 6, respectively. Confirming this, we find the following:

   Corr(BP 2t , SP 2t ) = 0.57

   Corr(BP 2t , Def P 2t ) = 0.48
   Corr(SP 2t , Def P 2t ) = 0.52


   These correlations are highly significant with p-values of less than 0.01. However, all
three series are highly serially correlated, so we use their first difference, denoted by ∆BP 2t ,
∆SP 2t , and ∆Def P 2t whose serial autocorrelations are low. Regressing ∆BP 2t on ∆SP 2t

(and a constant), the coefficient is 0.15 with t=2.98, statistically significant. Again, we
observe that the two estimates of the probability of regime 2, obtained from separate sets of

securities - stocks and bonds - are positively and significantly correlated. Finally, we regress
∆Def P 2t on the other two first differences in probability of regime 2 (and a constant). The
coefficient of ∆SP 2t is 0.10 (t = 4.73) and the coefficient of ∆BP 2t is 0.08 (t = 3.51),
both are highly significant. The strong link between the estimated probabilities of being in


                                               35
regime 2 for both bonds and stocks suggests that these probabilities are driven by common
underlying factors.


5.6. The co-movement of asset returns in the stress regime

   A popular hypothesis states that asset returns co-move more closely together in stress
periods caused by liquidity shocks. We examine this hypothesis by creating two variables,
RJunk rHigh which is the product of return on junk bonds and returns of the high BM stock
portfolio, both related to firms that are in financial distress (see Fama and French, 1995), and

we create an analogous series, RIG rLow , the product of returns on investment-grade bonds
and on low BM stocks, both associated with firms that are in better financial condition. A
positive product implies that the two asset returns move more closely together in the same

direction.

   We estimate a regression model of RIG rLow or RJunk rHigh on BP 2 (and a constant). A

positive coefficient of BP 2 is then consistent with the above hypothesis. We obtain that
indeed when the dependent variable is RJunk rHigh , the coefficient of BP 2 is positive and

highly significant: it is 51,254 (in bp) with t = 3.53.23 The coefficient of BP 2 with RIG rLow as

the dependent variable is quite insignificant (t = -0.44). When adding Rm − Rf to the model

with RJunk rHigh as dependent variable, the coefficient of BP 2 remains positive, 56,068, with t
= 3.96, highly significant, and the coefficient of Rm −Rf is positive and significant (t = 4.92).
The coefficient of BP 2 with RIG rLow as the dependent variable remains insignificant (t =
-0.03) when Rm −Rf is added to the model. Similar results are obtained when replacing BP 2

by B̂P 2 from Table 4, estimated by specification (14). These results support the hypothesis

that returns on distressed assets co-move more closely together in times of economic stress
whose likelihood is estimated by our regime-switching model.
  23
       The t-statistics are calculated using robust standard errors.

6. Discussion

6.1. Flight to liquidity, default risk, and T-bill returns

   One interpretation of our results is that, consistent with the literature on asset pricing
with frictions discussed in Section 4, stressed macroeconomic and financial conditions make
investors more averse to illiquidity shocks and they respond by switching from illiquid assets,
such as junk bonds, to investment-grade bonds which are known to be more liquid.24 An
alternative explanation is that the rise in the effect of liquidity shocks on bond prices proxies
for heightened investor risk-aversion to extreme events or rare disasters (Rietz, 1988; and
Barro, 2006). Such events are argued to affect consumption significantly or are argued to be

not well understood, so that an increase in their likelihood induces an aversion to riskier assets
such as junk bonds. Similar to this second explanation is the volatility feedback explanation

of Campbell and Hentschel (1992) by which increases in aggregate volatility necessitate a

reduction in investor holdings of risky assets, which in general equilibrium, implies lower
contemporaneous returns. In what follows, we test for distinct effects of risk and liquidity on

bond prices which imply, respectively, flight-to-quality/safety or flight-to-liquidity (or both).

   ENTER TABLE 10

   Column 1 in Table 10, Panel A, shows that the factor DEF captures only the common
part of the illiquidity effect on IG and junk bond returns, but not the part that is associated

with regime 2. While both Billiq and Silliq effects are statistically significant, Adj R2
is quite low, only 3%, and the interaction of liquidity factors and Prob(Regime 2)Bonds is
insignificant. The pattern that emerges is that default risk is distinct from liquidity risk,
especially in the stress regime identified using corporate bond returns.
   In columns 2 and 3, the dependent variable is -(T-bill yield minus Fed funds rate). This
variable, which rises with the price of T-bills, is immune to default risk, reflecting only
  24
      Chen, Lesmond, and Wei (2007) show that generally, investment-grade bonds have lower bid-ask spread,
(quoted or implied) than junk bonds. Also, the frequency of zero-return days, another common proxy of
illiquidity, is of the order of 6% - 10% for investment-grade bonds and 20% - 40% for junk bonds.

                                                   37
liquidity risk. It is also immune to policy effects and to maturity risk because the Fed funds
rate is for very short maturities.25 If a rise in illiquidity generates flight to liquidity, then

investors will switch from all types of risk and illiquid investments to short-term T-bills which
are the least risky and most liquid instrument. Then, their price will rise and their yield will
fall and -(T-bill yield minus Fed funds rate) will rise. It is worth noting that the inclusion of
Prob(Regime 2)Bonds and its association with bond illiquidity greatly raises the explanatory

power of the model, from Adj R2 of 3% to Adj R2 of 12%, demonstrating the importance of

our estimates of Prob(Regime 2)Bonds on the pricing of Treasury bills, which become a haven
for liquidity seekers in times of stress. Also notable is the result that T-bills’ prices rise with
an increase in illiquidity only in regime 2—the coefficient of Billiq is practically zero while

the coefficient of Prob(Regime 2)Bonds * Billiq is positive and significant. This shows that the

behavior of Treasury bills’ prices is similar to that of investment-grade bonds. In contrast,

T-bill returns do not vary with an increase in default risk in the stress regime (Prob (Regime
2)Bonds * DEF is insignificant). This is also consistent with a flight-to-liquidity phenomenon

rather than a flight-to-quality.

   Comparing specifications (2) and (4), it is worth noting that the inclusion of Prob(Regime

2)Stocks and its association with bond illiquidity greatly raises the explanatory power of the
model: Adj R2 rises from 3% to 6%. This demonstrates the importance of our estimates

of Prob(Regime 2)Stocks as well on the pricing of Treasury bills, and, while T-bill returns
are insensitive to Prob(Regime 2)Bonds *DEF, they do react significantly to Prob(Regime
2)Stocks *DEF.


6.2. Flight to liquidity and bond maturity

   In Table 10, Panel B, we first study how the differential bond return—Junk return
minus IG return—is explained by default and liquidity risks in normal times and in times
of stress (regime 2) identified in the bond return regime-switching model. The estimation
  25
    This is similar to the test of Amihud and Mendelson (1991) on the yield spread between T-bills and
Treasury notes of the same maturity.


                                                 38
in column 1 omits the liquidity variables, which are included in column 2. Two points are
noteworthy. First, the inclusion of the liquidity variables greatly raises (by almost two-thirds)

the explanatory power of the model, from Adj R2 = 11% to Adj R2 = 18%. This attests to
the importance of liquidity risk in determining the junk-IG differential return. Second, the
effect of the two liquidity variables is significant mainly when associated with Prob(Regime
2), the probability of the stress regime. The negative and significant coefficients of the

liquidity risk factors in stress times indicate flight to liquidity, in addition to the flight to

safety which is captured by the negative coefficient of Prob(Regime 2)*DEF.
   We expect that the effects of liquidity shocks on bond returns that we have documented
are greater for longer-maturity bonds, which have greater duration in the sense of having

greater price elasticity to yield change. Also, because long-term corporate bonds are less

liquid than short-term bonds (see Chen et al., 2007), we expect that long-term bond returns

are more sensitive to liquidity shocks than are short-term bond returns. To test this, we
create three portfolios of junk-minus-IG returns for three different maturities: short—less

than four years to maturity, medium—between four and nine years to maturity, and long—more

than nine years to maturity. We expect that in the stress regime (regime 2), the effects of

liquidity shocks will increase with maturity.
   The results in the last three columns (3, 4, and 5) of Table 10 Panel B are consistent

with our expectations. The coefficients of Silliq and Billiq are all negative, because a
rise in illiquidity lowers the prices of the less-liquid junk bond relative to that of the more
liquid IG bonds. Notably, the effects of both Silliq and Billiq become much more negative

and highly significant when interacting with Prob(Regime 2), with the effect being stronger
for longer-maturity bonds. This means that in the stress regime, the differential effect of
illiquidity shocks on the junk-IG return spread is particularly high. These effects of liquidity
risk are present after controlling for the effect of default risk (captured by the factor DEF),
in both normal times and stress times.




                                                39
7. Related literature on bond yields and liquidity

   The effect of liquidity on bond yields is shown for government securities that have the
same risk but differ in their liquidity by Amihud and Mendelson (1991), Boudoukh and
Whitelaw (1993), Kamara (1994), Elton and Green (1998), and Longstaff (2004). They all

find that the bond yield rises as a function of illiquidity.
   For corporate bonds, Chen, Lesmond, and Wei (2007) find that less liquid bonds (mostly
speculative-grade bonds) have higher yield after controlling for default risk and other bond

features. de Jong and Driessen (2007), Downing, Underwood, and Xing (2009), and Lin,
Wang, and Wu (2011) find that expected return on corporate bonds is increasing in their
liquidity risk (beta), following the analysis for stocks in Pastor and Stambaugh (2003) and
Acharya and Pedersen (2005).

   Recent studies, for example, Goldstein, Hotchkiss, and Sirri (2007), Edwards, Harris, and
Piwowar (2007), Dick-Nielsen, Feldhutter, and Lando (2008), Bushman, Le, and Vasvari

(2009), and Friewald, Jankowitsch, and Subrahmanyam (2009), use newly available daily

trading data on corporate bonds from TRACE platform in the United States (starting in

2002). Some of these studies show that liquidity worsened substantially for corporate bonds

from the onset of the crisis (3Q/2007) and that this contributed to an enhanced response
of bond spreads or returns to liquidity. Chacko (2005) and Mahanti et al. (2008) measure

liquidity of corporate bonds by the turnover of portfolios that contain them, construct a

bond return factor based on high and low liquidity bonds, and find that its beta coefficient
explains the cross-section of bond returns.
   Our study differs from the above studies on the effects of liquidity on corporate bonds
in that we use liquidity measures that enable the study of long time-series, spanning several
economic cycles, allowing more robust inference on expected returns. Goyenko (2006) also
studies the cross-market effect of liquidity over a long time-series and finds that stock returns
as well as Treasury bond returns are affected by both stock and bond liquidity shocks. In
contrast, we study the effect of liquidity conditional on the state of the economy and find

                                               40
the conditional effects to be substantial, both for corporate bond returns and for returns on
portfolios of stocks sorted by default risk.

   Finally, recent work (Panyanukul, 2009) has also found liquidity risk to be a priced
factor in explaining sovereign bond returns, especially during the period 2007 to 2009. We
conjecture that there is a strong conditional component to liquidity effects in sovereign bond
returns too, whereby during times of macroeconomic and financial market stress, better-rated

and more liquid sovereign bonds (e.g., the US treasuries and German Bunds) appreciate in

value whereas the worse-rated and less-liquid ones decline.


8. Concluding remarks

   Our analysis of the effect of conditional liquidity risk on corporate bond returns shows
that during economic and financial stress periods, liquidity risk becomes a significant determinant

of bond prices, appreciably more so than in normal times. We find that investors exhibit

“flight to liquidity” wherein liquidity shocks raise the prices of investment-grade bonds

while depressing the prices of junk bonds (all, relative to the effect on the general bond

market). This pattern is most strongly pronounced in times of economic stress. Thus, using
unconditional or normal-time models entails significant errors for researchers and investors

in corporate bonds. For instance, the risk management of corporate bond portfolios should

consider not only their liquidity risk, but also the risk that this risk will change in stressed
market and economic conditions.

   We also find that the conditional liquidity risk patterns observed in corporate bond
returns are mirrored in returns of stocks aggregated in portfolios of firms with high and
low book-to-market ratio. Since high book-to-market ratio indicates persistent distressed
profitability (Fama and French, 1995) as well as lower stock liquidity (Fang, Noe, and Tice,
2009), this suggests that the rise in liquidity risk of distressed securities is coincident between
corporate bond and stock markets. We indeed find that the very same economic and financial
factors that explain the regimes in the bond market do that for regimes in the stock market.


                                                41
We also show that the return premium on a high-minus-low book-to-market stock portfolio
is largely explained by the default premium. However, when economic conditions change,

the exposure to the default factor remains unchanged while the exposure to liquidity shocks
increases under adverse economic conditions.


Appendix A. Recession dates (year-month) based on macroeconomic data.

   NBER business cycles: The economic expansions and recessions are determined by the
NBER business-cycle dates. The expansions (recessions) begin at the peak (trough) of the

cycles and end at the trough (peak). The following provides periods and durations (in
months) of each business-cycle phase during our sample period, January 1973 to December
2007. The business-cycle dates are available from the NBER Web site: www.nber.org/cycles.html.
The dates are 12/73 - 03/75;02/80 - 07/80;08/81 - 11/82;08/90 - 03/91; 03/01 - 11/01; and

12/07.


   Prob(Recession)-Hamilton: Following Hamilton (1989), we estimate the growth in GNP

as a regime switching model (details in Appendix B). Hamilton (1989) interprets the probability
of being in regime 1 as the recession regime. We use a cut off of the probability of being

in regime 1 greater than 70% to create this dummy variable. Quarters that are classified

as recession in this approach include: 1974-2 to 1975-1; 1980-2,3; 1981-2; 1981-4 to 1982-4;
1986-2; 1990-3 to 1991-4; 1993-2,3; 1995-2,3; 1998-2; 2000-3 to 2003-1; 2006-3 to 2007-1.


   Mkt return (negative): We code a month that is the third consecutive month in which the
CRSP value-weighted market return with dividends is negative as a one and zero otherwise.
Months classified under this classification using our sample period include: 03/73 to 06/73;
05/74 to 09/74; 09/75; 03/77; 08/81 to 09/81; 02/82 - 03/82; 07/82; 02/84; 11/87; 08/90
to 10/90; 09/99; 11/00; 08/01 - 09/01; 06/02 - 07/02; 12/02; 02/03; 07/06; and 09/07 to
12/07.

   SW index : “The Chicago Fed National Activity Index (CFNAI) is a monthly index
designed to better gauge overall economic activity and inflationary pressure. The CFNAI

is a weighted average of 85 existing monthly indicators of national economic activity. It is
constructed to have an average value of zero and a standard deviation of one. Since economic
activity tends toward trend growth rate over time, a positive index reading corresponds
to growth above trend and a negative index reading corresponds to growth below trend.

The CFNAI corresponds to the index of economic activity developed by James Stock of
Harvard University and Mark Watson of Princeton University in an article, “Forecasting
Inflation,” published in the Journal of Monetary Economics in 1999. The idea behind their
approach is that there is some factor common to all of the various inflation indicators, and

it is this common factor, or index, that is useful for predicting inflation. Research has

found that the CFNAI provides a useful gauge on current and future economic activity and
inflation in the United States.” (Reproduced from www.chicagofed.org.) An index similar

in spirit is also the business conditions index which is also used in the analysis. The (ADS)

business conditions index is based on the framework developed in Aruoba, Diebold, and

Scotti (2009). The average value of the index is zero. Progressively bigger positive values
indicate progressively better-than-average conditions, whereas progressively more negative

values indicate progressively worse-than-average conditions.


Appendix B. Estimation of recession periods using Hamilton’s (1989) Markov
switching model


   This appendix reports the results of the following Markov switching model for the
quarterly growth rate in US GNP (yt ):


   Regime 1 (st = 1): yt = α1 + ut , and
   Regime 2 (st = 2): yt = α2 + ut , where


                                             43
      ut = ρ1 ut−1 + ρ2 ut−2 + ρ3 ut−3 + ρ4 ut−4 + et , et ∼ N (0, σ).

      The Markov switching probability for state transition is given by:
      P (st = 1 | st−1 = 1) = p, and
      P (st = 2 | st−1 = 2) = q.

      Following Stock and Watson’s (2002) observation of a structural break in the GNP series

in 1984, we estimate the model for two distinct time periods: 1952 (Quarter 2) to 1984

and from 1985 to 2008 (Quarter 3). We use these models to estimate the probability of
being in regime 1 interpreted by Hamilton (1989) as the recession regime which is used in
specifications of Table 4.

Table 1
Summary statistics
Panel A provides summary statistics on bond returns by credit rating classes (in basis points) IG stands
for bonds rated BBB and above. Junk stands for bonds rated BB and below. We use the Lehman Brothers
Fixed Income Database for the period January 1973 to December 1996, supplemented with data from the
Merrill Lynch Corporate Bond Index Database for the period January 1994 to December 2007, giving us
a sample period of 1973 to 2007. Included bonds must be in the Lehman/Merrill index with at least one
year to maturity. The average return for each rating group is value-weighted by the amount outstanding
in that month. Returns are calculated using quoted prices or trades and matrix prices are discarded.
Returns for credit rating classes are not available for some months in the sample period, but returns by
IG and Junk rating class are available for all months in the sample period. Panel B provides summary
statistics on bond market factors and documents the return on the two factor portfolios DEF and TERM
in basis points, and summary statistics on the Silliq and the Billiq factors. The sample is from January
1973 through December 2007. The default factor (DEF) is the difference between the equally weighted
return on all corporate bonds in the database with at least one year to maturity and the average return on
one-year and 30-year government bonds from CRSP. The term factor (TERM) is the difference between
the 30-year government bond return and the one-month T-bill return from CRSP. Silliq is the innovation
in stock market illiquidity measure ILLIQ from Amihud (2002), modified by Acharya and Pedersen (2005),
calculated as the residuals of an AR(2) process. Billiq is the innovation in bond market illiquidity using
short maturity on-the-run Treasuries bid-ask spread as in Goyenko (2006), and calculated as the residuals
of an AR(2) process. Panel C presents pairwise spearman correlations of bond market factors. Number in
parentheses in Panel C are p-values for the test that the correlation coefficient equals zero.

Markov switching probability for state transition:

P (st = 1 | st−1 = 1) = p
P (st = 2 | st−1 = 2) = q

In Panels B and C, we test whether the conditional model, with the factor coefficients varying between
regimes, is significantly different from the unconditional model with constant coefficients. The null
hypothesis about the coefficients is H0 : Lβ = c where L is a matrix of coefficients for the hypotheses
and c is a vector of constants. The Wald chi-squared statistic for testing H0 is computed as χ2W =
(Lβ̂ − c)′ [LV̂ (β̂)L′ ]−1 (Lβ̂ − c). Under H0 , χ2W has an asymptotic chi-squared distribution with r degrees

D we assess the in sample accuracy of the regime-switching model. Panel D uses the regime-switching
model estimated in Panel A to obtain estimates of investment-grade (IG) and junk grade bond returns in
each regime and compares it against the actual realizations. We also estimate an unconditional model over
the entire sample (1973–2007) and obtain the predictions. Panels show the regression of the actual bond
returns against the predicted bond returns with a test of the slope coefficient = 1.0 and the intercept being
zero. ∗ ∗ ∗, ∗∗, ∗ Indicate significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively. Numbers in parentheses

Table 4
Explaining the probability of regime 2 (stress regime) with macroeconomic, financial market, and
bank balance-sheet variables
This table presents OLS and logit estimates of the probability of being in regime 2 as a function of
macroeconomic and financial market variables. The OLS regression uses as dependent variable the
probability of being in regime 2 in any month, that is estimated along with the regime-switching model
in Table 3. The probability undergoes a logit transformation to map it into the real line, with a constant
correction term following Cox (1970, p. 33), to accommodate it being bounded between zero and one.
The dependent variable in the logit model is a dummy variable that equals one if the probability of
being in regime 2 is greater than 70%. Odd (even) numbered specifications are OLS (logit) estimations,
where the explanatory variables are lagged one period. N BER recession is a dummy variable that
equals one for NBER recession dates. SW index is the Stock and Watson (1989, 2002) recession index
with positive numbers indicating growth above trend. P rob(Recession) − Hamilton is the result of the
Markov switching model for the quarterly growth rate in U.S. GNP. We use these models to estimate
the probability of being in regime 1 interpreted by Hamilton (1989) as the recession regime greater than
70%. N egative market return is a dummy variable that equals one for three consecutive months of
negative market return (the CRSP value-weighted return with dividends). Business conditions index,
is based on the framework developed in Aruoba, Diebold, and Scotti (2009). The average value of the
index is zero, with bigger positive (negative) values indicating better- (worse)-than-average conditions.
P aper bill spread is the difference between the yield on the three-month nonfinancial commercial paper
rate and the three-month T-bill secondary market rate. T ED spread is the difference between the yield
on the three-month Euro $ deposit rate and the three-month T-bill secondary market rate, orthogonal to
the paper bill spread. Equity volatility is the square root of the monthly average squared daily returns
on the CRSP value-weighted index with dividends. EE measure is the growth in broker-dealer balance
sheet (relative to households) over the previous 12 months as calculated by Etula (2009). The sample
period is January 1973–December 2007. ∗ ∗ ∗, ∗∗, ∗ Indicate significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels,

Table 5
Estimation of the likelihood of regime 2 (stress regime)-out-of-sample tests
This table tests the performance of the probability of regime 2, as predicted by the economic model in
Table 4, when compared to the probability of regime 2 obtained from the Markov regime-switching model
of Table 3. First, we estimate model (14) of Table 4 using only the data for January 1973 - December
1989. Using these estimates, we predict the probability of being in regime 2 for January 1990, then we roll
forward every month and repeat the process until we estimate the probability of regime 2 for all months
during January 1990 - December 2007. We present a logit estimation of the probability of being in regime
2 as a function of the predicted Prob(Regime 2) as the independent variable. The dependent variable is
a dummy variable that equals one if the probability of being in regime 2, obtained from the estimates in
Table 3, is greater than 70% following the cutoff level in Hamilton (1989). We also present a figure that
displays the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve to assess the accuracy of this logit model to
predict regime 2. In the Y -axis we plot the true positive rate, the proportion of actual regime 2 months
correctly classified by the model. In the X -axis we plot the false positive rate, the proportion of non regime
2 months that are incorrectly classified as regime 2 months by the model. The diagonal represents random
guess. Points above the diagonal indicate good classification results, with the total area under the curve
relative to the area of the square measuring the accuracy of the model. ∗ ∗ ∗, ∗∗, ∗ Indicate significance at

Table 6
Out-of-sample predictions during the financial crisis years, 2008 - 2009.
Panel A shows the estimated probability of regime 2, obtained from specification (14) in Table 4, using
the economic time-series for December 2007 - November 2009 (the predictive economic series are lagged
one month). Panel B presents the regression of the actual bond returns on the predicted bond returns (in
excess of the 30-day T-bill return) for the years 2008 - 2009 in basis points. We use the data on iShares
investment-grade and high-yield bond indices to compute the bond returns for these years. The table
presents the intercepts and slope coefficients for both investment-grade and junk grade bonds, with a test
of the slope coefficient = 1.0. To predict bond returns for 2008 and 2009, we proceed as follows: First, we
predict the probability as explained in Panel A. Next, we weight the prediction of bond returns itself for
2008 - 2009 from the regime-switching model of Table 3 by the respective regime probabilities to obtain
the predicted bond returns (in excess of the 30-day T-bill return). Numbers in parentheses under the
coefficients are standard errors. ∗∗∗, ∗∗, ∗ Indicate significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

In Panels B and C we test whether the conditional model, with the factor coefficients varying between
regimes, is significantly different from the unconditional model with constant coefficients. The null
hypothesis about the coefficients is H0 : Lβ = c where L is a matrix of coefficients for the hypotheses
and c is a vector of constants. The Wald chi-squared statistic for testing H0 is computed as χ2W =
(Lβ̂ − c)′ [LV̂ (β̂)L′ ]−1 (Lβ̂ − c). Under H0 , χ2W has an asymptotic chi-squared distribution with r degrees of
freedom where r is the rank of L and V the variance-covariance matrix of the coefficients. Low and high
book-to-market stock returns is the return on the lowest and highest quintiles sorted by book-to-market
ratio, and data are obtained from Ken French’s data library.

Table 8
Explaining the probability of regime 2 (stress regime) from the stock returns model with
macroeconomic, financial market, and bank balance-sheet variables
This table presents OLS and logit estimates of the probability of being in regime 2 as a function of
macroeconomic and financial market variables. The OLS regression uses as dependent variable the
probability of being in regime 2 in any month, that is estimated along with the regime-switching model
in Table 7. The probability undergoes a logit transformation to map it into the real line, with a constant
correction term following Cox (1970, p. 33), to accommodate it being bounded between zero and one.
The dependent variable in the logit model is a dummy variable that equals one if the probability of
being in regime 2 is greater than 70%. Odd (even) numbered specifications are OLS (logit) estimations,
where the explanatory variables are lagged one period. N BER recession is a dummy variable that
equals one for NBER recession dates. SW index is the Stock and Watson (1989, 2002) recession index
with positive numbers indicating growth above trend. P rob(Recession) − Hamilton is the result of the
Markov switching model for the quarterly growth rate in U.S. GNP. We use these models to estimate
the probability of being in regime 1 interpreted by Hamilton (1989) as the recession regime greater than
70%. N egative market return is a dummy variable that equals one for three consecutive months of
negative market return (the CRSP value-weighted return with dividends). Business conditions index,
is based on the framework developed in Aruoba, Diebold, and Scotti (2009). The average value of the
index is zero, with bigger positive (negative) values indicating better- (worse)-than-average conditions.
P aper bill spread is the difference between the yield on the three-month nonfinancial commercial paper
rate and the three-month T-bill secondary market rate. T ED spread is the difference between the yield
on the three-month Euro $ deposit rate and the three-month T-bill secondary market rate, orthogonal to
the paper bill spread. Equity volatility is the square root of the monthly average squared daily returns
on the CRSP value-weighted index with dividends. EE measure is the growth in broker-dealer balance
sheet (relative to households) over the previous 12 months as calculated by Etula (2009). The sample
period is January 1973–December 2007. ∗ ∗ ∗, ∗∗, ∗ Indicate significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels,

Markov switching probability for state transition:

P (st = 1 | st−1 = 1) = p
P (st = 2 | st−1 = 2) = q

In Panel B we test whether the conditional model, with the factor coefficients varying between regimes,
is significantly different from the unconditional model with constant coefficients. The null hypothesis
about the coefficients is H0 : Lβ = c where L is a matrix of coefficients for the hypotheses and
c is a vector of constants. The Wald chi-squared statistic for testing H0 is computed as χ2W =
(Lβ̂ − c)′ [LV̂ (β̂)L′ ]−1 (Lβ̂ − c). Under H0 , χ2W has an asymptotic chi-squared distribution with r degrees
of freedom where r is the rank of L and V the variance-covariance matrix of the coefficients. Low
and high book-to-market stock returns is the return on the lowest and highest quintiles sorted by
book-to-market ratio, and data are obtained from Ken French’s data library. The variable HMLDEF
is constructed as follows: Every month we classify stocks in the CRSP database in a 5 X 5 sort based on
its modified Z -score (measure of default risk) and monthly equity volatility. Modified Z -score is defined as
-4.34-0.08*wcta+0.04*reta-0.1*ebitta-0.22*mvliab+0.06*sata. wcta is the ratio of working capital to total
assets (Compustat item (actq-lctq)/atq). reta is the ratio of retained earnings to total assets (Compustat
item req/atq). ebitta is the ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to total assets (Compustat item
(piq+xintq)/atq). mvliab is the ratio of market value of equity to total liabilities (Compustat item (prccq
* cshoq)/ltq). sata is the ratio of sales to total assets (Compustat item saleq/atq). For each month, in
each volatility quintile, we compute a market capitalization-weighted stock return for each Z-score quintile.
Low default-risk stock returns then is the average of stock returns of the highest Z -score quintile in each
volatility quintile. High default-risk stock returns then is the average of stock returns of the lowest Z -score
quintile in each volatility quintile. HMLDEF is the difference between the High and Low default-risk stock
returns.

Flight to Liquidity Effects
Panel A presents OLS regressions of returns (or yields) of various bond (assets) portfolios on the probability
of being in regime 2 (stress), obtained from the estimation in Table 3, Prob(Regime 2)Bonds , or table 7,
Prob(Regime 2)Stocks , on the four bond market factors described in Table 2 and on the interaction these
factors and Prob(regime 2). Columns (3)-(5) are the yields on 90-day T-bill in excess of the overnight Fed
Funds effective rate (to remove policy effects). Panel B presents OLS regressions of returns (or yields)
of various bond (assets) portfolios on the probability of being in regime 2 (stress), obtained from the
estimation in Table 3, on the four bond market factors described in Table 2 and on the interaction of
these factors and Prob(Regime 2). The returns on Junk and IG (investment-grade) are value-weighted
averages of the bond portfolios in each group. The estimations in columns 3–5 use returns on junk and IG
bond portfolio groups by maturity: short-term is up to four years, medium term is between four and nine
years, and long term is longer than nine years. ∗ ∗ ∗, ∗∗, ∗ Indicate significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10%
levels, respectively. Numbers in parentheses under the coefficients are standard errors.

Regime-switching model - Out-of-sample predictions during the financial crisis year 2008 and year
2009
This figure presents the regression of the actual bond returns against the predicted bond returns for the period 2008–2009. Actual
returns are obtained from data on iShares investment-grade and high-yield bond index. The returns used are in excess of the 30-day
T-bill return. To predict bond returns for 2008 and 2009, we proceed as follows: First, we predict the probability of regime 2 as explained
in Table 6, Panel A. Next, we weight the prediction of bond returns itself for 2008–2009 from the regime-switching model of Table 3 by
the respective regime probabilities to obtain the predicted bond returns (in excess of the 30-day T-bill return).
