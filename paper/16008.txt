                                           ABSTRACT

Build America Bonds (BABs) are a new form of municipal financing introduced in 2009. Investors
in BAB municipal bonds receive interest payments that are taxable, but issuers receive a subsidy from
the U.S. Treasury. The BAB program has succeeded in lowering the cost of funding for state and
local governments with BAB issuers obtaining finance 54 basis points lower, on average, compared
to issuing regular municipal bonds. For institutional investors, BAB issue yields are 116 basis points
higher than comparable Treasuries and 88 basis points higher than comparable highly rated corporate
bonds. For individual investors, BABs have lower yields than regular municipal bonds. Thus, on
average the Federal government subsidy disadvantages individual U.S. taxpayers, who are the main
holders of municipal bonds, and benefits new entrants in the municipal bond market.

1        Introduction

Build America Bonds (BABs) were introduced by the federal government as part of the Amer-

ican Recovery and Reinvestment Act signed into law by President Obama on February 17,

2009.1 The Build America Bond program is designed to help state and local governments pur-

sue various capital projects such as the construction of public buildings, schools, roads, energy

projects, public utilities, and other public infrastructure projects. The ﬁrst BAB was issued by

the University of Virginia with an award date of April 15, 2009 and a dated date of April 22,

2009. By the end of December 2009, around $63.4 billion of BABs have been issued compared

with $332.2 billion of regular municipal bonds. Thus, BABs represent 16% of all municipal

ﬁnance raised during this period.

        Funding for states and local governments is traditionally done through regular municipal

bond issues, where investors receive tax-exempt coupon interest payments from municipal is-

suers.2 Since traditional municipal bonds provide tax-exempt income, municipal bonds are

attractive investments for individuals and, not surprisingly, over two-thirds of municipal bonds

are held by individuals (see Ang, Bhansali and Xing, 2010). Consequently, tax-exempt munic-

ipal bond yields have, on average, been lower than taxable Treasury and corporate bond yields

(see, among others, Green, 1993).3

        Under the BAB program, municipalities issue bonds with taxable coupon payments, but

they receive a subsidy from the federal government to offset their borrowing costs.4 This sub-
    1
        This is also commonly known as the “Stimulus Bill.” Details of the BAB program are available at the Treasury
website at http://www.ustreas.gov/press/releases/tg80.htm
  2
    There are some bonds issued by municipalities that are taxable as they do not meet requirements that the bond
proceeds provide a signiﬁcant beneﬁt to the general public. Certain municipal bonds payments are also subject
to the Alternative Minimum Tax. For the majority of municipal bond issues, investors receive interest payments
exempt from Federal income tax.
   3
     However, in the aftermath of the recent ﬁnancial crisis, which has substantially impaired the ﬁnances of many
municipal issuers, municipal bond yields have often been higher than equivalent maturity Treasury yields. Another
reason for this reversal is the greater liquidity demand of Treasuries by investors not able to take advantage of the
tax exemptions of municipal bonds.
   4
     There is a second, much less common type of of BAB where BAB holders receive a tax credit from the federal
government equal to 35% of the bond each year (or 45% in certain cases). We do not analyze this type of BAB.

sidy enables state and municipal governments to tap additional sources of capital other than

individuals. BABs can only be issued during 2009 and 2010, but the subsidy is for the life of

the BABs.

    The subsidy is set at 35% of the BAB coupon, which is currently the same as the highest

marginal federal income tax rate and the highest marginal corporate income tax rate. For exam-

ple, suppose a state issues a BAB with a 5% taxable interest rate. The United States Treasury

pays the state government 0.35 × 0.05 = 1.75% making the state government’s net borrowing

cost 3.25% on a bond that pays a 5% coupon. An investor receiving the 5% coupon is subject

to taxes: an individual in the highest Federal marginal income tax rate holding the BAB would

receive (1 − 0.35) × 0.05 = 3.25% net of Federal taxes while a non-taxable entity such as a

pension fund would receive the full 5% coupon. Hence, from the perspective of an investor, the

BAB is a special type of a regular taxable bond.

    Suppose the state government issued a regular municipal bond at 3.25%. This is the same

out-of-pocket cost as the BAB which carries a 5% coupon. An individual investor buying the

regular municipal bond receives the full 3.25% and pays no tax. In this case, the individual

investor is indifferent between the BAB and a regular municipal bond. However, in practice

taxable interest rates tend to be, on average, higher than tax-exempt yields. This makes regular

municipal bonds unattractive investments for pension funds, foreign investors, and investors in

low tax brackets. Since BABs are taxable, the BAB program theoretically enlarges the market

for municipal issuers and enables a much broader group of investors to ﬁnance state and local

government projects.

    In this article we examine if opening up the municipal bond market to a a larger clientele has

lowered the cost of borrowing for state and local governments. Since the subsidy is provided

by the Federal government, and thus ultimately U.S. taxpayers, we also compare the prices of
This second type is rare because in order to take advantage of the tax credit, the BAB investor must have U.S.
taxable income, which is not the case for tax-exempt investors such as pension plans and many foreign investors.
We also do not consider other types of issuance under this program, which are the “Qualiﬁed School Construction
Bonds” or “Qualiﬁed Zone Academy Bonds.”

BABs relative to traditional municipal markets, Treasury bonds, and high credit quality corpo-

rate bonds. Finally, we investigate if individuals receive any beneﬁt from holding BABs relative

to regular municipal bonds and estimate the role of the Federal subsidy in determining the value

of BABs.5 In particular, we discuss the transfer issues regarding the U.S. Treasury payments

from individual taxpayers to new entrants in the municipal bond market. To our knowledge, our

paper is the ﬁrst formal analysis of the BAB market not produced by the Federal government.6


2        BABs and Tax-Exempt Municipal Bonds

Our data are obtained from Bloomberg and include all 6,177 BABs (CUSIPs) issued during

2009 as Direct Pay BABs. Table 1 reports summary statistics of the BABs over April to De-

cember 2009 and compares the issuance of BABs with the issuance of regular municipal bonds.

Over this period 6,177 BAB securities were issued carrying distinct CUSIPS representing 663

unique issuers. The amount of local and state government ﬁnance raised in 2009 through BABs

totals $63.4 billion.

        To compare the BAB issuance with regular municipal issues, we collect all municipal bond

issues occurring between April and December 2009 which have subsequent secondary market

trades reported by the MSRB. There were 95,233 regular tax-exempt municipal bonds issued

totaling $332.2 billion. Municipal bonds tend to be much smaller, with an average issue size

of $3.5 million, compared to BABs with an average issue size of $10.2 million. Thus, BABs

are more attractive to institutions because of their larger issue size. In our analysis we take

only straight bonds to avoid potentially complex computations involved in valuing embedded
    5
        We are implicitly assuming that the issuer does not have the ability to re-ﬁnance or pre-refund existing tax-
exempt or BABs into each other and thus “arbitrage” the beneﬁts of the subsidy. Generally, the tax code prevents
such arbitrage. The ability to reﬁnance BABs into other BABs is being considered in policy circles.
   6
     The U.S. Treasury has issued a report, Treasury Analysis of Build America Bonds and Issuer Net Borrowing
Costs, showing that the BAB program has reduced borrowing costs of states and municipalities, consistent with our
ﬁndings. However, their analysis uses linear ﬁxed effect regressions on yields, which are by deﬁnition non-linear
functions of cashﬂows. We avoid any linearizations, deal with truly comparable BABs issued in other conventional
bond markets, and handle risk consistently by discounting by different zero-coupon yield curves. The Treasury
report also does not compare BABs to Treasuries and corporate bond markets.


                                                           3
options. Straight bonds constitute 39% of all BABs and 60% of all regular municipal securities.

        Table 1 also reports information on the maturities of BABs and municipal bonds. BABs

tend to have longer maturities than regular municipal bonds. While 54% of BABs have longer

maturities than 10 years, only 36% of regular municipal bonds have similar maturities. S&P

credit ratings on BABs are similar to the ratings on regular municipals with the majority of all

issues rated AA or AAA.


3        Comparing BABs with Other Bond Markets

We compare the yield on BABs with more traditional debt by comparing the BAB issue yield

with hypothetical yields computed using different discount rates. The motivation is as follows.

In equilibrium, the price of any security is given by summing a series of discounted expected

cashﬂows. The yield is a (non-linear) transformation of that price. The discount rate reﬂects

the risk associated with the cashﬂow stream. Following Dufﬁe and Singleton (1999), we can

transform the risk of default into the discount rate and treat the cashﬂow stream to be default-

free. That is, suppose the cashﬂows of the BAB are given by CFt at time t. Then, we can value

the BAB by standard discounting:

                                                   
                                                   2N
                                                            CFt+i
                                            Pt =                        ,                                        (1)
                                                   i=1
                                                         (1 + rt+i /2)i

where we use semi-annual compounding so N is the maturity of the bond in years and rt+i is

the zero-coupon rate from t to t + i in annualized terms. This formula treats the cashﬂow as

default-free because the risk of default is absorbed by the discount rate.7
    7
        This valuation framework is very general; Dufﬁe and Singleton (1999) show that the discount rate captures
default risk even when the default risk is time varying as long as the loss given default does not depend on the size
of the defaultable claim at the time of default.




                                                          4
       We consider three sets of discount rates:8

   1. Municipal Bonds

         If the BAB cashﬂows have the same default rate as a regular municipal bond, then we can

         discount using municipal bond discount rates. In this case, we construct municipal bond

         zero curves taking only interdealer trades of fully tax-exempt bonds with S&P ratings of

         A and above following Ang, Bhansali and Xing (2010).

   2. Treasuries

         This is an extreme assumption as it speciﬁes that BABs carry the same risk as the Federal

         government. We take zero coupon Treasury yields from the Federal Reserve constructed

         following Gürkaynak, Sack and Wright (2007).

   3. Swaps

         In this case, we assume BABs to carry the same credit risk as AA-rated ﬁnancial institu-

         tions. We obtain swap zeros from Bloomberg.

       In each case, we express the discounted BAB cashﬂows as a yield. The yield obtained

using the municipal zero curve can be interpreted as the yield the BAB issuer would receive if

a bond with equivalent cashﬂows was issued in the regular municipal bond market instead of as

a BAB. Similarly, if the U.S. Treasury issued a bond with the same cashﬂows as the BAB, the

implied Treasury yield would be the effective yield earned by an investor buying the comparable

Treasury security. Finally, if an equivalent corporate bond were issued with the same cashﬂows

as the BAB and the investor purchased this equivalent corporate bond, he would earn the implied

yield obtained from discounting using the swap curve. Thus, each of the yields implied by the

different sets of discount rates represent the price of a bond with the same cashﬂows as the BAB

issued in different markets.
   8
       We do not consider corporate bond discount rates other than swaps or rates implied by CDS because we are
unable to obtain zero-coupon curves for these types of securities.




                                                         5
        Since the natural comparison of BABs is the traditional municipal market which is exempt

from tax, we compute tax-adjusted yields. This is done using methods similar to Ang, Bhansali

and Xing (2010). We take the viewpoint of an individual investor subject to a 35% tax rate held

constant for the life of the bond. For example, for a par bond, the coupon cashﬂows net-of-tax

are 65% of the original coupon. We compute an after-tax Treasury and after-tax swap yield

discounting the net-of-tax cashﬂows received by the individual investor.

        The issue yield of the BAB is not the borrowing cost to the issuer because the local or state

government receives a 35% subsidy from the U.S. Treasury. We compute the effective issuer

yield by discounting the original bond coupons multiplied by 65%, which is the actual coupon

paid by the issuer when applying the municipal discount rates. Note that this is the same yield

earned by an individual investor assuming the BAB carries the same default risk as a regular

municipal bond. However, this effective yield does not include underwriting fees which are not

available. Anecdotal evidence suggests underwriting fees on BABs are signiﬁcantly higher than

regular municipal issues.9

        We summarize these deﬁnitions in Table 2.


4        Results

Table 3 presents the main results and compares the yields on BABs with the implied yields

representing equivalent securities issued in other conventional bond markets. The average orig-

inal issue yield of BABs in 2009 is 3.69%. It should be noted that there is well-known large

heterogeneity in municipal market yields in general and the BAB market is no exception. The

10th and 90th percentile original BAB issue yields are 2.00% and 5.10%, respectively. We do

not analyze this dispersion as we are interested in average level effects. Note that the implied

municipal, Treasury, and swap yields we compute preserve their rankings no matter what the

original BAB issue yields are because all the zero yield curves are upward sloping over our

sample. Thus, our results on the yields of BABs relative to other markets are unaffected by the
    9

dispersion.

   Because of the Federal subsidy, the issuing entity does not pay the original issue yield.

The effective yield to the issuer is 2.32%, on average, which is lower than the average BAB

raw issue yield of 3.69% because 35% of the coupon payments are being made by the Federal

government. This is the same after-tax yield, on average, an individual investor would earn

buying BABs.

   We compare the BAB effective issuer yield with the comparable regular municipal yield in

the next line of Table 3. If local and state governments had issued equivalent municipal bonds

instead of BABs, their ﬁnancing rates would rise from 2.32% to 2.86%, a difference of 54 basis

points per year. In fact, this is likely an understatement because the regular municipal yield is

lower than what it otherwise would have been had the regular municipal market been forced to

absorb the extra BAB issuance. Thus, the Obama stimulus package has succeeded in reducing

the ﬁnancing costs of local and state governments in funding infrastructure projects.

   From an individual investor point of view, however, BABs have lower yields than regular

municipal bonds. Buying a regular municipal bond yields 2.86%, which is higher than purchas-

ing a BAB and receiving an after-tax yield of 2.32% (the same as the effective issuer yield).

Thus, for individuals municipal bonds dominate BABs, on average. If the same clientele who

regularly hold municipal bonds purchased the whole BAB issuance, individual investors would

have received the higher yields of municipal bonds. In this light, the BAB program can be in-

terpreted as a wealth transfer from the natural holders of municipal bonds, who are individual

U.S. taxpayers, to corporations, pension funds, and foreign investors not subject to individual

U.S. income taxes.

   The next line in Table 3 compares BAB yields with Treasuries. For a tax-exempt entity such

as an endowment, pension fund, or some foreign investors, BABs have higher yields compared

to holding Treasuries. If equivalent Treasury securities were issued with the same cashﬂows as

the BABs, these securities would yield 2.53%, on average. BABs yield 3.69%, on average, and

dominate Treasuries, but some of the extra 116 basis points per year represents compensation


                                               7
for bearing municipal risk rather than risk-free Treasuries. However, the credit risk in municipal

issues, especially at the local government and state level, has been small.10

       The relevant yield for an individual purchasing the equivalent Treasury bonds is 1.31% on

an after-tax basis. For the individual investor, purchasing BABs yields 2.32%, on average, after

taxes, which is a difference of 101 basis points. Again, a small part of this spread represents

compensation for increased default risk. But, if BABs carry the same risk as regular municipal

bonds, the yields on municipal bonds are higher than BABs for individual investors in the 35%

tax bracket.

       The next two lines of Table 3 report the equivalent swap yields and after-tax swap yields.

For tax-exempt institutions and assuming that that BABs have the same, or better, credit risk as

highly rated ﬁnancial institutions, BABs have higher yields than high-grade corporate bonds:

the implied yield is 2.81% on equivalent BAB cashﬂows issued in the swap market versus 3.69%

for straight BABs. For individuals, after-tax swap yields are also dominated by BABs.

       We report the percentage of the BAB issue price that is due to the Federal subsidy in the

last line of Table 3. This is computed as the sum of the present value of the coupon stream

multiplied by 35%, which is the amount paid by the Federal government, divided by the issue

price. The Federal subsidy contributes 7.47%, on average, to the total value of BABs.

       Finally, we also report the average implied yields each month from May to December 2009.

(We exclude April as there is only one BAB issue during that month.) This shows that the

corresponding rankings of the yields of BABs relative to other investments is very stable. The

implied BAB yields are not very volatile because interest rates have not exhibited much varia-

tion during the sample period.

       There are at least two reasons why BABs have lower after-tax yields relative to regular

municipal bonds. One is that the BAB program has succeeded in opening up the municipal

market to non-taxable and other non-traditional investors. Enhanced liquidity of BABs relative

to regular municipal bonds would make BABs less risky and hence holders of BABs require
  10
       See, for example, The U.S. Municipal Bond Rating Scale: Mapping to the Global Rating Scale And Assigning
Global Scale Ratings to Municipal Obligations, 2007, Moody’s Investors Service.


                                                        8
lower after-tax yields compared to municipal bonds. We will explore this avenue in future

research.11 Consistent with a liquidity explanation is the fact that BABs are issued at higher

raw yields than the implied swap and Treasury yields, with corporate bond and Treasury markets

presumably being more liquid than BABs.

       A second potential reason why regular municipal bonds have higher yields than after-tax,

or effective, BAB yields is the outstanding puzzle that long municipal yields are “too high”

relative to taxable yields, that is the term structure is generally steeper for municipal bonds

than for Treasuries (see Green, 1993; Chalmers, 1998). In Table 4, we report a breakdown of

the various implied BAB yields by maturity.12 Breaking down the yields by maturity severely

reduces the number of observations, particularly at the long-end of the yield curve with only

seven observations, so our results have to be interpreted with caution.

       The last column of Table 4 shows that the spread between implied municipal and effective

BAB yields increases from 0.49% to 0.78% moving from maturities less than ﬁve years to

maturities greater than 15 years, respectively. This is evidence that the municipal maturity

effect plays a role. Thus, the lower ﬁnancing costs of BABs for issuers comes partly from the

original municipal yield curve being much steeper than the taxable yield curve. Comparing

only long- versus short-maturity rates within each market, BABs have relatively small spreads

for long-dated versus short-dated borrowing. The slope of the implied municipal and implied

Treasury curves are very similar, at 2.56% and 2.68%, respectively. The slope of the effective

BAB yield curve is 2.23%, lower than the slopes of the implied municipal and Treasury curves.

But, the original BABs have the most pronounced upward-sloping yield with a slope of 3.42%.
  11
       Measuring liquidity in municipal bond markets is difﬁcult because the entire municipal bond market is ef-
fectively illiquid compared to Treasury and equity markets (see, for example, Harris and Piwowar, 2006; Green,
Holliﬁeld and Schürhoff, 2007). Since the holders of municipal bonds are not known, it is impossible to directly test
the ostensible purpose of the stimulus bill, that the municipal bond market has been opened up to non-individual
investors through the BAB program.
  12
     The municipal maturity puzzle is seen in Table 4 by the fact that the ratio of implied municipal to implied
Treasury yields is 2.080/1.511 = 1.38 for maturities <5 years and 4.641/4.188 = 1.11 for maturities >15 years.

5    Conclusion

We analyze the prices of Build America Bonds (BABs) issued in 2009 under the American

Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The BAB program is designed to broaden the clientele

holding municipal debt and lower the borrowing cost of local and state governments funding

capital and infrastructure projects. We ﬁnd that this goal has been met: ignoring underwriting

fees, local and state governments were able to obtain ﬁnancing 54 basis points, on average,

cheaper than issuing in the regular municipal bond market.

    For tax-exempt institutions such as endowments, pension funds, and foreign investors not

subject to U.S. income tax, BABs have original issue yields higher than regular tax-exempt

municipal bonds. For institutional investors, BAB yields are 116 basis points higher than com-

parable Treasuries and 88 basis points higher than comparable highly rated corporate bonds.

However, for individual investors subject to the highest 35% marginal income tax rate, BABs

have lower yields compared to regular municipal bonds. This implies that the subsidies from

the Federal government to local and state governments under the BAB program have accrued to

new entrants in the municipal bond market and have not, on average, beneﬁted individual U.S.

taxpayers.

    Under current law, BABs can only be issued in 2009 and 2010, but there is current dis-

cussion of extending the BAB program in various forms. Given the need for large continued

public ﬁnancing at the local and state government levels, our ﬁndings play an important role in

evaluating the BAB program and the attractiveness of BABs compared to more traditional bond

markets for institutions and individual investors.

Original Issue Yield               Yield of the BAB at issue.

                                   Yield computed using the municipal curve taking 65% of the
                                   original BAB cashﬂows. This is the effective yield the local
Effective Issuer Yield
                                   or state government is paying on the BAB. It is also the same
                                   as the after-tax yield an investor earns buying the BAB.

                                   Yield computed using the municipal curve. This is the yield
Implied Municipal Yield            if a regular municipal bond were purchased with the same
                                   cashﬂows as the BAB.

                                   Yield computed using the Treasury curve. This is the yield if
Implied Treasury Yield             a Treasury bond were purchased with the same cashﬂows as
                                   the BAB.

                                 Yield computed taking 65% of the original BAB cashﬂows
                                 and discounting using the Treasury curve. This is the after-

                                 tax yield earned by an individual investor buying a Treasury
                                 bond with the same cashﬂows as the BAB.

                                   Yield computed using the swap curve. This is the yield if
Implied Swap Yield                 a corporate bond rated above AA were purchased with the
                                   same cashﬂows as the BAB.

                                   yield earned by an individual investor buying a highly rated
