Product Variety and Demand Uncertainty

                                       ABSTRACT

We show that demand uncertainty leads to vertical product differentiation even when consumers are

homogeneous. When a firm anticipates that its inventory or capacity may not be fully utilized,

product variety can reduce its expected costs of excess capacity. When the firm offers a continuum

of product varieties, the highest quality product has the highest profit margins but the lowest

percentage margin, while the lowest quality product has the highest percentage margin but the

lowest absolute margin. We derive these results in both a monopoly model and a variety of different

competitive models. We conclude with a discussion of empirical predictions together with a brief

discussion of supporting evidence available from marketing studies.

1. Introduction
       What determines the breadth of a firm’s product line? While prior research on

product line, and product variety more generally, focuses on heterogeneity in consumers’

preferences or income, we show that when firms supply an uncertain number of

consumers, they may offer more than one product even when consumers preferences are

homogeneous. Offering multiple products reduces the costs associated with uncertain

demand. In particular, firms prefer to use lower quality products to meet speculative

demand. In other words, firms limit their inventory of high quality goods and sell low

quality goods once their high quality goods have stocked out. Our model helps explain

the extent of product differentiation and suggests a rationale for many common retailing

practices such as the use of private labels and full product line forcing by manufacturers.

       Specific retail examples include grocery stores’ offerings of national brands and

private labels, their offerings of fresh and frozen meats and seafood, and restaurants’

offerings of special entrees in addition to the regular dinner menu. The model also helps

to understand how toy retailers decide how many high versus low quality toys to stock

and how clothing retailers decide how many designer fashion items versus regular items

to stock.

       The model can also explain product differentiation in travel and other service

industries. For example, airlines must decide how many first class, business, and extra

deep coach class seats to put in a passenger airplane. And hotels can be designed so that

every room had a view (a long, narrow design) or so that some rooms have views and

others don’t (by using a wider design): rooms with views clearly cost more given the

shadow (land) cost of the scarce view (i.e., the water can only be viewed from exterior

rooms on the side of the building facing it). Stadiums can be built with permanent seats

(more comfortable) and temporary seats (less comfortable). Similarly, universities must

decide how many faculty versus Ph.D. students to use in staffing their undergraduate



                                                                                              1
classes, and medical centers must decide how many physician’s aids versus doctor’s to

use in a doctor’s office that accepts walk-in patients.

       The common elements in these examples are that firms sink costs of production

before demand is realized and that firms choose their capacity (or inventory) of high and

low quality products with the expectation that the high quality products will be consumed

more frequently than low quality products.

       The economics and marketing literatures have made big steps in understanding

product differentiation, but have exclusively focused on consumer heterogeneity as the

reason for variety (see surveys by Eaton and Lipsey, 1989, and Lancaster, 1990). An

important part of this literature looks at the product line and pricing decisions of a

monopolist engaging in second degree price discrimination when consumers’ valuations

are correlated with their preference for product quality (see Muss and Rosen, 1978, and

the empirical work of Sheperd, 1991).

       Our work is also related to the literature in operations management literature on

the inventory problem for a multi-product firm when consumers substitute products in

response to stockouts (see Mahajan and van Ryzin, 2001, Bassok, Anupindi, and Akella,

1999, and Noonan, 1995). However, this literature has treated the firm’s product line as

exogenous. A paper by van Ryzin and Mahajan (1999) considers a model of optimal
product assortment with stockouts, but they assume stockouts result in lost sales rather

than substitution (see also a related paper by Smith and Agrawal, 2000).

       In our paper, we show that even when all consumers have the same preferences

over product quality, firms may still offer multiple product qualities provided that

demand is uncertain. When only two products are feasible, we show that necessary and

sufficient conditions for both products to be produced are that demand is uncertain, that

the high quality product generates greater absolute consumer surplus and profit, and that

the lower quality product generates greater relative surplus and percentage margins. In

the next section we show this result when there is a monopoly supplier, and in Section 3


                                                                                            2
we show it for a competitive market and a social planner. In Section 4 we generalize the

two-product model in Sections 2 and 3 by considering heterogeneous consumer

valuations. In Section 5 we characterize the optimal product line for a monopolist when a

continuum of products are feasible. This extension helps establish the generality of the

results in the two-product model. We show that the highest quality product produced is

the one that generates the greatest total surplus (the one that would have been produced if

demand were certain) and the lowest quality product produced is the one that maximizes

the relative, or percentage surplus. Section 6 concludes with a discussion of empirical

implications together with a brief discussion of supporting evidence from marketing

studies of margins earned by grocery stores on private label and national brands. Section

6 also discusses the implications of our model for manufacturer-retailer relationships and

full-line forcing, one of several important areas for future research.

2. Monopolist with Two Feasible Product Varieties

The Model
       In this section we analyze the product line, inventory, and pricing decisions of a

monopolist that can produce two vertically differentiated varieties of the same product, a

high quality product and a low quality product.
       Let f (x ) denote the probability distribution function associated with the random

variable x, the number of identical consumers willing to buy one unit of output (one seat),
on the support [x,x ] ⊂ ℜ + and suppose x > 0 . Let F (x ) denote the associated

cumulative distribution function.
       Each consumer is willing to pay vh for the high quality good and vl for the low
quality good. Without loss of generality, we assume v h > v l .
       The high quality good costs c h per unit to produce whether or not it is sold. The
low quality good costs c l per unit to produce whether or not it is sold. We assume that




                                                                                            3
v h > c h , v l > c l , and c h > c l , since otherwise the product choice problem would be trivial.

We normalize the non-sunk costs to zero.
        Define ∆ h = v h − c h and ∆ l = v l − c l to be the total or absolute surplus created by
the high and low quality product respectively and define ω h = (v h − c h ) v h and
ω l = (v l − c l ) v l to be the percentage or relative surplus created by each product.

        This is a model of complete information and we assume throughout that
consumers maximize their surplus given the set of available products and prices.

The One-Product Case
        Suppose first that the firm is constrained to produce only the high quality good (or
by analogy, only the low quality good). Clearly the firm sets ph = v h . Given this price,
the firm chooses its inventory, qh , to maximize


               ∫                     ∫ v q f (x)dx − q c .
                   qh                  ∞
        max        v h xf (x )dx +         h h        h h
          qh       x                  qh



        The first term represents the firm’s revenue when realized demand is less than the
firm’s inventory; the second term represents the firm’s revenue when demand exceeds the
firm’s inventory and it stocks out, and the final term represents that ex ante sunk cost of
production.
        The first order condition is

        v h [1− F (qh )]− c h = 0 .

This is the well-known newsboy condition. The firm chooses its inventory level to
equate the marginal expected revenue of an additional unit of inventory with the marginal
cost of inventory. Rearranging this, we can define the firm’s optimal inventory as the
solution to

        [1− F (q )]= cv*
                       h
                           h

                           h
                               .




                                                                                                    4
The Two-Product Case
       Now suppose that the monopolist can produce any amount of both the high
quality good and the low quality good and that consumers are free to purchase any of the
firm’s products that are available when it is their turn to buy. The firm chooses the price
and inventory of each product to maximize its expect profit. Note that the one-product
solution above is feasible but not necessarily optimal.
       The firm’s problem is easiest to analyze by first solving the pricing decision. The
following lemma shows that in equilibrium, given any positive inventory choices,
ph = v h and pl = v l . This is intuitive since we expect the firm to extract the entire

surplus. While these prices are not optimal for all possible consumer behavior, they are
optimal when consumers buy all of the firms’ high quality goods before buying any low
quality goods, and we show that this always happens in equilibrium.

Lemma: In equilibrium, given any positive inventory choices, the monopolist’s prices
are ph = v h and pl = v l and consumers buy all of the firms’ high quality goods before

buying any low quality goods.

       Proof: If consumers strictly prefer either good, the firm can increase the price of
       that good without changing the order of purchase and its profits would increase,
       so consumers must be indifferent between the goods.
               Since they are indifferent, consumers must buy the high quality goods
       first. Otherwise the firm could increase its profits by lowering the price of high
       quality goods (since high quality goods have a higher price and the costs are
       sunk). But if consumers buy low quality goods last, it follows that pl = v l ;
       otherwise the firm could raise its profits by increasing pl . Since consumers are
       indifferent between the goods, it follows that ph = v h . 




                                                                                              5
         The certain demand case is presented as a benchmark.

Proposition 1: When demand is certain, i.e. x = x , the monopolist produces only high
quality goods if v h − c h > v l − c l (or ∆ h > ∆ l ) and only low quality goods if
v h − c h < v l − c l (or ∆ h < ∆ l ).


         Proof: If demand is certain, the firm’s inventory decision solves

                            max v h qh + v lql − qh c h − ql c l
                            {q l ,q h }


         subject to qh + ql ≤ x , and qh , ql ≥ 0 , which implies only the higher margin

         product will be produced.

         When demand is certain and v h − c h = v l − c l (or ∆ h = ∆ l ), the firm is indifferent

between producing low quality and high quality goods.
         When demand is uncertain, we can use the Lemma, to write the monopolist’s
inventory choice problem as


                        ∫                      ∫
                             qh                    q h +q l
          max
          {q l ,q h }       x
                             v h xf (x )dx +
                                                   qh
                                                              [v hqh + v l (x − qh )] f (x)dx +

                                          ∫ [v q + v q ] f (x)dx
                                               ∞

                                                    h h          l l                              (P)
                                               q h +q l

                                                −qh c h − ql c l

subject to qh ≥ 0 and ql ≥ 0 . So the optimal inventories are given by the complementary

slackness conditions,

          v l [1 − F (qh + ql )]− c l ≤ 0, ql ≥ 0                                                 (a)

and

          v h [1 − F (qh )]− v l [F (qh + ql ) − F (qh )]− c h ≤ 0, qh ≥ 0,                       (b)

where at most one inequality can hold with strict inequality in each condition.




                                                                                                     6
         From these optimality conditions we show the following results on the firm’s
product line decision:

Proposition 2: When demand is uncertain, i.e., x > x , then the monopolist produces (i)
only the low quality good if v h − c h < v l − c l (or ∆ h < ∆ l ), (ii) both the high quality good
and the low quality good if v h − c h > v l − c l (or ∆ h > ∆ l ) and

                   ch cl                   c       c
                     > (or equivalently 1 – h < 1 – l )
                   vh vl                   vh      vl

(or ω h < ω l ) and (iii) only the high quality good if v h − c h > v l − c l (or ∆ h > ∆ l ) and

                   ch cl
                     < ,
                   vh vl


(or ω h > ω l ).

         Proof. First, let v l − c l > v h − c h . If qh > 0 , then either ql = 0 and qh > 0 or ql > 0
         and qh > 0 . Suppose ql = 0 and qh > 0 . Then (a) and (b) become
         v l [1 − F (qh )]− c l ≤ 0 and v h [1 − F (qh )]− c h = 0 , which is a contradiction. Suppose

         instead that ql > 0 and qh > 0 . Then (a) and (b) hold with equality. Subtracting
         (a) from (b) yields [v h − v l ][1 − F (qh )] = c h − c l , so

                                  c h − cl
                   1 − F (qh )=            >1
                                  v h − vl

         or equivalently F (qh )< 0 , which is a contradiction. So v l − c l > v h − c h implies

         qh = 0 . This implies the following complementary slackness condition

                                   c
                   [1− F (ql )] ≤ v l , ql ≥ 0 ,
                                       l


         and since c l v l < 1, it follows that so ql > 0 . So qh = 0 and ql > 0 .
                   Next let v h − c h > v l − c l . If qh = 0 , then either ql = 0 and qh = 0 or ql > 0
         and qh = 0 . Suppose that ql = 0 and qh = 0 . Then (a) and (b) imply v l − c l ≤ 0 and




                                                                                                         7
v h − c h ≤ 0 which is a contradiction. Suppose instead ql > 0 and qh = 0 . Then (a)
and (b) become v l [1 − F (ql )]− c l = 0and v h − v l F (qh ) − c h ≤ 0, which is a

contradiction. So v h − c h > v l − c l implies qh > 0 .
          Now let v h − c h > v l − c l and

           cl ch
             > .
           vl vh

The later implies that v h c l > v l c h , so v h c l − v l c l > v l c h − v l c l or

           cl ch − cl
             >        .                                                                  (e)
           vl vh − vl

If ql > 0 , then (a) and (b) can be rewritten as

          v l [1 − F (qh + ql )]− c l = 0

and

                            c −c
          [1− F (qh )] = v h − v l ,
                              h       l



but these and (e) imply

                                  c       c −c
          [1− F (qh + ql )] = v l > v h − v l ≥ [1− F (qh )]
                                      l    h     l


which implies ql ≤ 0 , which is a contradiction. So v h − c h > v l − c l and

           cl ch
             >
           vl vh
imply qh > 0 and ql = 0 .
          Finally, let v h − c h > v l − c l and

           ch cl
             > .
           vh vl

The later implies




                                                                                          8

                vh − vl vl

       If ql = 0 , then (a) and (b) can be rewritten as

                v l [1 − F (qh + ql )]− c l ≤ 0

       and
                                c −c
                [1− F (qh )] = v h − v l ,
                                  h       l


       but these and (f) imply

                                      c       c −c
                [1− F (qh + ql )] ≤ v l < v h − v l = [1− F (qh )],
                                          l   h      l


       which implies ql > 0 , which is a contradiction. So v h − c h > v l − c l and

                ch − cl cl
                       >
                vh − vl vl

       imply qh > 0 and ql = 0 . 

       If v l − c l = v h − c h the firm is indifferent between offering only the low quality
good and both the high and low quality good, and if v h − c h ≥ v l − c l and

        cl ch
          =
        vl vh

then the firm is indifferent between offering only the high quality good and both the high
and low quality goods. Both of these equalities hold only in the case in which v l = c l and
v h = c h , in which case there is no surplus and the firm is indifferent between producing

either good and producing nothing.
       Figures 1 and 2 shows the optimal product line as a function of the costs of each
product holding consumers’ valuations for the products fixed (we could have presented

values which violate our starting assumptions for the problem (we assumed that the low
quality good was cheaper to produce and both goods could profitable be produced).

        Figure 2 shows graphically that when demand is uncertain, the decision to
produce the high quality good versus the low quality good depends both on which
product has the higher total or absolute markups, ∆ h = v h − c h and ∆ l = v l − c l , and on
which product has the higher relative or percentage markups, ω h = 1− c h v h and

percentage markup they are the only goods produced. But when the high quality good
has a greater absolute margin and the low quality good has a higher percentage margin,
then both products are produced.

       Figure 3 provides the intuition for Proposition 2. For the case in which it is
optimal to produce both products, the Figure depicts the optimal production, q**     **
                                                                              h and ql


in terms of the first order conditions for the single product firm. First notice that if the
firm were to produce q*h units of the high quality good and no units of the low quality

good. the marginal return to adding a low quality unit the same as the marginal return to
adding a low quality unit if the firm were to produce q*h units of the low quality good, and

this is clearly positive. So the firm’s optimal total output is clearly defined by



                                                                                               11
v l [1 − F (q)]− c l = 0 and clearly exceeds q*h . Second, notice that if only the high quality

product were produced, the optimal choice of output, q*h , exceeds q**
                                                                    h . The reason


 h < qh is that when the firm is producing both products, an extra unit of the high quality
q**   *



output imposes an additional cost on the firm because it lowers the expected sales of the
low quality units. So there is an incentive to reduce qh below the single product

optimum.

                                              v l [1− F (q)]− c l = 0

        Proposition 2 implies the following interesting and empirically testable corollary
about product lines.

Corollary: If the monopolist produces two products then the higher quality product must
have a higher absolute margin and lower percentage margin: qh > 0 and ql > 0
⇒ ph − c h > pl − c l & (ph − c h ) ph < (pl − c l ) pl .


3. Competitive Markets with Two Product Varieties
        In this section we again suppose that firms can produce only two vertically
differentiated varieties of the same product model, but here we allow a continuum of




                                                                                                  12
competitive firms to supply the market. The same two products are feasible and the unit
costs and consumer valuations are the same as in the monopoly analysis.
        There are a number of different ways to model competition with demand
uncertainty, each of which is realistic for some markets and each of which can imply very
different understandings of how market operate. We examine three different models of
competition and show that results similar to those in the previous models apply to all
three models. In Section 3.1 we assume that prices clear the market after demand is
realized. In Section 3.2 we assume that prices are set before demand is realized and that
consumers can search costlessly for price and availability. In Section 3.3 we also assume
that prices are set before demand is realized, but assume that consumers can visit only
one firm (but choose the firm to visit based on price and availability).
        The market allocations in the three competitive models turn out to be the same.
This isn’t that surprising since in all three competitive models the choice of product
variety is efficient (though this is a consequence of assuming homogeneous consumers
and unit demands, see Dana, 1998, and Eden, working paper). Under these conditions,
the three competitive equilibrium allocations are also the same as in the monopoly
problem above. We relax the unit demand assumption in Section 4.
        The following propositions, analogous to Propositions 1 and 2, hold for all three
models.

Proposition 3: When demand is certain, i.e. x = x , then in equilibrium competitive firms
produce only high quality goods if v h − c h > v l − c l and only low quality goods if
vh − ch < vl − cl .


        Proposition 3 follows from marginal cost pricing.




                                                                                          13
Proposition 4: When demand is uncertain, i.e., x < x , then competitive firms produce (i)
only the low quality good if v l − c l > v h − c h ; (ii) both the high quality good and the low
quality good if v h − c h > v l − c l and

         ch cl
           > ;
         vh vl


and (iii) produce only the high quality good if v h − c h > v l − c l and

         cl ch
           > .
         vl vh

        In each case, though the definition of competitive equilibrium changes slightly,
we show that conditions (a) and (b) hold. Proposition 4 (the proof is the same as
Proposition 2) follows from (a) and (b).
        Finally, since Figure 1 follows from (a) and (b), it also depicts the equilibrium
product line offerings in a competitive market.

3.1 Market Clearing
        We begin with a definition of a competitive equilibrium.
        A competitive equilibrium is the ex ante levels of market production, qh and ql ,
a set of state-contingent spot market prices, ph (x ) and pl (x ) and spot market sales such

that (i) firms sell in the spot market no more than they produce ex ante, (ii) if the spot
market price is positive firms sell all that they produced ex ante, (iii) firms cannot
increase their expected profits by producing more ex ante.
        When demand is certain, clearly prices are equal to marginal cost, so Proposition
3 holds. When demand is uncertain, we begin with the case where only one product is
feasible.
        If only one product were feasible, say the high quality product, then when qh ≥ x
the spot market price is zero and sales are x and when qh < x the spot market price is v h




                                                                                               14
and sales are qh . Since the incremental profits from additional units of ex ante demand
must be zero, qh is determined by

               ∫
                    ∞
        ch =       qh
                        v h f (x )dx .


It follows that

        v h [1 − F (qh )]− c h = 0 .

        Now suppose that two products are feasible. We begin by characterizing the
equilibrium spot market prices and sales given qh and ql .
        When x ≤ qh , the spot market price of high and low quality units will be zero and

only high quality units will sell because all consumers strictly prefer high quality. The
shadow cost of both high and low quality is zero.
        When qh < x ≤ ql + qh , the spot market price for low quality is zero and sales of
low quality units are x − ql . If the price were positive, then sales of the high quality units
would be less than qh which implies the price of high quality units is zero, but since

consumers strictly prefer high quality units, the demand for low quality units would be
zero, which is inconsistent with a positive price for low quality units. It follows that the
price of high quality units must be v h − v l and firms sell every unit produced
        When ql + qh < x , the spot market price for high quality units is v h and the spot
market price for low quality units is v l and firms sell every unit produced.

        Since the incremental profits from additional units of ex ante production of low
quality units must be zero, ql is determined by

               ∫
                   ∞
        cl =       qh + ql
                             v l f (x )dx .


And since the incremental profits from additional units of ex ante production of low
quality units must be zero, ql is determined by

               ∫              (v h − v l ) f (x )dx + ∫ q + q v h f (x )dx .
                    qh + ql                             ∞
        ch =       ql                                    h   l




                                                                                               15
So

        v l [1 − F (qh + ql )]− c l ≤ 0, ql ≥ 0

and

        v h [1 − F (qh )]− v l [F (qh + ql ) − F (qh )]− c h ≤ 0, qh ≥ 0

which implies Proposition 4 holds when markets are in equilibrium.

3.2 Rigid Prices and Flexible Consumer Choice
       In this Section and Section 3.3, we assume that the firms set their prices before
learning demand. This assumption seems appropriate for some of the examples discussed
in the introduction, such as restaurants. Moreover price rigidities increase the likelihood
that capacity is not utilized when demand realizations are low, and hence increase the
likelihood that the use of quality dispersion will be the optimal policy to follow. We will
see, however, that in the case of unit demands the equilibrium product variety is the same
with and without price rigidities.
       In this Section, we assume that consumers can observe and costlessly choose
among all available products and prices when they make their purchase decisions.
Consumers make their purchases sequentially (they are identical so the order doesn’t
matter) so this means that when it is a consumer’s turn to purchase, he or she is able to
purchase the best remaining price-product combination offered by any firm.
       This zero shopping cost assumption is not always realistic. Moreover, because of
this assumption this model predicts only the market availability of products and not the
product line of individual firms. In equilibrium, all firms could be specialists in either
high quality or low quality, or all could offer both high and low quality goods. We
change this assumption in Section 3.3.
       This model is a multi-product extension of a model introduced by Prescott (1976),
formalized by Eden (1990), and applied by Dana (2000).


                                                                                             16
        In this environment a competitive equilibrium is a set of market prices,
associated probabilities of sale, and ex ante quantity choices such that (i) firms cannot
increase their profits by changing their ex ante output given the prices and associated
probabilities of sale and (ii) the probability of sale associated with each price is consistent
with prices, quantities, and market demand, (iii) consumers
        When demand is certain all firms charge marginal cost in equilibrium, so
Proposition 3 holds. When demand is uncertain, the competitive equilibrium will consist
of a range of prices for each good offered. From profit maximization, i.e., the zero-profit
condition, it follows that if a low quality good is offered at price p the probability that it
sells in equilibrium must be c l p . However firms may not offer positive output at all

prices in equilibrium.
        In state x, goods with a probability of sale greater than or equal to 1 − F (x ) must

sell. From the zero profit condition, we know low quality goods priced at

            cl
        1 − F (x )

and high quality goods priced at

           ch
        1 − F (x )

are the “last” units to sell in state x. However, consumers prefer high quality goods if

                  ch                 cl
        vh −              > vl −            ,
               1 − F (x )        1 − F (x )

and prefer low quality goods otherwise. When high quality goods are preferred, profit
maximization implies that only high quality goods will be produced. So when this
expression holds at x, i.e., v h − c h > v l − c l , the total supply of high quality goods will be

the quantity that equalizes this expression:




                                                                                                 17
                     ch                 cl
          vh −               = vl −             .
                 1 − F (qh )        1 − F (qh )

In higher demand states, consumers prefer low quality goods, but only if the price is less
than v l . It follows that

                 cl
                           = vl .
          1 − F (qh + ql )

This implies that (a) and (b) are satisfied, so Proposition 4 holds for rigid prices when
consumers have flexible choice.

3.3 Rigid Prices with Inflexible Choice
         In this section, consumers must commit to purchase from a single firm before they
learn whether the firm’s products are available. Consumers choose given only ex ante
information about firms’ products, prices, and inventories. If the firm that a consumer
visits stocks out of a consumer’s preferred product, the consumer either buys another
product from the same firm or nothing at all. So consumers visit the firm that offers the
greatest expect consumer surplus. In equilibrium, competitive firms compete this surplus
down to zero.
         A symmetric competitive equilibrium is a pair of prices and production levels
and a set of active firms such that no combination of prices and production levels exists
that would increase consumers’ surplus if every consumer switched to the deviating firm.
         This model is a multi-product extension of Carlton (1978)1. Since firms have no
market power, the equilibrium prices and inventories are those that maximize consumer
surplus plus producer surplus subject to a zero profit constraint and non-negative ex ante
and ex post consumer surplus constraints. In addition, if a firm offers both products it


1
    See Deneckere and Peck (1995) for an analysis of this game with a finite number of
firms. They show that Carlton’s equilibrium is the limit of the subgame perfect Nash
equilibrium of the oligopoly game as the number of firms goes to infinity.


                                                                                            18
must be the case that consumers buy high quality goods before they buy low quality
goods. If consumers behaved otherwise, the firm would be able to make a profitable
deviation that would induce the efficient purchase order.
          So we can write the firm’s problem as2


                                     ∫                                 ∫

where g is the probability distribution function for the demand state given that a random
consumer actually wants the good. Note that the ex ante consumer surplus constraint is
satisfied as long as the ex post constraints, pl ≤ v l and ph ≤ v h , are satisfied, so it is not
binding. Also, ph ≤ v h and v h − ph ≥ v l − pl imply pl ≤ v l , so we can ignore this

constraint.

    Since f is distribution of aggregate demand and q denotes total output, the individual
firm’s problem profit function is proportional to this aggregate profit function.


                                                                                                                               19
        Consider the firm’s unconstrained production problem subject only to qh ≥ 0 and
ql ≥ 0 . The complementary slackness conditions are

        (v h − v l )[F (qh + ql ) − F (qh )]+ v h [1 − F (qh + ql )]− c h ≥,qh ≥ 0         (x)

and

        v l [1 − F (qh + ql )]− c l ≥ 0,ql ≥ 0,                                            (y)

which imply that both (a) and (b) hold. However we must verify that the omitted
constraints are satisfied. That is, we must verify that given (a) and (b) there exist prices
such that ph ≤ v h , v h − ph ≥ v l − pl , and zero-profit constraint holds.

        It is natural to suppose the equilibrium prices will be the ones that equate the total
revenues from sales of each product to the total costs of producing that product. In this
case the zero profit constraint holds by construction. The price pl is defined by


         ∫ p xf (x)dx + p q [1 − F (q )]− q c
            qh

                 h                    h h           h     h h   = 0,
           0


and the price ph is defined by


         ∫ p (x − q ) f (x)dx + p q [1− F (q + q )]− q c = 0 .
            qh + ql

                 l             h              l l         h     l      l l
           qh



We can rewrite these equations as

                                                     
                ∫          x

                    0     qh                         

and

                                                                  

                    qh          ql                                

where the bracketed expressions are the average probability of sale of the high and low
quality goods respectively.



                                                                                            20
        From (a) and (b) we know

         v h [1 − F (qh )]− c h ≥ 0
and the inequality is strict if ql > 0 . Since


         ∫         x
             qh
                     f (x )dx > 0 ,
             0    qh

(g) implies that v h > ph whenever qh and ql are positive.
        If qh is positive then (a) and (b) imply v h − c h ≥ v l − c l , so

         vh ch vl cl
           −  ≥ − .
         ph ph pl pl

And, since in each demand state the probability of sale of a high quality good is strictly
greater than the probability of sale of a low quality good, it must be that the average
probability of sale is greater for high quality goods, which with (g) and (h) imply that

         cl ch
           > .
         pl ph

So
         vh vl
           >
         ph pl

and since v h ≥ v l , it follows that v h − ph > v l − pl .

        So all of the omitted constraints are satisfied by the solution (a), (b), (g) and (h)
and Proposition 4 holds.
        However the equilibrium in this model does not yield unique individual prices.
The prices defined by (g) and (h) are natural, but they are not unique. The firms could
also subsidize their low quality goods and charge a premium for high quality as long as
its inventory satisfied (a) and (b) and v h − ph > v l − pl > 0 . Prices only role here is to

attract consumers to the store and there are many price pairs that induce the same




                                                                                                21
consumer behavior. Furthermore, different firms can offer different prices in
equilibrium.

Proposition 5: All competitive equilibrium of the inflexible choice, rigid price model

satisfy (a) and (b).

        While the prices pl and ph are not uniquely determined, they must be nonnegative,
they must be less than vl and vh respectively, and they must induce consumers to weakly
prefer the high quality item.

4. The Two-Product Model with Downward Sloping Demand
        In this section we extend the two-product model by considering heterogeneity in
consumers’ valuations. This is particularly valuable because any empirical test of our
theory of product variety will need to consider heterogeneous consumers. Also it is
important to see that two-product models considered in Sections 2 and 3 will no longer
yield the same equilibrium allocation when consumers are heterogeneous. This is
because both market power and ex ante pricing are contributing to the deadweight loss
when consumers are heterogeneous. Market power imposes costs for the usual reason.
Ex ante pricing imposes costs because it is possible that consumers with the highest
valuation of the good may find the good unavailable even while consumers with lower
valuations were able to buy the good. For this reason, we begin by characterizing the
social planner’s problem and then show that this is the market allocation associated with
market clearing prices.
        Let f denote the distribution of x, the number of identical consumers willing to
pay v for the high quality good and v – s for the low quality good. Consumers know their
own valuations conditional on wanting the good, but don’t learn whether or not they want
the good until after the planner has chosen its inventory. The distribution of consumer
valuations in the population is given probability density function h and cumulative



                                                                                           22
density function H. Each consumer who wants a good will buy at most one. As before,
high quality goods cost ch to produce whether or not they are used. Low quality goods
cost cl to produce whether or not they are used. We assume that s > c h − c l , so given

certain demand (e.g., x = x ) only the high quality product would be produced.

       We assume that x and v are independently distributed. In other words, an
individual’s valuation is not correlated with the probability that they want the good. This
assumption implies that there is no role for screening in the product line decision of
firms. If screening were possibly, then it alone would offer a justification for product
variety.
       If the social planner can produce only one good it would produce the high quality
good and the remaining problem would be to choose price, ph, and inventory, qh, to
maximize
                 max (q h , x )
           max ∫ x                x ∫ 0 vh (v )dv f (x )dx +   ∫                    x ∫ H −1 1− q h  vh (v )dv f (x )dx − qh c h .
                                     ∞                             ∞                    ∞

            qh                                                     max (q h , x )                
                                                                                               x 



       The first term characterizes consumer surplus when x consumers want the good
and qh ≥ x are available. In this case everyone gets the good and total surplus is xE [v ].

The second term characterizes consumer surplus when x consumers want the good and
only qh < x are available. In this case only consumers whose valuations are sufficiently

high get the good. The cutoff is the valuation of the marginal consumer in state x, which
is defined by equating total consumption to the planner’s capacity:

                     qh = [1 − H (v )]x ,

                             H −11− h  f (x )dx = c h .                                                                                    (y)
               max (q h ,x )        x

Let q*h denote the solution to (y). The social cost of capacity is set equal to the expected

valuation of the marginal consumer (which is zero when the marginal consumer doesn’t
exist).
          Note that the marginal consumer exists in every demand state if and only if
q*h ≤ x . When q*h > x then there exist low demand states in which everyone who wants

the good has it, and there are no additional consumers available to derive utility from
consuming the good.
          We now turn to the case where the planner can offer two goods. Here the order of
consumption may matter. When all of the goods are consumed, efficiency requires that
the consumers with the highest valuations obtain the good but it does not matter which
consumers get the high quality good; each consumer values quality the same. However
when demand is insufficient to fully utilize the available capacity, efficiency requires that
the consumers with the highest valuations get the good and that all of the high quality
goods be consumed before any of the low quality goods are consumed.
          Using this observation about the allocation of the goods ex post we can write the
social planner’s problem as:

          max
          {q h ,q l   }

        The social cost of high quality capacity is set equal to the marginal consumer’s
expected valuation for high quality, when the marginal consumer exists, plus the social
value of switching a consumer from low quality to high quality when the marginal
consumer does not exist but the high quality good is scarce. The social cost of low
quality capacity is set equal to the expected valuation of the marginal consumer for the
low quality good.

then both good are produced.

        Proof: If G(x ) ≤ c l , then the second complementary slackness condition implies
                                                       [                          ]
        that either ql = 0 or G(qh + ql ) − s 1− F (max(qh + ql , x )) = c l ≥ G(x ). The later

        implies qh + ql ≤ x since G is an increasing function. So either ql = 0 or
        qh + ql ≤ x . Suppose ql = 0 . Then G(qh ) ≤ c h so from the complementary

        slackness conditions it follows that qh > 0 . Alternatively, suppose qh + ql ≤ x .
        Then F (max(qh + ql , x )) = F (max(qh , x )) = 0 and the complementary slackness

        conditions become

                    G(qh + ql ) ≤ c h ,qh ≥ 0 ,

        and

                    G(qh + ql ) ≤ c l + s, ql ≥ 0.

        Since c l + s > c h , G(qh + ql ) ≤ c h implies G(qh + ql ) < c l , so ql = 0 . Hence, if
        G(x ) ≤ c l then only the high quality good is produced.
                    We now claim that if G(x ) > c l and

       Note that q*h ≤ x is a necessary condition for production of the low quality good.

If at the optimal single product production level, every unit of the high quality good
produced is consumed in every demand state, then the low quality good will not be
produced. Multiple product production is optimal when capacity (or inventory) is not
always fully utilized. Numerous classes of demand functions, such as isoelastic and
Cobb-Douglas, have the property that demand approaches infinity as price goes to zero
which implies x = ∞. In this case, it is clear that q*h < x and production is always fully

utilized so only one product would be produced.
       The necessary and sufficient conditions under which a social planner would
choose to produce both high and low quality products are different from the conditions
under which a monopolist or a competitive market with price rigidities (Sections 3.2 and
3.3) would produce both products. For a monopolist this is clear because the decision
depends on the preferences of the marginal consumers and the monopolist will clearly
distort price and sell to fewer consumers. Similarly, under two of the competitive models
we analyze, prices are rigid and the resulting market distortions will impact the product
line decision. In each of these models, price rigidities increase the likelihood that capacity
is underutilized and hence increases the value of producing both products. Under market
clearing prices, the equilibrium product line decision will be the same as in Proposition 6.
This is fairly easy to see since the competitive market with market clearing prices
allocates the good in the same way that the social planner does.


                                                                                             29
5. Monopoly with Full Product Line
        In this section we generalize the two-product model by allowing the firm to offer
a continuum of vertically differentiated product varieties. We consider explicitly only the
monopolist’s decision, however generalizations of the other models are also feasible and
based on the analysis of the monopoly case we briefly discuss the various competitive
models and the complex forces that will drive product line decisions in those
environments.
        As before, let f (x ) denote the probability density function associated with the

random variable x, the number of identical consumers willing to buy one unit of output
(one good), on the support [x,x ] ⊂ ℜ + and suppose x > 0. Let F (x ) denote the

associated cumulative distribution function.
        Let v denote consumers’ willingness to pay. Let c (v ) denote the cost of producing
one unit of the product when quality is v. We assume c (0) = 0 and c ′(0) < 1. We also
assume that there exists some v such that v − c(v ) < 0 for all v > v . Let
v * = argmax(v − c (v )). Clearly,


Proposition 7: When demand is certain, the monopolist chooses product quality v˜ = v * ,
produces q = x units, and sets its price equal to v * .

        We now turn to the case where demand is uncertain.

Single Product Monopolist
        Suppose that the firm is able to produce only one product. Which level of product
quality would the firm choose? The firm chooses its price, quantity, and quality to
maximize profits. Clearly the firm sets ph = v , whether prices are set before or after

demand is realized, so we can write the firm’s problem as


               ∫                  ∫ vqf (x)dx − qc(v).
                   q                ∞

This establishes the following two results:


Proposition 8: When demand is uncertain and the firm is constrained to choose a single
product variety, then the product quality chosen satisfies v˜ < v * .

Proposition 9: As the demand uncertainty increases, the monopolist’s choice of product

quality, v˜ , falls.

The Multi-Product Monopolist
         We now suppose that the monopolist can produce an arbitrary amount of each
quality. Without loss of generality (since the firm offers a continuum of product
qualities), we assume it sets a uniform price for each quality.
         The following Lemma simplifies the statement of the firm’s optimization
problem. We show that the monopolist sets p (v ) = v for all of the products it offers and

that purchase decisions are ex post efficient. Once again, this is very intuitive. Since
these prices are feasible, the firm can easily induce consumers’ to make ex post efficient




                                                                                           31
purchasing decisions, and the firm captures the entire surplus, it is impossible for the
monopolist to achieve any higher ex post profits.

Lemma: Given its inventory, the monopolist sets p (v ) = v for all of the products it

produces, and in equilibrium consumers buy goods in decreasing order of quality
(highest quality goods stock out first).

       Proof: If consumers strictly prefer some goods to others, then there must be at
       least one good whose price the firm can increase without affecting the order in
       which consumers make their purchases or the total volume of their purchases, and
       would therefore increase profits. Since this is a contradiction, consumers must be
       indifferent between all goods.
               If consumers are indifferent between the goods then clearly the price and
       quality ranking of the goods must be the same and it follows that consumers must
       buy the highest priced (highest quality) good first, and consume the goods in
       decreasing order of price. If not, then by lowering the prices of all of its goods by
       a small, systematical different, amount, the firm could induce consumers to
       reorder there purchases in decreasing order of price which strictly increases the
       firm’s expected profit.
               The firm must set the price of its lowest quality units equal to consumers’
       valuations since otherwise raising this price would have no impact on the volume
       or order of product sales and would strictly increase profits. And since consumers
       are indifferent between the goods, it follows that the prices for all products must
       equal consumers’ valuations.

       The firm’s problem is further simplified if we express the decision variable as the
quality of each unit of the firm’s output rather than the amount of its output to offer at
each quality level. Define v (x ) to be the quality of the good purchased and consumed by



                                                                                             32
the marginal consumer when x consumers demand the good. So c (v (x )) is the ex ante

cost of producing the marginal unit consumed in state x. It follows directly from the
lemma that v (x ) is non-increasing in x, and therefore that c (v (x )) is non-decreasing in x.

           The firm’s problem is to choose its inventory and the product quality of each unit
of its inventory. Let Q denote the firm’s inventory which is clearly finite, so the firm
chooses Q and v (x ) on [0,Q] to maximize

           ∫ v (x )(1− F (x ))dx − ∫ c (v (x ))dx
             Q                           Q

             0                           0
                                                                                                  (P)

subject to the constraint that v (x ) is non-increasing.


Proposition 10: When demand is uncertain, the optimal range of qualities for the firm is
[vˆ,v ].
    *




           Proof: Suppose the constraint does not bind. Then it is clear that the firm’s
           optimization can be solved by point-wise maximization. The first order conditions
           are

                    c ′(v (x )) = 1− F (x )                                                       (*)

           for all x ∈ [0,Q] and

                    c (v (Q))
                                = 1− F (Q) .                                                  (**)
                      v (Q)

           Equation (*) implies that v (0) = v * = arg max(v − c (v )) . Combining (*) and (**)

           yields

                                   c (v (Q))
                    c ′(v (Q)) =               .
                                    v (Q)

           So from the definition of vˆ ,

                                              c (v )
                    v (Q) = vˆ = arg min             .
                                                v


                                                                                                  33
       Since, c ′′ > 0 , and (*) implies

               c ′′(v (Q))v ′(Q) = − f (x ),

       it follows that v (x ) is strictly decreasing and the constraint is not binding. So the
       optimal range of qualities is [vˆ,v * ]. 


       The proposition establishes that the highest quality product that the firm produces
is the product that would be offered if demand were certain. That is, the highest quality
offered is the one that maximizes surplus (and the monopolist’s margin) conditional on
sale. The lowest quality offered is the one that maximizes the monopolist’s percentage
markup.
       Note that the range of qualities is always finite, as long as c (v * )< v * , because

when the cost function is continuous there always exists a finite interval on which c (v ) v

is increasing and c − v is decreasing. In other words, there exists some v < v * such that

        c (v ) c (v )
                   *

              < * .
          v      v

       As demand becomes more and more certain, the range of products offered
remains the same. This is empirically counterintuitive. However, this model ignores the
fixed costs associated with product variety. While the optimal product variety is
independent of the demand uncertainty, the benefits of product variety diminish as
demand becomes more certain. So if fixed costs of product variety were included in the
model, then variety would diminish.
       For brevity we do not replicate these results for the three competitive models
discussed in Section 3. However it is clear that the monopolist is once again extracting
the entire consumer surplus, so the monopoly outcome, social planner outcome, and the
market clearing price outcome are clearly the same. Because consumers have




                                                                                               34
homogeneous valuations, the other two competitive models also yield the same market
allocation.

6. Conclusion
        We have shown that demand uncertainty is an explanation for vertical product
differentiation even when consumers have ex post identical tastes. Demand uncertainty
makes it possible that not all inventory or capacity is utilized, and as a consequence,
firms find it optimal to respond to sell low cost, low quality products in addition to high
cost, high quality ones. In practice underutilization of inventory is much more likely
when firms prices are rigid. Therefore, all else equal, we expect that we see a greater
range of product qualities in such cases.
        Future work should consider product line choice when the manufacturer and the
retailer are different firms. In this case, a monopoly manufacturer of a high quality good
can choose to extract rents from his retailer either directly through a higher price, or
indirectly by being the sole supplier of the low quality good and earning an additional
margin when a low quality sale is made. This second approach is likely to be more
efficient than the first, because it avoids a marginal price distortion. This suggests that
simple extensions of our model will provide an explanation for manufacturers’ use of
full-line forcing.
        We believe that this work should have a direct impact on the empirical literature
on product differentiation and price discrimination. Our model predicts higher absolute
markups and lower percentage markups for high quality products in both competitive and
monopoly markets, even when consumers have ex post identical preferences for product
quality. The model is empirically relevant for any market in which consumer substitute
between high and low quality, market demand is uncertain, and market clearing spot
prices do not guarantee that firms’ inventory or capacity is fully utilized.




                                                                                              35
         Empirical testing of the model would require careful attention to the measurement
of margins, turnover, shelf space restrictions, competitive conditions in retailing and
manufacturing, and the use of full line forcing, as well as to the existence of customers
with different relative valuations over quality. Perhaps the most direct existing studies
relevant to our model involve a study of grocery stores, which, for a wide variety of
products, stock both high quality national brands and low quality private labels. The
evidence seems to support our model’s main predictions. For a wide variety of products
(e.g., tooth brushes, toothpaste, soft drinks, crackers, soups, cereals, etc) grocery stores
earn a higher percentage margins on private labels than on national brands, while the
absolute margin (especially after adjusting for turnover) is generally higher on the
national brands.3 But these studies should be viewed as only suggestive of the model’s
applicability, and more carefully designed studies across a variety of different industries
would be necessary to full test the applicability of the model’s predictions.
