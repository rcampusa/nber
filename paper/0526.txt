                               ABSTRACT



     This paper presents an explicit model of portfolio demand and uses

it to show how the rate of inflation and its variances affect the real prices

of land and of common stock. The analysis is thus an extension of two of the

author's earlier papers which studied how the interaction of inflation and

tax rules alter the real prices of land and stock. The analysis shows the

importance of going beyond the traditional assumption that net—of—tax yields

are equated for all assets.

   Inflation, Portfolio Choice, and      the Prices   of Land and Corporate Stock


                                Martin Feldstein*



        During the rapid inflation of the past decade, the price of land has not

 only kept its real value but has increased far more rapidly than the general

 price level.' While elementary economic theory would predict that land and all

other real assets would hold their real value when the price level rose, the

increase in the relative price of land caught economists as well as others by

surprise.

       The reasons for the rise in the relative price of land are multiple and

complex. They range from the rise in the world price of food to the political

instability in the Middle East and the fears of political change in Western

Europe. No single paper, let alone a short theoretical one, could hope to

provide a full explanation.

       There is, however, a fundamental link between general price inflation

and the relative price of land that deserves particular attention. This relation

is the opposite side of the same coin that causes inflation to depress the price

of common stock. In essence, inflation and the tax laws interact to raise the

return on land and lower the return on reproducible capital.2 The prices of




iarvard t5niyersity and the Nationa Bureau of Economic Research.

       1For the 1970's as a whole, the Agriculture Department's index of the
price of farm land rose at an annual rate of 13 percent, nearly double the 7.4
percent annual rise in the general consumer price index.
            this paper, I   use the   term reproducible capital to refer to business
capit-al and ignore owner—occupied     housing. In many ways, owner occupied housing
behaves like land in its response to inflation.

these   assets must then adjust to the new inflation expectation to make investors

willing to hold both types of assets in the initially existing quantities. This

requires the price of land to rise (relative to the general price level) and the

price of reproducible capital to fall.

         If uncertainty could be ignored, the price changes would be such that the

real after—tax rates of return were equal both before and after any change in the

rate of inflation. A model of asset demand that makes this simple arbitrage

assumption and ignores uncertainty can however be very misleading. The present

paper presents an explicit model of portfolio demand and uses it to show how the

rate of inflation and its variance affect the real prices of land and capital.

         The present paper is thus an extension of two earlier studies in which I

presented models of how the interaction of inflation and the tax rules alter

the real prices of land (Feldstein, 1979) and common stock (Feldstein, 1980a).

Although these papers considered the role of uncertainty in a rather ad hoc way,

a formal model of portfolio choice derived from utility maximization was lacking.

The purpose of the present paper is to remedy that deficiency.

         A basic result of the earlier papers (as well as of the present analysis)

is that changes in tIe rate of inflation alter the relative price of assets while

at any constant inflation rate the equilibrium real asset prices remain unchanged.

Thus an unanticipated jump in the expected rate of inflation causes an immediate

jump in the level of the land price. After this initial jump, the price of

land increases at the same rate as the general rate of inflation.

         This   interpretation implies that the   continuous increase   in   the price of

land   during   the 1970's can best be thought of as a combination of (1) many

small changes in the equilibrium real price of land (as the expected rate of

general price inflation changed) and (2) a continuing increase in the nominal

price of land at the prevailing rate of inflation. Similarly, the fall in the
                                     —3—


real value of share prices combines a series of falls in the equilibrium real

price of shares with continuous increases in their nominal price.

       The first section of this paper presents the model of portfolio equili-

brium while the second section derives the means and variances of the asset

yields. The price equations for land and reproducible capital are then developed

in section 3. The fourth section derives the comparative static results for

changes in inflation and in the uncertainty of inflation. A brief con-

cluding section discusses some of the implications of this work and possible

directions for further research.

1. A Model of Portfolio Equilibrium



       The economy that I shall describe consists of identical individuals1

who hold a short term nominal asset, (1tbillst), land, and (reproducible) capital.

The current price level and current inflation rate are known but the rate of

inflation in the future is unknown. For simplicity, it is easiest to think of

the economy switching from one expected inflation rate to another.2

       The aggregate stocks of both land and capital are assumed fixed. While

this may be a realistic approximation for land,3 it is clearly not an appropriate
                                                                   4
model for capital. If the market price of existing capital assets falls below

replacement cost, the size of the capital stock will fall while a market price of

ecisting assets above their replacement cost will cause an increase in net

investment. The anticipation of the future change in the size of the capital

stock will change the expected future yields per unit of capital and labor.

That in turn will influence the initial changes in the prices of these assets.

While it would clearly be desirable to incorporate this effect into the analysis,

the combination of dynamic price adjustments and explicit portfolio choice under

uncertainty is a more complex problem than I can currently solve.5 I have chosen

       'The assumption of identical individuals ignores another important feature
that belongs in a more complete model of portfolio choice: differences in tax
rates among investors. The distinction between taxable individual investors and
tax exempt institutions can be particularly important in understanding the effect
of inflation on portfolio investment (Feldstein, l980a,b).

       2The idea of an expected time pattern of future inflation rates might be
more realistic hut would be more complex to analyze without adding any fundamen--
tally new insights.

       3The effective stock of land can change through the loss of topsoil,
forestation, etc.

       4mis is Tobints   q value, the index of common stock prices per unit
of real capital.

       5Poterba (1980) and Sumniers (1980) have extended the type of analysis
presented in Feldstcin (1979, 1980a,b) to include an explicit capital stock
adjustment process with feedback onto the path of asset prices. They assume
certainty and therefore that the yields of all assets are always equated, at
least up to a constant.

to focus on the portfolio choice aspect but I recognize the importance of

extending the specification to incorporate the dynamic general equilibrium

response.

            Consider an individual i whose initial holdings of land, capital and

money are L.
           1 units of land, K.1 units of capital and B. dollars of treas—
                                                              1
ury bills. These holdings reflect some previous set of expectations about asset

yields and the associated covariance matrix. When the Hicksian "week" begins,

there is a new set of expectations (possibly but not necessarily identical with

the old ones). These expectations imply a set of equilibrium asset prices

      and        relative to the numeraire; the purpose of this section is to derive

equations for these equilibrium prices.

         The individual's initial endowment is thus B. + p L. + p K. and must
                                                     1      Li Ki
be redivided among new holdings (B., L. and K.) according to the wealth

constraint:




(1)              B. + PLLi + PKKi = Bi + Li + PKKi



        At the end of the "week", each unit of land is worth RL      ,   each unit of

capital is worth RK and each unit of bills is worth RB .          Thus    RL — 1

is the return per week per unit of land, RK — 1      is the return on capital,

and RB — 1       is the rate of interest. All of these are to be regarded as

real after—tax rates of return. The returns to land and capital are uncertain
while   the bill   return is riskless.1 The individual's wealth at the end of


       1This reflects the assumption that the inflation rate for the current week
is known even though the future inflation is uncertain.

the week is thus:




(2)             Wi = RLL. + RKK. + RB.



       If each individual has the same quadratic utility function, expected

utility can be written as a linear combination of the mean and variance of W.:



(3)             E[u(W.)] = E[W.) —       0.5y     var (Wi)



where y >   0    is a measure of risk aversion and the 0.5 is introduced to simplify

subsequent calculations.

      Equation 2 implies that



(4)             E(W.) =
                          L.     + RKK. + RBBi



where the bars over the RL and                   denote expected yields for the one week

holding period. By using equation 1, this may be rewritten



(5)             E(W.) =
                          RLL.
                                 + RKK. + RB[pL(Li —     L.)   + pK(Ri —   K.)   + B.]



Equation 2 also implies that



(6)             var (W.) =           +           + 2GLKLiK.
                             GLLLI



wher& °LL and              as the variances of the one week holding period returns

and GKL is the covariance.

       The household's optimum portfolio is found by maximizing the value of

expected utility in equation 3 subject to the constraint of equation 1. Using

equations 5 and 6, this implies the first—order conditions:



 (7)         0 =       — RBpL — -r[OLLLI + OLKKiJ



and




(8)          0 =       - RBpK — Y[GKKKI +



       The pair of asset demand equations may therefore be written:


                                                  — Rp

        Equation 10 can thus be solved explicitly for the equilibrium asset

prices as functions of the expected yields, the covariance matrix, and the

    2.     The Means and Variances of Asset Yields



              I turn now to the derivation of the mean real net—of—tax returns on the

    three assets and the corresponding covariance matrix.

              Consider first the real net rate of return on bills. If the nominal

    short term rate is r , the personal tax rate is 0 , and the active current

    inflation rate is ii         , the   real net—of—tax rate of return is



    (13)             RB = (1 —        0)r   —   it


    Because the tax is levied on the nominal return, the real net of tax returns

    will vary with the rate of inflation. Ever since Irving Fisher (1930),

    empirical studies have confirmed that the nominal interest rate changes approxi-

    mately point—for—point with sustained changes in the rate of inflation1; in the

    current notation, dr/dir                1 is a reasonable approximation. This implies that
I
              =—   (1 — 0)   <   0;    an increase in the inflation rate reduces the real net
    dRB/dlr
    return on bills. For a high enough inflation rate, the real return can be nega-

    tive. This is a particularly important feature of our tax system because it

    suggests that the usual assumption of equal yields on all assets may be wrong and

    a poor approximation when there is substantial inflation.

              The return on a unit of a land consists of an income return and a capital

    gain or loss. If the marginal physical product per unit of land (per week) is

    FL ,    the net—of—tax marginal revenue product is (1 — O)pFL            .   Increases in the

    price of land are taxable capital gains. The capital gains tax rate is less


              1See, e.g., Yohe and Karnovsky (1968) and Feldstein and Suners (1978).
                                                       —10—


than the tax rate on ordinary income and the effective tax rate is further

reduced because capital gains are taxed only when the property is sold; I

shall use the letter c to denote the accrual—equivalent effective tax

rate, i.e., the rate which levied on accruals would collect the same present

value of taxes as the actual rate levied on realizations. If the increase in

the price of land during the week is 1L                         the after tax capital gain is

(1 -

         The total nominal return per unit of land is thus (1 — 6)pFL + (1 —                     c)L.
Since a unit of land costs L the nominal return per dollar invested in

land is (1 —                      + (1   —                    The real rate of return is the differ-
                    O)pFL/PL                     c)L/pL   .



ence between this nominal rate of return and the rate of inflation:

(1 —
        O)pFL/pL
                   + (1 —
                              c)L/pL
                                             —     .   Finally,   the real return per unit of land

(RL) is just the product of the real rate of return and the price per unit of

land:




(14)
                        =   (1-   e)pFL + (1- c)L -



         There are two types of uncertainty about this return, corresponding to

the income and capital gain components of the price change. Since the current

price level is known, the income uncertainty is caused by the uncertain marginal

physical product of land., If cL is the mean marginal physical product of

land and '         is   the random cdmponent with zero mean and variance




(15)           FL =         L+
                                                  —11-


In a stationary equilibrium the price of land will rise at the same rate as

the general price level:                 =   iT       .
                                                            Change in the expected future rate of

inflation or in the expected future value of any other factor that influences

the value of land will cause the price of land to change by more or less than

the current rate of inflation. The uncertain change in the price of land can

be written without restriction as:

                The return on reproducible capital also consists of an income return

      and a change in the price of the asset. Because the tax rules are based on

      nominal accounting definitions, a rise in the rate of inflation increases

      the effective tax rate on the real income from reproducible capital.1 This

      is due primarily to the required use of historic cost depreciation but also

      reflects the method of inventory accounting.2 If the marginal physical

—3k   product per unit of -14 is FK ,                          the   net—of—tax marginal revenue product in

      approximate the extra tax burden per unit of capital as proportional to the

      rate of inflation; the real return per unit of capital is thus depressed by

      )crrp   at current prices. The real net of tax income per unit of capital is thus

      of how higher inflation increases the effective tax rate on the income of non-
      financial corporations and of their equity owners.

             3This ignores the sepdrate corporate income tax and the differential
      treatment of dividends and retained earnings. Recognizing these would complicate
      the analysis without changing anything fundamental.

        The income uncertainty of the return on capital reflects the uncertain

marginal product of capital and can be represented by:



(21)
              FK=K+
where 0 has mean zero and variance               The uncertain change in the price

of existing capital assets can be written

3. The Price Equations



             The means and covariance matrix of the returns on land and capital can

be used with equation 12a and 12b to obtain explicit price equations for land

and capital. It is useful to begin by substituting the mean values RB and

RL into equations 12 to obtain the price of land:


                             (1- O)pL - cupL                   —            + o

                                                                   GLL
                                                                     L         LKi)
                                              (1 —    e)r —


Collecting        and rearranging terms yields:


                                                      (1 -
(27)
                    p        (1 —       O)r — (1 —         c)Tr    +
                                                                       1L   (GLLL + GLKK)



          There are several significant things to notice about this expression

for the real price of land                                 .      In   the absence of risk—aversion (y =                       0)
and inflation (11         = 0)      ,    the real price of land is just the discounted value of

the expected return per unit of land, i.e.,                                             =          .    If    there is inflation

but no risk—aversion, the relationship is more complex; the perpetuity

at           is discounted by r —                    [(1   —   c)/(l    —   O)]ii       .     Since     (1         c)I(1 —   0) > 1,
this "net discount rate" can easily become "negative". That is, as u rises

r —    [(1   —   c)/(l   — 0)url        approaches zero and the implied relative price of

land becomes indefinitely large. When (1 —                                   o)r    <       (1 — c)7r   ,    the   value of

L' "passes through" infinity and becomes apparently negative. More generally,

for many plausible tax parameters, the relative price of land is implausibly

sensitive to changes in                  ur

         These results show the importance of explicitly recognizing the role

of uncertainty and risk—aversion in determining L' Equation 27 shows

that risk—aversion can eliminate the anomalous results. With

                     0   in the denominator, relative asset prices are not nearly
y(OLLL+ GLKK) >
so sensitive to differences in the mean real net rates of return.

         A more complete characterization of the real price of land is obtained

       °LL and °LK are rewritten in terms of the underlying variances and

covariances. The essential features of the analysis are preserved but the

analysis is simplified by assuming that the income disturbances (3 and )                   are

independent of each other and of the price disturbances ( and              6i)   .   Such an

assumption would be reasonable if investors knew that the disturbances

and 0 are serially independent so that a disturbance in one period has no

implications about future values of FL and FK .                 With this simplifying

assumption, the relevant variances and covariances of section 2 become:

                                     +   (1 —   c)



         In this form, the real price of land is defined as a quadratic function of

tax rates, rates of return, the expected inflation rate, and the total wealth

in land and capital. If the income risk is ignored (a = 0)                             ,   the real price

of land assumes the simple form:



(33)                =
                        (1 —   6)r   — (1 —     c)lr + y(1       —   c) (GpLL + OPKK


This   case is also substantively interesting because the price risk can generally

be expected to be large relative to the income risk and because uncertainty about

the future inflation rate contributes to the price risk but not the income risk.

         The analogous equation for the real market price of capital is

                                                    (1 — O)q   — Air

4. Some Comparative Static Analyses



           Equations 33 and 34 can be used to examine how the real prices of land

and capital respond to changes in inflation, the uncertainty of future infla-

tion, etc. Since the stock of capital is assumed to remain constant,' the

results can of course only indicate the direction and not the magnitude of the

change.

           The derivative of                               with respect to the expected inflation rate

is easily shown to be:


                     d(pL/p)                                                                   dr                                dVL

where VL =                 and VK                              .     Note first that, in the absence of risk—
                 PLL                                PKK
aversion, the effect of inflation on the real price of land is positive if

(dr/dir)    <   (1   —   c)/(l       — 0)       .     Since c <               U     ,     this   will clearly be satisfied

whenever dr/dir < 1              .     During the increasing inflation of the 1960's and 1970's,
the nominal interest rate rose by approximately the rise in the rate

of inflation, causing the real net interest rate to fall by (1 — 0)dir                                                     .    In
contrast, the real return on land falls only because of the smaller rate of capi-

tal gains tax on the nominal appreciation in the value of the land. Since the

extra tax on bills per dollar of capital would exceed the extra tax on land, the

price of land rises in the absence of uncertainty in order to equalize the yields.



           1See above, page 4
                                           —19—


         Introducing uncertainty leaves this conclusion unchanged but suggests

that the magnitude of the effect may be reduced. If d(pL/p)/thr < 0

dVL/dlr < 0   since VL =         and L is constant. This positive term offsets
                           PLL
some of the magnitude of the pure tax and interest rate effect, the economic

reason for this is that as            rises the investor has relatively more wealth

in this form which in turn raises the risk premium that the investor requires

to hold even more land or, equivalently, which reduces the demand for more land

and therefore the real price of land.

        If the primary reason for the covariance between the unanticipated

changes in the prices of land and capital (c) are the unanticipated changes

in inflation, the term GdVK/dir is also likely to be positive, further

reducing d(pL/p)/dIr but nevertheless leaving it positive. For example,

dpL/dT > 0    and dpK/thr < 0    imply o < 0             and dVK/dlr < 0       and therefore that

GdVK/dlT > 0      Similarly, dpL/dT > 0           and dpK/dlT 0 imply aE >             0   and

dV /di > 0    and therefore again o dV /dir > 0                 .    The economic reason (in the
  K
relevant case in which dpK/dlr < 0)         is that inflation reduces the value of the

investors' reproducible capital and, since the return on capital is negatively

correlated with the return on land, reduces the demand for land and therefore

its price.

        The effect of uncertainty is nevertheless to dampen the effect of infla-

tion and not to reverse it. To see this, note that the opposite implies a

contradiction. If dpL/dlr < 0     ,    c                  < 0       which implies an even larger
                                             (dVL/dlr)

positive value of dpL/drr

        A similar analysis shows that a higher rate of inflation reduces the

real value of capital1 and that the uncertainty and risk aversion again dampen

the magnitude of the effect.


        'This depends on the relative magnitudes of the historic cost deprecia-
tion effect and the real interest rate effect.   For an analysis with realistic
parameters, see Feldstein (l980b).

         Consider now the effect of an increase in the uncertainty of the

 relative increase in each term depends on the extent to which uncertainty

 about inflation is the source of the uncertainty about asset prices. Two

 extremes will illustrate the possible results. If most of the variation in

the real price of land reflects variation in anticipated inflation while little

of the variation in the price of capital reflects the inflation uncertainty,

an increase in the inflation uncertainty will raise a                              while leaving a
                                                                             cc                              ww

between c and w unchanged, equations 33 and 34 imply that an increase in

inflation uncertainty reduces both                 and            .     Investors       respond to the

increased uncertainty by demanding less land and capital and more of the risk—

less nominal asset.

        More generally, the response of relative asset prices to an increase in

inflation uncertainty will depend on the relative extent to which a                                    ,     a

and a     are changed. An increase in inflation uncertainty might cause the

real price of land to rise if investors wish to substitute both land and bills

for capital.

5. Conclusion



          This paper has focused on the specific question of how changes in

expected inflation and in its uncertainty affect the real prices of land and

of reproducible capital. The analysis shows how an explicit portfolio choice

framework can be applied to derive asset price equations and how, in the

framework, the interaction of taxes and increased inflation causes a rise in

the real value of land and a fall in the real value of corporate equities.

          Two more general points are worth noting. First, the analysis shows the

inappropriateness of the common assumption that inflation is neutral, i.e., that

it does not alter real magnitudes. When there are taxes on capital income, this

is false and inflation can have substantial real effects.

          Second, the traditional assumption that prices adjust until net—of—tax

yields are equal may be very misleading. In the examples shown here, the

existence of a finite price for land depends on the uncertainty of the asset

yields.

          This paper has shown that an explicit utility maximization model of

portfolio choice can be applied to analyzing the effects of changes in the rate

of inflation. A natural next step is to embed this analysis in a more general

dynamic framework in which changes in the price of capital change the supply of

new capital goods and therefore the future path of the real marginal products

of capital and land.
