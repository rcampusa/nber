Optimality and Equilibrium In a Competitive Insurance Market Under Adverse Selection and
Moral Hazard
Joseph Stiglitz and Jungyoll Yun
NBER Working Paper No. 19317
August 2013
JEL No. D86

                                              ABSTRACT

This paper analyzes optimal and equilibrium insurance contracts under adverse selection and moral
hazard, comparing them with those under a single informational asymmetry. The complex interactions
of self-selection and moral hazard constraints have important consequences. We develop an analytic
approach that allows a characterization of equilibrium and optimal (Pareto Optimal (PO), and Utilitarian
optimal (UO)) allocations. Among the results : (i) a PO allocation may involve “shirking” (not only
less care in accident avoidance than is possible, but less care compared to the case of pure moral hazard)
either by high risk individuals in the case of single-crossing preference or by one or both types in the
case of multi-crossing preference (as may naturally be the case under the double informational asymmetry);
and (ii) while an equilibrium, which is unique (even under multi-crossing preferences) if it exists, is
more likely to exist as the non-shirking constraint for low-risk type gets more stringent (i.e. when low
risk individuals shirk with lower levels of insurance). We also show that a pooling equilibrium, which
is not feasible under pure adverse selection, may exist when individuals differ in risk aversion (as well
as in accident probability) or when the provision of insurance is non-exclusive (i.e. individuals can
purchase insurance from more than one firm). Furthermore, while with pure adverse selection, UO
always entails pooling with complete insurance (in the standard model), with adverse selection and
moral hazard, all PO allocations may entail separation and the UO may entail incomplete insurance.
We show further that, in general, any PO allocation can be implemented by a basic pooling insurance
provided by the government and a supplemental separating contracts that can be offered by the market,
although, in the presence of moral hazard, a tax needs to be imposed upon the market provision.

The analysis suggests that two commonly observed features of many countries’ public insurance schemes
are consistent with PO: (a) Some individuals (type H) shirk—contrary to widespread views, it is
not a sign of a poorly designed system that some individuals shirk; and (b) there exists a hybrid provision
of insurance by the government and the market.

1. Introduction

Risk and improvements in the way that it can be managed has been a central theme in
economic theory and policy in recent decades. Individuals are risk averse, so the insecurity
posed by the risk of unemployment, accident, disease, etc. has major adverse effects on
welfare. 2 Partially because of perceptions that private markets have not adequately
responded, governments throughout the world have designed social insurance systems to help
mitigate the economic effects of these untoward events.3 Yet controversies rage over the
best design of insurance schemes, including the extent to which reliance can be placed on
markets.

It has long been known that insurance can attenuate incentives to avoid the insured against
event. Optimal insurance balances out the benefits of improved risk mitigation with the
costs of weakened incentives. Practical policies are bedeviled by the further complications
of individual heterogeneity and the complexities posed by the interaction of public insurance
and private provision. A currently fashionable approach has it that government should
provide some level of “basic coverage,” but that people should be free to purchase additional
coverage from private carriers. There has, to date, been little theoretical work establishing
contexts in which such a mixed system (which we refer to below as a “hybrid” system) would
satisfy optimality properties. The argument for the base coverage is often related to the fear
that private markets will focus on “cream skimming”—providing insurance to those of the
lowest risk-- so that basic coverage at affordable prices to high risk individuals can only be
obtained through some version of an enforced pooling equilibrium, in which low risk
individuals subsidize high risk individuals. The US Medicare program, for instance, works
this way, with those wishing to buy supplemental insurance being encouraged to do so.

   Over the past thirty years, a large literature has developed considering market equilibrium
with adverse selection and moral hazard. The original results of, say, Rothschild-Stiglitz
[1976] in the context of adverse selection or Arnott-Stiglitz [1991] in the context of moral
hazard, have proven robust. Take the canonical insurance model, where an equilibrium is
defined as a set of contracts, each of which break even when chosen by those who prefer the
contract to any other offered in the market, and such that there does not exist another contract
which, given the existing set of contracts, would make a profit were it to be offered.        In
                                                                    4
adverse selection models where the single crossing property holds, if there is an equilibrium,
it is a separating equilibrium characterized by full insurance of the high risk individual, and
incomplete insurance of the low risk individual.
  Remarkably, in the ensuing thirty years since the canonical models were first developed,
there has been little literature devoted to the question of what happens when there is both
moral hazard and adverse selection, as is almost always the case in the real world. Such
situations pose difficult policy dilemmas.
   Consider the on-going debate over health care reform. Those focusing on moral hazard

  Research over the past four decades has helped explain why markets may not respond adequately—there may
not exist a competitive equilibrium, and when it does exist, it may provide only limited insurance and attempts
to differentiate among individuals with different risks may be very costly.

  That is, the indifference curves of high and low risk individuals (in say {benefit, premium} space) cross only
once.
                                                                                                               2
argue that we should encourage people to self-insure, through health insurance savings
accounts.     But critics say that that will result in a breaking down of existing insurance
pools: the least risky will self-insure, leaving the worse risks in the insurance pool. That
in turn will lead to higher insurance premiums, leading more to be uninsured. Clearly, it is
not a Pareto improvement: those that chose not to avail themselves of the tax subsidized
accounts are worse off, essentially because they lose the implicit cross subsidy from low risk
individuals in the earlier pooling equilibrium. Worries about adverse selection effects of the
reforms introduced to mitigate moral hazard have hampered health care reform.
         Similarly, in financial loan markets, requiring more collateral might mitigate the
moral hazard problem—those with more collateral will be less induced to engage in
excessively risky behavior. But it is possible that wealthier people with more collateral will
be more risk prone (either because of the higher level of wealth, or because those with wealth
include disproportionately large numbers who have gambled and “won.”) Again, the
interaction of adverse selection and moral hazard effects are at the center of the analysis of
how to address problems posed by information asymmetries.
   To date, however, there has been neither a full analysis of the market equilibrium nor of the
Pareto optimal (PO) or utilitarian optimum (UO) set of insurance contracts (nor does such an
analysis exist in other simple market contexts) in which there is the double informational
asymmetry problem of both moral hazard and adverse selection.5 This paper provides such
an analysis, with results that are strikingly simple, though even in the simplest model the
analytics turn out to be remarkably complex. We combine the Rothschild-Stiglitz insurance
model with two groups with the Arnott-Stiglitz model with two activity levels, providing an
analysis of the full set of Pareto efficient contracts, characterizing the utilitarian optimum,
describing the market equilibrium, and ascertaining how the government might be able to
implement the optimal allocations.
   This paper identifies several distinctive features of optimal and equilibrium allocations that
are not present under pure adverse selection or under pure moral hazard; these distinctive
features are the results of self-selection and moral hazard constraints interacting with each
other: (i) a PO allocation may involve “shirking” (less care in accident avoidance compared
to the case of pure moral hazard) either by high risk individuals in the case of single-crossing
preference or by one or both types in the case of multi-crossing preference (as may naturally
be the case under the double informational asymmetry) 6; and (ii) while an equilibrium, which
is unique (even under multi-crossing preferences) if it exists, is more likely to exist as the
non-shirking constraint for low-risk type gets more stringent (i.e. when low risk individuals
shirk with lower levels of insurance). We also show that a pooling equilibrium, which is not
feasible under pure adverse selection, may exist when individuals differ in risk aversion (as


5
  Three exceptions are the study of Whinston [1983] , who uses the Diamond/Mirrlees social
insurance/retirement model, and shows that the utilitarian optimum involves pooling; Stiglitz-Weiss [1987],
who look at moral hazard and adverse selection in a credit market with collateral, where individuals differ in
both their collateral and the probability of default; and Chassagnon-Chiappori (1997), who examined the
properties of equilibrium in a model of adverse selection and moral hazard, which is characterized by multiple-
crossing preferences. This paper makes clear how each employs assumptions that are special cases of the
model analyzed here. There have been some works (Laffont-Tirole(1986), Piscard(1987)) that integrate both
moral hazard and adverse selection problems into a single model where all the parties of contracts are risk-
neutral. But they do not explain the insurance arrangements for risk-averse parties.

6
  This result can be contrasted with the previous arguments (Stewart(1994)) that adverse selection and moral
hazard may partially offset the welfare loss associated with each other.
                                                                                                                  3
well as in accident probability) or when the provision of insurance is non-exclusive (i.e.
individuals can purchase insurance from more than one firm). Furthermore, while with pure
adverse selection, UO always entails pooling with complete insurance (in the standard model),
with adverse selection and moral hazard, all PO allocations may entail separation and the UO
may entail incomplete insurance.         Also we show that there exists a “hybrid” way of
providing insurance combining both the government and the market that can achieve a Pareto
optimal allocation under the double informational asymmetry, supporting a fashionable
approach that is currently adopted by health and retirement insurance systems in the US
(though our results imply further that a tax needs to be imposed upon the market provision.)

   This paper is organized as follows: Based upon a model presented in Section 2, we
characterize the optimal allocations under single and double informational asymmetries in
Section 3 and Section 4, respectively. In Section 5, we also characterize the equilibrium
allocations under the double informational asymmetry and compare the results to those under
the single asymmetry; in particular, we analyze conditions for the existence of equilibrium
and explore the possibility of a pooling equilibrium. The role of the market or the
government in implementing an optimal allocation is discussed in Section 6, followed by
concluding remarks in Section 7.


2. Model

    Consider an individual who is faced with the risk of an accident with some probability,
Pi (e), which depends upon the type i of the individual and the level e of care he takes. It is
assumed for simplicity that there are two possible levels of care that an individual can take,
e = 0 (shirking) or e = e̅ (non-shirking), and that there are two types of individuals – high
risk (H-type) and low-risk (L-type) individuals-- who differ from each other only in the
probability of accident for a given level of care. The type is privately known to the individual,
while the portion    of H-type is common knowledge.

          Letting Pi (e = e̅) = Pi ,                Pi (e = 0) = PiS

for i=H,L, we assume that PH > PL , PiS > Pi (i = H, L). ∆Pi ≡ PiS − Pi ,, measures the
sensitivity of the accident probability to the care level an individual of i-type chooses. This
can vary depending upon the type, i.e., it could be the case that either ∆PL ≥ ∆PH or that
∆PL < ∆PH . The former (latter) case can be interpreted as one in which effort and type
are complements (substitutes) to each other in the determination of the accident probability.
That is, when they are complements, being a “good” type not only lowers the accident
probability, it also increases the reduction in accident probabilities from greater effort.
   The expected utility of an i-type individual (i=H,L) with wealth w, who purchases the
amount αi of insurance by paying premium βi and takes the care level e, is7

    Vi (αi , βi ) = Maxe Pi (e)U(w − d + αi ) + (1 − Pi (e))U(w − βi ) − e,                         (1)

7
  In this formulation, we assume the two types of individuals have the same utility of consumption in each state
of nature. It is easy to generalize our results to the case where their utility of consumption differs. Similarly,
the cost of effort devoted to accident avoidance can differ. The assumptions of separability and linearity are
also made for convenience.
                                                                                                                 4
where d is the amount of loss in the event of an accident.
  The No-shirking (NS) constraints: ei (αi , βi ) is determined as follows: The individual
chooses to shirk (or not to shirk) when

    ∆Pi {U(w − βi ) − U(w − d + αi )} ≤ (or >)e̅,                             (2)

which can be rewritten as

                                           e̅
    βi ≤ (or >) fi (αi ) ≡ w − U −1 {∆P + U(w − d + αi )} , i = H, L                       (2’)
                                                i


where fi′ < 0. We call condition (2) for i-type the no-shirking constraint for i-type, denoted
by NS(i) constraint; the locus βi = fi (αi ) is called the NS(i) locus, and is negatively sloped:
(2) implies that if individuals are to take care, there must be less-than-full insurance, that is,
βi < 𝑑 − αi , i.e., αi + βi < 𝑑 .
   Diagrammatically, we can see what is entailed in Figure 1. For a fixed effort level, an
individual indifference curve in the {α, β} space is upward sloping and concave, as depicted
                                                        dβ    P U′ (w−d+α)
in Figure 1. The slope of the indifference curve is        = 1−P              . Higher benefits and
                                                        dα         U′ (w−β)
lower premia increase utility, so a movement down and to the right increases expected utility.
Indifference curves with shirking (no effort) are steeper in general than those without. The
overall indifference curve, with e endogenous, would then be scalloped shaped. An
interesting point is that the indifference curves for the two types may cross each other more
than once (multi-crossing property); even though at any given level of care, the high risk
individual’s indifference curve is steeper than the low risk individual’s, there may be some
levels of insurance such that the low risk individual shirks and the high risk individual does
not, and it can be the case that PLS > PH. This can be contrasted with the single-crossing
property that has been typically assumed in the literature, and arises naturally in simple
specifications where there is only adverse selection.
   We can easily identify necessary conditions for multiple crossing: the no-shirking locus
of the L type must lie below that of the H-type, which from (2) means that ∆PL < ∆PH . We
require, in addition, that PLS > PH, which can be written as

           ∆PL ≡ PLS − PL > PH − PL ≡ T.

In short, multiple crossing requires

            ∆PH > ∆PL > 𝑇,

i.e., type and effort are substitutes to each other and, in some sense, individual heterogeneity
is less important than effort in determining the accident probability of an individual. 8 This
case is illustrated by Figure 2. In Figure 2 the NS constraints divide the (α, β) space into
three regions, that where neither shirks, that where both shirk, and the intermediate region,
where the low risk individual shirks and the high risk does not. The low risk individual’s
indifference curves are flatter than the high risk individual’s in the first and third region, but


8
    This would be the case when T < Min {∆PL , ∆PH }.
                                                                                                  5
they are steeper in the second region.
  The profit for an insurance contract (α, β) purchased by an i-type individual, πi (α, β), is

 πi (α, β) = (1 − Pi (ei (α, β)))β − Pi (ei (α, β))α,      i= H, L

The profit for a contract depends upon the choice of care level by an individual. The care
level switches at the NS locus; hence, taking e as endogenous, the zero profit line for a
particular type of individual appears as in Figure 1.
   The self-selection (SS) constraints. We focus on situations where the insurance provider(s)
know that there are two types of individuals, but cannot ascertain who is of which type.
Earlier literature (Stiglitz [1975], Rothschild-Stiglitz (1976)] identified two possible kinds of
allocations: a pooling allocation, in which the two types buy the same insurance contract,
and a separating allocation, in which they buy different contracts. In a separating allocation,
the contracts {(αH , βH ), (αL , βL )} offered the two groups have to satisfy the SS constraints
for each i, denoted by SS(i) constraints:

   Vi (αi , βi ) ≥ Vi (αj , βj ),            i, j= H, L,                       (3)

 Type i (weakly) prefers its contract to the other contract.
   We employ two different optimality concepts: Pareto Optimality (PO) and Utilitarian
Optimality (UO). A set of contracts is PO if together they yield non-negative profits and there
does not exist any other set of contracts which yields non-negative profits and which makes
at least some individuals better off without making others worse off. A set of contracts is
UO if it yields non-negative profits and it maximizes utilitarian social welfare, V, where

  V = θVH + (1 − θ)VL .

   Note that a contract is PO if it is UO, while it is not necessarily UO if it is PO.
   An equilibrium or an RS equilibrium, as defined by Rothschild-Stiglitz (1976), is defined
as a set of contracts that yields zero profit such that there does not exist any other contract
which yields positive profits by attracting some individuals.
   Before analyzing optimal allocations and market equilibrium under the double
informational asymmetry (DIA) (with both moral hazard and adverse selection), we will first
outline the results under a single informational asymmetry (SIA), where there is either only
adverse selection or only moral hazard.


3. Optimality Under Single Informational Asymmetry (SIA)

3-1. Optimality under Pure Adverse Selection (PAS)
    Suppose that an individual has no choice of effort. For simplicity, we assume the
accident probabilities are those associated with the non-shirking care level. The PO set of
contracts {(αH , βH ), (αL , βL )} must solve the following problem:

   Max VL (αL , βL )                                                                   (4)
      s.t.
             VH (αH , βH ) ≥ VH (αL , βL )
             VL (αL , βL ) ≥ VL (αH , βH )
                                                                                                 6
              θπH (αH , βH ) + (1 − θ)πL (αL , βL ) ≥ 0
              VH (αH , βH ) ≥ K

where πi (αi , βi ) = (1 − Pi )βi − Pi αi (i=H,L), i.e. it must maximize the utility of L-type,
subject to SS constraints, the non-negative profit constraint, and to H-type attaining at least a
given level of utility, K. We denote by (α∗H , β∗H ) and (α∗L , β∗L ) the full-insurance contract
for H-type and the incomplete-insurance contract for L-type, respectively, such that each
contract yields the zero profit, i.e., πi (α∗i , β∗i ) = (1 − Pi )β∗i − Pi α∗i = 0 for i =H,L, and that
the two contracts strictly satisfy the SSH constraint. {(α∗H , β∗H ), (α∗L , β∗L )} is the Rothschild-
Stiglitz equilibrium, when it exists, but as we shall shortly show, this allocation may not be
PO. Theorem 1 characterizes the PO and UO allocation under pure adverse selection (PAS)
(the proof is relegated to the Appendix.):

Theorem 1. (Optimality under Pure Adverse Selection (PAS))

    (i) There always exists a PO separating contract entailing some subsidy between H and
L types of individuals.
  (ii) There exists θ1 (> 0) such that for θ < θ1 , all PO contracts entail some subsidy
between H and L types of individuals.
  (iii) Any PO separating contract entails full-insurance from the H-type and incomplete
insurance for the L-type
                                             ̃, β̃) achieves the UO outcome, where
   (iv) The full insurance pooling contract (α
              ̅
              P
         β̃ =    ̅
                  ̃ and P
                  α      ̅ ≡ θPH + (1 − θ)PL.
               1−P



   Only the first part of Theorem 1 may not be familiar. To see this result, we examine the
utility frontier, represented by V(vH ), which shows the maximum amount of utility that can
be attained by L type for any given level of utility attained by H-type.9 We do this by
parametrically considering a subsidy from L-type to H-type. The zero subsidy point is the
R-S separating allocation (that is, the competitive equilibrium if it exists).
   Theorem 1 (iv) suggests that the utilitarian optimum is achieved through the maximum
subsidy that can be transferred to H-type from L-type given the zero-profit and self-selection
constraints. Theorem 1 (i) and (iv) imply that while the UO is PO, it is not Pareto-superior to
other allocations (even for a small θ).
   Letting VH∗ ≡ VH (α∗H , β∗H ) and VL∗ ≡ VL (α∗L , β∗L ) , we can establish that for θ < θ1 ,
 ∂V
     > 0 at vH = VH∗ , i.e., by the L-type transferring money to the H type, the loosening of
∂v  H
the self-selection constraint dominates the loss of welfare that arises from the income transfer.
The implication of Theorem 1 (ii) is that the separating contract involving no subsidy is not
necessarily PO. Indeed, it will be shown later in this paper that {(α∗H , β∗H ), (α∗L , β∗L )} is an R-S
equilibrium (in the sense of Rothschild-Stiglitz) if and only if θ ≥ θ1. This result provides a
necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an RS equilibrium and provides new
insights into the Rothschild-Stiglitz equilibrium theorem:



9
  It is natural that we focus on the utility curve, because it provides the complete characterization of the set of
Pareto optimal allocations.
                                                                                                                      7
{(𝛼𝐻∗ , 𝛽𝐻∗ ), (𝛼𝐿∗ , 𝛽𝐿∗ )} is the competitive equilibrium if and only if it is PO.

  Figure 3 provides an intuitive explanation for Theorem 1. Figure 3 shows a variant of the
familiar adverse selection model, with the zero profit locus for the L and H type labeled in the
obvious way. As we increase αH from αH          ∗
                                                   along the full-insurance line 10 , i.e., as we
increase the subsidy from L-type to H-type, the amount αL of insurance for L-type will
increase. There are two conflicting factors that affect the utility VL of L-type in response to
the change in αH : the self selection constraint becomes less binding as the utility of H-type
increases, but the profit constraint becomes more binding. The former effect is illustrated by
the shift of VH to VH ′ in Figure 3, while the latter effect is shown by the shift of the zero-
profit line for L (indicated by upward arrow) in Figure 3. The result (α′L , β′L ) may imply
that the utility of L-type could increase as in Figure 3.
   Whether or not the utility of L-type increases in αH depends upon the distribution of types.
If θ is high, then the profit effect dominates, and as we increase the expected utility of H-
type, that of L-type decreases. Eventually, as we transfer more money from L to H-type, we
reach the pooling contract (α  ̃, β̃) as shown in Figure 3. It is not feasible to increase the well
being of H-type beyond that point. When, on the other hand, θ is negligible, the effect on
the profit constraint is negligible, and hence as we increase the subsidy to H-type, we relax
the self selection constraint, and, at least initially, the well being of L-type as well.
Eventually, however, it decreases, as the contract for L-type approaches the full-insurance
one. It pays the low risk individuals to subsidize the high risk individuals, so long as the
marginal benefit in increased insurance consistent with separating exceeds the marginal cost
of the subsidy. If there are essentially no high risk indivdiuals, the marginal cost is negligible.
Such allocations cannot, of course, be sustained within a standard competitive Rothschild-
Stiglitz equilibrium.


3-2. Optimality and equilibrium under Pure Moral Hazard (PMH) alone

   Figure 4 depicts the pure moral hazard (PMH) case. The critical curve is the zero profit
                                         P
locus, which is the line OB (with slope 1−P) below the NS locus, and the line OA with slope
 PS
      above the NS locus. Assume now we have only one type (say type L), but subject to the
1−PS
NS constraint. UO and PO then coincide: we simply maximize the well-being of the
representative agent subject to the zero profit locus. There are two possibilities, illustrated
in Figure 4. The first is that the optimum occurs with shirking (‘A’ in Figure 4); the second,
at the no-shirking constraint (‘B’ in Figure 4). Either can occur; it simply depends upon the
shape of the indifference curve. Note that in the second case individuals would like to get
more insurance—they are not fully insured; but they cannot commit themselves not to shirk.
And if they are given any more insurance they will. It is easy to show that the market
equilibrium coincides with the UO and PO.11
   We will consider one of the following two assumptions for each type.



10
  There is full insurance if d – β = α. Hence the line marked α + β = d is the full insurance line.

  See Arnott and Stiglitz [1991]. But note that this result is in part an artifact of the fact that there is only one
good. See Greenwald and Stiglitz [1986].
                                                                                                                    8
   A1: For any (α′i , β′i ) and (αi , βi ) such that βi = fi (αi ), β′i = d − αi ′ and Vi (αi , βi ) =
Vi (αi ′, βi ′) , it is the case that πi (αi , βi ) > πi (αi ′, βi ′) (alternatively, if πi (αi , βi ) =
πi (αi ′, βi ′)), then Vi (αi , βi ) > Vi (αi ′, βi ′)).

   A2: For any (α′i , β′i ) and (αi , βi ) such that βi = fi (αi ), β′i = d − αi ′ and Vi (αi , βi ) =
Vi (αi ′, βi ′) , it is the case that πi (αi , βi ) < πi (αi ′, βi ′) (alternatively, if πi (αi , βi ) =
πi (αi ′, βi ′)), Vi (αi , βi ) < (αi ′, βi ′)).

   What the assumption A1 (or A2) says is that a contract offering an individual the maximum
amount of insurance without inducing him to shirk (or a contract inducing shirking)
dominates a full-insurance contract inducing shirking that offers the same level of utility.
Under assumption A1 (or A2), the optimal insurance contract under PMH coincides with the
one that strictly satisfies the NS condition (or with the one offering full insurance).12 The
indifference curve shown in Figure 4 satisfies the assumption A1. If A1 holds for a
particular type of individual, a PO contract for that type will be constrained by the NS
condition. (Similarly, if A2 holds for a type, then a PO contract for that type will not be
constrained by the NS condition.)
   Let us define a contract (αoi , βoi ) for i-type (i=H,L), such that it yields zero profit for the
type, i.e., πi (αoi , βoi ) = (1 − Pi )βoi − Pi αoi = 0 , and it satisfies either βoi = fi (αoi ) or
βoi = d − αoi . We can then state the following Theorem.

Theorem 2 (Optimality and Equilibrium under PMH)
  A PO and equilibrium set of contracts is {(αoL , βoL ), (αoH , βoH )}, where βoi = fi (αoi ) or
βi = d − αoi under A1 or A2, respectively.
 o




   Note that the contract (αoi , βoi ) is uniquely determined by the parameters Pi and ∆Pi.
   For most of the analysis in this paper we will focus upon the case when A1 holds for each
type. Although the assumption A2 implies that the NS constraint is not binding, however, it
could affect a PO allocation when adverse selection is also present. We will not thus ignore
the possibility that A2 holds for one or the two types. That is, we will mention, whenever
relevant, how the results could change as A2 (rather than A1) holds. As we shall show, it
may be optimal for one of the two groups to shirk. Shirking itself is not necessarily
evidence of a poorly designed incentive scheme.


4. Optimality under the Double Informational Asymmetry (DIA)

   The analysis of optimality with both moral hazard and self-selection (DIA) involves
considering the consequences of having both NS and SS constraints. The heart of the
analysis entails a detailed examination of the interaction between these constraints, which
turns out to be a matter of considerable complexity. The introduction of moral hazard
imposes additional restrictions upon the set of PO contracts for both H and L-types through


12
   The assumption A1 implies that the probability PiS of accident in the event of shirking is higher than Pi by
more than a certain level. The assumption A2 will hold, on the other hand, if effort had little effect on accident
probabilities and/or the indifference curve above the non-shirking constraint were initially very steep.
                                                                                                                     9
the NS constraints, and these additional restrictions bring about important differences
between the optimal allocation under DIA and that under PAS or that under PMH.
   The characterization of PO under DIA is further complicated by the possibility of multi-
crossing preferences, which arises naturally when fH (α) > fL (α) . In analyzing the
optimality under DIA we will first confine ourselves to the case of single-crossing preference
before turning to the case of multi-crossing preference.


4-1. Single-crossing Preference

  In characterizing the optimal allocations under DIA, we will first prove the following
proposition which provides necessary conditions that must be satisfied if a contract is to be
PO in the case of single-crossing preferences.

Proposition 1
   Suppose that the single-crossing property is not violated, and suppose that A1 holds for
both of the two types. Then, a contract (αH , βH ) of for H-type can be PO only if the
following conditions hold: βH = fH (αH ) when ∆PL < ∆PH , and αH + βH = d or
βH = fH (αH ) when ∆PL ≥ ∆PH. A contract (αL , βL ) for L-type is PO only if βL ≤ fL (αL ).


   The proof can be found in the Appendix. (Similar conditions for the optimality under
multi-crossing preferences will be presented later.) Proposition 1 shows that a PO contract
with single-crossing preferences should satisfy the following conditions: a PO contract for H-
type may entail full-insurance even when A1 holds under certain conditions, while that for L-
type should satisfy its NS constraint. We can use this result to characterize PO allocations, as
it allows us to narrow down the relevant set of constraints, dividing the analysis of the
optimality into two cases, that where the H-type’s NS constraint is strictly satisfied, and that
where the H-type gets full insurance.
     Let us consider the following problem to examine the optimal allocation in the case when
A1 holds for both of the two types :

Max VL (αL , βL ) = PL U(w − d + αL ) + (1 − PL )U(w − βL )                             (5)

     s.t.

  VH (αH , βH ) ≥ VH (αL , βL )                               (SSH) (5A)
  VL (αH , βH ) ≤ VL (α𝐿 , βL )                              (SSL) (5B)
  βL ≤ fL (αL )                                                   (NSL) (5C)
  θ {(1 − PH (αH , βH )) βH − PH (αH , βH )αH } + (1 − θ){(1 − PL )βL − PL αL } = 0 (5D)
                                                      (Zero Profit Constraint)

where βH = fH (αH ) or d − αH , and Vi (αH , βH ) is the (expected) utility of i-type choosing
(αH , βH ).
  In the discussion below, we refer to SSH and SSL as the self-selection constraint for the
high and low risk type of individuals, respectively (5B and 5C). Similarly, we refer to the no

                                                                                              10
shirking constraint for the high and low risk individuals as NSH and NSL. In characterizing
the solutions to (5), we will adopt the following strategy of analysis: we will first use the zero
profit constraint 5(D) and the condition that βH = fH (αH ) or that βH = d − αH to represent
βL and βH as functions of (αL , αH ), and to rewrite VL and all the other constraints (i.e., SS
constraints for H and L and NS constraint for L) in terms of (αL , αH ). The solution to the
problem (5) will then be αL (αH ) as a function of αH , which will enable us to see how the
optimal αL , or the optimal VL , will vary with αH (indicating the amount of subsidy from L-
type to H-type).
   Let us first rewrite βL as a function of αL and αH as follows:

                              P          θ    1
             B(αL , αH ) ≡ 1−PL αL + 1−θ 1−P (PH αH − (1 − PH )fH (αH ))                        (6)
                                  L                L


or

                              P ′         θ        1
            BB(αL , αH ) ≡ 1−PL αL + 1−θ 1−P (PHS αH − (1 − PHS )(d − αH )),                          (6’)
                                  L′                   L′


where PL ′ could be either PL or PLS depending upon (αL , βL ). Note that, so long as L-
type subsidizes H-type, (1 − PL )βL > PL αL and PH αH > (1 − PH ) fH (αH ) (or PHS αH >
(1 − PHS )(d − αH )).
  Substituting (6) or (6’) and βH = fH (αH ) or βH = d − αH into (5A), (5B) and (5C), we
have

     VH (αH , fH (αH )) ≥ VH (αL , B(αL , αH ))                                       (SSH) (7A)
     VL (αH , fH (αH )) ≤ VL (α𝐿 , B(αL , αH )))                                      (SSL) (7B)
     B(αL , αH ) ≤ fL (αL )                                                            (NSL) (7C)

or

     VH (αH , d − αH ) ≥ VH (αL , BB(αL , αH ))                                        (SSH) (7A’)
     VL (αH , d − αH ) ≤≤ VL (α𝐿 , BB(αL , αH )))                                      (SSL) (7B’)
     BB(αL , αH ) ≤ fL (αL )                                                           (NSL) (7C’),

respectively.
   Solving for αL as a function of αH in (7A) or (7B) or (7C) ((7A’) or (7B’) or (7C’)) with
the inequality being replaced by equality, we will denote the solution for (7A) or (7B) or (7C)
((7A’) or (7B’) or (7C’)) by M H(αH ) or M L(αH ) or M L(αH ) ( M H(αH ) or
 M L(αH ) or sM L(αH )), respectively, with each representing the following: M H(αH )
(or M H(αH )) is a maximum value of αL (for a given αH ) that satisfies SSH when
βH = fH (αH ) (or when βH = d − αH ); M L(αH ) (or M L(αH )) is a minimum level of
αL (for a given αH ) that satisfies the SSL when βH = fH (αH ) (or when βH = d − αH );
while M L(αH ) is a maximum level of αL (for a given αH ) that satisfies NSL when
βH = fH (αH ) (or when βH = d − αH ).13


13
   The mneumonic for remembering these constraints is MX is the maximium value of         αL consistent with a
set of constraints, MN the minimum; SH and SL denote the self-selection constaint for the high and low types
                                                                                                             11
       Taking these into consideration, we can rewrite the maximization problem (5) as follows:

 MaxαL VL (αL , B(αL , αH )) = {PL U(w − d + αL ) + (1 − PL )U(w − B(αL , αH )}                     (8)

       (or   VL (αL , BB(αL , αH )) = {PL U(w − d + αL ) + (1 − PL )U(w − BB(αL , αH )})

s.t.

       αL ≤ MXSH(αH )(or sMXSH(αH ))                      (8A) (or (8A’))
       αL ≥ MNSL(αH )(or sMNSL(αH ))                        (8B) (or (8B’))
       αL ≤ MXNL(αH )(or sMXNL(αH ))                       (8C) (or (8C’))

   In characterizing the solutions to the problem (8), we will first consider several critical
contracts just as references for the analysis. Let (α̅ , β̅ ) or (α̿ , β̿ ) be a zero profit pooling
contract under no moral hazard but with the amount of insurance set by the NS constraint for
the H-type, or the one which provides full insurance and so leads to shirking for both types,
respectively. That is,

               ̅
               P                            ̅
                                            P  S
         β̅ = 1−P̅ α̅ = fH (α̅ )   or β̿ = 1−P̅S α̿ = d − α̿ ,                                   (9)

and

        MXSH(α̅ )=α̅ =MNSL(α̅ ) and            sMXSH(α̿ )=α̿ =sMNSL(α̿ ),

since it is a zero-profit pooling contracts. We can then prove the following Lemma on the
properties of the constraints:

Lemma 1
i) α̿ > α̅ > αoH .
ii) M        L′(αH ) > 𝑀𝑋𝑆𝐿′(αH ) > 1 and M            L′(αH ) < 0,
      while M L′(αH ) > 𝑠𝑀𝑋𝑆𝐻′(αH ) > 1 and M L′(αH ) < 0.
iii) MXNL(α̅ )> α̅ when ∆PL > ∆PH, and MXNL(α̅ ) < α̅ when ∆PL < ∆PH ,
     while sMXNL(α̿ ) < α̿ .


   The proof can be found in the Appendix, while the properties of the constraints are
depicted in Figure 5a and 5b. The pooling contract (α̅ , β̅ ) is shown by Lemma 1 iii) to
satisfy or fail to satisfy NSL condition when ∆PL > ∆PH or when ∆PL < ∆PH, as depicted in
Figure 5a or in Figure 5b, respectively.
   The set of (αL , αH )’s that satisfy all the constraints (8A)-(8C) or (8A’)-(8C’) is illustrated
by the shaded area in Figure 5b when ∆PL < ∆PH , while it is illustrated by the shaded area
(left one) or by the sum of the two shaded areas (depending upon parameter values as will be
discussed later) in Figure 5a when ∆PL ≥ ∆PH. In characterizing PO contracts with single-

respectively, and NL denotes the no shirking constraint of the L individuals. The pre-fix “s” is added when the
high risk individual shirks. In the absence of shirking, the no-shirking constraint for the H type is binding.
                                                                                                                  12
crossing preferences under DIA, we will first denote by αL (αH ) the maximum value of αL ’s
that satisfy all the constraints (8A)-(8C) or (8A’)-(8C’) for a given αH , and will define G
and G′ as follows:

       G = {αH | αL (αH ) ≠ ∅, βH = fH (αH )}
       G′ = {αH | αL (αH ) ≠ ∅, βH = d − αH }

Denoting the supremum of the set G (or G′) by up(𝐺) (or by up(G′ )), we can then
prove the following Lemma:

Lemma 2
i) up (G) < 𝛼̅ when ∆PL < ∆PH while up (G) = 𝛼̅ when ∆PL ≥ ∆PH .
ii) When ∆PL ≥ ∆PH , up (G′) < 𝛼̿. Also, there exists θ′ (> 0) such that for θ < 𝜃′
  up (G′) > 𝛼̅.



   The proof can be found in the Appendix. Lemma 2 suggests that a PO contract with
single-crossing preferences under DIA may involve shirking for H-type when ∆PL ≥ ∆PH
while it is never the case when ∆PL < ∆PH.
   Our analysis of characterizing PO contracts is parallel to that of Section 3.1. Note that a
bench-mark contract (αoH , βoH ) for H-type is the one that yields zero profit for H-type, i.e.,
πH (αoH , βoH ) = (1 − pH )βoH − pH αoH = 0 while satisfying βoH = fH (αoH ), i.e., a PO contract
for H-type under PMH when A1 holds. Starting from the contract (αoH , βoH ) for H-type that
involves no subsidy from L-type, we will increase αH so as to increase (or decrease) the
amount of subsidy from L-type and thereby increase utility of H-type in order to figure out
the changes in utilities for both types of individuals.
 To characterize a set of PO contracts that corresponds to the change in αH or in αL (αH ),
we need to analyze the relationship between αL and VL , which is not straightforward. As the
subsidy increases, i.e., as αH increases under the strict NS or the full-insurance condition for
H-type, there are, as in the case of PAS, two conflicting effects upon the amount of insurance
for L-type or upon their welfare: the positive effect caused by the relaxed self-selection
constraint and the negative effect caused by the more-binding profit constraint. What is
critically different in this case from the case of PAS is that the positive effect is limited by the
NS constraints. When the NS constraint is tighter for L-type than for H-type (i.e., when
∆PL < ∆PH ), the increase in the amount of insurance for L-type that results from the relaxed
SSH constraint may be limited by the NSL constraint. When H-type is faced with tighter NS
constraint than L-type (i.e., when ∆PL ≥ ∆PH), on the other hand, the amount of insurance for
L-type may be constrained by NSH constraint; under certain circumstances, interestingly, the
subsidy may involve so much insurance for the H-type that they shirk (i.e., up (G) > 𝛼̅ as
shown by the shaded area on the right hand side of Figure 5a), despite the fact that the
subsidy (satisfying the SSH constraint) entailing shirking is more costly than the subsidy that
does not entail shirking. This will be discussed in detail below.
   When αL is decreasing in αH , so is the utility VL of L-type. If αL is increasing in αH , on
the other hand, VL could be increasing or decreasing in αH , depending upon whether or not




                                                                                                 13
the effect of the relaxed SS constraint outweighs that of the more-binding profit constraint.14
Note, however, that the utilitarian social welfare is increasing in αH so long as αL is
increasing in αH .
    Taking these into account, we will characterize PO allocations with single-crossing
preferences under DIA in Case I (∆PL ≥ ∆PH) and in Case II (∆PL < ∆PH )


4-1-1. Case I : ∆PL ≥ ∆PH or fL (α) ≥ fH (α)

   When the NSH constraint has to be satisfied, we cannot increase the subsidy further
beyond that associated with the pooling allocation on the NSH locus, which is A(α              ̅, β̅) as
shown in Figure 6a. If we allow for shirking on the part of H-type, however, we may be able
to give H-type a utility higher than VH (α    ̅, β̅) ≡ v̅H . In other words, we could start to increase
αH from a contract (α         ̅
                         ̅H , βH ) on the full-insurance line such that VH (α     ̅H , β̅H ) = v̅H . (See
Figure 6b, where a contract (α     ̅H , β̅H ) is illustrated by B). The feasibility of this option
would depend upon whether or not there exists a contract for L-type that satisfies the SSL and
zero-profit constraints given (α   ̅H , β̅H ). Alternatively, in terms of Figure 5a, it will depend
upon whether or not up (G′) > 𝛼̅. As Lemma 2 ii) indicates, if θ is small so that the
required amount of subsidy that each L-type has to pay is small, the subsidy inducing H-type
to shirk would be feasible. Figure 6b shows that the subsidy is feasible as the iso-profit line Z’
for L-type yielding zero-profit given the full-insurance contract B for H-type is located lower
than C, which strictly satisfies both SSL and NSL given B for H-type.
   Furthermore, we can consider a case when a PO contract always involves shirking for H-
type. Suppose that up (G′) > 𝛼̅. As the subsidy increases from α              ̅, L-type may initially
suffer from utility loss because B will yield lower profit for H-type than A under A1. As the
subsidy continues to increase, however, the utility of L-type could increase when θ is small.
That is, this pareto-improving arrangement is feasible because the additional subsidy is
negligible when θ is small. Consider the case where there are a negligible number of high
types. Then the cost of subsidization is negligible. As we increase insurance for H-type
from B to E as in Figure 6c, the corresponding additional cost of subsidization is so small (as
is indicated by the line Z” in Figure 6c) that the resulting utility for L-type may increase
(from 𝑉̅𝐿 to 𝑉̂𝐿 in Figure 6c). Ultimately, we only want to weaken the SSH constraint to the
point where it does not violate the SSL constraint, i.e. it must be on the optimal PMH contract
for the L type. The resulting utility possibility curve (for small θ) is depicted as in Figure 7,
which suggests that any contract involve non-shirking for H-type is not PO.
    More formally we can establish the following Theorem on PO in Case I:

Theorem 3 (PO in Case I)
   Suppose that A1 holds for each type. Then, the followings are true:
1) There exists θ̅(>0) such that for θ > θ̅, the followings are true: i) a PO does not entail
shirking; ii) a pooling contract on the NSH locus achieves the UO outcome.
2) There exists θ̂ (∈ (0, θ̅)) such that for θ < θ̂, all the PO allocations are separating ones


14
   Obviously, the more insurance that the L type receives, the better off he is, but going on in the background—
to satisfy the zero profit locus—there are changes to the premium he has to pay, and the premium reflects not
just the cost of his own insurance, but the subsidy he is providing to the H-type.
                                                                                                              14
and entail shirking by H-type.


   The proof can be found in the Appendix. So long as A1 holds for H-type, a PO contract for
H strictly satisfies NSH constraint (even when NSH is more stringent than NSL) unless θ is
low. These suggest that when θ is high, a pooling contract with incomplete insurance is PO
and thus UO. This contrasts with the situation where there is no moral hazard, where UO
entails pooling, but full insurance. Recall that under PAS, any pooling allocation with less
than full insurance could be improved upon with a set of separating contrasts. Now, the NS
constraint keeps any other contract offering more insurance to H-type from being Pareto-
superior to the original pooling one.15
   Theorem 3 also demonstrates that a PO allocation should entail shirking on the part of H-
type when the portion of H-type is small. Note that, for a small θ, any separating contract
entailing no shirking will be Pareto-dominated by a pooling contract A in Figure 6a, which is
in turn, as shown by Figure 6c, Pareto-dominated by a separating contract (F, E) that entails
shirking for H-type. The amount of insurance for L-type, which would be severely limited by
the stringent NSH constraint, can be considerably increased by allowing H-type to shirk,
making both types better off when the portion of H-type is small. Note that in a PMH
model without AS there cannot exist shirking in the optimal outcome,16and in the PAS model
the H-type always gets full insurance. Under DIA, however, the SS constraints interact with
NS constraints so that a PO outcome may entail efficiency loss even for H-type relative to the
one (αoH , βoH ) that is optimal under PMH under A1. In other words, when the optimal
contract for H-type under PMH entails non-shirking under A1, the presence of adverse
selection as well as moral hazard may induce H-type to shirk.


4-1-2. Case II: :∆PL < ∆PH or fL (α) < fH (α)
    The problem for a PO contract in Case II (with single-crossing preferences) will be the
 same as (5) when βH = fH (αH ). Figures 5b shows that as the subsidy or αH increases,
 αL (αH ) increases initially (as the SSH constraint is binding) until αH reaches a certain
 point at which the NSL constraint becomes binding; αL (αH ) decreases thereafter (as the
 NSL constraint continues to be binding) until αH reaches a point where the SSL constraint
 has to be binding. Further increases in αH satisfying the constraints are not possible. We
 can then establish the following theorem on the optimality in Case II.

Theorem 4 (Optimality in Case II with single-crossing preferences)
 A pooling contract is not PO. Under A1, a PO contract strictly satisfies NSH constraint
and it does not entail shirking for any type.


     The result is driven by the restriction upon the amount of insurance for L-type that is

15
   The optimality of a pooling contract under the double informational asymmetry is also shown by Whinston
(1983), who analyzed the optimal provision of retirement insurance under the double informational asymmetry
in a special case when ∆PH = ∆PL , while confining his analysis to the contracts that do not allow individuals to
shirk.
16
   In particular, when a full-insurance contract is just barely dominated by a contract at the non-shirking
constraint, the UO allocation is supported by a separating contract involving a full-insurance contract for H-type
for almost every θ.
                                                                                                               15
imposed by their NS constraint. As a consequence,. The benefit of the subsidy from L-type to
H-type from the relaxation of SSH constraint is limited by the relatively severe NSL
constraint. In particular, the L-type individuals would not be able to avail themselves of the
maximum amount of insurance consistent with the SS constraints (which is the amount of
insurance offered by a pooling contract), because of the NSL constraint. This is shown by
Figure 5b where up (G) < 𝛼̅, and this is why a pooling contract is never PO.17 The result
on the non-optimality of a pooling contract in this case can be compared to the case of PAS,
in which the utilitarian optimum always requires pooling at full insurance.18 Note also that,
so long as A1 holds for each type, it would not pay H-type to shirk in this case as the amount
of insurance for L-type is not further constrained by the NSH constraint as in Case I. In Case
II with single-crossing preferences, therefore, the introduction of moral hazard would not
affect the efficiency of a PO allocation under adverse selection: a PO contract for H-type
under DIA can preserve its efficiency relative to PMH. .


4-2. Multiple-Crossing Preferences
    The single-crossing property of preferences may be violated in Case II when fH (α) >
fL (α). In this case the SS constraint is in a sense tighter than it would be the case under the
single-crossing preferences, so that the chance for the optimality of a pooling contract may
increase.19 The tighter SS constraint also keeps a PO contract from being on the NS locus,
which may lead to a PO contract that entails shirking even when A1 holds for each type. In
figuring out these properties of a PO allocation we will assume in this analysis that A1 holds
for both types.
     This paper does not provide a complete characterization of the set of PO contracts
under multi-crossing preferences, but rather highlights an important feature of a PO contract
with multi-crossing preferences that can be compared to those under single-crossing
preferences: a PO contract under DIA may entail efficiency loss for one or both types relative
to PMH. For our purposes, it suffices to confine our analysis to a set of separating PO
allocations that yield zero profit for each type as well as to pooling PO allocations.20 21
     In examining PO’s of these types we will divide (α, β) space into the four different
regions R(l,h) (l=L,0, h=H,0), where l-type and h-type shirk: R(0,0) or R(L,H) is a region

17
    Alternatively: We know from proposition 1 that if there is a pooling equilibrium, it must be at the intersection
of the zero profit-pooling line and the NS(L) constraint (point C in figure 6-1). But a separating set of
contracts entailing {C, X), where X* is any point along H-indifference curve through C above C entails a lower
subsidy, and therefore there can exist a set of contracts that Pareto-dominates a pooling contract C.
18
     Remember that a PO is not PO for small θ in Case I, as is shown in Theorem 3.
19
   The way to think about this is the following: if the H type are very risk averse, then the self-selection
constraint is not very binding, since even mild reductions in insurance are viewed as very costly. But with the
single crossing property violated, the H-type’s indifference curve may be even flatter than the L-types.
20
   Note that neither a separating contract yielding zero profit for each type nor a pooling contract may be PO.
We just concentrate in this paper, however, on the cases when at least one of the above contracts is PO, in order
to show that a PO may have the peculiar property mentioned above under multi-crossing preferences.
21
    Under pure adverse selection there is a possibility that a separating contract yielding positive profits is an RS
equilibrium in the presence of multi-crossing preferences (caused by difference in risk aversion, for example) as
there may not exist a contract that can profitably attract low-risk type only given the putative equilibrium
contracts. Under moral hazard as well as adverse selection, however, a separating contract yielding positive
profits cannot be sustained as an equilibrium, because we can always think of a contract that can profitably
attract non-shirking H-type, given the putative equilibrium contracts which should entail shirking for H-type.
                                                                                                                  16
where no type shirks or a region where both types shirk, respectively, whereas R(L,0) or
R(0,H) is a region where only L-type shirks or a region where only H-type shirks,
respectively. We can then first consider the four different regional PO’s, denoted by PO-
R(l,h), each of which is PO within a region R(l,h). After figuring out a regional PO contract
PO-R(l,h), we will compare each regional PO contract PO-R(l,h) with the others to determine
a global PO contract, which is denoted by PO-G.
   In particular, let k be the type H or L of an individual whose accident probability is higher
than that of the other type under a contract PO-R(l,h). For example, k = L for a contract
PO-R(L,0) while k = H for the other regional PO contracts. Also, let us first denote by S(l,h)
a set {(αL , βL ), (αH , βH )} of separating contracts that satisfies strictly both SSL and SSH:

     Vi (αL , βL ) = Vi (αH , βH )        for i = H, L

We can then prove the following Lemma on the properties of S(l,h)(≡ {(αL , βL ), (αH , βH )}).

Lemma 3
i) There exists no S(l,H) that is PO-R(l,H) (for l=L,0).
                𝜕π (α ,β )                                  𝜕πL (αL ,βL )
ii) For S(0,0), H𝜕αH H |              < 0; for S(L,0),          𝜕αH
                                                                        |                    <0
                        L     πL (αL ,βL )=0                                πH (αH ,βH )=0
iii) There always exists S(0,0) (≡ {(αL , βL ), (αH , βH )} ) such that πH (α𝐻 , βH ) > 0 and
πL (αL , βL ) = 0.


  The proof can be found in the Appendix. Now we can then establish the necessary
conditions for a regional PO to satisfy as follows:

Proposition 2
  Suppose that preferences exhibit multi-crossing property and that A1 holds for both types.
A necessary condition for PO-R(l,h) is as follows:

(1) A set {(αL , βL ), (αH , βH )} of separating contracts yielding zero profit for each type is PO-
R(l,h) only if it is S(l,h) when it exists, or, otherwise,
    Vk (αk , βk ) = Vk (αk′ , βk′ ) & βk = 𝑑 − αk or βk = fk (αk ) where k, k ′ = L, H
Also, there always exists a set of separating contracts that yields zero profit for each type and
satisfies the necessary condition (1).

(2) A pooling contract (α, β) is PO-R(l,h) only if (a) α + β = 𝑑 or (b) if β = fi (α)             for
      i= L,H.


   The proof can be found in the Appendix. Proposition 2 presents necessary conditions for an
allocation to be PO-R(i,j) under multi-crossing preferences and shows that a separating
contract satisfying (1) exists. As shown by (A,B), (C,D), (E,F) in Figure 9a, a separating PO-
R(l,h) involving no subsidy should strictly satisfy both of the SS constraints whenever
possible. A pooling PO-R(l,h) contract has to be either on the NS locus of one type or on the
full-insurance line because, otherwise, a pareto-improving arrangement will be made possible.
Take, for example, a pooling contract Z’ as in Figure 9b. We can offer H-type more insurance
along his indifference curve, satisfying SSH constraint and making higher profits for H-type

                                                                                                        17
while maintaining the same level of utility for each type.
  Now let us turn to a global PO contract, PO-G. Concentrating ourselves on the set of
separating PO-G contracts, we can establish the following Proposition:

Proposition 3
   A separating PO-G that yields zero profit for each type is unique if it exists.


   The proof can be found in the Appendix. Proposition 3 can be used to characterize an
RS equilibrium under the double informational asymmetry (DIA), as will be shown in the
next section.
   Which of these PO-R(l,h)'s is PO-G would depend upon various factors, including (a) the
curvature of the indifference curve (the degree of risk aversion); (b) the position of the H-
non-shirking constraint (the “tighter” it is, the greater the benefit from allowing H-type to
shirk; (c) the change in accident probability from crossing the NS locus (which is one of the
factors determining the tightness of the NS constraint, i.e. when Δ p is small, then the NS
constraint is tight, but the cost of shirking is low).
   The fact that one of the four PO-R(l,h)'s is PO-G suggests that a PO contract under multi-
crossing preferences has some features different from those under single-crossing preferences.
First, it may strictly satisfy both of the SS constraints, in which case no PO contract is on the
NS or full-insurance locus. Second, more importantly, a separating PO contract may
involve inefficiency compared to the case of single-crossing preferences. It may entail
shirking for one or both types of individuals (even under A1) or insufficient amount of
insurance (relative to NS constraint) even if it does not entail shirking. Also, a pooling
contract either involves full insurance or strictly satisfies one of the two NS constraints, so
that the allocation may involve shirking for one or both of the two types even under A1. A
pooling contract Z in Figure 9b, for example, could be PO-G, while it induces both types to
shirk.
   A candidate for a separating PO-G contract, however, may be dominated by a pooling
contract, depending upon distributions of types. Unless contracts both for H and for L-type
strictly satisfy their respective NS constraints, a separating contract involving no cross-
subsidy may be pareto-dominated by a pooling contract that is on NSH or NSL locus when
θ ≈ 1 or θ ≈ 0, respectively. This suggests that, as is shown in Figure 9a, a separating
contract could be dominated by a pooling contract X or Y in Figure 9a when θ ≈ 0 or when
θ ≈ 1, respectively. This implies that in the presence of multi-crossing preferences, which is
due to the double informational asymmetry, a separating contract with no subsidy may not be
supported as a PO unless θ is in the intermediate range between 1 and 0, because it could be
not only H-type but also L-type who suffers from the efficiency loss associated with self-
selection. This will have an important consequence for the equilibrium existence, which
will be dealt with in the next section.
   Although we do not provide a complete characterization of PO with the preferences of
multi-crossing property in this paper, we can establish the following Theorem on the
optimality in Case II.

Theorem 5 (Optimality with multiple-crossing preference)
   Suppose that A1 holds for both types.
i) A PO allocation under multi-crossing preferences, which is a pooling or a separating one
that involves no subsidy, may entail shirking for one type or for both types of individuals.

                                                                                              18
Also, it may involve less-than-full insurance when entailing shirking and it may not strictly
satisfy NS constraint when entailing non-shirking.
ii) There exists θ̃(> 0) such that, for θ < θ̃, a PO allocation cannot be achieved by a
separating contract with no cross-subsidy while it can be achieved by a pooling contract that
is on the NSL locus. There also exists θ̃′(< 1) such that, for θ > θ̃′, a PO allocation may
not be achieved not by a separating contract with no cross-subsidy but by a pooling contract
that is on the NSH locus


The proof can be found in the Appendix. Theorem 5 suggests the two features of PO
allocations with multi-crossing preferences, which are not true in the case of single-crossing
preferences. First, in Case II, a PO can be achieved by a pooling contract as well in the
presence of multi-crossing preferences, which is not the case under single-crossing
preferences. Second, because of the interaction of self-selection constraint with moral
hazard constraint the distinctive features of a PO allocation (compared to the case of pure
moral hazard or of pure adverse selection) still hold – a PO allocation may involve shirking,
which would not be optimal under PMH. In particular, the presence of multi-crossing
preferences tends to reinforce this feature as a PO allocation may involve shirking even for
both types of individuals. This result comes mainly from the fact that L-type individuals may
have stronger preference for insurance than H-type in a certain region. This type of
preference on the part of L-type would lead to peculiar features of a PO contract: a contract
for H-type, as well as the one for L-type, may entail efficiency loss associated with self-
selection in the form of insufficient amount of insurance well below the level that is dictated
by NS(i) (i=H,L) or of shirking (full insurance). This suggests that a separating contract with
no cross-subsidy could be dominated by a pooling contract when θ is high as well as when
θ is low. Note, however, that, when θ ≈ 1, a separating contract may not be dominated by
any pooling contract, as is illustrated by a contract (A,Y) in Figure 9b, while, when θ ≈ 0,
any separating contract will be dominated by a pooling contract X (in Figure 9a) on the NSL
locus .


5. Equilibrium under Adverse Selection and Moral Hazard (DIA)

  In this section we analyze the existence and nature of a Nash or Rothschild-Stiglitz (RS)
equilibrium under adverse selection and moral hazard. In particular, we will first examine
how the presence of moral hazard affects the conditions for the existence of equilibrium
under adverse selection and the possibility of a pooling equilibrium.22


5-1. Existence of RS Equilibrium
    We first recall the following theorem on equilibrium existence under PAS.

Theorem 6 (Equilibrium under PAS, Rothschild-Stiglitz (1976) )


22
   Chassagnon and Chiappori (1997), who analyzed the issue of equilibrium existence under adverse selection
and moral hazard when the single-crossing property is violated, demonstrated some non-standard (compared to
Rothschild-Stiglitz) results on the equilibrium, such as multiple equilibria, existence or non-existence of
equilibrium (regardless of distribution), etc..
                                                                                                          19
  If the single crossing property holds,
i) A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an RS equilibrium is that there
exists a Pareto optimal allocation with no subsidy.
ii) There exists θ1 (>0) for any given (PL , PH ) (and utility function), where θ1 is defined
in Theorem 1, such that an RS equilibrium {(α∗L , β∗L ), (α∗H , β∗H )} does not exist under PAS for
θ < θ1 and does exist for θ≥θ1.
iii) If an equilibrium exists, it is a separating equilibrium


  The proof is easy. The pair of contracts that maximizes VL subject to the SS(i) entails a
subsidy if θ < θ1 .

Theorem 7 (Equilibrium with Adverse Selection and Moral Hazard)
i) If there exists a PO without any cross subsidization, it is an RS equilibrium
ii) A necessary condition for a pooling RS equilibrium is that there exists a pooling PO
allocation. A necessary condition for a RS pooling equilibrium is that the indifference curve
of the L-type be steeper than that of the H-type below the putative equilibrium, and this
cannot occur if the single crossing property is satisfied.
iii) A pooling allocation may be an RS equilibrium if the single crossing property is not
satisfied.


   A PO without cross subsidization must be a separating equilibrium. There is no way that
a separating equilibrium allocation for VL can be improved upon if it is a PO without cross
subsidy. If a pooling allocation is not PO, there always exists another allocation that would
make everyone better off and break even. The discussion of the (iii) of Theorem 7 is
postponed until the next subsection.
   Now we can see from Proposition 3 that pareto optimality is a necessary condition for an
allocation to be an RS equilibrium.

Proposition 4
    A set {(αL , βL ), (αH , βH )} of separating contracts is an RS equilibrium under multi-
crossing preferences if and only if it is global PO and πi (αi , βi ) = 0 for each i = H, L.


The proof can be found in the Appendix. Using Proposition 3 and 4 we can characterize the
RS equilibrium under the double informational asymmetry as follows:


Theorem 8 (Equilibrium under Moral Hazard and Adverse Selection)
   Suppose that A1 holds for both types. An RS equilibrium, if it exists, is unique. Under
single-crossing preferences, it entails incomplete insurance and non-shirking for H-type
individuals, who bear no efficiency costs compared to PMH case. This may not be true in
the case of multi-crossing preferences: an RS equilibrium may entail shirking or insufficient
amount of insurance (relative to NS constraint) for H-type as well as for L-type.


  The proof is delegated to the Appendix.         Theorem 8 suggests that, unless preferences
                                                                                                20
violate the single-crossing property, an RS equilibrium would not involve any efficiency loss
(in terms of insufficient amount of insurance or of shirking) compared to PMH or to PAS.
Under multi-crossing preferences, however, an equilibrium may entail shirking or insufficient
amount of insurance (relative to NS constraints) for one or both types of individuals. This is
because the multi-crossing property of preferences may keep a contract for a riskier
individual from being on his NS locus or on the full-insurance locus. Also, the result on the
uniqueness of an RS equilibrium can be compared to Chassagnon- Chiappori (1997), who
argued that there may exist multiple RS equilibria which are pareto-ranked to each other in
the presence of multi-crossing preferences under DIA.


Conditions for existence

   Now we will discuss how the presence of moral hazard affects the likelihood of
equilibrium non-existence under adverse selection given the assumption (A1). The NS
constraint for each type affects the equilibrium existence differently, depending upon whether
Case I or Case II holds and whether or not the preferences satisfy single-crossing property if
Case II holds. The presence of NSH constraint, resulting in incomplete insurance for H-type,
decreases the likelihood of equilibrium existence, compared to the case of PAD. This is
because the lower amount of insurance for H-type associated with the moral hazard constraint
leads to a lower amount of insurance for L-type, making a pooling contract relatively more
attractive, and hence making equilibrium existence relatively less likely. 23 Figure 10b
illustrates this point: as NSH constraint gets tighter (from 𝑓𝐻 to 𝑓𝐻 ′) the resulting utility
𝑉𝐿 for L-type becomes lower. The NSL constraint, on the other hand, may increase the
likelihood of equilibrium existence. That is, the tighter moral hazard constraint for the L-
type reduces the scope of potential deviant contracts (against {(αeL , βeL ), (αeH , βeH )}) in Case II
and thereby may increase the likelihood of equilibrium existence. Figure 10a shows that as
NHL constraint gets tighter (from 𝑓𝐿 to 𝑓𝐿 ′ ) the scope for equilibrium non-existence
becomes larger.24
    We will now analyze more specifically how the change in the NS constraint for each type
affects the equilibrium existence under adverse selection. In particular, we will see how the
threshold value of θ for the equilibrium non-existence, θ̃ , changes as ∆PL (or ∆PH )
changes. Although it is not certain in general whether or not θ̃ > θ1 (θ1 : the threshold value
of θ for the non-existence under PAS), we can establish the following results.

Theorem 9
   Suppose that A1 holds for both types.
i) There always exists θ̃(> 0) such that an RS equilibrium does not exist for θ < θ̃. And,
in Case II with single-crossing preferences, the lower threshold value θ̃ for the non-
existence of an RS equilibrium has the following property: θ̃ is increasing in ∆PL while it is
decreasing in ∆PH .
ii) In Case II with multi-crossing preferences there also exists θ̃′(< 1) as well such that an
RS equilibrium may not exist for θ > θ̃′.

23
   When the multi-crossing property holds, the stricter incentive constraint for H-type would increase the
likelihood of equilibrium existence as the amount of insurance for H-type remains the same as full-insurance.
24
   The fact that NS constraint for each type affects equilibrium existence differently has also been pointed out
by Jack(2002).
                                                                                                                   21
   The proof is delegated to the Appendix. In particular, Theorem 9 i) shows that as a PO
contract for L-type does not strictly satisfy the NS constraint under A1, there always exists a
small value of θ for which an RS equilibrium does not exist. Also, if the multi-crossing
property holds for preferences, an RS equilibrium may not exist when the portion of one type
is very high compared to the other type, because the probability of accident can be higher for
a shirking L-type than for a non-shirking H-type.25

5-2. Possibility of a Pooling Equilibrium
   Theorem 6 asserts that a pooling equilibrium never exists if the single crossing property
holds, with the indifference curve of the low risk being flatter than for the high risk. As we
noted, however, under plausible assumptions, the single crossing property may not hold in
our model. Consider the point on the pooling zero profit line where the line hits the NSH
locus. Any contract near the pooling contract below the VL indifference curve through that
point is preferred by H-types, and cannot break the pooling contract. Whether the pooling
contract is an equilibrium requires a global analysis, i.e. there must exist a point above the
zero profit locus for the L type, above the VH indifference curve through the pooling contract,
and below the VL indifference curve through the pooling contract.         It can be shown that .a
“breaking contract” must lie below the NSL locus, and the tighter that is, the less likely that is
to be.
   We will identify in this subsection some cases in which a pooling equilibrium exists, which
can arise when individuals are different in their risk-aversion as well as in their riskiness.
(Recall that so far in the analysis, we have assumed that individuals differ only in their risk
properties, not in their preferences.). Here we will consider the case when fL (𝛼) = fH (𝛼) ≡
f(𝛼), while, as will be noted below, the same underlying arguments can be applied to the
other cases when fL (𝛼) ≠ fH (𝛼). We will also focus upon the case when the assumption A1
is satisfied so that a PO contract under PMH may strictly satisfy the NS constraint. The
pooling contract that we consider as a candidate for an equilibrium is the one (α    ̅, β̅) on the
                              ̅
                              P
NS locus, i.e., β̅ = f(α
                       ̅) =      ̅, which is illustrated by A in Figure 11.
                                 α̅
                                1−P

Difference in Risk-Aversion
  Suppose that L-type individuals are more risk-averse than H-type individuals, i.e., that

   The proofs can be found in the Appendix. In the model we have analyzed, a pooling
contract cannot be supported by a Nash equilibrium, because there exists a contract that will
be purchased just by the low risk individual and does not change his behavior (i.e. satisfies
the NS constraint.)26. When we introduce heterogeneity in risk-aversion on the part of
individuals, however, the presence of moral hazard may contribute to the sustainability of a
pooling contract as an RS equilibrium.
   Figure 11 illustrates the case when a pooling contract A can be sustained as an RS
equilibrium unless θ is high. A contract B would attract H-type individuals only to make
losses, whereas a contract C would attract L-type individuals only to make losses because
they would shirk under C. Note that the contract C could yield positive profits without NS
constraints.
   There are two factors that lead a pooling equilibrium to be sustainable under the double
informational asymmetry. First, the presence of moral hazard would dictate incomplete
insurance for individuals, at which a L-type individual, who is more risk-averse than the other
type, may have a stronger demand for insurance.27 This suggests that, given a pooling
contract, any deviant contract that can attract L-type individuals needs to offer larger amounts
of insurance than that offered by the pooling contract. Second, a deviant contract offering
larger amounts of insurance is likely to induce individuals to shirk, so that it may fail to make
positive profits.
   These arguments can hold even when fL (𝛼) > fH (𝛼) or when fL (𝛼) < fH (𝛼), so long as
the marginal rate of substitution at (α ̅, β̅) is higher for L-type than for H-type and so long as

θ is low so that VL (α             ′




6. Equilibrium with Non-exclusive Provision of Insurance

    Whenever insurance is incomplete due to moral hazard, private insurance providers have
incentives to offer additional insurance, as the marginal rate of substitution of insurance is
greater than its price. As Arnott and Stiglitz [1991a,1991b] show, the nature of equilibrium
when there are multiple providers depends on whether or not an individual’s total purchase of
insurance can be observed.
   Previous discussions have focused on three cases: (a) full revelation of quantity
information; (b) no revelation and no firm knows how much it sells to any individual; (c)
each firm knows its own sales to any individual but not that of any other firm. Here, we

26
    Thus, the standard analysis for whether a contract can “break” an equilibrium is somewhat more complicated
in the case of double informational asymmetry.
27
   The stronger demand for insurance by more risk-averse individuals who also chooses greater effort in
preventing accident may imply positive relationship between insurance and riskiness (Donder-Hindriks(2009)),
which would act toward the sustainability of a pooling equilibrium.
                                                                                                            23
show that with a fourth plausible information structure it is more likely that an equilibrium
may exist. It is based on the premise that the government may be able to identify all of an
individual’s purchases of insurance, although private insurance firms on their own cannot. 28
Suppose that, when an individual purchases insurance in excess of a certain amount 𝛼 ∗ , the
government lets insurance firms know about it; and that firms in response sell any amount of
                                   ̅
                                   P
insurance at the fixed price ̅ (reflecting the market risk) so long as the individual does not
                              1−P
purchase more than 𝛼 ∗ . We will see in this section if this pricing contract with the quantity
limits can be used to sustain an equilibrium under DIA when insurance firms provide
insurances non-exclusively given the partial revelation of information by the government.
     If individuals purchase excessive insurance, they will shirk—the purchase of additional
insurance imposes a negative externality on other providers. In this case the government
may want to take some actions to discourage individuals from purchasing excessive insurance
that can induce shirking. This will induce the market to provide the efficient allocation of
insurance under moral hazard when the insurance provision is non-exclusive.
     What we will show in this section is that this type of government action designed to
secure the efficiency in the presence of non-exclusive insurance provision under moral hazard
can play an important role in determining an equilibrium under adverse selection. To see this
we will continue to assume that ΔPL = 𝛥PH ≡ ∆P, and consider an insurance contract
(𝛼 ∗ , 𝛽 ∗ ) such that

     (𝛼 ∗ , 𝛽 ∗ ) =            𝑉𝐿 (𝛼, 𝛽)                                                             (10)

                              β ≤ f(α),

i.e., that it maximizes the utility of L-type given the NS constraint and the zero profit
(associated with a pooling contract) constraint. The NS constraint may or may not be
binding for the contract (𝛼 ∗ , 𝛽 ∗ ). In the former case, we will have

                                           𝛽 ∗ = 𝑓(𝛼 ∗ ),

where (𝛼 ∗ , 𝛽 ∗ ) is a pooling contract on the NS locus that satisfies zero profit condition. We
can first prove the following Lemma:

Lemma 4
  There exists θ(∆P) (∈ (0,1]) such that 𝛽 ∗ = 𝑓(𝛼 ∗ ) for θ < 𝜃(∆P), where θ′(∆P) < 0.


     We can then establish the following Theorem.

 Theorem 11 (Equilibrium with Non-exclusive Provision under DIA)
  Suppose that ΔPL = 𝛥PH ≡ ∆P, and suppose that the government informs insurance firms
of those who have purchased insurance in excess of 𝛼 ∗ . Then, (𝛼 ∗ , 𝛽 ∗ ) is an RS
equilibrium for θ < 𝜃(∆P), where 𝛽 ∗ = 𝑓(𝛼 ∗ ). When an equilibrium exists, the equilibrium


28
   For instance, the government could require that all insurance policies be registered, and any non-registered
insurance policy would not be enforceable.

individual does not purchase more than 𝛼 ∗ .


  Consider the standard case where the indifference curve of L-type individuals is flatter than
that of H. The standard way in which a pooling contract is broken is to offer a contract, A in
Figure 12, lying below VH and above VL. Such a contract, entailing less insurance, will
                                                                                                         ̅

make a profit. But now, given that all insurance firms offer insurance at the price 1−P̅ up to
𝛼 ∗ . A in Figure 12a must entail insurance at less than that price (otherwise it would not be
purchased), and all individuals will purchase A, supplementing it with insurance from other
providers.29 As a result, the contract will lose money.
                                                                         ̅
                                                                         p
   This argument may not hold for high θ. As θ increases, the price ̅ becomes high, and1−p
at a high enough price, L-type individuals would like to reduce their insurance below the
pooling contract (𝛼 ∗ , 𝛽 ∗ ) while H-type individuals would want to keep their insurance. This
would make the pooling outcome (𝛼 ∗ , 𝛽 ∗ ) unsustainable, as each type would choose
different amount of insurance.      The differential choices of insurances between two types
would affect the price of insurance, which would again induce each type to adjust his choice
of insurance. This process might result in a price equilibrium in which the H-type chooses
the maximum amount of insurance that induces non-shirking at the given price, while the L-
type chooses a smaller amount of insurance at the same price.30 31
   There are two ways that the presence of moral hazard contributes to the sustainability of a
pooling equilibrium. First, due to the moral hazard constraint, L-type individuals may be
                                                       ̅
                                                       p
willing to purchase more insurance at the price 1−p̅ at (𝛼 ∗ , 𝛽 ∗ ). As the non-shirking
constraints get tighter, therefore, the chance for a pooling equilibrium becomes greater. In
the absence of moral hazard, on the other hand, a pooling equilibrium never exists. Second,
the non-exclusive nature of private provision of insurance induces H-type individuals, as well
as L-type individuals, to choose any deviant contract involving a lower level of insurance
with lower prices. In other words, the moral hazard constraint which makes L-type’s
preference for insurance stronger and the non-exclusive provision of additional insurance at
the fixed price can work together to sustain a pooling equilibrium.
   In particular, concerns about moral hazard make it natural to want to put constraints on the
amount of insurance—there is an obvious externality, as we have noted. If firms have
information about the quantity of insurance, they will use it to limit the amount of insurance.
And this makes the pooling equilibrium they we have described particularly persuasive.



29
   Arnott and Stiglitz [1991a, 1991b ] discussed the use of latent policies to discourage contracts which might
break an equilibrium. Here, it is the actual policies offered in the market which serve to deter equilibrium
breaking deviations. Note that if the government provided full information about coverage, then the
equilibrium which would emerge would correspond to the exclusive contract equilibrium.
30
   As will be analyzed later, this argument would apply to the case of pure adverse selection, in which the H-
type chooses the full insurance at the equilibrium price while the L-type chooses less-than-full insurance.
31
   Alternatively, there can also exist a pure pooling price equilibrium, at the level of insurance preferred by the
low-type, in which the government announces any purchases in excess of that amount. The H-type would then
know that if they purchase in excess of the pooling amount, it would signal that they are H-type, and they will
be refused insurance by all insurance providers except at the price ( 𝐻 ) reflecting their market risk.
                                                                     1− 𝐻

                                                                                                                25
  Now let us consider a case of PAS when there is no moral hazard. To figure out an
equilibrium in this case we will consider an insurance contract (𝛼 ∗ , 𝛽 ∗ ) such that

                                      (𝛼 ∗ , 𝛽 ∗ ) =                    𝑉𝐿 (𝛼, 𝛽)
                                                                ̅
                                             s.t.         β = 1− ̅ 𝛼,

i.e., that it maximizes the utility of L-type given the zero profit (associated with a pooling
contract) constraint. We can then establish the following Theorem with the proof being
delegated to the Appendix.

Theorem 12 (Equilibrium with Non-exclusive Provision under PAS)
    Suppose that the government informs insurance firms of those who have purchased
insurance in excess of 𝛼 ∗ . Suppose that insurance firms provide insurances non-exclusively
given the information revealed by the government, while individuals may choose insurance
contracts sequentially. Under PAS an RS equilibrium strategy will be a pricing contract that
offers insurances at the fixed price 1−𝐻 for those revealed to have purchased more than 𝛼 ∗
                                                  𝐻
                            ̅
                            P
and at the fixed price       ̅
                                 for the others.
                           1−P



   As shown in Figure 12b, the resulting equilibrium allocation would then be a hybrid type
allocation: a pooling allocation (𝛼 ∗ , 𝛽 ∗ ) for both types plus a supplemental insurance for H-
type, or, alternatively, (𝛼 ∗ , 𝛽 ∗ ) for both types (A in Figure 12b) and (𝛼 ′ − 𝛼 ∗ , 𝛽 ′ − 𝛽 ∗ ) for
H-type (C in Figure 12) such that 𝛽 ′ − 𝛽 ∗ = 1−𝐻 (𝛼 ′ − 𝛼 ∗ ) and 𝛼 ′ + 𝛽 ′ = 𝑑. When the
                                                                    𝐻
private provision of insurance is non-exclusive, a pooling contract (𝛼 ∗ , 𝛽 ∗ ) may be sustained
as a part of an equilibrium, provided that the government identifies those who have excess
amount of insurance.
   The reason why the pure pooling allocation (𝛼 ∗ , 𝛽 ∗ ) cannot be sustained as an
equilibrium under PAS is because, at that point, H-type individuals have incentive to increase
amount of insurances at the price 1−𝐻 reflecting their market risk. Note that, in the absence
                                              𝐻
of moral hazard, additional insurances for H-type would not change their probability of
accident, unlike the case of DIA where (𝛼 ∗ , 𝛽 ∗ ) can be sustained as an equilibrium.32


7. The Role of the Market in Implementing PO and UO

   Although the market outcome, if it exists, is PO, every PO outcome cannot be
implemented by private markets. What we argue in this section is that, with the minimum
intervention of the government, the PO outcome can be achieved by the market under adverse
selection whether or not moral hazard is present.


32
     Note that this equilibrium is not PO because, given this equilibrium, L-type could also be offered some
supplemental insurance at their market risk           𝐿
                                                           without affecting the contract (𝛼 ′ , 𝛽 ′ ) for H-type. This
                                                  1− 𝐿
supplemental insurance for L-type, however, would not be able to be offered given the current information
revelation of government.
                                                                                                                    26
    Suppose that the market is relatively more efficient in providing insurance compared to
the government. We will assume, however, that the market is just slightly more efficient in
the provision of insurance than the government to downplay the effect of the relative
efficiency of the market upon the design of the implementation mechanism. 33 We can then
show that a hybrid provision of insurances by the government and the market is an optimal
mechanism of insurance provision except for limiting cases.

6-1. Pure Adverse Selection
   For a PO allocation {(αH , βH ), (αL , βL )} let Pi be the probability of accident for an
individual of type i who chooses (αi , βi ) and let ̅P = θPH + (1 − θ)PL. We can then prove
the following theorem.

Theorem 13
   For any PO allocation {(αH , βH ), (αL , βL )} under adverse selection, there exists (α̅, β̅)
                  ̅
                  P               P
such that β̅ = 1−P̅ α
                    ̅, βi − β̅ = 1−Pi (αi − α
                                            ̅) ≤ 0, for i=H,L, and that {(αi − α ̅), (βi − β̅)}
                                      i
is an RS equilibrium given (α   ̅, β̅) regardless of θ. In particular, β̅ = α
                                                                            ̅ = 0 when a PO
                                              ̅
allocation entails no subsidy, whereas βi = β and αi = α  ̅ when a PO allocation is a pooling
one.


    The proof can be found in the Appendix. Theorem 13 demonstrates that any PO allocation
can be decomposed into a pooling allocation (α     ̅, β̅) entailing the subsidy embedded in the
PO allocation and a separating allocation that does not involve any subsidy. This suggests that
after offering the pooling contract (α  ̅, β̅), the government can leave to the market the
provision of the remaining separating contract in implementing the PO allocation, and if the
market is relatively more efficient in the insurance provision than the government, it should
do so.
   The possible role of the market under adverse selection can be illustrated by Figure 13.
Figure 13 shows the case when the UO, which is a separating outcome (B,C), can be
implemented by a hybrid provision of the government and the market: the government
provision of A (pooling contract) and the market provision of the remaining separating
contract involving no subsidy. In particular, the supplementary provision of insurance can
always be sustained as an RS equilibrium, regardless of θ, because the market provision is
PO given the government provision and does not involve any subsidy.
   We have thus established the following Corollary.

Corollary 1
   The optimal mechanism of implementing any PO provision of insurance under adverse
selection is a hybrid provision by the government and the market, except for the limiting
cases where a PO involves no subsidy so that it is implemented only by the market or where a
PO allocation is a pooling one so that it is implemented only by the government. In
particular, the UO allocation, which is a pooling one, can only be attained by the government
provision.

  33
     This assumption implies that, whenever indifferent between the government and private provisions in the
model, the private provision is desirable or that the government provision needs to be minimized.


                                                                                                         27
6-2. Moral Hazard and Adverse Selection
  In the presence of moral hazard as well as adverse selection, the market has to provide
some insurance in implementing any PO especially when low-risk type individuals are
subject to stricter non-shirking constraint than high-risk type ones (Case II). Focusing upon
the utilitarian optimum in particular, we can present the following Corollary.

Corollary 2
   With adverse selection and moral hazard, the market may play a role in the achieving the
utilitarian optimum, whereas it can be attained only by the government under PAS.


   Corollary 2 is clear from the discussions on the UO in Section 4, which demonstrates that
the UO should be a pooling allocation with complete insurance under PAS, whereas it may be
a separating allocation for a wide range of parameters under DIA. In this respect we can
argue that, although the presence of adverse selection restricts the role of market in achieving
the utilitarian optimum, the introduction of moral hazard may create room for the market to
play an important role in implementing the utilitarian optimum. This argument is consistent
with the practice of many current insurance systems, such as health insurance and retirement
insurance, in which the government provides all the individuals with basic insurance and the
market offers a variety of additional insurance that can match diverse preferences of
individuals.
   In delegating some provision of insurance to the market in this case, however, the
government needs to regulate the market in general to achieve the PO allocation, for in the
absence of such regulation, insurance firms will not take account of the externality that their
provision of insurance has on other firms, and in particular, on the government, as the
provider of the base insurance.    We can establish the following: .

Theorem 14
  Any PO separating contract {(αH , βH ), (αL , βL )} under moral hazard and adverse selection
entailing incomplete insurance can be implemented by the government provision of a pooling
contract (α̅, β̅) and the market provision of a separating contract {(αi − α̅), (βi − β̅)}i=H,L,
together with the schedule of government tax t(α) such that
       t(α) = 0                         for α < αL
                   U′ (w−d+α)
              =              |      −1   for α ∈ [αL , αH )
                    U′ (w−β) V
                                L
                  U′ (w−d+α)
              =             |    −1      for α ≥ αH ,
                   U′ (w−β) V
                             H
where   Vi = V(αi , βi ) , i = H, L.



   Theorem 14 demonstrates that, while the optimal allocation can be achieved by a hybrid
provision of the government and the market under adverse selection, the government needs to
intervene further in the market after offering a pooling contract in the presence of moral
hazard. The reason for this additional intervention is because the supplementary separating
allocation by the market will exert an externality upon the pooling contract offered by the
                                                                                             28
government in presence of moral hazard, which private firms would not take into account in
offering contracts. In other words, without the government tax, the market would provide
excessive amount of insurance (compared to the PO allocation) given the government
provision of the basic pooling contracts under DIA.


7. Conclusion

   This paper examines how the presence of moral hazard affects the optimal and equilibrium
allocations under adverse selection and discusses the roles of the market and the government
in implementing the optimal allocation. Moral hazard and self-selection constraints interact
with each other and this changes optimal and equilibrium allocations in important ways from
what emerges in cases where there is only moral hazard or only adverse selection. We show
that the nature of the equilibrium depends critically upon how the accident probabilities differ
across risk types and are affected by the level of care taken. At the center of our analysis is
a focus on the impact of a subsidy from the low risk (L-type) to the high risk type. As in the
case of the pure adverse selection, as the subsidy increases, there are two conflicting effects
upon the amount of insurance for L-type or upon their welfare: the positive effect of the
relaxed self-selection constraint and the negative effect of the more-binding profit constraint.
So long as the net effect is positive, utilitarian welfare is increased, because the changes in
the profit constraints are simply transfers, and are effectively cancelled out between the two
types of individuals.34With moral hazard, the non-shirking constraints, however, limit the
magnitude of the positive effect.
   On the nature of the optimal allocation, the main results are the followings. First, a Pareto
optimal (PO) allocation may involve shirking for high-risk individuals, which would not be
true under pure moral hazard. The fact that some individuals shirk (do not take adequate care)
has often been raised as a criticism of public insurance programs. Our paper shows that
such shirking may indeed characterize Pareto Optimal allocations. The cost of inducing
them not to shirk exceeds the benefits. Perhaps more surprising is the result that in the case
with multi-crossing preferences (which is often true under the double informational
asymmetry) a PO allocation may entail shirking even for both types of individuals. Second,
the utilitarian optimum (UO) may be achieved either by a pooling contract with incomplete
insurance or by a separating contract that may entail full insurance (and shirking) for high-
risk individuals. The reason for the utilitarian optimality of the pooling contract with partial
insurance is that the more severe non-shirking constraint for high risk type makes infeasible a
dominating separating contract. This result can be compared to the case of pure adverse
selection where the UO is always achieved by a pooling contract with complete insurance.
   Regarding equilibrium under moral hazard and adverse selection, as in the pure adverse
selection model, if there exists a separating PO allocation with no subsidy, that allocation is a
Rothschild-Stiglitz (RS) equilibrium. But there are several distinctive results under double
information asymmetry: First, a RS equilibrium may entail shirking for one type or for both
types of individuals in the presence of multi-crossing preferences. This property of an
equilibrium is never present under pure moral hazard. Second, the presence of the moral
hazard constraints affects the likelihood (e.g. the critical value of θ, θ̃) that a separating
allocation with no subsidy is PO, and therefore the likelihood of equilibrium existence. A

34
   This is a slight simplification, because the higher risk individual has a lower expected (net of accident)
income, and hence a higher marginal utility of income.
                                                                                                                29
separating contract involving no subsidy is more likely to be pareto optimal as the non-
shirking constraint for low-risk type individuals gets tighter, because the positive welfare
effect from the loosening of the self-constraint, from providing a subsidy to the high risk
individuals, is limited. Besides, we also showed that, in the presence of multi-crossing
preferences, an RS equilibrium may not exist either for high θ or for low θ.
   Second, this paper also discusses the possibility of a pooling equilibrium under the double
informational asymmetry. When the low risk type is more risk averse than the other type,
the former may have stronger preference for insurance at a pooling allocation than the latter,
which can keep a (potentially) deviant contract entailing smaller amount of insurances from
attracting the low risk type. Furthermore, when the provision of insurance is non-exclusive,
a pooling contract can be sustained as an equilibrium, provided that the government reveals
information about the excessive purchase of insurances (by an individual) that can induce
shirking, because a deviant contract (against a pooling contract) entailing a smaller amount of
insurances with a lower price can attract H-types as well as L-types. In this respect, this paper
also began the investigation of another important class of problems: that where there is
some, but limited, revelation of information about individual’s insurance purchases. When
there is full revelation, if an equilibrium exists, it will consist of exclusive contracts, and has
been well-described in the earlier literature. When there is no information, the only
equilibrium is a price equilibrium, but such an equilibrium is very fragile and complex.35
Indeed, this was the context in which adverse selection was first studied, with one of the
results being that the only equilibrium may entail no insurance. We show here that if the
government reveals when any individual purchases more than a critical threshold of insurance,
the market will limit purchases and a pooling equilibrium can be sustained.
    Finally, this paper demonstrates that any Pareto optimal allocation can be implemented
through the hybrid provision of insurance by the government and the market (except for the
limiting cases when a PO allocation does not involve any subsidy so that it can be
implemented only by the market and when a PO allocation is a pooling one so that it can be
implemented only by the government.) This is a theoretical justification of what we often
observe in reality, i.e., a system in which the government provides basic insurance to
everyone (effectively a pooling contract) and leaves to the market the supplementary
provision. However, when delegating some provision of insurance to the market in the
presence of moral hazard, the government needs to intervene through taxes because of the
externality the market exerts upon government provision.

   The insurance market has proved a fertile context in which to examine the effects of
adverse selection and moral hazard in isolation. Results and concepts developed in highly
idealized models have proven useful in understanding many other markets. This paper has
shown that while the interaction between adverse selection and moral hazard is complex,
there are simple analytic tools which allow a tractable analysis with considerable generality,
and with results that, in some cases, confirm those obtained when there is only one
information asymmetry. More interestingly, in other cases we show those results to be of
limited validity.

offering a large policy, sufficiently large that individuals would not wish to supplement that policy with market
insurance at the going price.

when αH = αL , i.e., at a pooling contract with complete insurance, any further subsidy (or any further increase
in αH ) would not satisfy the self-selection constraint.
   It is trivial to show that a pooling contract that involves full insurance and yields zero profit, maximizes the
utilitarian social welfare function even with perfect information.36 Since such a contract can be implemented
even with imperfect information about information types, it is clear that is also represents the UO under
imperfect information.

Proposition 1

   36
      It is also clear that any pooling contract other than (α̃ , β̃ ) is dominated by(α̃ , β̃ ) so such an allocation
cannot be PO.


                                                                                                                             32
   Consider first the case of single-crossing preferences. Suppose that βL > fL (αL ). We can then offer another
contract (α′ , β′ ) such that 𝑉𝐿 (αH , βH ) = 𝑉𝐿 (α′ , β′ ), α′ < αL , β′ < 𝛽L and that β′ = fL (α′), which is to be
chosen by L-type and not to be chosen by H-type, given the single crossing assumption. The new contract can
make more profits than the original one because of the assumption A1, suggesting that {(αL , βL ), (αH , βH )} is
not PO.
Suppose that β𝐻 < fH (αH ) . We can then find another contract (α′ , β′ ) offering more insurance (i.e. α′ >
α𝐻 , β′ > 𝛽H ) such that 𝑉𝐻 (αH , βH ) = 𝑉𝐻 (α′ , β′ ), and that β′ = fH (α′), which is to be chosen only by H-type
and yields more profits (because of the incomplete insurance for H-type), suggesting that {(αL , βL ), (αH , βH )}
is not PO. Suppose that β𝐻 > fH (αH ) and that {(αL , βL ), (αH , βH )} is PO. If αH + βH < 𝑑, we can always
think of a contract for H-type, (α′ , β′ ), such that 𝑉𝐻 (αH , βH ) = 𝑉𝐻 (α′ , β′ ), and α′ + β′ = d, which is to be
chosen only by H-type and yields more profits than (αH , βH ) (because (αH , βH ) represents the incomplete
insurance), suggesting that a PO separating contract entails full insurance for H-type in this case


Lemma 1
i) Suppose that αH = αL = α        ̅ . In order for both (7A) and (7B) to be binding, it should be the case that
  Pi {U(w − d + αH ) − U(w − d + αL )} = (1 − Pi ){U(w − B) − U(w − fH (αH ))} for i=H,L. Since B gets
  higher for PH than for PL , we can see that this condition would not hold for i=H,L unless αH = αL and
  B = fH (αH ). When αH = αL = α          ̅ , therefore, MXSH(.) and MNSL(.) curves intersect each other, i.e.,
  MXSH(α  ̅)=MNSL(α     ̅)= α̅. The similar argument will hold when βH = d − αH . In this case αH = αL = α   ̿ and
              ̿           ̿
  βH = βL = β while β = d − α        ̿, implying that α̿>α̅.
ii) Taking derivatives of (7A)-(7B) (or of (7A’)-(7B’)) with the equality being in place in each of the conditions
  with respect to αL and αH , we get the desired results.
iii) When ∆PL < ∆PH βH > fL (αH ), because βH = fH (αH ) > fL (αH ), implying that βL > fL (αL ) at αL = αH
  and βL = βH . When ∆PL > ∆PH , βH < fL (αH ) because βH = fH (αH ) < fL (αH ), implying that βL < fL (αL )
  at αL = αH and βL = βH . Note that a contract (α         ̿, β̿) induces shirking for L-type, which implies that a
  contract that does not entail shirking for L should involve the amount of insurance smaller than α    ̿ (given a
  contract (α̿, β̿) for H), i.e., sMXNL((α   ̿) < 𝛼̿.

iii) First note that 𝑃𝐿′ = 𝑃𝐿 in (6’). Substituting (6) or (6’) into (7C) or (7C’) and taking derivatives of (7C) or
  (7C’) with respect to αH , we get the first part of the desired results. Since BB(αL , αH ) < 𝐵(αL , αH ) for
  given (αL , αH ) because d − αH > fH (αH ), we get the second part of the desired result by (7C) and (7C’).


Lemma 2
i) Note that MXNL(𝛼̿) < 𝛼̿ since a pooling contract (𝛼̿, 𝛽̿ ) is a full-insurance one that entails shirking for L.
                       ̿
Note also that sMXNL((α) < 𝛼̿ by Lemma 1 iii). Considering that M L′ (𝛼𝐻 ) > 1 and M H ′ (𝛼𝐻 ) > 1
by Lemma 1 ii), we can see that up (G) < 𝛼̿. As MXNL(𝛼̅) > 𝛼̅ when ∆PL < ∆PH by Lemma 1 iii),
  up (G) < 𝛼̅.
ii) First note that 𝑃𝐿′ = 𝑃𝐿 in (6’). From (6’) we can see that BB(αL , 𝛼𝐻 ) ≈ 𝐵(αL , 𝛼𝐻 ) when θ ≈ 0. This
suggests that M L(𝛼𝐻 ) ≈ M L(𝛼𝐻 ) when θ ≈ 0 , implying that up (G) > 𝛼̅ when ∆PL ≥ ∆PH for
small θ.


Theorem 3
1) As for the existence of θ̅ :
    Given the contract B (α  ̅H , β̅H ) for H-type in Figure 6b, the most profitable contract for L-type that satisfies
SSL and NSL constraints would be the one C (α′L , β′L ) (Figure 6b) such that

     PL U(w − d + αL ′) + (1 − PL )U(w − βL ′) = U(w − d + α

where B(αL , αH ) ≡                αL +              (PH αH − (1 − PH )fH (αH )) and αL (αH ) is the solution for (5), so that

since U ′ (w − d + αL ) > 𝑈′(w − βL ) and U′(w − βL ) < 𝑈′(w − fH (αH )) < U′(w − d + αH ) . This implies
that the optimal αH , α∗H , is the maximum value, α̅.
2) Note that for αH < α ̅ the constraint (5C) is not binding in Case I. Forming the Lagrange function for the
problem (5) to get the necessary conditions for the solution, we have

                                                                       PH                          1−PH

                                                                       PL                          1−PL

φ∗ {VL (αH , fH (αH )) − (PL U(w − d + α∗L ) + (1 − PL )U(w − B(αL , αH ))} = 0

where λ, φ refer to the multipliers associated with the constraints (5A), (5B), respectively. We can see from
(5A), (5B) and (11) that it should not be the case that λ∗ ≠ 0, φ∗ ≠ 0 for αH < α ̅ and that λ∗ = φ∗ = 0 . We
                               ∗       ∗                    ∗      ∗         ∗
can then see from (11) that λ ≠ 0, φ = 0 because, if λ = 0, φ ≠ 0 , φ = 1 , in which case the sufficient
condition is not satisfied. From (11) we have
                          ∗ )−U′
              PL U′ (w−d+αL      (w−B(αL ,αH ))
       λ∗ =                                            > 0,
              PH U′ (w−d+α∗L )−PU′ (w−B(αL ,αH ))

                  PL 1−PH
where P ≡                   < 1, since it is always the case that U′(w − d + α∗L ) > 𝑈′(w − B(αL , αH )) because the
                  PH 1−PL
contract (αL , αH ) entails incomplete insurance.
  The maximized utility for L-type, VL∗ (αH ), can then be written as

  VL∗ (αH ) = VL (α∗L , βL∗ )
            = PL U(w − d + α∗L ) + (1 − PL )U(w − B(αL , αH ))
                        +λ∗ (VH (αH , fH (αH )) − PH U(w − d + α∗L ) − (1 − PH )U(w − B(αL , αH )))

Thus, we have

                                                                                      ∂αH
positive regardless of θ. This, together with Theorem 3 1), suggests that there exists θ̃, which is not greater
than θ̅ such that for θ < θ̃ a PO allocation entails shirking for H-type.
   Note that for θ < θ̃ a PO contract for H entails full-insurance while a PO contract for L entails incomplete
insurance under A1 by Proposition 1. This suggests that a pooling contract cannot be PO for θ < θ̃ under A1
for L.


Theorem 4
  For a pooling contract (α, β) to be PO, it should be the case by Proposition 1 that β ≤ fL (α) and β = fH (α),
which is not feasible in Case II. Suppose that A1 holds for H. It should then be the case that a PO contract
(αH , βH ) for H is on the NSH locus. Suppose not, i.e., suppose that αH + βH = d. We can then think of a
contract (αH ′, βH ′) such that β′H = fH (α′H ) and VH (αH , βH ) = VH (αH ′, βH ′), which satisfies the self-selection
constraints. Since πH (αH ′, βH ′) > πH (αH , βH ) by A1, (αH , βH ) will not be a PO contract for H. In other
words, a PO contract does not entail shirking by any type under A1.


Lemma 3
   i) PO-R(l,H) should entail full-insurance for H-type, because otherwise there would always exist a contract
involving more insurance that can attract H-type only since 𝑃𝐻𝑆 > 𝑃𝐿𝑆 . Suppose that S(l,H) {(αH , βH ), (αL , βL )}
                                                          𝑆                      𝑆
                                                         𝑝𝐻                     𝑝𝐻 𝑈′(𝑤−𝑑+αH        𝑝𝐿𝑆 𝑈′(𝑤−𝑑+αH
is a PO-R(l,H), where βH = 𝑑 − αH =                         𝑆   αH .   Since      𝑆 𝑈′(𝑤−β )   >                     , there must be a
                                                         1−𝑝𝐻                  1−𝑝𝐻       H        1−𝑝𝐿𝑆 𝑈′(𝑤−βH )
              ′   ′        ′             ′
contract (α , β ) (α < αH , β < βH ) that attracts L-type only (given {(αH , βH ), (αL , βL )}) to make profits,
implying that the S(I,H) is not PO-R(l,H).
   ii) Suppose that, over the contracts between (α1 , β1 ) and (α2 , β2 ), i-type’s probability of accident remains
to be pi , while j-type’s probability is either pj or pj ′ depending upon his choice of efforts. Let us assume just
                                                                                                                              pj
for convenience that pj < 𝑝i < pj ′ . Also, let β1 = b1 α1 and β2 = b2 α2 . Suppose that b1 =                                       and
                                                                                                                             1−pj
        pi
b2 =          initially so that each contract initially yields zero profit. We will then increase α1 (or α2 ) while
       1−pi
maintaining b1 (or b2 ) to examine how the change in α1 (or α2 ) affects α2 and b2 (or α1 and b1 ), as the
two self-selection constraints are simultaneously strictly satisfied. As for the self-selection constraint for i-type,
the following should hold:

               (1 − pi )U(w − b2 α2 ) + pi U(w − d + α2 ) = (1 − pi )U(w − b1 α1 ) + pi U(w − d + α1 )

And, as for the self-selection constraint for j-type, the following should hold:

              (1 − pj ′)U(w − b2 α2 ) + pj ′U(w − d + α2 ) = (1 − pj )U(w − b1 α1 ) + pj U(w − d + α1 )

The above set of the two equations has four unknowns, α1 , α2 , b1 , b2 . Taking derivatives of each equation with
                                       p
respect to α1 , α2 , b1 , keeping b2 = i , we have
                                                  1−pi


                                                              Adα2 = Cdα1 − Edb1
                                                              Bdα2 = Ddα1 − Fdb1 A
 where

                                        B ≡ −pj ′U ′ (w − b2 α2 ) + pj ′U ′ (w − d + α2 ) >
                               C ≡ −(1 − pi )U′(w − b1 α1 ) + pi U′(w − d + α1 )
                               D ≡ −(1 − pj )U ′ (w − b1 α1 ) + pj U ′ (w − d + α1 ) < 𝐶
                                                  E ≡ −(1 − pi )α1 U′(w − b1 α1 )
                                               F ≡ −(1 − pj )α1 U ′ (w − b1 α1 ) > 𝐸

                                                                                                                                    35
                     dα2                                                              db1
We also know that          > 0, which implies by the above inequalities that                < 0. This suggests that as α1 (or
                     dα1                                                              dα1
α2 ) decreases while keeping the self-selection constraints strictly satisfied, the contract (α1 , β1 ) becomes
profitable if the profit for (α2 , β2 ) remains to be zero. Similarly we can examine how the change in α1 (or α2 )
                                       pj
affects b2 when we keep b1 =              . By taking derivatives of each of the above two equations with respect to
                                        1−pj
                               pj                                   db2
α1 , α2 , b2 , keeping b1 =          , we can get the result that         < 0, implying that as α1 (or α2 ) decreases while
                              1−pj                                  dα1
keeping the self-selection constraints strictly satisfied, the contract (α2 , β2 ) becomes profitable if the profit for
(α1 , β1 ) remains to be zero.

iii) As Figure 8 illustrates, we can always think of an S(0,0), (A,B), such that VH indifference curve passing B
crosses X, the intersection of NSL locus and zero-profit line for H-type, implying that (A,B) satisfies the desired
property.

Proposition 2
Suppose that S(l,h) yielding zero profit for each type, denoted by (A,B), exists. Suppose that a set (A’, B’) (≠
(A,B)) of contracts (A’ for L and B’ for H-type) that yields zero profit for each type is PO-R(l,h). Since (A,B)
strictly satisfies the SS constraint for k-type (k=H,L), (A’,B’) should be the one that does not strictly satisfy SSL
constraint for L-type, implying that S(l,h) with A’ for L-type entails B” for H-type that yields positive profit.
This suggests by Lemma 3 ii) that (A’,B’) should be pareto-dominated by (A,B), suggesting that (A’,B’) is not
PO-R(l,h). Suppose that (A,B) does not exist. Since a PO-R(l,h) has to strictly satisfy the SS constraint for k-
type (k=H,L), the amount of insurance for k-type has to be at its maximum, which is either full insurance (when
h=H) or maximum non-shirking level (when h=0). Finally, Lemma 3 iii) implies that there always exists a
separating PO-R(0,0) contract.
(2) Consider a pooling contract (α, β) such that α + β < 𝑑 and β > fH (α). We can then think of a contract
(α′, β′) such that VH (α, β) = VH (α′, β′) , α′ > 𝛼, 𝛽 > 𝛽′ , so that a separating contract
{(α′ , β′ ), (α, β)} dominates the pooling contract (α, β) because πH (α, β) < πH (α′, β′). The same argument
can be applied to any other pooling contract that does not strictly satisfy any non-shirking condition.

Proposition 3
   To see if a PO-R(l,h) is a PO-G, we first need to make sure that it is not pareto-dominated by another regional
PO or that there is no other contract that can profitably attracts one type given the PO-R(l,h). We can first see
that PO-R(L,H) and PO-R(0,H) are pareto-ranked to each other and that so are PO-R(L,0) and PO-R(0,0). We
can also see that PO-R(L,H) and PO-R(L,0) are pareto-ranked to each other and that so are PO-R(0,H) and PO-
R(0,0). The remaining pairs will be PO-R(L,0) & PO-R(0,H) and PO-R(L,H) & PO-R(0,0). Consider be PO-
R(L,0) & PO-R(0,H). Whenever 𝑉𝐻 associated with PO-R(L,0) is lower than that associated with PO-R(0,H),
there should be a contract that can profitably attract H-type only, so that PO-R(0,H) is PO-G. When 𝑉𝐻
associated with PO-R(L,0) is higher than that associated with PO-R(0,H), 𝑉𝐿 associated with PO-R(L,0) should
also be higher than that associated with PO-R(0,H), implying that PO-R(L,0) is PO-G. Consider PO-R(L,H) &
PO-R(0,0). Whenever 𝑉𝐻 associated with PO-R(0,0) is lower than that associated with PO-R(L,H), there
should be a contract that can profitably attract H-type only, so that PO-R(0,0) is PO-G. If not, PO-R(L,H) should
be PO-G, because then, given PO-R(0,0), by Lemma 3 ii), there should be a contract that can profitably attract
L-type only.



Theorem 5
i) Proposition 2 suggests that a PO-R(l,h) may not be on the NS locus nor on the full-insurance locus. This
suggests that a PO-G contract, whether it may be separating one or pooling one, may not be on the NS locus nor
on the full-insurance locus. Note that a pooling contract Z in Figure 9a may be PO-G.

ii) From Figure 9a we can see by A1 that when θ ≈ 0 the pooling contract X dominates any separating contract
that involves no subsidy. When θ ≈ 1, the pooling contract Y dominates any separating contract involving no
subsidy except for some special cases such as (A,Y) in Figure 9b.



                                                                                                                          36
Proposition 4
  Suppose that a global PO contract A that yields zero profit for each type is not an RS equilibrium. A deviant
contract that can make positive profits if offered would imply that the contract A is not PO, leading to the
contradiction. Suppose, on the other hand, that an RS equilibrium is not global PO, i.e., that it is pareto-
dominated. Then, by Lemma 3 ii), there exists a contract that will be chosen by one type to make positive
profits, implying that it is not an RS equilibrium, i.e., leading to the contradiction.

Theorem 7
i) This is trivial by Theorem 6 i).
ii) For a pooling allocation to be an RS equilibrium it needs to be PO by i). See Theorem 10 on the condition
for the existence of a pooling equilibrium.
iii) For the condition ii) to be satisfied, the single-crossing property should not hold.


Theorem 8
   If a PO separating contract exists, it is unique in the case of single-crossing preference. It is also unique in
the case of multi-crossing preferences by Proposition 3. Thus, an RS equilibrium is unique, if it exists, by
Proposition 4.
   In the case of single-crossing preferences, a PO contract entailing shirking involves cross-subsidy as is
shown by Theorem 3, implying that an RS equilibrium should not entail shirking in this case. In the case of
multi-crossing preferences, Theorem 5 and Proposition 4 suggest that an RS equilibrium may involve shirking
or amount of insurance that is insufficient relative to NS or full-insurance constraint.



Theorem 9
i) As for the existence of θ̃:
    In the case of multi-crossing preferences, θ̃ always exists by Theorem 5 ii).
    In the case of single-crossing preferences: Let us denote by A and B a contract (α, β) and (α′ , β′ ),

β = 𝑓𝐻 (α) ≈ d − α, so that A may go to A’ in Figure 10c. Consider first the case where PLS = PH . Denoting by B’

a contract (α", β") such that VH (A′) = VH (B") and β" = L α" , we can see from A1 that α" < α′ , implying

that θ̃ > 0. Now, by increasing PH from PLS , we will examine how α" will change to see if a new α" is still
lower than α′ . Restating the condition that VH (A′) = VH (B") (taking into account zero-profit conditions), we
have

  As for the property of θ̃:
    Figure 10a shows that as NSL constraint becomes stricter, θ̃ decreases, while Figure 10b shows that as
NSH becomes stricter, θ̃ decreases.

ii) When θ ≈ 1, the pooling contract Y in Figure 9b dominates any separating contract involving no subsidy,
except for a separating allocation (A,Y) as shown in Figure 9b.

Theorem 10

present as a proof a figure (Figure 11). In Figure 11, given a pooling contract A, a deviant contract B will
attract H-type only to make losses, while a deviant contract C will attract L-type only who would shirk, making
losses. Note that there exists θ∗ (> 0) such that any contract outside the non-shirking locus will make loss if
θ < θ∗ .

Theorem 11
Given the government revelation of information, by the assumption (A1), there would be no contract that

at any contract entailing the amount of insurance smaller than 𝛼 ∗ each type of individual would like to
                                                ̅

                                                                                                       ∗
implies that there would be no contract offering insurance smaller than 𝛼 that can profitably attract L-type
only when insurance provision is non-exclusive.

                      for those purchasing more than 𝛼 ∗ , the resulting allocation would be (𝛼 ∗ , 𝛽 ∗ ) for both types
            1− 𝐻
and supplemental contract (𝛼 ′ − 𝛼 ∗ , 𝛽 ′ − 𝛽 ∗ ) for H-type (Figure 12b). Given this outcome, no contract
offering insurance smaller than 𝛼 ∗ would not be able to profitably attract L-type only under non-exclusive
provision as in the case of Theorem 11. Any contract offering insurance more than 𝛼 ∗ at the price lower than
  𝐻                          ̅
                             P

                                   would attract H-type only, yielding negative profits. Also, note that the pure pooling

allocation     (𝛼 ∗    ∗)
               , 𝛽 cannot be sustained as an equilibrium under PAS is because, at that point, H-type
individuals have incentive to increase amount of insurances at the price 𝐻 .

Theorem 14
The first part of the theorem, the decomposition of a separating contract into a pooling and a separating ones
(with no subsidy), is already proved in Theorem 13. It suffices to prove the remaining part. We will show that,
without the government tax, a firm can make positive profit by deviating from the separating contract

offering it given the pooling and separating contracts. There then exists a contract (α′ , β′ ) that a firm can offer
