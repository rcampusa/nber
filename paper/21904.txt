                                             ABSTRACT

This project examines how reminders affect tax filing among lower-income nonfilers (individuals
who did not appear on a filed tax return but had income reported by third parties to the Internal Revenue
Service). We present novel data on this population and results from two randomized controlled trials.
The results demonstrate that one-time reminders increase tax filing, both to claim tax refunds based
in part on withholdings and Earned Income Tax Credit benefits, as well as to voluntarily pay balances
owed to the IRS. However, these effects do not persist. Consistent with recency effects, individuals
who owe a balance due appear more likely to recidivate into nonfiling than those who receive refunds.
Follow-up reminders continue to increase tax filing, particularly among individuals who previously
had to pay balances to the IRS instead of receive refunds.

I. Introduction

Common intuition suggests that attention plays a crucial role in individuals’ decisions. If
individuals are not attentive to certain benefits from taking an action, it seems unlikely that they
will take that action. While traditional economic theories have assumed that individuals make
decisions as fully informed agents who take all available information into account (Mas-Colell,
Whinston and Green 1995 and Varian 2014), a large and growing literature in psychology and
economics has developed theories of limited attention or inattention to characterize individuals’
decisions (see DellaVigna 2009 for a survey of this literature). These theories highlight how
reminders and other informative or persuasive cues can affect a variety of individuals’ decisions.
For example, studies have examined how simplified information and reminders affect college
enrollment (Castleman and Page 2014), exercise (Royer, Stehr and Sydnor 2015 and Calzolari
and Nardotto 2015), savings for retirement (Karlan et al 2015), school choice (Hastings and
Weinstein 2008), vaccination use and medical treatment adherence (Mauer and Harris 2014 and
Raifman et al 2014), and electricity usage (Allcott and Taubinsky 2015).

While many studies of inattention have focused on static settings, there are still many open
questions about inattention in dynamic settings. Do inattentive individuals learn and form habits
in dynamic settings? Will a one-time reminder have permanent effects on knowledge and
behavior, or does inattention inherently require repeated reminders to get individuals to
repeatedly take actions and make decisions? Do individuals become inattentive to repeated
reminders? While the answers to these questions are likely to vary across different contexts,
understanding the factors relevant to these questions is important for academic researchers as
well as policymakers. For example, policies requiring actions each year may need to repeat
nudges each year to generate sustained changes in individuals’ decisions.

In this project, we examine the effects of reminders in the context of a low frequency repeated
behavior. In particular, each year, individuals must decide whether or not to file their tax returns
independent of having filed a tax return in a previous year. Relative to daily, weekly, or monthly
decisions, or settings with little time to get information between decisions, tax filing represents a
low frequency decision. More specifically, we focus on potentially EITC-eligible individuals and
examine tax filing decisions across multiple years. We present evidence on one-time and
repeated reminders to file tax returns, where one-time reminders refer to reminders sent only in a
single year and repeated reminders refer to reminders sent in multiple years.

The empirical analysis is based on outreach pilots conducted by the United States Internal
Revenue Service. The field experiment setting for these outreach pilots is relevant both for the
general academic insights into inattention and for the insights into this particular population. In
contrast to some laboratory settings, this field experiment setting involves significant real money
stakes for both individuals and the government. For example, for tax year 2012, there were
roughly 39 million nonfilers, and about 4 million of these were estimated to be potentially EITC
eligible. In this nonfiler population, there are billions of dollars of potential tax refunds and
potential tax revenue at stake. 1 We present novel, publicly available data on the spatial
distribution of the nonfiler population across multiple years below.


1
    See Table 1 and the corresponding discussion of these summary statistics on this nonfiler population below.
Using a stratified random sample of roughly 360,000 potentially EITC eligible nonfilers from tax
years 2011 and 2012, we conducted randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in 2014 and 2015. A
sample of 200,000 individuals was randomly selected to receive EITC and filing information
from the IRS during the 2014 tax filing season (generally, January 15 through April 15 in a given
year). The second RCT built upon the first. The experimental sample for the second RCT
consisted of individuals in the first RCT who filed tax returns during the 2014 filing season. Of
these roughly 130,000 tax returns, 30,000 were randomly selected to receive one reminder notice
from the IRS during the 2015 tax filing season. For each RCT, a control group did not receive
any experimental reminders. Importantly, the treatment group for the 2015 RCT included some
individuals who received treatment from the 2014 RCT and some who did not.

The results from the experiments provide multiple insights about inattention, reminders and
recidivism. First, the results demonstrate that, in a setting with real money at stake, reminders
appear to reduce inattention. In particular, in both RCTs, the treatment group had higher filing
rates than the control group. The treatment group was more likely to file both current and prior-
year tax returns, and was more likely both to claim refunds and pay taxes owed. Notably, the
increased filing rates across all income levels, potential benefit levels and filing histories.

Second, in this setting with low frequency decisions, one time reminders generated one-time
effects: the effects of reminders in 2014 did not persist to 2015. These results suggest that the
reminders reduced inattention when they were received, but individuals did not permanently
learn from the reminders. Third, the repeated reminders reduced recidivism. Specifically,
individuals who received reminders in both the 2014 and 2015 RCTs had a higher filing rate than
individuals who received reminders in the 2014 RCT only or not at all. Consistent with a lack of
learning from reminders in this setting, the follow-up reminder did not have diminished
effectiveness as individuals who received reminders in the 2014 and 2015 RCTs had a similar
filing rate as individuals who received reminders in the 2015 RCT only.

A fourth result is that past experiences were influential and interacted with the effectiveness of
the follow-up reminders for one group. Individuals who had a balance due on their 2013 tax
return were less likely to file a 2014 return compared to individuals who received a refund on
their 2013 return. Further, the follow-up reminder appeared to be particularly effective at
reducing recidivism among those who previously owed taxes compared to among those who
previously received refunds. This result suggests that some low-income nonfilers may follow an
intuition of expecting to pay a balance due in the future if they file a tax return, and this
expectation is based on the experience of having had to pay a balance due when they most
recently filed a tax return. This intuition indicates some low-income nonfilers may suffer from
recency bias or a law of small numbers bias. However, the reasoning may be flawed because, at
least for these individuals and perhaps true more broadly, tax situations appear to change
significantly from year to year: of the people in the 2015 RCT control group who owed a balance
due on their 2013 tax return, roughly 50% of them qualified for a refund on their 2014 tax return.

Overall, the results suggest a model of inattentive behavior in which informational nudges can
affect behavior, but individuals do not appear to learn from the informational nudges themselves.
Instead, individuals do appear to, perhaps mistakenly or suboptimally, draw inferences from
recent realizations of uncertain outcomes. Thus, when considering the impacts of informational
interventions on individuals’ well-being, it is important to consider whether or not the set of
available policy instruments includes follow-up reminders or only one-time reminders, and the
potential for individuals’ mistaken or suboptimal inferences to affect future actions.

These insights regarding inattention, reminders and recidivism are broadly relevant to the
literatures on consumer choice, psychology, economics, and public finance. While recent work in
behavioral economics has aimed to develop dynamic models of consumer choice with inattention
(see Taubinsky 2013), the current results help inform such models by providing evidence of how
attention and reminder effects decay and how reminder effects can be repeated with follow-up
reminders. The current results also relate to a literature in psychology and individual choice on
belief adjustment and recency effects (see Hogarth and Einhorn 1992 for a discussion of
theoretical foundations for recency effects and Davelaar et al 2009 for more recent evidence).
The current results present evidence consistent with possibly suboptimal recency effects or
recency bias in a field setting that involves potentially billions of dollars of tax refunds and tax
revenue. Furthermore, while other studies have considered settings with high frequency
decisions and high frequency reminders (e.g. daily or weekly decisions to put effort at school or
go to the gym accompanied by daily or weekly reminders about these decisions as in Calzolari
and Nardotto 2015 and Bergman 2015), the current results demonstrate that inattention can be
persistent in a dynamic setting with low frequency (annual) decisions. Related to the consumer
choice literature, recent literature has highlighted the impacts of various policy nudges on a
variety of behaviors (see Thaler and Sunstein 2008, Chetty 2015, Bhargava and Manoli 2015,
Manoli and Turner 2015, and the Social and Behavioral Science Team 2015). Results from our
study suggest that policy nudges may be effective at generating one-time effects, but they may
not generate permanent learning. Thus, to create permanent changes in behavior, nudges may
have to be repeated each year or whenever consumers face the relevant decisions.

Our experimental analysis is also relevant for the literature on incomplete take-up of benefits.
Incomplete take-up is a widespread phenomenon with potentially severe consequences
(Haveman et al 2001, Jones et al 2003). Even for large-scale, popular social programs including
the Earned Income Tax Credit, there is significant incomplete take-up of benefits (Currie 2006,
Kleven and Kopczuk 2011, Scholz 1994, Hotz et al 2003, Plueger 2009, Bhargava and Manoli
2015). This incomplete take-up across social programs is particularly concerning for
policymakers and researchers because many of these programs are intended to provide benefits
to individuals with limited resources, and those with the most limited resources may be the ones
who face the most barriers to claiming benefits for which they are eligible (Bertrand,
Mullainathan and Shafir 2004). Our experimental design highlights that, while the motivation for
third-party information reporting to collect tax revenue is typically based on reducing tax
administration costs and tax evasion through improved monitoring and detection (Slemrod 2007),
third-party information reporting also creates the opportunity for the tax collection agency to
apply behavioral economics and advance public policy (Remler and Gleid 2003, Congdon,
Kling, and Mullainathan 2009 Baicker, et al 2012, and Chetty 2015).

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II provides a conceptual framework.
Section III discusses the data and experimental design. Section IV presents the empirical analysis
and results, and Section V summarizes the findings and discusses potential future studies that can
build on this research.
II. Conceptual Framework

We present a simple framework to organize thoughts about reminders and recidivism. In
particular, this framework is intended primarily to clarify hypotheses about inattention,
reminders and recidivism. Karlan et al (2015) and Taubinsky (2013) provide more complete
dynamic models of choice with inattention, and DellaVigna (2009) and Mullainathan,
Schwartzstein and Congdon (2012) present static models of inattentive choice.

For simplicity, we present a two-period setting in which an individual is making a decision
whether or not to take an action in each period. The action may be an occasional purchase, or as
in our experimental setting, filing a tax return. We will assume that the action chosen in the first
period does not affect the decision in the second period and vice versa. For example, if an
individual files a tax return in the first period, the person still has to make a decision about filing
a tax return in the second period. For this purpose, we assume that in each period the individual
will take action if and only if expected benefits exceed costs. The cost in each period is denoted
by c.

Following the literature in behavioral economics, we assume that benefits in each period are the
sum of a visible component, v, and an opaque component o. The individual is fully attentive to
the visible component, but inattentive to the opaque component. Using 𝜃 ∈ [0,1] to denote the
degree of inattention, the perceived benefit in each period is 𝑣 + (1 − 𝜃)𝑜, so 𝜃 = 0 corresponds
to having full attention. We assume that benefits have some uncertainty and that this uncertainty
applies only to the visible component, so v is drawn from some random variable. Given this set
up so far, the individual will take action in each period if expected benefits exceed the
cost,𝐸(𝑣) + (1 − 𝜃)𝑜 > 𝑐.

Next we introduce reminders in each period. In particular, we let 𝑟 ∈ {0,1} denote a reminder,
where 𝑟 = 1 indicates having received a reminder, and 𝑟 = 0 indicates not having received a
reminder. Starting with the first period, we assume that the reminder affects the degree of
inattention so that 𝜃1 = 𝜃1 (𝑟1 ) with the subscript referring to period 1. With this reminder, the
individual will take action in period 1 if

                                     𝐸1 (𝑣) + [1 − 𝜃1 (𝑟1 )]𝑜 > 𝑐.

We now turn to the second period. In this period, the individual receives the second reminder
𝑟2 , also has the reminder from the first period 𝑟1 and the realized value of the visible component
(filed a return) from period 1, 𝑣1 . We model the degree of inattention in the second period as
being a function of these three components so that 𝜃2 = 𝜃2 (𝑟2 , 𝑟1 , 𝑣1 ). As we discuss in more
detail below, a primary motivation for this conceptual framework is to explain our hypotheses
regarding how inattention in period 2 relates to each of these three components.

Before turning to the hypotheses, we also introduce notation to account for possible learning that
is independent of inattention. Specifically, we allow the realized value of the visible component
from period 1 to affect beliefs about the visible component in period 2. In this case, the
expectation of the visible component in period 2 is given by 𝐸2 (𝑣|𝑣1 ). Thus, the individual will
take action in the second period if

                                𝐸2 (𝑣|𝑣1 ) + [1 − 𝜃2 (𝑟2 , 𝑟1 , 𝑣1 )]𝑜 > 𝑐

Within this framework, we define recidivism as not taking action in period 2 conditional on
taking action in period 1. In other words, recidivism refers to not filing a tax return in the current
year conditional on having filed a tax return in the previous year.

Using this framework, we now discuss multiple hypotheses about reminders.

1. Reminders reduce inattention: 𝜃1 (1) < 𝜃1 (0) and 𝜃2 (1, 𝑟1 , 𝑣1 ) < 𝜃2 (0, 𝑟1 , 𝑣1 ).
The decision rules specify that the reminders affect decisions through the inattention parameters,
and that these parameters are distinct from beliefs. Because beliefs govern expectations over the
visible components of benefits, reminders could reduce inattention without affecting
expectations or beliefs about possible benefits. To check this, one could survey reminder
recipients before and after receipt of the reminders to see if the reminders affected their beliefs
and/or expectations.

2. Persistence: 𝜃2 (𝑟2 , 1, 𝑣1 ) < 𝜃2 (𝑟2 , 0, 𝑣1 ).
If reminders from period 1 have a persistent impact on inattention, then we expect the degree of
inattention in the second period to go down based on having received a reminder in the first
period. In this case, we expect less recidivism (inaction) in period 2 based on having received a
reminder in period 1. On the other hand, if there is no persistence, the degree of inattention in the
second period will be independent of having received a reminder previously or not, i.e.
𝜃2 (𝑟2 , 1, 𝑣1 ) = 𝜃2 (𝑟2 , 0, 𝑣1 ) so individuals that received reminders in the first period will have
the same degree of recidivism in the second period as individuals who did not receive reminders
in the first period. To test for persistence, one can test for differences in the likelihood of taking
action in the second period based on having received a reminder previously or not.

3. One-time vs. repeated reminders: 𝜃2 (1,1, 𝑣1 ) 𝑣𝑣. 𝜃2 (1,0, 𝑣1 ).
If repeated reminders are more effective than a one-time reminder, then we expect that there will
be less inattention in the second period (i.e. less recidivism into inaction in the second period) if
the individual has previously received a reminder in the first period. Thus, this hypothesis is
related to the persistence hypothesis, but it is more specific because it is conditional on receiving
a reminder in the first period, whereas the persistence hypothesis is unconditional. To test this
hypothesis, one can therefore condition on individuals receiving a reminder in the second period
and test for differences in the likelihood of taking action in the second period based on having
received a reminder in the first period or not.

4. Recency effects
The role of past experience in expectations of current beliefs is captured within the term
𝐸2 (𝑣|𝑣1 ). This term refers to the expectations of benefits in period 2 given the realization of the
uncertain outcome in period 1. Individuals may use their previous outcome from period 1 to
update their beliefs about period 2 benefits. More specifically, individuals may use their most
recent outcome from period 1 to anchor their beliefs about the potential outcome in period 2.
Following Hogarth and Einhorn’s (1992) belief adjustment model with anchoring and recency
effects, we refer to this anchoring based on most recent outcomes as recency effects. We note
that these recency effects could be a mistaken or suboptimal way of updating beliefs if benefits
in period 2 are actually independent from period 1 outcomes.

To check for evidence of recency effects, one can examine the likelihood of taking action in
period 2 conditional on period 1 realizations. For example, evidence of people with lower period
1 realizations being less likely to take action in period 2 could be evidence of recency effects. In
examining this evidence, however, it is also important to assess the extent to which lower
realizations of period 1 outcomes are actually correlated with lower realizations in period 2. This
distinction is important for distinguishing heterogeneity across individuals with different beliefs
or expectations from actual biases in beliefs across similar individuals who had randomly
different outcomes.

     reminder effect with salient experience                reminder effect with non−salient experience


Independent of inattention, individuals may learn from period 1 experiences, and some period 1
experiences may be more salient than others. One can examine evidence of learning by studying
how the likelihood of action in period 2 relates to realized values (experiences) from period 1.
Evidence of systematic patterns may suggest some learning. Moreover, more salient or intense
past experiences may make individuals more susceptible or sensitive to reminders. For example,
an individual may be more sensitive to a reminder to buy eggs if the eggs were used to make a
delicious cake. In this case, the delicious cake is not only a good outcome, but it may also be
very memorable or salient the next time buying eggs comes up. Similarly, in the context of filing
a tax return, a balance due in the first period may be more salient or memorable than receiving a
refund. Thus, reminders may be more effective at reducing inattention among people who had a
balance due as opposed to individuals who received refunds. It’s also possible that receiving a
communication from the IRS, even a simple informational postcard, may be a strong incentive to
file a required return.

In addition to the interaction between past experience and reminders, we note that past
experience can also affect behavior in period 2 through beliefs, i.e. through 𝐸2 (𝑣|𝑣1 ). These
learning effects are independent of the effects of reminders. Intuitively, even absent any
reminders in period 1 or 2, individuals who file tax returns and receive a refund in period 1 may
learn about benefits from tax filing and may be more likely to file tax returns in period 2.

Heterogeneous Treatment Effects

Thus far, the framework has focused on the effects of reminders on attention to potential
benefits. Nonetheless, it is also possible to consider the impacts of reminders on attention to
potential costs. For some individuals, the costs of not filing a tax return may involve perceived
costs and opaque costs, and a reminder to file may increase attention to potential penalties or
other costs from not filing a tax return. Moreover, the same reminder may have different effects
on different individuals: some individuals may perceive the reminder in terms of attention to
potential benefits from filing, while others may perceive the reminders in terms of attention to
potential penalties from not filing. We acknowledge this potential for heterogeneous treatment
effects here and discuss this in more detail below, specifically in relation to the effects of the
follow-up reminders.

III. Experimental Design

A. Data & Experimental Population

The experiment was based on administrative tax data from the IRS. To construct the
experimental population, we first created a dataset of potentially EITC-eligible nonfilers for Tax
Years (TY) 2011 and 2012. The steps to create this dataset were as follows. First, a population of
individuals is identified using the set of all information returns (e.g., Forms W-2 and 1099MISC,
as well as other forms) for TY2011 or TY2012. This population was checked against data on
filed tax returns for the relevant year. Individuals who filed a return or who were claimed as a
dependent on a return for the relevant year were removed from the experimental population.
Individuals who were deceased as of January 1, 2014, claimed as a dependent, did not have
positive earned income based on information return data, or were not US citizens or residents
were filtered out of the experimental population.

Figure 1 presents novel, publicly available data on the spatial distribution of nonfilers. 2 The
maps plot the fraction of nonfilers in each county from TY2005 through TY2013. Specifically,
we calculate the fraction of nonfilers in a given county by computing the total number of
nonfilers divided by the sum of nonfilers and filed tax returns. While the maps highlight
significant variation across and within states, the overall patterns indicate higher nonfiling
fractions concentrated in southern or southeastern states. Additionally, the plots indicate that
places with high degrees of nonfiling generally continue to be high nonfiling areas across the
years. The one exception is TY2007 in which nonfiling decreased across all areas. This year
corresponds to the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 which required individuals to file TY2007
returns in order to receive stimulus checks. The maximum amount of the stimulus rebates was
$600 per individual. 3 This suggests that many nonfilers may be responsive to financial incentives
or information on financial incentives for filing tax returns. The plots for subsequent tax years
highlight significant recidivism as the higher nonfiling fractions across areas re-emerge.

Next, potential EITC benefits were estimated for the remaining nonfiler population. Individuals
were matched to potential qualifying children (QCs) using Social Security Administration birth
record data. Potential EITC benefits were estimated based on income information and the

2
  Data for these plots will be publicly available on the IRS Tax Stats webpage in early 2016. Nonfilers for TY2014
have not yet been identified since the late TY2014 tax returns could be filed toward the end of calendar year 2015.
To create the data for these plots, we first compute the number of nonfilers and filed returns in each five-digit zip
code. Information returns are used to determine the zip codes for nonfilers, and home addresses on tax returns are
used to determine the zip codes for filed returns. Five-digit zip codes with less than 100 nonfilers or less than 100
returns are dropped to preserve confidentiality. The five-digit zip codes are then matched to counties, and sums of
nonfilers and returns are computed within each county. Finally, the nonfiler fraction is computed as the total number
of nonfilers divided by the sum of nonfilers and filed tax returns.

number of QCs. An individual’s child who was under the age of 19 and not claimed as a
dependent on anyone else’s return for the study year was considered a QC. Individuals who had
positive estimated EITC benefits were retained for the experimental population. Lastly, other
filters were applied (such as receipt of combat pay (assumed extension to file), a past or present
EITC ban, or any current enforcement action). The final database of potentially EITC-eligible
nonfilers consisted of about 2.2 million nonfilers with no QC and just over 600,000 nonfilers
with one or more QCs for TY2011, and about 2.5 million single nonfilers and 1 million nonfilers
with potential QCs for TY2012.

Table 1 presents summary statistics on the population of potentially EITC-eligible nonfilers from
TY2011 and TY2012. Average wage income and total gross income are roughly $6,000 and
$7,500 for this population, so these nonfilers have lower income levels than typical EITC
recipients (see Manoli and Turner 2015). About 75% of the nonfilers do not appear to have any
potential qualifying children. Thus, the average estimated EITC benefits for the nonfiler
population is on the order of $500 dollars because most individuals in the data have benefits
computed based on having no qualifying child which has a maximum benefit of $464 and $475
for TY2011 and TY2012, respectively. About 25% of the experimental population had an
estimated positive tax liability before refundable credits of roughly $150. These summary
statistics indicate that there are potentially billions of dollars of tax refunds and tax revenue at
stake with this nonfiler population.

The summary statistics on individuals’ filing histories for TY2001 through TY2010 tax returns
indicate that roughly 14% of these nonfilers never filed a tax return for these years, and a similar
fraction always filed a tax return for these years. Furthermore, for the individuals who filed one
or more returns, the fractions are roughly constant at 8%. This indicates that, for this population,
many individuals move in and out of filing over multiple years.

To determine the experimental sample, a stratified random sample of 400,000 nonfilers (200,000
from each tax year) was drawn from the experimental population. National Change of Address
(NCOA) data from the United States Postal Service was used to obtain updated address
information for this sample. Updated address information was unavailable for about 10% of the
sample. From the remaining 360,000 individuals, a stratified random sample of 200,000
individuals (100,000 from each tax year) were assigned to the treatment group, and the
remaining roughly 160,000 individuals were assigned to the control group. 4 Table 1 presents the
summary statistics for the experimental sample. Overall, the sample is comparable to the
experimental population, though income is slightly lower.

B. Experimental Treatments

The analysis consisted of two RCTs, with the first in 2014 and the second in 2015. The 2014
experimental treatments were as follows. The control group received no intervention. Individuals
in the treatment group were randomly assigned one of six treatments: (1) an early postcard, (2)
an early brochure, (3) an early postcard and a late brochure, (4) an early brochure and a late
postcard, (5) an early postcard and a late postcard, or (6) an early brochure and a late brochure.

4
  At the time of mailing, 10 individuals in the treatment group were determined to not have up-to-date address
information, so these observations were dropped from the sample.
Figures 2A-C present examples of the postcard and brochure respectively. The early mailing
occurred on March 21, 2014, and the late mailing occurred on April 2, 2014. The mail was
tracked so that undeliverable mail was identified and recorded.

The second RCT was conducted during the 2015 tax-filing season, and it built upon the 2014
RCT. In particular, the experimental sample for the 2015 RCT was individuals in the 2014 RCT
who filed their TY2013 tax returns during the 2014 tax-filing season after the 2014 experimental
mailings were sent out. Out of this sample, 30,000 individuals were randomly selected for
treatment and the remaining were retained as a control group. This treatment group received two
identical experimental postcards during the 2015 tax-filing season. Specifically, the postcards
were mailed on February 23, 2015 and March 23, 2015. The experimental postcards for the 2015
RCT were the same as those sent out in the 2014 RCT, but the wording was updated for the 2015
tax-filing season and deadlines. Figure 3 presents an example of the postcard for the 2015 RCT.

IV. Empirical Analysis

A. Methods

We first analyze and provide results for the 2014 RCT and then turn to the 2015 recidivism RCT.
For the main empirical analysis presented here, we pool all of the treatment groups and present a
comparison to the control group. Angrist and Pischke (2008) and Cameron and Trivedi (2010)
provide textbook discussions of the empirical methods used here. We assess the impacts of the
experimental outreach on a variety of outcomes that we describe in more detail below. To fix
ideas, we denote an outcome of interest for individual i as yi. Using this measure, we estimate the
following regression specification

                                   𝑦𝑖 = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖

where 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑖 is an indicator equal to 1 if individual i received treatment and 0 otherwise. To
account for some individuals not receiving intended treatment due to printing or mailing issues,
we present treatment-on-the-treated (TOT) results. In particular, in the regression specification
above, we instrument for receiving treatment using the original random assignment. Thus, we
estimate the regression above using Two Stage Least Squares (Instrumental Variables), and the
first stage is given by

                                𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑖 = 𝜋 + 𝜌𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑖 + 𝑢𝑖

where 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑖 is an indicator equal to 1 if individual i was randomly assigned to treatment and
0 otherwise. Intuitively, the TOT estimation strategy re-scales the raw difference in outcomes
between the treatment and control groups by the fraction of the treatment group that actually
received treatment.

Using these regression results, we present the estimated coefficient 𝛼� as the mean outcome for
the control group and 𝛼� + 𝛽̂ as the mean outcome for the treatment group. We also separately
present the estimated difference 𝛽̂ .
B. Results

1. 2014 RCT

Filing

Table 2 presents the first empirical result from the 2014 RCT. 5 The first result is that the
outreach increased tax filing for both prior-year tax returns and current-year tax returns. The
table presents the filing fractions for both prior-year tax returns (TY2010-TY2012) and current-
year tax returns (TY2013) for the treatment and control groups separately. The table highlights
that receiving treatment increased filing rates by roughly 0.5% to 1%. These treatment effects
may seem small in absolute terms, but they may be viewed as large relative to the baseline filing
rates for the control group, particularly for the prior-year returns, which had much lower baseline
filing rates. Consistent with having randomly selected the treatment group, the results in the table
demonstrate that the treatment effects are robust to controlling for a variety of covariates. This
result relates to the reminders reducing inattention, the first implication discussed in the
conceptual framework.

The table indicates that all filing rates are higher for the treatment group. Separate results not
shown here indicate that the treatment group was more likely to file for two or more years rather
than just the current-year return. The lower baseline filing rates for prior-year returns may be
driven by individuals facing relatively high barriers to obtaining tax documents for prior years
compared to obtaining tax documents for the current year. Nonetheless, these results indicate that
the specific informational content of the experimental reminders reduced inattention not only to
filing current-year tax returns, but also to filing unfiled prior-year returns.

Figure 4 presents evidence on internal validity and the timing behind the effects of the reminders.
This figure plots the hazard rates for filing TY2013 tax returns (i.e. the fraction of individuals
filing a TY2013 tax return at a given date, conditional on not having filed earlier) for the
treatment and control groups. The figure strengthens the case for a causal interpretation of the
experimental mailings as it illustrates that, prior to the experimental mailings being sent out, the
filing hazards for the two groups appear similar, and after the experimental mailings were
mailed, the filing hazards for the treatment group increase relative to those of the control group.
Thus, it appears that some responses to the experimental treatment occurred almost immediately
upon receipt of the experimental mailings. Note that the plot also illustrates that, after the
experimental mailings were sent, the filing hazards for the treatment group appear consistently
higher than those of the control group for all subsequent dates.

Table 3 presents evidence on the differential effects of the different treatments. The results on the
individual treatments (Panel A) and comparisons of the postcard versus the brochure (Panel B)

5
  For the first stage regression, we estimate 𝜋� = 2.25𝑒-12 with a standard error of 0.0008 and 𝜌� = 0.7290 with a
standard error of 0.0011. These results indicate that roughly 73% of individuals randomly selected for treatment
ended up receiving the intended treatment. The treatment-on-the-treated (TOT) results therefore re-scale the
                                                                                             1
reduced-form differences in the outcome means for the treatment and control groups by            = 1.3717. Intuitively,
                                                                                          0.7290
for a given outcome, the treatment effect is scaled up from the reduced form difference between the treatment and
control groups because only 73% of the treatment group actually received treatment.
and one contact versus two contacts (Panel C) indicate that there were no statistically significant
differences due to presentation or the number of contacts. These results suggest that the postcard
and brochure were equally as effective at reducing inattention to the tax-filing decision.
Moreover, a single reminder may be as effective as reminders separated by less than 2 weeks.

Prior-Year Returns

Table 4 presents an analysis of filing prior-year returns and the characteristics of these filed
returns. Analyzing these characteristics provides evidence on which particular types of
individuals responded to the treatment. In these results, we focus on TY2011 returns for TY2011
nonfilers, and TY2012 returns for TY2012 nonfilers. Consistent with the earlier results in Table
2, the treated individuals had higher likelihoods of filing their previously unfiled returns. To test
if the treatment only induced filing among those who would receive refunds as opposed to those
who may owe a balance due, we examine the fractions of the treatment and control groups that
received refunds on the prior-year returns, and the fractions that paid a balance due. If the
treatment only induced responses among those who would receive refunds, then we would
expect that the treatment group would have a higher fraction of receiving a refund than the
control group, and that the fractions owing a balance due would be equal across the treatment
and control groups. These results in Table 5 indicate that, for both nonfiler groups, the treatment
group had higher fractions receiving a refund and paying a balance due. These results indicate
that the treatment increased filing among both nonfilers who qualified for refunds as well as
those who owed a balance due.

We next turn to examining the characteristics of the prior-year returns conditional on filing to see
if there were specific types of nonfilers who responded to the treatment more so than others.
Overall, the results indicate that the likelihood of claiming the EITC, having self-employment
income, and the use of paid preparers, appear similar for the treatment group and control group.
These results suggest that the treatment did not appear to induce filing among specific groups
along these dimensions.

The results on the fraction claiming EITC benefits in Table 4 are of particular interest given that
the experimental sample focused on identifying potentially EITC-eligible nonfilers for TY2011
and TY2012. The results indicate that roughly 50% of filed prior-year returns claimed EITC
benefits. The analysis of these prior-year returns indicates that many of these returns had earned
income that was higher than the earned income EITC eligibility thresholds for the corresponding
filing status and number of qualifying children reported on the return. This was driven primarily
by two factors. First, some filed a joint return, and the spouse’s income led to total earned
income being beyond the EITC eligibility thresholds. Second, some individuals reported self-
employment income that led to total earned income being beyond the EITC eligibility thresholds.
Indeed, after conditioning on earned income on the filed return being below the EITC eligibility
thresholds, the fraction of prior-year returns that claimed EITC benefits was roughly 80% for
TY2011 returns and just under 90% for TY2012 returns. These percentages are comparable to
the percentage of individuals claiming EITC benefits when filing current-year returns and
appearing to meet EITC eligibility conditions (see Manoli and Turner 2015). 6

6
 Appendix Table 1 examines whether or not nonfilers that were associated with a potential qualifying child filed
with a qualifying child. Overall, there was a low rate of predicting an association to a qualifying child for returns
Interestingly, the EITC claim rate on the filed prior-year returns was similar across the treatment
and control groups. This indicates that, while the treatment did increase tax filing and hence
EITC participation, conditional on filing, the treatment did not increase the likelihood of
claiming EITC benefits. These results suggest that the informational content of the mailings may
have primarily increased attention to filing and not just to EITC benefits. For example, in the
extreme case that the informational content only made EITC benefits salient but did not make tax
filing salient, we may have expected filing rates to be constant for the treatment and control
groups but EITC take-up rates to be higher for the treatment group than for the control group.

Similar to Table 4 on prior-year returns, Table 5 presents an analysis of current-year (TY2013)
returns for the 2014 RCT. These results are similar to those in Table 4 in that they indicate that
the treatment increased filing generally, but it did not appear to induce filing more so for any
particular group of individuals measured along various tax characteristics.

Refunds Received and Balances Paid

Building on the results in the previous tables, another main result is that the experimental
outreach increased both refunds received as well as balance dues paid. To examine the impacts
on refunds received and balance dues paid, we compute total refunds received for each
individual as the sum of refunds received from prior-year and current-year tax returns. Similarly,
total balance dues paid for each individual are computed by summing balances paid from prior-
year and current-year returns. The results in Table 6 show that, on average, individuals in the
treatment group received $38 per individual more than the control group, and they paid roughly
$50 per individual more than the control group. These results are consistent with the reminders
possibly having heterogeneous impacts on beliefs for different groups. For example, the
reminders may have increased perceived costs of filing for individuals who owed taxes, but may
have increased perceived benefits from filing for individuals who could receive a refund.

Persistence

The effects of the outreach do not appear to have persisted to the next year. Table 7 presents the
fractions filing 2014 tax returns for the treatment and control groups of the 2014 RCT. These tax
returns were filed during the 2015 filing season, one year after the treatment mailing from the
2014 RCT had been sent out. These results indicate that the filing rates for 2014 tax returns are
virtually identical across the treatment and control groups. Furthermore, these results
demonstrate that there was no evidence of persistence even among individuals who filed 2013
tax returns during the 2014 filing season, owed taxes on these returns, or received refunds on


that filed without any qualifying children. Many prior-year returns were filed without a qualifying child, and they
had been predicted to not be associated with a qualifying child. Appendix Table 2 examines predicted income and
income reported on filed tax returns. Overall, there was a strong positive correlation between predicted income and
total income reported on tax returns, but there was also significant variation in total income beyond the variation in
gross income. These could be driven, for example, by unobserved spousal income and unobserved self-employment
income. Comparing predicted wage amounts and wage amounts reported on the 1040s indicates that predicted
wages explained more of the variation in 1040 wages than gross income did with total income. However, there was
still significant variation in wages reported on 1040s beyond the variation in predicted wages.
these returns. Moreover, there is little evidence of persistence even among individuals who had a
tax preparer.

We also note that it is useful to consider the magnitudes of the treatment effects and standard
errors when examining persistence. Table 7 indicates that the standard error for the difference in
filing rates for TY2014 tax returns is 0.002. With this standard error, we have statistical power to
detect a difference of 0.004. Table 2 indicates that the treatment effect on filing TY2013 tax
returns is 0.010. Thus, the standard error in Table 7 suggests that less than 40% (0.004 out of
0.010) of the treatment effect persisted into the following year. We conclude that the IRS
reminders were effective at increasing filing only in the year that they were sent out, and
subsequently there is essentially almost complete recidivism into pre-treatment behaviors. This is
consistent with the effects of other tax notices also fading out in subsequent years (see Manoli
and Turner 2015).

Heterogeneity

We next turn to examining heterogeneity in the filing rates and treatment effects across multiple
dimensions. This analysis of heterogeneity allows for a further characterization of inattention as
the potential mechanism behind nonfiling and responses to the experimental treatment. In
particular, we examine heterogeneity along the following dimensions: potential EITC benefits
from unfiled tax returns, gross income on unfiled returns, and filing histories. Figure 5 presents
the analysis of heterogeneity along these dimensions. In particular, these figures present separate
series of filing rates for the treatment and control groups across these dimensions of
heterogeneity.

Panel A indicates that, with the exception of slightly lower filing rates at very low or very high
potential benefit amounts, baseline filing rates for the control group are mostly stable across
potential benefit amounts. Additionally, at most levels of potential benefits, the treatment group
had slightly higher filing rates, and the difference between the treatment and control group is
relatively stable across potential benefit amounts. If individuals were at least partially attentive to
their potential EITC benefit amounts , we would expect to see an increase in the baseline filing
rates for the control group as actual benefit levels increase. Furthermore, if the treatment
reminded them to claim those potential benefits, we would expect to see larger differences
between the treatment and control groups at higher potential benefit levels. The relatively stable
differences between the treatment and control groups across potential benefit levels suggests that
the treatment did not impact beliefs about the potential benefit but instead increased attention to
the requirement to file or the opportunity to receive a refund. 7

Panel B presents filing results across gross income amounts from unfiled returns. Filing rates for
the control group appear to increase slightly with gross income, and the treatment group has
higher filing rates at each income level. The differences between the treatment and control

7
  The patterns in Panel A are also consistent with individuals knowing their potential benefits for current-year
returns and these potential benefits being uncorrelated with potential benefits from unfiled prior-year returns.
However, the patterns in Panel A could also be explained by measurement error in potential benefits from unfiled
returns so that potential benefits are unrelated to true benefits from unfiled returns. Because some forms of income
are unobserved (e.g. cash income), we cannot definitely rule these alternative hypotheses out.
groups appear relatively stable across gross income levels. Thus, although higher-income
nonfilers may be more attentive to filing (possibly because they are more likely to be required to
file), the reminders appear to affect inattention equally across lower- and higher-income
nonfilers.

Heterogeneity related to filing history also speaks to the nature of inattention among lower-
income nonfilers. If lower-income nonfilers with limited filing histories are particularly
inattentive, we might expect 1) a positive relationship between the number of past returns filed
and the likelihood of filing and 2) a positive relationship between the number of past returns filed
and responses to the treatment. Panel C presents filing rates for the experimental sample broken
down by different filing histories based on TY2001 through TY2010 tax returns. The fact that
baseline filing rates increase with the number of past returns filed suggests that individuals with
more complete filing histories are more attentive to benefits from tax filing. The plot also shows
that, while there are minimal differences between the treatment and control groups, the
differences in filing rates are relatively stable in cases where at least five past returns were filed.
Thus, it appears that the experimental outreach reduced inattention relatively equally across
groups that had a consistent but incomplete connection to the tax system, but not so much for
groups with minimal or no previous connection with the tax system. (The latter group may be
making an attentive decision not to file.)

2. 2015 RCT

Repeated Reminders

Table 8 presents the results from the 2015 recidivism RCT. A first result from the 2015 follow-
up outreach is that a single postcard increased filing and EITC participation, even though the
sample population all filed a 2013 return in the prior year. Viewed from the perspective of
nonfiling instead of filing, the results for the control group indicate that roughly 47% of the 2013
filers recidivate into nonfiling, and the treatment reduced this recidivism by 4% to 43%.
Moreover, the results for the 2014 and 2015 treatment and control groups indicate that there were
no statistically significant differences in the effects of the 2015 outreach based on whether or not
individuals also received treatment in 2014. The effect of the period 2 reminder did not diminish
based on having received a previous reminder. Thus, relating to the third implication in the
conceptual framework, repeated reminders appear more effective than one-time reminders.

Recency Effects & Heterogeneous Responses to Reminders

Next, we examine differences in baseline likelihoods of filing 2014 returns and heterogeneity in
the responses to the 2015 treatment based on outcomes from filing the 2013 return. These results
relate to the fourth and fifth implications in the conceptual framework.

Figure 6 presents graphical evidence on possible recency effects and heterogeneous treatment
effects. In particular, the figures plot the likelihood of filing a TY2014 tax return after having a
balance due on the TY2013 tax return. Panel A presents the evidence for the full 2015 RCT
sample. To account for differences driven by self-employed individuals, Panel B plots the filing
patterns for individuals who did not have any self-employment income on the TY2013 tax
returns. Lastly, to account for differences in income and household differences, Panel C presents
covariate-adjusted filing patterns for people with no self-employment income on their TY2013
tax returns. 8 These figures highlight noticeable declines in the likelihood of filing as the prior-
year balance due increases. 9

In their belief adjustment model, Hogarth and Einhorn (1992) distinguish between step-by-step
and end-of-sequence information processing modes. We note that tax-filing may fall in the end-
of-sequence processing mode because individuals working with a tax preparer or preparing their
own returns with tax software may only focus on the bottom line refund or balance due on their
tax returns. Hence, the tax-filing setting may be conducive to involving recency effects, and the
evidence presented in Figure 6 would be consistent with this intuition.

Consistent with the graphical evidence in Figure 6, Table 8 shows that the 2015 outreach appears
to have been particularly effective at reducing recidivism for individuals who had a balance due
on their 2013 tax return. From the perspective of nonfiling, roughly 52% of individuals who had
a balance due on the 2013 return recidivated into nonfiling, but the treatment reduced this
recidivism to about 42%. The results for the control group show that individuals with a balance
due had a higher likelihood of recidivating into nonfiling. This is consistent with a recency effect
and tax aversion. Intuitively individuals may use their most recent past experience paying a
balance due to forecast their current tax situation, and then they may seek to avoid paying a
perceived balance due by not filing a tax return.

 The treatment effects in Table 8 for those who previously received refunds versus those who
paid a balance due are consistent with heterogeneous treatment effects. The reminders may have
increased attention to potential benefits of filing for those who previously received refunds, and
the reminders may have increased attention to potential penalties for not filing for those who had
a balance due.

The results in Table 8 also indicate that reminders appear to have been more effective among
individuals who used a paid tax preparer to file their 2013 return. Among individuals in the
control group, filing rates were similar across individuals who did or did not have a preparer in
the previous year. This indicates that tax preparers themselves may not be effective at reducing
recidivism among this population. However, comparing the differences between the treatment
and control groups for individuals who did and did not have a tax preparer in the previous year
indicates that, not only did the treatment increase filing for both groups, but the increase was
almost twice as large for individuals who used a tax preparer than for those who had self-
prepared returns.


8
  The covariate-adjusted filing patterns are obtained via the following steps. First, we regress an indicator for filing a
TY2014 return on dummies for filing status, number of EITC qualifying children, having a paid tax preparer, deciles
of total wage income, and deciles of total income. Next, we obtain the residuals from this regression and add the
mean probability of filing a TY2014 return to the residuals. Finally, we created bins based on TY2013 balance due
amounts and then computed the means of the residuals within the bins. Figure 6 Panel C plots the mean residuals by
the balance due bins.
9
  The graphical evidence should not be interpreted in terms of a regression discontinuity; as indicated by the plotted
frequencies in Appendix Figure 1, most individuals receive a refund or have a zero balance due because of
withholdings and refundable tax credits.
Table 9 presents an analysis of characteristics of 2014 returns filed by the treatment and control
groups, and also for the subsample of returns who paid a balance due on the previous year’s
return. Similar to the 2014 RCT, the results in Table 9 indicate that the treatment did not induce
filing among any particular group with specific tax characteristics on their 2014 tax returns.

Building on this intuition, Figure 7 plots the fraction of individuals getting a tax refund on their
TY2014 tax return conditional on filing these returns against the balance due on their TY2013
tax returns. The graph shows that the fractions do not differ noticeably between the treatment and
control groups. Moreover, while there is a noticeable decline in the likelihood of getting a refund
for those who previously had a balance due, roughly 50% of those who had a balance due on
their TY2013 returns received a tax refund on their TY2014 returns. This highlights that tax
situations for the experimental sample appear to change significantly from year to year so that
many individuals who previously owed a balance due last year may qualify for a refund in the
current year. Thus, if individuals have recency effects in their beliefs about their current tax
situations based on their most recent filing, it may be erroneous for them to conclude that they
are likely to owe a balance due in the current year simply because they owed a balance due in the
previous year. Moreover, the possible recency effects also highlight that EITC-eligibile
individuals may move toward nonfiling if they previously fail to claim EITC benefits that could
have more than offset the balance due on the return.

V. Conclusions

The primary goal of this study has been to provide insights into inattention, reminders and
recidivism using a setting of the annual tax-filing decision. We summarize the broad results from
the two field experiments conducted by the IRS as follows. First, reminders reduce inattention
and increase tax filing. Second, in this setting with annual decisions, reminders to file in a given
year have impacts on filing in that year only (i.e. impacts do not persist to future years). Third,
repeated reminders reduce recidivism and generate increased attention to tax-filing to the same
degree as the first reminder. Fourth, individuals appear to be influenced by past experiences
(especially negative ones), and individuals’ receptiveness to reminders appears to be affected by
these past experiences. These results contribute to the literatures on consumer choice, behavioral
economics and tax policy. Even though we acknowledge that results and intuitions from this
analysis may be specific to lower-income nonfilers studied here, many of them can also apply to
the population more broadly. Individuals who did not file tax returns despite having income may
be more likely to be inattentive or receptive to reminders than the population of individuals who
regularly file tax returns each year. Nonetheless, the population of low-income nonfilers is large
enough that there are potentially billions of dollars of tax refunds and tax revenue at stake.

While the current research has examined inattention with individual-level treatments, future
research may examine inattention in a social context and consider the role of peer influence. For
example, advertising reminders to broad populations may reduce inattention more effectively
than individual-level reminders because individuals may discuss the ad thereby reminding one
another about the need to take a given action. On the other hand, advertising reminders to broad
populations may be less effective than individual-level reminders if individuals are not attentive
to impersonal messaging or if they are not attentive to transmitting reminders to peers.
Future research may also explore conditions under which third parties can address inattention
using peer influence and social context. For example, tax preparation firms, employers, or
information return issuers (such as banks or universities) could provide reminders about filing
requirements and/or tax benefits each time they have contact with those individuals. Similarly, as
Cushing and Ahlawat (1996) demonstrate in the context of a firm’s financial auditing decisions,
future research may test if it is possible to alleviate or mitigate recency effects by providing step-
by-step processing, documentation or checklists that increase tax comprehension and draw
attention away from just the bottom line of tax refunds or balances owed.

Notes: The sample size for Panel A, Panel B and Panel C are 360,352, 98,065, and 145,725, respectively. The sample
in Panel B consists of treated individuals who only received postcards or brochures (ie the individuals in the Early
Postcard + Lat Brochure and Early Brochure + Late Postcard treatments are omitted). In Panel A, the filing rate fo
the control group is the same across treatment groups since all of the treatment groups are compared to the
control group that did not receive any experimental mailings.

Notes: The filing hazard at a given point in time is defined as the probability of filing a tax at
that time conditional on not having filed earlier. For each group, the hazard rate at a given time
is computed as the number of individuals who file a return on that date divided by the number
individuals in the group who have not filed a return prior to that date. The Post Date refers to
the calendar week that the tax return is posted to the IRS database.
