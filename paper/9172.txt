                                            ABSTRACT

Although there is a sizeable literature on the effect of private school attendance on academic student
outcomes, the number of studies that investigate the impact of school sector on non-academic outcomes
is limited. Using a rich data set, we analyze the impact of Catholic school attendance on the likelihood
that teenagers use or sell drugs, commit property crime, have sex, join gangs, attempt suicide, and
run away from home. We employ propensity score matching methods to control for the endogeneity
of school choice. Catholic school attendance reduces the propensity to use cocaine and to have sex
for female students. However, it increases the propensity to use and sell drugs for male students.

      Catholic Schools and Bad Behavior: A Propensity Score Matching Analysis



I.       Introduction

         The academic performance of K-12 public schools has become a central issue in

American politics both at the local and federal level.1 One important policy proposal

towards improving academic outcomes is to enhance competition between public and

private schools through vouchers and other vehicles.2 The policy rationale for this

“school choice” argument is that vouchers would increase the demand for private

schooling, which in turn would put pressure on public schools to improve their quality.

Implicit in this proposal is the notion that private schools are more effective in improving

student academic outcomes in comparison to public schools.3 A large literature has

emerged to investigate the validity of this hypothesis (e.g. Altonji, Taber and Elder 2001,

Figlio and Stone 2000, Neal 1997, Goldhaber 1996, Evans and Schwab 1995, Sander

1996, and Sander and Krautman 1995). This literature analyzes whether students in

Catholic (and other private) schools perform better on standardized exams, are more



1
  The average American student does not perform well on standardized tests in comparison to students from
other countries. For example, the U.S. ranks 18th in the world on 8th grade science tests, and it ranks 19th in
8th grade math (U.S. Department of Education 2000). The issue is important because there is evidence
linking students’ academic performance to their future success in the labor market (Murnane et al. 1995).
Furthermore, at the aggregate level, there is evidence indicating that education quality of the labor force has
a positive impact on economic growth (Hanushek and Kimko 2000).
2
  In response to a question on vouchers in the third Presidential debate, President George W. Bush stated
that “…[federal money] will go to the parent so the student can go to a tutoring program, or another public
school, or a private school.” A number of voucher programs have been implemented since mid-1990s
(Peterson et al. 2001).
3
  Because vouchers are used mostly for religious private schools, a heated public debate has emerged
regarding the constitutionality of the voucher programs. More precisely, the issue of whether public money
can be used to enroll at sectarian schools and whether this is a violation of the First Amendment’s
prohibition against the “establishment” of religion has been debated at various state courts as well as the
Supreme Court of the United States (Lane 2002, Canedy 2002).

likely to graduate from high school, and/or immediately enroll in college in comparison

to students in public schools.

           Although there exists evidence regarding the positive impact of Catholic

schooling on academic outcomes (e.g. Evans and Schwab 1995, Eide, Goldhaber and

Showalter 2004), some papers report mixed results or no impact of Catholic schools (e.g.

Neal 1997, Sander 1996).4 If private schools generate better academic outcomes than

their public counterparts, it is conceivable that they also produce more favorable non-

academic outcomes for their students. That is, if the academic environment of the school

has an impact on the non-academic behavior of the student, then it is possible that private

schools have a differential impact on student behavior, such as criminal activity. The

issue is important because if school type has an influence on non-academic student

behavior, it would constitute another dimension of the current school choice debate for

two reasons. First, risky behavior of youths such as juvenile crime and teenage sexual

activity entails social costs, including the financial burden put on the welfare and criminal

justice systems. Second, they have ramifications for the future well-being of the

individual involved. For example, Mocan, Billups and Overland (2005) show that

current criminal activity makes future criminal activity more likely by increasing criminal

human capital and depreciating legal human capital. Bound and Freeman (1992) and

Freeman and Rodgers (2000) document a negative relationship between youth criminal

record and labor market outcomes. In addition, there is evidence indicating that teenage

risky behaviors are complements, which implies that there may be positive spillover

effects from curtailing risky activities (Dee 1999).

                                                    2
       Research on the impact of school type on non-academic outcomes, such as risky

behavior, is not as extensive even though schools are generally evaluated not only on

their effectiveness in academic learning but also on their ability to promote healthy social

and psychological development of the youth (Watt 2003). Belfield (2003) finds a strong

positive association between Catholic school attendance and community service

participation, civic skills, political knowledge and tolerance using data from the National

Household Education Survey of 1999. Bettinger and Slonim (2005) investigate the

effect of vouchers on students’ altruistic behavior, exploiting data from an Ohio school

voucher lottery. They find that students attending private schools (all Catholic in their

sample), after being randomly assigned to these schools through a lottery, tend to give

more to charity in experiments. They also find that this private school treatment effect

has no impact on the amount children give to other students.

       Angrist et al. (2002) use data from a Columbia voucher lottery to examine the

effects on a number of academic and non-academic outcomes three years after the

random assignment. They find that students who attend private schools as a result of

winning the lottery have higher educational attainment and higher scores on achievement

tests. The authors also find some evidence suggesting that voucher winners worked less

than the losers and were less likely to marry or cohabit as teenagers. In a follow-up

study, Angrist, Bettinger, and Kremer (2005) look at the long-term educational

consequences of these vouchers. They find that lottery winners have substantially higher

high school graduation rates and test scores than losers seven years after the randomized

experiment.




                                             3
        Watt (2003) finds no evidence to indicate that small and/or private schools are

better suited for adolescents’ emotional well-being using data from the Add Health,

refuting the notion that these schools offer a unique sense of community that is conducive

to the emotional adjustment of adolescents. In fact, the findings suggest that attending

small and private schools cause higher levels of depression and a greater likelihood of

suicide attempts among males and cause higher likelihood of use or threat or use of

weapons among both males and females. However, it is not clear whether a causal link

between small and private schools and adolescent outcomes is identified because of

standard endogeneity problems.

        Using data from Great Britain, Thornton (1998) suggests that one in ten students

in private schools use drugs, and many independent schools are unaware of the extent of

drug and alcohol abuse among their students. Figlio and Ludwig (1999) examine the

effects of private religious schooling on adolescent non-market behaviors using data from

the National Education Longitudinal Survey of 1988. They use instrumental variables to

account for unobserved heterogeneity, and find that private religious schools reduce

adolescent sexual activity, arrests, and the use of cocaine. They find no consistent

evidence that these schools have any effect on drinking, marijuana use, gang

involvement, or smoking. Valois et al. (1997) examine a number of health risk behaviors

among public and private high school students in South Carolina. They find that

attending a private high school does not necessarily have an impact on adolescent risky

behavior. In particular, private high school students, compared to public school students,

were more likely to report higher rates of alcohol use, drinking and driving, binge

drinking, smoking, marijuana use, and use of alcohol and other drugs before sexual




                                             4
intercourse. Along the same lines, Sander (1998, 1999) suggests that Catholic schools

are not more effective than public schools in reducing marijuana, alcohol abuse, or

smoking.

       In this paper we employ the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health

data set (Add Health) to investigate whether school type has an impact on youth risky

behavior, and we analyze the impact of attending a Catholic school on 13 different risky

behaviors, ranging from using cocaine use to gang fights. We focus on the Catholic

school-public school distinction because the number of students in non-Catholic private

schools is not large enough in the data set to conduct a meaningful analysis for this

group. However, this is not a major shortcoming because Catholic schools students

constitute about 49 percent of all private school enrollment (U.S. Department of

Education, 2000). Furthermore, most of the research on the impact of school choice has

focused on Catholic school-public school differences.

       We control for the endogeneity of school choice by employing propensity score

matching estimators. We find that Catholic schooling has the opposite effect on the

behavior of male and female students. Catholic schooling has a positive influence on the

propensity to use and to sell drugs for male students, but it reduces the extent of cocaine

use and sexual activity of female students.

       The paper is organized as follows. In Section II we discuss the conceptual issues

of risky teenage behavior and selection of school type, and describe the propensity score

matching methods. In Section III, we introduce the data set used in the analyses. Section

IV discusses the propensity score matching procedure and reports the results. Section V

concludes the paper.




                                              5
II.     Conceptual Issues and Empirical Specifications

         There exists research to suggest that teens may be poor decision makers. For

example, Halpern-Felsher and Cauffman (2000) find that adults consistently outperform

teens on measures of decision-making competence regarding the long term benefits and

costs of interventions such as cosmetic surgery. On the other hand, some analysts report

that youths and adults react similarly regarding the perceived consequences of risky

behavior (e.g. Beyth-Marom et al., 1993). Recent research in economics has

demonstrated that youths respond to prices and incentives as predicted by economic

theory (e.g. Harbaugh, Mocan and Visser 2006, Mocan and Rees 2005, William et al.

2002, Gruber and Zinman 2001, Grossman and Saffer 1987). Even though youths may

have different risk-aversion and time discount rates than adults, they are not irrational or

emotional decision makers (Gruber 2001). As a result, there is room for public policy to

influence their behavior by implementing policies that alter prices and incentives.

         Behavioral change may also be accomplished by education if education can alter

tastes towards risky behavior, or if education can provide information regarding future

costs of risky behavior.5 Figlio and Ludwig (1999) list a number of reasons why Catholic

schools may be relatively more effective than public schools in this regard. First,

religious instruction in Catholic schools may change the preferences of teens for certain

activities. Second, Catholic schools may tend to offer more strict discipline than public

schools. Third, Catholic schools, given that they can more easily regulate who attends,



5
  Tastes can also be influenced by other factors such as peers, culture, and role models. For a discussion of
the application of behavioral economics to theoretical models of the risky behavior of teens, see
O’Donoghue and Rabin (2001).


                                                      6
may offer a better peer group than public schools on average.6 Of course, a counter-

argument can be made to argue that the strict discipline and related environment of

Catholic schools may generate unintended consequences such as rebellion and bad

behavior associated with it.

         The investigation of the effect of Catholic school attendance on student outcomes

(academic as well as non-academic) is complicated by empirical difficulties. It is

important to control for family and child heterogeneity that may influence both school

choice and risky behavior. For example, if parents who put a high value on education

tend to send their children to Catholic schools, and if this unobservable parental attribute

has an impact on the outcome of the child, then the correlation between Catholic

schooling and student outcomes may be attributable to this unobservable family

characteristic. Alternatively, negative selection into Catholic schooling may exist. That

is, children with higher unobserved probability of undertaking risky activities could be

more likely to attend Catholic schools. This is because teens with pre-existing behavioral

problems (unobserved to the researchers) may be sent to Catholic schools because their

parents may believe that these children are more likely to benefit from the added religious

instruction and any extra discipline offered in Catholic schools. Under this scenario,

unobserved attributes which make Catholic school choice more likely are positively

correlated with the teen’s risky behavior, and single equation estimates of the effect of

Catholic schooling on risky behavior would be biased toward finding a positive

relationship between Catholic schooling and risky behavior.




6
 Figlio and Ludwig (1999) list other reasons including an “incapacitation” effect, as students in Catholic
schools are assigned more homework and participate in more extracurricular activities. Thus, students in


                                                     7
         Our empirical strategy is designed to address these issues. Consider Equation (1)

         (1)      Yi = β0 + β1Di + Xi’β2 + εi,

where Yi is a dichotomous indicator of risky behavior for the student i, X is a vector of

socio-demographic and other characteristics of the family and the student, and D is an

indicator variable for Catholic school attendance.

         As discussed above, the propensity to enroll in a Catholic private school (D=1) is

likely to be correlated with factors that influence the propensity for risky behavior of the

student (ε). One solution for this endogeneity issue is to find an instrument that explains

the tendency for Catholic school attendance, but does not have a direct impact on the

teen’s propensity to engage in risky behavior. In analyses of the impact of Catholic

schooling on academic outcomes, researchers used as instruments the religious beliefs of

the student or family (Coleman, Hoffer, Kilgore, 1982; Noell, 1982; Evans and Schwab,

1995, Neal, 1997), measures of the availability of Catholic schooling — the proportion of

Catholics in the area, proximity of Catholic schooling, urbanity (Evans and Schwab,

1995; Goldhaber, 1996; Neal, 1997), and interactions between religious beliefs and

urbanity (Sander and Krautman, 1995; Sander 1996). In our case, these might not be

desirable instruments because religious affiliation, religiosity of the area, and urbanity

may also impact the propensity to engage in risky behavior.

         To address the potential bias due to unobserved heterogeneity, we use propensity

matching estimators, first introduced by Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983). Traditional

matching and propensity score matching methods have been increasingly employed in

economics (Benjamin 2003, Zhao 2005, Dehejia and Wahba 2002, Heckman, Ichimura,



Catholic schools may have less time available to devote to risky activities.


                                                      8
and Todd 1997, 1998, Hahn 1998, Lechner 2002, Smith and Todd 2005, Jalan and

Ravallion 2003, Mueser, Troske, and Gorislavsky 2005).7 In traditional matching

estimators, each treatment unit (Catholic school students in our context) is matched to a

fixed number of units with the opposite treatment (non-Catholic school students) under

the assumptions of unconfoundedness (conditional independence) and common support,

which can be formally expressed as

        (Yi=0, Yi=1) ┴ Di | X i, where only Yi=1 or Yi=0 is observed (the student

engages in risky activity, or does not engage in risky activity); and

        0< Pr(Di = 1 | X i) < 1.

Unconfoundedness assumption implies that the treatment (Catholic school attendance) is

random conditional on some set of observed characteristics (X). This allows for

“selection on observables.” The common support assumption guarantees that each

treated unit (a student in a Catholic school) can be matched with a corresponding control

unit (a student attending a public school). The average treatment effect is then calculated

as the mean within-match difference in the outcome variable between the treated and

untreated units. Unlike regression techniques, matching estimators do not impose any

functional form restrictions, nor do they assume a homogenous treatment effect across

populations (Zhao 2005).

        The application of matching methods becomes impractical and difficult to

implement when the set of covariates gets large. For example, in case of n dichotomous

covariates, there are 2n possible cells over which the difference in the outcomes for the

and Statistics.


                                                  9
treatment and controls units needs to be calculated. Obviously, the problem gets worse if

some of the covariates are continuous.

       One way of dealing with the dimensionality problem is to use a propensity score

method, introduced by Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983), who showed that confoundedness

and common support assumptions imply

       (Yi=0, Yi=1) ┴ Di | p(X i),     and

       0< Pr(Di = 1 | p(X i)) < 1,

where p(X i) is the propensity score, defined as the probability of receiving treatment

(attending a Catholic school) conditional on X. Therefore, if (Yi=0, Yi=1) and D i are

independent conditional on X i, then they are also independent on the propensity score

p(X i). This reduces the dimensionality of the matching problem to a single dimension,

p(X i). The intuition is that, whereas one conditions on X in traditional matching

estimators, in propensity score matching estimators one conditions on the propensity

score, because observations with the same propensity score have the same distribution of

the full vector of covariates, X (Dehejia and Wahba 1999).

       In practice, the propensity score matching estimator is implemented in two steps.

The first step involves estimation of the propensity score using a binary choice model,

such as a logistic regression. Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) defines a propensity score as

a function of the vector X, such that Xi ┴ Di | p(X i), i.e., conditional on the propensity

score, the covariates are independent of assignment of treatment. Therefore, for

observations with the same propensity score, the distribution of covariates should be the

same across the treatment and comparison groups (Dehejia and Wahba 1999).




                                              10
          The choice of the vector X and the functional form are determined by whether the

estimated propensity score satisfies the Balancing Property Hypothesis, i.e.

Xi ┴ Di | p(X i). To test the Balancing Property Hypothesis, we divide the sample in k

equally spaced groups defined over the estimated propensity score and check whether the

average propensity score of the treatment and control units differ within each group

(Dehejia and Wahba 1999, 2002, Becker and Ichino 2002). If there are significant

differences in the average propensity score between treatment and control units in at least

one group, we split the group in half and repeat the test. We continue this process until

the average propensity score of treatment and control units do not differ in any group.

We then test the means of each variable in X between treatment and control units. If this

test fails, we try again with the inclusion of higher order terms and interactions of

covariates to the model until this condition is satisfied. Following Becker and Ichino

(2002), we restrict this algorithm to only those observations where the propensity score

belongs to the intersection of the supports of the propensity score of treatment and control

units. Becker and Ichino (2002) suggest that imposing the common support condition

this way may improve the quality of the matches used to estimate the average effects of

treatment on the treated (ATT).

          The second step involves estimating a univariate nonparametric regression to

evaluate the average effect of treatment on the treated (ATT), which can be specified as

follows

          (2)          E(∆i | D i = 1) = E{(Yi=0, Yi=1) | D i = 1}

                      = E{E{(Yi=0, Yi=1) | D i = 1, p(X i)}}

                      = E{E{Yi =1 | D i = 1, p(X i)} - E{E{Yi =0 | D i = 0, p(X i)}| D i = 1}.




                                              11
       Following Dehejia and Wahba (2002) and Leuven and Sianesi (2003), we employ

a range of methods to evaluate the ATT. First, we consider nearest neighbor matching

without replacement. Rosenbaum (1995) argues that the results can be sensitive to the

order in which treatment units and control units are matched. Therefore we consider both

“low-to-high” and “high-to-low” matching. In these methods, the treatment units are

ranked from lowest to the highest or from highest to lowest propensity score. The highest

ranked treatment unit is matched first to a control unit and then that particular comparison

unit is removed from further matching (Dehejia and Wahba 2002).

       Second, we employ nearest neighbor matching with replacement. Matching with

replacement can minimize the propensity score distance between the matched control

units and therefore can reduce bias because each treatment unit can be matched to the

nearest control unit even if a control unit is used multiple times (Dehejia and Wahba

2002). Third, we use a radius matching estimator with a range of calipers. In radius

matching, all control units with the propensity score within a certain radius from the

propensity score of the treatment unit are matched.

       For each of these methods, we estimate a weighted regression using the control

and treatment units where the control units are weighted by the number of times that they

are matched to a treatment unit. Estimating a regression can improve the precision of the

estimates (Dehejia and Wahba 2002).

       It should be noted that the propensity score matching procedure is not a magic

bullet. It is reliable to the extent that students’ unobservable attributes, which make them

more or less likely to attend a Catholic school, do not directly influence their behavior.

(An example for such an unobservable is the convenience, such as the distance between




                                             12
home and a Catholic school). Standard problems of bias remain if unobservable that

influence affect Catholic school attendance also influence the outcome.



III.     Data

         The data used in the paper are drawn from Wave I of the National Longitudinal

Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health).8 The Add Health is a nationally representative

survey of adolescents in grades 7 through 12. It is considered the largest and most

comprehensive survey of adolescents ever undertaken in the United States. It was

designed to provide detailed information on teen behavior, including their criminal and

sexual activities and substance use/abuse. The full sample from Wave I consists of

20,745 adolescents interviewed between April and December 1995. We select a

subsample consisting of teens attending a Catholic or public school in an urban area.9

         The survey contains a section with detailed questions about one’s delinquent

behavior. Specifically, the respondents were asked whether they had committed any of

the following acts in the past 12 months: damaging property, robbery, burglary,

  We exclude teens in rural areas for two reasons: (1) to be consistent with Figlio and Ludwig (1999), and
(2) no Catholic school students were observed to be residing outside of an MSA.


                                                    13
participating in a gang fight, running away from home, selling drugs, or stealing

something worth more than fifty dollars. Teens also answered questions about whether

they had ever used different types of illicit drugs such as marijuana, cocaine, hard drugs

(heroin, LSD, ecstasy, mushrooms, etc.), or ever injected illegal drugs with a needle.

Finally, they were asked about their sexual behavior and whether they had attempted

suicide in the 12 months prior to the interview date.

       For sections that involve sensitive information, such as delinquent behavior, the

respondent listened to pre-recorded questions through earphones and entered their

answers directly on a laptop computer to minimize potential interviewer and parental

influences. Turner, et al. (1998) provide evidence that this computer-based method leads

to a significantly higher incidence of reported risky activities relative to other survey

methods.

       When selecting a list of controls variables, it is important to condition only on

variables that are strictly exogenous. Any variable that is correlated with both Catholic

school attendance and risky behavior may induce bias in the estimates. Keeping this in

mind, we include the following variables: binary indicators for age, gender, race and

ethnicity of the respondent, whether the parents receive public assistance, mother’s

education, whether parents are Catholic, marital status of the parents, and whether the

school is in an urban location. After selecting teens based on these criteria and

excluding cases with missing data, we have a sample of 11,437 adolescents.

       The definitions of the variables are provided in Table 1. The upper panel of Table

2 presents the means for the outcome variables for the full sample as well as for students

in Catholic and public schools. A star next to the mean value of the variable under the



                                             14
public school column indicates that the means are different between Catholic and public

schools for that variable. We note that students in Catholic schools are more likely to

have engaged in most of the risky behaviors under study. Specifically, Catholic school

students are more likely to have used or sold drugs, or committed property damage or

burglary. On the other hand, Catholic school students are less likely to have had sex.

       The sample characteristics of the explanatory variables are presented in the lower

panel of Table 2. There are significant differences between the Catholic school students

and the public school students. Catholic school students are more likely to be male,

white and non-Hispanic. They are also more likely to have Catholic parents and mothers

with higher education. Their parents are also more likely to be married, and less likely to

be on welfare in comparison to the parents of public school students.



IV. Results

Propensity Score Estimation

       Using the algorithm outlined in Section II, we estimate the propensity score for

our sample, incorporating the covariates linearly and with some higher-order terms in

order to satisfy the balancing property. It has been argued that gender differences in

risky behavior can be attributed to differences in risk aversion (Powell and Ansic 1997),

discount rates (Lau and Williams 1998), and the motivation for security (Schneider and

Lopes 1986). Therefore, we estimate models both for the full sample and for males and

females separately. Table App-1 in the Appendix reports the results from the logistic

regressions that estimate the propensity scores. As shown in the table, the overwhelming




                                            15
majority of covariates are statistically significant determinants of Catholic school

attendance, especially for males.

        As explained above, the procedure starts by splitting the sample in equally spaced

intervals of the propensity score and testing whether the average propensity score of the

catholic school attendants and the public school attendants are equal within each interval.

If the test fails in one of the intervals, the interval is split in half and the test is repeated.

This algorithm generated eight intervals for the whole sample. We also made sure that

the balancing property is satisfied for each of the covariates within each interval. In order

to improve the quality of matches, we imposed the common support condition in the

propensity score estimation. This ensures that each treatment unit has a corresponding

matching unit in the comparison group. Because we also estimate models separately for

males and females, the above conditions are satisfied for males and females separately.

The final number of blocks that satisfies the balancing property is 6 for females and 8 for

males. Table 3 displays the distribution of the number of Catholic and public school

attendants across blocks within the common support region.

        Table 4 reports the results of the balancing property test for the full sample as

well as for the male and females samples. T-statistics pertaining to the differences

between the covariates of the treatment and control groups are listed in each cell. As

shown in Table 4, Catholic school and public school students are identical in their

observed characteristics within each block in overwhelming majority of the cases. For

example, in the full sample, the differences in the means of the covariates between

Catholic and public students are statistically significant at the 5 percent level for only 10

cases out of 154 combinations. The quality of the balances is also very good for the male




                                                16
and female samples. In only seven out of 123 cases for males, and five out of 97 cases

for females, are the covariates statistically significant between the Catholic school

students and public school students.

         The mean propensity score is 0.141 with a standard deviation of 0.110 for

Catholic school students. Public school students have a mean propensity score of 0.035

with a standard deviation of 0.055. Among females, the mean and standard deviations of

the propensity score are 0.095 and 0.073 for Catholic school students, and 0.029 and

0.041 for public school students. For males, the mean and standard deviation are 0.167

and 0.123 for Catholic school students, and 0.044 and 0.067 for public school students.

The fact that the mean estimated propensity scores differ considerably between the

treatment and control groups suggests that the two groups are substantially different in a

multivariate sense, and it reinforces the desirability of sub-classification (Benjamin

2003).



Estimates of the Catholic School Effect on Risky Behavior

          To put the results into perspective we first estimated linear probability models,

where each outcome is a dichotomous indicator of a particular risky behavior. Column

1 of Table 5 reports the estimated coefficients and standard errors of the impact of

Catholic school attendance on each risky behavior in linear probability models for the

full sample as well as the sample of males and females. Each model contains all

variables listed in Table 2. For males, the coefficient of Catholic School is negative in

three cases, and positive in 10. The coefficients are positive and statistically significant

in five bad behavior equations. The coefficients are negative in 8 out of 13 cases for



                                             17
females, but they are never statistically significant. These results are obtained from

regressions which do not control for the endogeneity of school choice; therefore they

are not reliable because of the potential bias due to selection into Catholic schooling as

described in Section II.

         Next, we turn to the propensity score matching estimates that control for selection into

the Catholic schooling. Table 5 presents the estimated treatment effects that emerge from

various methods described in Section II. The estimates for the full sample are presented in the

top panel, and the estimates for the male and female samples are presented in the second and

third panels, respectively. In each panel, columns 2 and 3 depict the estimates obtained from

matching without replacement. Column 4 displays the estimates from matching with

replacement; and columns 5, 6 and 7 present the estimates from radius matching with different

calipers. Following Dehejia and Wahba (2002), we include all the controls linearly in the

weighted regressions. These variables include the binary variables of male, Hispanic, white,

black, Asian, seven age dummies, parental welfare receipt, mother’s education dummies,

parent’s marital status, whether the school is an urban location, and whether the parent is

Catholic.10

         The results are consistent between procedures (columns 2-7). In the full sample, the

coefficient of Catholic school is positive and statistically significant for marijuana, injecting

drugs, burglary and selling drugs, and negative and significant for having sex, and to some



10
  The goal of matching is to choose subsamples of students whose characteristics closely resemble the
characteristics of the Catholic school students. In Appendix Table App-2, we present tests for the equality
between the means of the covariates for the treatment group (Catholic school students) and the control
groups from each matching procedure. As shown in the table, the characteristics of the control samples
obtained from each method are very similar. In fact, they are essentially identical for control group
characteristics from the matching without replacement method (columns 1 and 2). Contrary to the large
mean differences between Catholic school students and public school students in the unmatched (raw) data
as shown in Table 2, the two groups closely resemble each other in Appendix Table App-2.

extent for gang fight. However, the middle and bottom panels of the table reveal that there is a

substantial difference between males and females regarding the impact of Catholic schooling.

Catholic schooling has a negative impact on bad behavior for females, but for males it has a

positive impact. For example, for females, Catholic schools tend to reduce the propensity to

have sex by 11-13 percentage points and the propensity to use cocaine by 5-6 percentage

points. For males, catholic schooling has a positive impact on drug related behavior.

Specifically, Catholic schooling increases the propensity to use cocaine by 4-5 percentage

points, to use marijuana by 8-11 percentage points, to inject drugs by about 2 percentage

points, to use hard drugs by 4-5 percentage points, and to sell drugs by 8-10 percentage points.

In some models, there is a positive impact on the propensity to burglarize (4-5 percentage

points) as well. The gender difference in the impact of Catholic schooling on student bad

behavior is interesting. To the extent that our estimates are not contaminated by endogeneity

of school choice, they suggest that males and females respond differently to the same treatment

(being in a Catholic school): while Catholic schooling reduces the propensity of bad behavior

of female students, it increases it for male students.

           The finding that Catholic schooling decreases the propensity of cocaine use

and sexual activity for female students, but increases the propensity to use and sell drugs

for male students suggests that boys and girls react differently to the Catholic school

environment, which is commonly associated with discipline and structure. This could be

because males may have a more difficult time adopting to their environment. It is

interesting to note that other research has also identified differential response of males

and females to certain “treatments.” For example, Sacerdote (2005) shows that among

Korean children who are adopted by American families, males complete fewer years of




                                              19
schooling, have lower probability of completing four years of college, and they have

lower incomes than females. Male adoptees also have higher propensities of drinking

and being overweight.

        Kling and Liebman (2004), and Kling et al. (2005) analyze data from the Moving

To Opportunity program, where families, mostly female-headed minority households

with children living in high-poverty public housing projects were offered housing

vouchers by lottery. Consistent with our results, these papers find that female and male

youth respond differently to this “treatment.” The intervention had beneficial effects for

females, but adverse effects for males. Specifically, the program reduced the extent of

mental health problems and risky behavior for female youth, but it increased injuries and

substance use for male youth. The authors conclude that male and female youth appear

to respond to their environment in different ways, and provide a number of explanations

that may help explain this outcome, ranging from the possibility that males have less

effective coping strategies in stressful situations, to differential peer effects.

        To demonstrate that our data set is consistent with other databases in one respect,

we investigated the impact of Catholic schooling on the Add Health Picture Vocabulary

Test (AHPVT). At the beginning of the interview, teens were given the AHPVT, which

is a computerized, abridged version of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test. The

AHPVT involves the interviewer reading a word then the respondent selecting the

illustration which best fits the word. We estimated propensity score matching models,

separately for females and males, and found a statistically significant impact on Catholic

schools on the test scores. For males, the estimate of the impact of Catholic school

attendance on AHPVT suggests that all else equal, students in Catholic schools score




                                               20
about 0.16 of a standard deviation higher on this standardized exam than students in

public schools. For females, the effect is larger. Catholic schooling increases the scores

of females students by 0.40 of their standard deviation.

       This result is consistent with the ones reported earlier regarding bad behavior.

That is, the impact of Catholic schooling is more significant for female students than

male students. Catholic schooling reduces the propensity for bad behavior for female

students, while it increases it for male students; and the positive impact of Catholic

schooling on test scores is greater in magnitude for female students than for male

students.


V. Conclusion

       Engaging in risky behaviors can have negative consequences for the current and

future well-being of the individual and his or her family, and these behaviors can also

have negative social consequences through their burdens on the welfare and criminal

justice systems. Although teenage risky behavior can be changed by sanctions and

incentives, another potential tool in this regard is the influence of schooling. In

particular, the analysis of the impact of Catholic school education on teenage risky

behavior is important because of the current school choice debate in the United Sates.

       Using a rich, nationally representative data set, we analyze the impact of Catholic

school attendance on risky behaviors such as using or selling drugs, committing theft,

robbery and burglary, having sex, engaging in gang-related fights, attempting suicide,

and running away from home. We control for the endogeneity of school choice by

employing a variety of propensity score methods. We find that for female teenagers

Catholic schooling leads to a reduction in the propensity to have sex. For males, on the



                                             21
other hand, attending a Catholic school (as opposed to public school) increases the

propensity to use and sell drugs.

  Notes: All matching estimates are regression adjusted using all covariates linearly. The standard errors of the regression adjusted matching estimates are computed using a
  bootstrap with 499 replications. (*) In this specification, the control group includes all non-Catholic school students. Thus these are standard OLS coefficients.
