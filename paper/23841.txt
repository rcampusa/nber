                                          ABSTRACT

House prices and exchange rates can potentially amplify the expansionary effect of capital
inflows by inflating the value of collateral. We first set up a model of collateralized borrowing in
domestic and foreign currency with international financial intermediation in which a change in
leverage of global intermediaries leads to an international credit supply increase. In this
environment, we illustrate how house price increases and exchange rates appreciations contribute
to fueling the boom by inflating the value of collateral. We then document empirically, in a Panel
VAR model for 50 advanced and emerging countries estimated with quarterly data from 1985 to
2012, that an increase in the leverage of US Broker-Dealers also leads to an increase in cross-
border credit flows, a house price and consumption boom, a real exchange rate appreciation and a
current account deterioration consistent with the transmission in the model. Finally, we study the
sensitivity of the consumption and asset price response to such a shock and show that country
differences are associated with the level of the maximum loan-to-value ratio and the share of
foreign currency denominated credit.

1         Introduction
Capital inflows are expansionary and pose difficult challenges for policy makers—see,
for instance, Rey (2013, 2016).1 Historically, however, some economies have been more
sensitive than others to the volatility of capital inflows, with emerging market economies
standing out as particularly vulnerable (e.g. Chari et al., 2017).
    What are the mechanisms through which capital inflows lead to macroeconomic
booms? And what are the characteristics that account for the differences in sensitivity
across countries? In this paper, we explore the role of asset price inflation and credit
market characteristics. Our main finding is that the currency denomination of credit
flows and loan-to-value ratios are associated with the strength of the consumption
response to international credit supply shocks.
    Figure 1 shows that capital inflows are expansionary and associated with large
swings in asset prices.2 The figure shows that, during a boom, cross-border banking
claims and equity prices grow more than 10 percent per year in real terms. GDP,
consumption, and house prices grow about 4-5 percent per year. The current account
balance deteriorates significantly before reverting during the last year of the expansion.
The real exchange rate appreciates during the last two years of the boom phase (both
in real effective terms and vis-a-vis the US dollar), while the economy starts to slow.
Short term real interest rates are hight throughout the boom phase and increase further
during the last year.
    During the bust phase, these dynamics partially revert. Cross-border claims and
house prices fall as fast as they grew during the boom phase for three years in a row.
Equity prices drop very sharply for two consecutive years and, once they rebound, grow
about half as fast as during the boom. GDP growth declines sharply and then resumes,
but only at about a third the pace during the boom years. Consumption slows and
then remains depressed. The current account deficit closes quickly and remains in a
small surplus position. The real exchange rate depreciates sharply, and short term real
interest rates decline, remaining elevated.
        Not all countries behave alike though. For instance, Figure 1 shows that emerging

on the Mundell-Fleming model and Chari et al. (2005) on sudden stops in the neoclassical growth
model.

      Note. The solid line plots the median pattern in whole cross section of countries
      in our sample, together with the median for advanced and emerging markets (dotted
      and dashed lines, respectively) across a set of boom-bust episodes in BIS cross-border
      claims, using a 6-year window, from three year before the peak to three years after
      the peak. In each panel, time 0 is the peak of the boom-bust cycle in cross-border
      bank claims (i.e., the last period of a boom in which cross-border bank claims display
      a positive growth rate), which is also depicted with a vertical line. All variables are
      expressed in percent. See Appendix A and B for more details of the identification of
      the episodes, including summary statistics, and the definition and data sources of the
      variables considered.


economies experience much larger and more persistent boom-bust cycles than advanced
ones (dashed and dotted lines, respectively). But this characterization of heterogeneity
is an over-simplification as countries differ in ways that cannot always be reduced to the
emerging market and advanced economies divide. For example, Figure 2 focuses on a
few selected characteristics of credit markets. While emerging markets (lighter, yellow
bars) tend to have shallower mortgage markets and higher shares of foreign currency
debt than advanced economies (darker, blue bars), maximum LTV limits and home
ownerships are distributed much more evenly. More generally, countries that are now
member of the OECD, like South Korea and Mexico, in the past experienced some
of the wildest capital flow gyrations. At the same time, more advanced economies
like Ireland and other South European countries experienced deeper and longer-lasting
financial crises than most emerging market economies during the global financial crisis.

    In this paper, therefore, we will study differences in experiences with capital inflows
at the country level based on specific characteristics, as opposed to comparing country-
groupings formed from the outset, focusing on variables that have a counterpart in a
fully specified model of international borrowing and lending to help the interpretation
of the empirical findings.
    Traditionally, the analysis of capital flows and their impact on the macroeconomy
distinguished between “push” and “pull” factors (Calvo et al., 1996). The former are
best thought as shocks that originate abroad and lead capital to flow in or out of
individual countries. The latter are domestic shocks that attract foreign capital from
the rest of the world. In this paper, we focus on one particular push shock—a shock
to the international supply of credit. Focusing on a specific shock facilitates isolating
causal effects in the empirical analysis. It also allows us to explore both the transmission
mechanism and the cross-country heterogeneity in more detail from a theoretical point
of view.
    We proceed in three main steps. First, we set up a theoretical model of international
financial intermediation and collateralized borrowing in domestic and foreign currency.

                                                                           4
Second, we identify an international credit supply shock in the data and document its
transmission and relative importance. Third, we study the differential incidence of this
shock across countries considering country characteristics that affect its transmission
in the model.
    Both house prices and the exchange rate can have an amplification effect, by in-
flating the value of collateral and expanding the borrowing capacity of the economy.
These channels of amplification may be more relevant depending on the characteristics
of the credit market. We focus on the maximum loan-to-value ratio and the share of
foreign currency liabilities over total liabilities. We assume that the source of collateral
is residential housing, and borrowing can be denominated in either foreign or domestic
currency. We take both the LTV and the share of foreign currency denominated liabil-
ities as given and study the implications of varying them exogenously across countries.
Housing is usually the largest asset class in households portfolios and it is used as collat-
eral for both mortgage and commercial borrowing. The US dollar remains the dominant
currency in the international financial system with relatively constant portfolio shares
over time.
   The model we use has two main blocks. One block is small, but financially integrated
with the rest of the world. In this economy, households are relatively impatient and
subject to a standard borrowing constraint like in (Kiyotaki and Moore, 1997). The
other block is large and is the source of the global supply of credit. Households of
the foreign economy own international financial intermediaries that operate globally
and channel funds from savers to borrowers. These intermediaries are subject to an
exogenous capital requirement as in Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2014) and He and
Krishnamurthy (2013). A change in the leverage of international financial intermediaries
leads to an increase in the international supply of credit, as we will assume in our
empirical analysis.
    In the model, the shift in the international credit supply leads to a consumption
boom, an appreciation of the real exchange rate, and house prices inflation (while
the expected return on these assets falls), in line with the unconditional evidence we
document in Figure 1. If the collateral constraint is binding, house prices always expand
households’ borrowing capacity in the model. Similarly, when credit is denominated
in foreign currency and the constraint is binding, a real exchange rate appreciation
boosts the borrowing capacity of the economy in foreign currency. Movements in the


                                             5
real exchange rate, however, affect the economy also through two other channels. In
particular, the value of the domestic endowment increases, while the purchasing power
of any new debt declines, if this is denominated in foreign currency. While the collateral
effect of a house price increase is always expansionary, the net effect of the appreciation
is an empirical/quantitative matter.
   Overall, the predictions of the model provide a solid theoretical foundation for our
empirical analysis, even though we make a number of simplifying assumptions to keep
the framework tractable and highlight the key mechanisms at work. The model not
only underpins the identification of our international credit supply shock in the data,
but also highlights specific mechanisms of transmission that are useful to interpret the
evidence we report. The model also helps us select country characteristics that may be
associated with a different sensitivity to such a shock, illustrating that the house price
and exchange rate collateral effects can be stronger the higher the LTV ratio and the
share of foreign currency debt.
    Next, we investigate empirically the transmission and the relative importance of our
international credit supply shock, as well as the cross-country differences in its impact.
We do so by specifying an unbalanced Panel Vector Autoregression model (PVAR) for
50 countries estimated with quarterly data from 1985:Q1 to 2012:Q4.
    Based on the insights from the theoretical model that we develop, we augment the
PVAR model with the leverage of US Broker-Dealers, and then focus on a shock to
this variable. While regulation and financial innovation determine it in the longer-term
(Boz and Mendoza, 2014), over the business cycle several factors, such as monetary
policy, the state of the cycle, and risk appetite can affect the leverage constraint (Rey,
2013, 2016, Forbes et al., 2016). We focus on the cyclical changes and do not take a
stand on the ultimate cause of these shifts. Instead, we investigate their consequences
for the international supply of credit and the transmission to small open economies.
   The PVAR analysis shows that our international credit supply shock triggers a sharp
and persistent increase in cross-border claims, house prices and consumption. The real
exchange rate appreciates and the current account deteriorates. After about five years,
these dynamics revert with some overshooting in line with the event study in Figure
1 and the transmission in the model. Our international credit supply shock is also
an important source of business cycle variation, accounting for variance share of most
variables between 10 and 20 percent depending on the particular model specification.


                                            6
    In the last step of the analysis, we study the sensitivity of the transmission to
country characteristics. The individual country estimates reveal a significant degree of
heterogeneity. Consistent with the predictions of the model, the impact of the shock is
stronger in economies with a larger share of liabilities denominated in foreign currency
and a higher loan-to-value ratio. In the model, both the tightness of the LTV limit and
the share of domestic currency debt can potentially affect the impact of the international
credit supply shock that we identify in the data.
    Our paper relates to three strands of literature. A first set of contributions explore
how US monetary or regulatory policy stance, innovations in the financial system, and
risk taking behavior can affect leverage of international financial intermediaries and the
global financial cycle, both from an empirical (Rey, 2013, 2016, Forbes et al., 2016)
and theoretical (Bruno and Shin, 2015, Boz and Mendoza, 2014) perspective. We take
these ideas one step further and investigate, both empirically and theoretically, possible
mechanisms of transmission to macroeconomic variables and asset prices in individual
countries. We study the next chain in the transmission of such shocks, that is from the
leverage of US Broker-Dealers to macroeconomic dynamics and asset prices in economies
at the receiving end of capital inflows, also exploring the cross-country distribution of
these effects.
    The second strand of the literature we relate to consists of papers that study the role
of international capital flows in fueling the US housing boom and subsequent crash—
see, among others, Justiniano et al. (2015), and Favilukis et al. (2017).3 In this paper,
we explore the role of house prices and exchange rates for the transmission of capital
flow shocks emanating at the center of the international financial system and potentially
affecting the periphery.
   Finally, this paper is also related to the literature on the sensitivity of consumption
to house price and credit shocks. Berger et al. (2015) use US micro data to quantify
the elasticity of consumption to changes in housing wealth. Kaplan et al. (2016) show
that this elasticity depends on the source of the shock moving house prices. Calza et al.
(2013) study how this elasticity depends on the mortgage market structure in a few ad-
vanced economies. We investigate this elasticity in an open-economy setting, in a large
cross section of advanced and emerging economies, focusing on how it is affected by

    Aizenman and Jinjarak (2009) investigate empirically the impact of shocks to house prices for
the current account. See Gete (2009) and Ferrero (2015) for models that rationalize this direction of
causality.

the share of foreign currency debt and the maximum LTV ratio. Almeida et al. (2006)
document empirically how housing prices and mortgage demand respond more to in-
come shocks in countries where households can achieve higher LTV ratios, consistent
with the earlier evidence of Jappelli and Pagano (1989). Our theoretical and empirical
analysis takes a general equilibrium approach. Finally, Mian et al. (2016) document a
cross-country association between household debt and consumption growth. We con-
dition our analysis on a particular source of exogenous variation in consumption—an
international credit supply shock—and uncover a relation between the share of foreign
currency borrowing and the maximum level of the LTV and the consumption sensitivity
to such a shock for the largest panel of countries studied to date for which quarterly
data on house prices are available. The estimated implied elasticity is quantitatively
sizable and estimated precisely.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 sets up the model that we use
to illustrate the nature of the shock and support the VAR identification assumptions.
Section 3 discusses the transmission mechanism. Section 4 presents the Panel VAR
model and reports the response of the typical economy in our cross section to the
identified international credit supply shock. Section 5 investigates the cross-country
sensitivity to LTV levels and the share of foreign currency debt. Finally, Section 7
concludes. The paper’s appendix contains details of the event study described above,
the definition and the sources of all data used in the paper. A supplement (not for
publication) contains all model derivations, additional empirical results and robustness
checks on the PVAR analysis.



2     A Model of International Borrowing and Lending
This section presents a stylized model of international financial intermediation and
collateralized borrowing. The model helps us to identify an international credit supply
shock in the data, to interpret its transmission, and the sensitivity of its effect to country
characteristics.
    The world economy lasts for two periods and consists of two blocks (countries),
Home (H) and Foreign (F), of size n ∈ (0, 1) and 1 − n, respectively. In both periods,
the representative Home and Foreign household receives a country-specific endowment
of non-durable goods, and consumes a bundle of the two tradable goods as well as non-


                                              8
tradable housing services, which are proportional to the stock of housing. For simplicity,
we abstract from construction and assume that housing is in fixed supply, like land. The
two blocks differ in the degree of patience of their representative household. The Home
household is relatively impatient and borrows to purchase housing services subject to a
collateral constraint. The Foreign household saves via deposits and equity holdings in
a global financial intermediary that channels funds to the borrowers and is subject to
a leverage constraint (or, equivalently, a capital requirement).


2.1     Goods Markets
The structure of the goods markets is standard. The representative Home household
consumes a Cobb-Douglas basket of Home and Foreign goods:

                                                      cαH c1−α
                                                           F
                                             c=                 ,                              (1)
                                                  αα (1 − α)1−α

where α ∈ (0, 1) is the steady state share of consumption on Home goods. Following
Sutherland (2005), we assume that the weight of imported goods in the Home con-
sumption basket is a function of the relative size of the foreign economy (1 − n):

                                             α ≡ 1 − (1 − n)λ,

where λ ∈ (0, 1) represents the degree of openness, equal for both countries. This
assumption implies α ∈ (n, 1] and generates home bias in consumption.4
  Expenditure minimization implies that the demand for Home and Foreign goods by
Home households is:
                                  −1                                             −1
                              PH                                               PF
                 cH = α                  c        and       cF = (1 − α)                  c,   (2)
                              P                                                P

where PH and PF are the Home currency prices of the Home and Foreign goods, re-
spectively, and P is the overall price level. These price indexes are related to each other
according to:
                                       P = PHα PF1−α .                                  (3)
  4
    The size of home bias decreases with the degree of openness and disappears when λ = 1. In the
limit for n → 0, the Home block becomes a small open economy. We will study this special case in
details below.


                                                        9
    The consumption bundle of the representative household in the Foreign block cor-
responds to (1), with α∗ ≡ nλ representing the Foreign consumption share of imported
goods. The demand for Home and Foreign goods by the Foreign household are identical
to (2), with the only difference that an asterisk denotes Foreign variables.


2.2    Exchange Rates and Relative Prices
The nominal exchange rate E is defined as the number of units of Home currency
required to buy one unit of Foreign currency, so that an increase of the nominal exchange
rate corresponds to a depreciation of the Home currency. We assume that the law of
one price (LOOP) holds for each good:

                      PH = EPH∗            and           PF = EPF∗ ,                 (4)

where PH∗ and PF∗ are the Foreign currency prices of the Home and Foreign goods,
respectively.
    The terms of trade τ for the Home country represents the price of imports relative
to the price of exports, where both prices are expressed in terms of the Home currency:

                                            EPF∗
                                         τ=      .                                   (5)
                                            PH

An increase in the terms of trade corresponds to a rise in the price of imports relative
to exports for the Home consumer in Home currency, so that Foreign imports become
relatively more expensive. In this sense, an increase in τ represents a deterioration of
the terms of trade for the Home country (i.e. a depreciation). All relative prices are a
function of the terms of trade:

                            pH = τ α−1      and      pF = τ α ,                      (6)

where pk ≡ Pk /P , for k = {H, F }. The same conditions hold for the Foreign country.
   The real exchange rate s is the price of Foreign consumption in terms of Home
consumption:
                                          EP ∗
                                     s≡        .                                 (7)
                                           P
A higher s corresponds to an increase in the price of the Foreign consumption basket


                                            10
relative to the Home consumption basket in terms of the Home currency, and thus to a
depreciation of the real exchange rate. In spite of the LOOP, purchasing power parity
does not hold because of home bias, that is, the real exchange rate is generally different
from one. However, the (log) real exchange rate is proportional to the (log) terms of
trade:
                                EP ∗    EPF∗    pH         ∗
                            s≡       =        × ∗ = τ α−α .                            (8)
                                 P       PH     pF
Therefore, we can characterize the equilibrium indifferently with respect to a single
relative price.


2.3    Home Households
A continuum of measure n ∈ [0, 1] of households populate the Home economy. All
households are identical and relatively impatient. We denote by c1 and c2 their con-
sumption in the two periods. In addition, in period 1, households decide once and for
all the amount of housing services to purchase, which we assume to be proportional to
the housing stock h1 . Lifetime utility therefore is:

                              U = u(c1 ) + βu(c2 ) + v(h1 ),                          (9)

where β ∈ (0, 1) is the individual discount factor. Preferences are risk-neutral with
respect to consumption (i.e. u0 (·) = c̄ > 0), and are increasing and weakly concave with
respect to housing (i.e. v 0 (·) > 0 and v 00 (·) ≤ 0).
   Households are endowed with y units of Home goods in each period and h0 initial
units of housing, and can obtain credit denominated in either Home (b) or Foreign (f )
currency. Thus, the budget constraint in period 1 is:

                           c1 + qh1 − b − s1 f = pH1 y + qh0 ,                       (10)

where q is the relative price of houses in terms of the consumption good, and we have
assumed that the household starts with no credit to repay. In the second period, the
household repays the debt contracted in the first period plus a gross interest rate, so
that the budget constraint is:

                                c2 = pH2 y − Rb b − s2 Rf,                           (11)


                                           11
where Rb and R are the gross interest rates on credit denominated in Home and Foreign
currency, respectively.
   While households (and banks) choose the currency denomination of their credit
portfolio, in this paper, we abstract from this decision and treat the share of foreign
currency denominated credit as given.5 In particular, we will characterize the equilib-
rium in terms of the ratio between credit in Home and Foreign currency:

                                                    b
                                             η≡         ,                                        (12)
                                                   s1 f

so that 1/(1 + η) represents the share of Foreign currency liabilities in total credit from
the perspective of the Home country, which can be measured in the data. If η = 0, the
model corresponds to the limiting case in which all credit is denominated in Foreign
currency. As f decreases, η increases, and in the limit the share of Foreign currency
debt goes to zero.
    Following Kiyotaki and Moore (1997), a collateral constraint limits total debt to a
fraction θ ∈ [0, 1] of the value of housing purchased in period 1:

                                         b + s1 f ≤ θqh1 .                                       (13)

The parameter θ represents a limit that lenders impose on borrowers to mitigate issues
related to asymmetric information. In practice, however, θ is also affected by policy
as in many national housing finance systems regulation mandates the maximum loan-
to-value (LTV) ratio that lenders can offer. Because borrowing is denominated in
foreign-currency, both house prices and the exchange rate enter this constraint. Thus,
equation (13) combines the typical specifications adopted in the housing and the open
economy macroeconomics literatures.
    The Home household maximizes (9) subject to (10), (11), and (13). Let µc̄ be the
Lagrange multiplier on the borrowing constraint, normalized by the marginal utility of
consumption (c̄). The first order conditions for the optimal demand of credit in period
1 in Home and Foreign currency are, respectively:

                                                                              s2
                   1 − µ = βRb                 and              1 − µ = βR       ,               (14)
                                                                              s1
   5
     In Figure D.1 of the supplement we show that, at the country level, the share of foreign currency
liabilities in total liabilities is rather constant over time.


                                                 12
with µ > 0 when b + s1 f = θqh1 . The two expressions in (14) are the consumption
Euler equations under risk neutrality. Under these assumptions, when binding, a tighter
borrowing constraint (i.e., a higher µ) reduces the cost of forgoing consumption today
(or increases the benefits of saving today). No arbitrage requires Home households to
be indifferent between credit denominated in Home and Foreign currencies and yields:

                                                       s2
                                             Rb = R       ,                                       (15)
                                                       s1

which corresponds to the uncovered interest rate parity condition in real terms.6
       The Euler equation for the choice of housing services is:

                                                       v 0 (h1 )
                                       (1 − θµ)q =               ,                                (16)
                                                            c̄

and shows that house prices are higher (i) the higher the maximum LTV ratio θ (ii)
and the tighter the borrowing constraint µ.
    Note here that, all else equal, both the level of the LTV and the tightness of the
borrowing constraint increase housing demand. A higher LTV directly allows for more
borrowing in equation (14) and hence more consumption, including more housing ser-
vices. Similarly, a tighter borrowing constraint (a higher value of the multiplier µ)
increases house prices via higher demand for scarce collateral.7 However, when the col-
lateral constraint is not binding (µ = 0), housing demand is constant and house prices
are equal to their fundamental value, that is the marginal utility of housing in units
of marginal utility of consumption. In this case, the housing market is insulated from
exogenous shocks that affect other parts of the economy.
    The unconditional evidence reported in the previous section suggests that both the
real exchange rate and house prices increase during periods of capital inflows. In our
model, both asset prices can amplify the effects of an international credit supply shock,
but with different mechanisms. An increase in house prices boosts the (Home currency)
value of the collateral and expands the households’ borrowing capacity, thus supporting
   6
      It is well known that the uncovered interest rate parity condition fails in the data, at least in
the short-run. For instance, by using loan-level data for Turkey, Baskaya et al. (2017) document that
persistent differentials in domestic and foreign borrowing costs vary with the global financial cycle.
Salomao and Varela (2017) analyze the implications of UIP failure for the currency composition of
credit. In the model, we abstract from frictions that may lead the UIP to fail.
    7
      This effect is particularly stark in our model because of the assumptions of risk neutrality and
fixed housing supply.


                                                  13
consumption of housing and non housing only when the collateral constraint binds.
This “collateral house price effect” is evident from equation (13), and the mechanism
corresponds to the standard amplification channel associated with house prices in the
closed economy literature (e.g. Kiyotaki and Moore, 1997). Note here that this effect is
stronger the higher is the LTV. When the collateral constraint is not binding, however,
the feedback from house prices to the rest of the economy disappears because of our
simplifying assumptions on housing preferences and technology.
    In contrast, the exchange rate can amplify the effects of an international credit
supply shock independently of whether the collateral constraint is binding or not. When
total borrowing is constrained, equation (13) shows that an exchange rate appreciation
expands the borrowing capacity of the economy like house prices do, but in Foreign
as opposed to Home currency; an effect that we label “collateral exchange rate effect.”
Note here that this effect is stronger the higher the share of foreign currency liability. As
we can see from the budget constraint (10), an appreciation also boosts the purchasing
power of the Home endowment, but it reduces that of any given amount of foreign
currency debt regardless of whether the constraint binds or not.8 We call these two
latter effects “endowment valuation effect”, and “debt valuation effect”, respectively.
Note here again that the debt valuation effect is also increasing in the share of foreign
currency liabilities like the collateral exchange rate effect.
    Both the debt and collateral exchange rate effects become less severe as the share
of foreign currency declines (i.e., η gets bigger). We can see the dependency of the
debt valuation effect on the share of foreign currency credit by rewriting the budget
constraint in terms of η as:

                              c1 + qh1 − (1 + η)s1 f = pH1 y + qh0 .

Similarly, rewriting the borrowing constraint at equality as a function of η, we can see
that collateral exchange rate effect is also declining in η:

                                        (1 + η)s1 f = θqh1 .

In both cases, a higher value of η dampens the effect of an appreciation of the real
   8
    In a fully dynamic setting, the latter effect would trade off the lower purchasing power of a given
amount of debt contracted in the current period with the lower repayment on credit obtained in the
past.


                                                  14
exchange rate (a fall in s1 ) on the purchasing power of a given amount of credit in
Foreign currency f .
    The collateral exchange rate effect reinforces the endowment valuation effect, but
could be offset by the debt valuation effect. The overall impact on the economy is a
quantitative matter that depends on the total level of borrowing as well as its currency
composition. But an appreciation is more likely to be expansionary in our model at
higher levels of debt and higher shares of foreign currency debt, so that the borrowing
constraint is more likely to bind and hence to activate the exchange rate collateral
effect.


2.4     Foreign Households
The Foreign economy is populated by a continuum of identical households of measure 1−
n. Foreign households are relatively patient and derive utility solely from consumption
(c∗ ). Their utility function is:

                                        U∗ = u(c∗1 ) + β ∗ u(c∗2 ),                                   (17)

with β ∗ ∈ (β, 1). Because of their relative patience, the borrowing constraint of the
Foreign representative household never binds in equilibrium. Therefore, we abstract
from Foreign purchases of housing services, as house prices in country F would be
irrelevant for the equilibrium.9
    Foreign households are endowed with y ∗ units of Foreign goods in each period,
and can save via deposits (d) or equity holdings subject to adjustments costs (e) with
financial intermediaries. The budget constraint in period 1 is:

                                     c∗1 + d + e + ψ(e) = p∗F 1 y ∗ ,                                 (18)

where ψ(·) (with ψ 0 , ψ 00 > 0) is a convex cost of changing the equity position.10 As
in Jermann and Quadrini (2012), the equity adjustment cost creates a “pecking order”
   9
     The only difference from explicitly incorporating foreign housing decisions would be to price hous-
ing in the lending country—something our empirical evidence has little to say about. The Foreign
counterpart of equation (16) with µ∗ = 0 shows that we would obtain a solution for Foreign house
prices of the form q ∗ = v 0 (h∗1 )/c̄∗ .
  10
     For simplicity, we assume global financial intermediaries are set up in the first period, and normalize
to zero initial deposits and equity.


                                                    15
of liabilities whereby intermediaries always prefer to issue debt relative to equity. The
budget constraint in the second period is:

                                  c∗2 = p∗F 2 y ∗ + Rd d + Re e + Π,                               (19)

where Rd and Re are the real gross returns on deposits and equity, respectively, and Π
stands for the profits of the global financial intermediary that the Foreign representative
household owns.
    The problem of the foreign representative household is to maximize (17) subject to
(18) and (19). The first order conditions for the optimal choice of deposits and equities
are:
                                       1 = β ∗ Rd ,                                 (20)

and
                                         1 + ψ 0 (e) = β ∗ Re .                                    (21)

Combining these two first order conditions, we obtain:

                                                       ψ 0 (e)
                                         Re = Rd +             .
                                                        β∗

Because of the presence of adjustment costs, the return on equity pays a premium over
the return on deposits, which is increasing in the degree of convexity of the portfolio
cost of adjustment function.


2.5     Global Financial Intermediaries
A representative financial intermediary (a global bank) operates in international credit
markets and channels loans from patient Foreign lenders to impatient Home borrowers,
funding its activity with a mix of equity and deposits raised in the Foreign country.11
    Table 1 below summarizes the balance sheet of financial intermediaries in period
1. As discussed earlier, a given fraction η of their loan book is denominated in Home
currency. Following Bräuning and Ivashina (2016), we assume that global financial
intermediaries swap their exchange rate exposure by entering a contract with perfectly
  11
     Obviously, this is oversimplification, as we abstract from domestic financial intermediation. The
benefit of our assumption is that we can isolate the role of global banks and their interaction with the
frictions on the demand side of domestic credit for the transmission of global financial shocks.

competitive specialized FX traders. These traders are endowed with a large amount of
capital K and make zero profits. Using these swap contracts, global banks can ensure
that only the total size of the asset side of their balance sheet matters, and not its
currency composition.
   The profits of a generic financial intermediary at market value correspond to the
total return on loans, net of the payouts to depositors and equity holders, and the
hedging costs:

where φ(·) (with φ0 (·), φ00 (·) > 0) represents the cost of swapping the total amount of
credit denominated in Home currency issued by an intermediary.
    Because equity is more expensive than deposits, financial intermediaries would like to
leverage their balance sheet as much as possible. We assume that a capital requirement
limits leverage and the size of their balance sheet:
                                                         

with χ ∈ (0, χ̄).12

   The problem for the representative global financial intermediary is to maximize (22)
subject to the leverage constraint (23) and the balance sheet constraint. Using the no
arbitrage condition (15) and the definition of the share of credit denominated in Home
currency (12) introduced earlier, we can rewrite the problem of the representative global
bank as:
                      max Π = (1 + η)Rf − Rd d − Re e − φ(ηf ),
                          f

  12
    Gabaix and Maggiori (2014) obtain a similar constraint assuming that financiers can divert part
of the funds intermediated through their activity.



                                                  17
subject to the balance sheet constraint:

                                    (1 + η)f = d + e,                                (24)

and the capital constraint:
                                     e ≥ χ(1 + η)f.

    The main theoretical experiment that we focus on in the model is a one-time change
in the capital constraint χ. We then map the results of this experiment into the identifi-
cation of our international credit supply shock in the VAR analysis of the next section.
For this purpose, we will focus on an equilibrium in which the capital constraint is
binding. If the capital constraint were slack, financial intermediaries would become
irrelevant, and a shock to χ would have no effect on macroeconomic variables and asset
prices.
   After substituting for deposits from the balance sheet constraint and for equity from
the binding capital constraint, intermediaries profits become:

                    Π = R − χRe − (1 − χ)Rd (1 + η)f − φ(ηf ).
                                          
                                                                                     (25)

The first order condition for the optimal choice of lending is:

                                                    η
                         R = χRe + (1 − χ)Rd +         φ0 (ηf ).                     (26)
                                                   1+η

The lending rate is a weighted average of the funding costs, plus the cost of swapping the
position denominated in Home currency. The capital constraint χ represents the weight
on the return on equity: a tighter leverage constraint (a higher χ) implies a higher cost
of equity, which is passed on to borrowers in the form of a higher loan rate. The last
term on the right-hand side is the hedging cost of Home currency lending: for given f ,
the loan rate is increasing in the share of credit issued in Home currency. Similarly, for
given η, the loan rate is increasing in the amount of credit issued in Foreign currency
because a larger balance sheet with a fixed share of Home currency credit corresponds
to a larger amount of loans to hedge.




                                           18
2.6     Equilibrium
We characterize the equilibrium in terms of the quantity of credit denominated in For-
eign currency f , for a given share of credit denominated in Home currency η, which we
treat as a parameter. In equilibrium, the demand for housing within each country must
equal the available supply, which is fixed and, without loss of generality, normalized
to one (h0 = h1 = 1). A competitive equilibrium for this economy is a collection of
quantities and prices such that:

    1. Domestic households maximize their utility subject to their budget and collateral
       constraints;

    2. Foreign households maximize their utility subject to their budget constraints;

    3. Financial intermediaries maximize their profits subject to their balance sheet and
       leverage constraint;

    4. Goods market clear in every period.

    The full list of equations that characterize the equilibrium of our model is reported
in Appendix. Here we discuss the special case of a small open economy as we assume
in our empirical analysis in section 4.



3     The Small Open Economy Case: An Example
In our empirical analysis, we will focus on the transmission of an international credit
supply shock to individual countries. The key identifying assumption will be that each
country in our sample is too small to influence the global supply of credit. This case
can be analyzed in the model by taking the limit for n that goes to zero (a small open
economy) and using our assumption about the degree of home bias that links country
size, consumption shares, and degree of openness. This small open economy assumption
implies that Home demand does not affect the equilibrium in the market for Foreign
goods. In this case, we can solve for the real exchange as a function of the quantity of
credit and the interest rate. The credit market then determines the entire equilibrium
of the model.


                                             19
3.1       The Exchange Rate and the Credit Market
Credit demand interacts with the goods market through the real exchange rate, which
in period 1 and 2 is given by:13
                                                                 1−λ
                                                   λy
                              s1 =           ∗
                                                                         ,                         (27)
                                           λy + (1 − λ)(1 + η)f
                                                                   1−λ
                                                    λy
                              s2 =           ∗
                                                                             .                     (28)
                                           λy − (1 − λ)R(1 + η)f

Intuitively, higher borrowing in period 1 implies higher Home demand, and hence an
appreciation of the terms of trade (and consequently of the real exchange rate). How-
ever, higher borrowing in period 1 also means, higher interest repayments in period 2,
and hence lower demand and a depreciation in period 2.


Credit supply

The credit supply schedule is upward-sloping in the {f, R} space:

                                     1 + χψ 0 [χ(1 + η)f ] ηφ0 (ηf )
                               R=                         +          ,                             (29)
                                               β∗           1+η

A larger balance sheet requires more equity to satisfy the capital constraint. Since
equity is costly to raise, global financial intermediaries charge a higher lending rate
to borrowers. In addition, as mentioned earlier, for a fixed share of Foreign (Home)
currency credit in total credit, a larger balance sheet implies a higher hedging cost,
which financial intermediaries pass on to borrowers. These two effects make credit
supply increasing in the level of the interest rate.
    The shock that we study originates from the balance sheet of global banks and
is transmitted to individual countries through the international credit market. As
equation (29) shows, an increase in the leverage of financial intermediaries (a reduction
of the capital requirement parameter χ) shifts down the credit supply schedule. At any
level of credit, the interest rate offered on loans issued to the Home country must fall.
This mechanism is what underpins our identification assumptions in the VAR of section
4.

      The derivations of these equilibrium relations are reported in an supplement to the paper.


                                                   20
Credit Demand

The credit demand schedule differs depending on whether the collateral constraint binds
or not. In particular, credit demand is a piecewise function with a kink at the level of
credit where the borrowing constraint becomes binding:

                         1 s1
                       

                                          −       if (1 + η)s1 f = θq.

                       

If the collateral constraint does not bind, the slope of the credit demand schedule is
negative. In this region, the LTV level is irrelevant for the equilibrium. If the constraint
binds, credit demand is downward-sloping for a sufficiently high level of the LTV ratio.14


3.2     Equilibrium
Figure 3 plots the credit market equilibrium in the space {f, R} for a reasonable choice
of the parameters values. Starting with credit demand, which results from combining
(27), (28), and (30), we normalize the endowment in both countries to y = y ∗ = 1
and fix the marginal utility of housing in units of marginal utility of consumption to
κ = 0.85. We set a high value for θ = 0.9, consistent with the observed (median)
maximum LTV limit in our sample of countries, and η = 0.43 to match the median
share of foreign currency liabilities from BIS data. We pick a value for the openness
parameter (λ = 0.79) slightly larger than in Gali and Monacelli (2005) but within the
range discussed in the literature. Finally, we set the domestic discount factor to β = 0.9
to yield a lending spread of about 100 basis points, whether the borrowing constraint
is binding or not.
    Focus next on the credit supply (equation 29). The parameters that pin down its
shape are the capital requirement, the discount factor of country F, and the adjustment
cost parameters. We choose a capital requirement of 10% (χ = 0.1) to target a leverage
ratio of 10—a value that is close to the average leverage of US commercial banks in the
data. We set β ∗ = 0.99 to obtain Rd = 4.1% in annualized terms. We assume that the
adjustment costs for equity holdings and the hedging cost are both quadratic and set

regions.

their parameters residually. Given the rest of the calibration, their values determine
whether the borrowing constraint is binding or not, and the premium that bank equity
pays over deposits.
    Figure 3 displays the two types of credit market equilibrium that can arise in the
model, depending on whether the constraint binds or not. For example, for a given
cost of hedging, if the equity adjustment cost parameter is relatively high (ζ = 0.03),
financial intermediaries pay a large premium over the return on deposits (about ten
and a half percentage points). In this case, the equilibrium is in the unconstrained
region (point A), with a relatively high interest rate on loans of 5.2%. When the
equity adjustment cost is relatively low (ζ = 0.02), the equity premium is smaller
(approximately seven percentage points), credit is abundant, and the interest rate on
loans is lower at about 4.9%. In this case, given the LTV value, demand meets supply
in the constrained region (point B).

0.1 to 0.02 in the region where the collateral constraint is binding.
    We start from the same constrained equilibrium of Figure 3 (point B) with low
equity premium. The reduction in capital requirements of global banks increases the
international supply of credit. The credit supply schedule shifts downward, and the new
credit market equilibrium occurs in point B 0 (top-left panel of Figure 4), with higher
credit and a lower interest rate. The higher availability of credit pushes up house
prices (bottom-left panel). As demand rises in the Home country, the real exchange
rate also appreciates (top-right panel) and consumption increases (bottom-right panel).

as long as the model solution is approximated around a steady state in which the
constraint is binding. A similar adjustment would occur if the economy experienced
the same shock starting from point A in Figure 3. The main difference is that, with
a non-binding collateral constraint, house prices in the Home country would not be

responsive to the increase supply of credit.15



4        An International Credit Supply Shock in the Data
In this section we identify an international credit supply shock empirically and dis-
cuss its impact on selected macroeconomic variables and asset prices of the receiving
economies. We use a panel-vector autoregressive model (PVAR) that allows us to in-
vestigate both the behavior of the typical economy in response to the shock and the
cross-countries differences in this transmission. As we shall see, most empirical findings
are consistent with the predictions of our model.


4.1       A PVAR Model
The PVAR model includes the leverage ratio of US Broker-Dealers to identify an in-
ternational credit supply shock and a small set of domestic variables that have a direct
counterpart in the theoretical model. The set of domestic variables includes cross-
border bank claims on financial and non-financial sector, real private consumption, real
house prices, the real exchange rate vis-a-vis the US Dollar, and the current account
balance as a share of country GDP. In the model, the private sector corresponds to
households borrowing against housing collateral. For consistency, in the data, we do
not distinguish between credit towards households and firms, and we focus on house
prices as the key domestic asset price for the transmission of the exogenous shock. We
do not include a price measure corresponding to the credit variable selected because
quarterly time series for interest rate on loans are not available for our large country
panel. Nonetheless, below we use the model to link the response of house prices and
the real exchange rate, which are observables, to the interest rate on loans.
       The specification for each country i is:

                             xit = ai + bi t + ci t2 + F1i xi,t−1 + uit ,                        (31)

where xit is the vector of endogenous variables, ai is a vector of constants, t and t2
  15
    Starting from point A, with a large enough shock, the economy could also move from the uncon-
strained to the constrained equilibrium. The adjustment in this case would be similar to that depicted
in Figure 4.



                                                  24
are vectors of deterministic trends, F1i is a matrix of coefficients, and uit is a vector of
reduced form residuals with variance-covariance matrix Σiu . All variables considered
enter in log-levels, except for the current account, which is expressed in percentage of
country GDP. 16 The empirical model is the same for all countries to avoid introducing
differences in country responses due to different specifications, and because it would
be difficult to find a data-congruent specification for all 50 countries in our sample. In
particular, somewhat arbitrarily, but mindful of the relatively short sample period for
some of the emerging economies, we include one lag of each variable in every system.
The full sample period is 1985:Q1-2012:Q4, but some country models are estimated
with a later starting date, depending on data availability.
    We estimate the model using the mean group estimator of Pesaran and Smith (1995)
and Pesaran et al. (1996), as pooled estimators are not consistent in dynamic panel data
model with slope coefficients varying across countries. In the estimation, we drop all
countries which have less than 40 observations or have unstable dynamics (i.e., with
eigenvalues larger than 1). This selection leaves us with 51 out of the 57 countries
initially in our event study.17


4.2     Identification
We want to identify a shock to the international supply of credit as in the model
presented in previous section. The model shows that changes in leverage of international
financial intermediaries lead to an international credit supply expansion. In the PVAR
model, we use innovations to US Broker-Dealers’ leverage as a source of exogenous
variation in the international supply of credit, and cross-border claims of BIS reporting
banks as our measure of international credit.18 Leverage of US Broker-Dealers can be
readily measured from US Flow of Funds data. These institutions are also a good proxy
for the global financial intermediaries that we considered in the theoretical analysis.
   Consistent with the small open economy assumption in our model, our key as-
sumption is that leverage of US Broker-Dealers is not contemporaneously affected by
  16
     The country VAR system can be consistently estimated in levels with OLS even if it contains some
unit roots (see Sims et al., 1990). See the paper’s supplement for robustness to using Local Projections
as in Jorda (2005).
  17
     Specifically, we drop from our original sample Brazil, Colombia, Greece, Indonesia because of
unstable dynamics, and Morocco and Serbia because of the number of observations.
  18
     Bruno and Shin (2015) also show that changes in the leverage of US Broker-Dealers have a well-
defined theoretical and empirical linkage with changes in BIS cross-border claims.

conditions in individual countries outside the United States. In the estimation of the
country-specific VARs, however, we can allow for lagged feedback of the domestic econ-
omy into the leverage equation. Proceeding in this way does not compromise either the
consistency or the efficiency of estimates obtained given that we do not use country-
specific standard errors to construct the variance of the mean group estimator. For
robustness, however, we compute also a restricted specification of the VAR in which we
eliminate this lagged feedback. Since the leverage of US Broker-Dealers is endogenous
to the US business cycle, we do not include the US in the sample, leaving us with 50
countries.
    In practice, we obtain the impulse responses of all other variables in the country
VAR systems to an international credit supply shock from the Cholesky decomposition
of the variance-covariance matrix of the estimated reduced-form residuals, with lever-
age ordered first in the system.19 The orthogonalized leverage innovations for each of
the country-specific models (light solid lines) together with their cross-country average
(dark solid line) and standard deviation (straight dotted lines) are plotted in Figure 5.
The shocks differ slightly across countries because of the lagged feedback from the rest
of the system to leverage equation and the fact that models are estimated over different
sample periods (depending on data availability).
    While leverage of the international financial intermediaries is exogenous in our
model, in the data various factors can affect the leverage of US Broker-Dealers. Long-
term determinants include financial regulations and innovation (e.g., Boz and Mendoza
(2014)), liquidity conditions and systemic risk, as well as the state of the business cycle
(see, for example, Bruno and Shin, 2015, Rey, 2013, Bekaert et al., 2013).
    Table 2 reports regressions of the average orthogonalized residual in Figure 5 on these
underlying, more structural determinants of US Broker-Dealers’ leverage. For monetary
policy, we consider both the raw change in the Federal Funds Rate (∆F F Rt ), capturing
the systematic component of monetary policy, as well as its surprise component (M     t
                                                                                         P
                                                                                           )
measured with Romer and Romer (2004) monetary policy shocks. We also include the
slope of the yield curve (RtL − Rt ) that contain information about the state of the
US business cycle and term risk premia. Finally, we consider the VIX volatility index
(V IXt ) as a raw measure of systemic risk.
       Consistent with the available evidence, leverage tends to increase when US policy
  19
     Note here that the order of the other endogenous variables in the VAR system does not matter
for the transmission of the leverage shock.

rates and volatility are falling, and to a lesser extent, when the term premium declines.
In fact, the term premium is only marginally significant statistically, and drops out when
we enter these variables jointly in the regression. Note, however, that the adjusted R-
squared of the regressions is quite low, approaching 10 percent only when VIX index
and Fed Funds Rate changes are entered together. This suggests that they would be
relatively weak instruments.
    For our purposes we do not need to take a stand on the underlying structural sources
of cyclical change in the leverage data. As long as country-specific, domestic pull factors
do not affect leverage of US Broker-Dealers, we can treat changes in leverage as an
exogenous push shock to capital flows that increases the international credit supply
like in our model. Thus, to make sure that leverage is not affected by common shocks
to many small open economies, as a robustness, in our PVAR model, we will control
for world GDP and world equity prices that have a strong forward looking component,
rather than instrumenting leverage with its structural determinants above.20
  20
    Cesa-Bianchi et al. (2015) used these variables as instruments for cross-border claims in a similar
set up, along with US Broker-Dealers’ leverage, applying the external instrument approach of Mertens
and Ravn (2013) and Stock and Watson (2012). Their optimal instrument selection procedure chooses
leverage as preferred instrument for most countries, but the F-statistics is often below the threshold
value to avoid weak instruments problems. They obtain very close results by using the instrumental
variables directly in the PVAR as exogenous variables and applying the Cholesky decomposition as
done in this paper.

4.3        Response of a Typical Small Open Economy
Figure 6 reports the impulse response to the identified international supply of credit.21
The size of the shock is one-standard deviation of the leverage residuals, which is
equal to 7.5% per quarter on average across all countries (e.g., leverage going from
10 to 10.075). We censor the responses included in the computation of the mean
group estimator at the 10% level (5% each side) to eliminate the possible influence of
any outliers. The dark and light shaded areas represent the one- and two-standard
deviation confidence intervals, respectively, computed based on scaled variance of the
country responses across countries, which is a consistent estimates of the true cross
section mean impulse response.
   The estimated impulse responses are consistent with the transmission in our the-
oretical model. In the typical small open economy (represented here by the average
response in the cross-section) the leverage shock leads to a statistically significant and
 21
    We use a simple average of the country-specific estimates to construct the mean-group estimates.
Results are robust to using a weighted average because of the large number of countries in the sample.

persistent increase in cross-border claims, real consumption, and house prices; to a real
exchange rate appreciation, and a deterioration of the current account balance.22 These
responses are in accordance with the behavior of a constrained economy in our model
whereby house prices respond to increased demand for collateral following the credit
shock. The responses are also consistent with the the exchange rate collateral and the
endowment valuation effects dominating the (contractionary) debt valuation effect of
the appreciation. Therefore, both the exchange rate appreciation and the house price
increase possibly amplify the initial effect of the shock.
    Note also that, like in our model, in the medium term (about 4-5 years after the
shock) the exchange rate goes through a period of depreciation, before reverting com-
pletely to its long-run value. The depreciation is associated with falling consumption
and house prices, and a current account surplus. The amplitude of the bust-phase,
  22
    Note here that these are conditional responses to a particular shock. In the data, the current
account balance should add up to zero globally only unconditionally (and ignoring the global discrep-
ancy), but not conditional on particular shocks. Even unconditionally, the current account does not
add up to zero globally if scaled relative to country GDP.


                                                                     29
however, is much smaller than the boom-phase, even though it has the same duration.
In contrast, in the theoretical model (and the episodes reported in Figure 1), the two
phases have not only similar duration, but also comparable amplitude.
   Quarterly data on interest rates on loans, either in domestic or foreign currency, are
not available for a large and long panel data set like ours. The model, however, helps
us connect the response of house prices to these interest rates. For simplicity, assume
the LTV parameter θ is equal to one. The first order conditions for credit (14) and
house prices (16) can be combined to give:

                                  κ                       s2  κ
                          βRb =           and        βR      = .
                                  q                       s1  q

These two expressions equalize the cost of borrowing, in domestic and foreign currency,
respectively, to the return on housing. Housing returns in domestic currency must fall in
line with declining lending rates when the international supply of credit expands. Given
a constant marginal utility of housing, this adjustment must happen via an increase in
house prices that erodes returns as the boom triggered by the shock propagates.
    The model, therefore, predicts that returns on other “risky” assets fall in response
to the international credit supply shock like in Blanchard et al. (2015). In our context,
credit is the “international asset” while housing is the “domestic non-financial asset.”
A positive international credit supply shock appreciates the real exchange rate and
decreases the return on housing via an asset price boom. In the data, the net effect of
capital inflows will depend on the balance between the falling returns in local currency
and the appreciating real exchange rate that make those lower returns more attractive
to foreign investors. The fact that, in the data, the current account swings into deficit
in response to the shock means that cross-border claims co-move closely with total net
capital inflows. This observation in turn suggests that the exchange rate component of
the total return may be dominating the underlying return decline in domestic-currency
from the perspective of foreign investors.
    The effects of the international credit supply shock are quantitatively sizable. Cross-
border bank claims display a hump-shaped response, with an impact response of slightly
less than 1% percent and a peak response just below 2% percent. This corresponds to an
impact increase of about USD250 billions if this multiplier is applied to all countries in
the sample, relative to the post global financial crisis global average of USD25 trillions.
Consumption and real house prices increase by about 0.3% percent and 0.75% percent,

respectively, above their long-run levels within a year. The real exchange rate vis-a-vis
the US Dollar appreciates on impact by about 0.6% percent, arguably driven by the
nominal exchange rate, strengthens some more, and then reverts very slowly toward
its equilibrium level. Finally, the current account turns into a deficit, with a trough
of more than 0.15% percentage points of GDP. Ignoring the fact that the VAR model
responses may not be accurate to evaluate a large change in leverage, the estimated
elasticities imply a consumption drop during the global financial crisis of about 4-5
percentage points in the typical economy, compared to the 7 percent registered by the
United States during the NBER-dated phase of the great recession, with leverage falling
by 15 times.
    Figure 7 reports the mean group estimate of the share of variance explained by the
international credit supply shock. The shock we focus on is important for the dynamics
of the data as it explains a sizable portion of the variance of all variables in the VAR
system. At the same time, US Broker-Dealers’ leverage is explained mostly by shocks
to itself within the first a year or so, consistent with the identification assumptions

made. Our leverage shock accounts for about fifteen to twenty percent of the long-run
forecast error variance of cross-border credit, house prices, and consumption, and a
slightly smaller share (but still above 10%) for the real exchange rate and the current
account. These magnitudes exceed the share of forecast error variance that is typically
explained by domestic monetary policy shocks.
    As we report in Figures (D.2-D.7) of the paper supplement, these results are fairly
robust. We have findings similar to the baseline when we condition on contemporaneous
world GDP in the VAR systems. When we exclude lagged country variables from the
leverage equation, we find stronger effects, while the effects of the shock are qualitatively
similar, but quantitatively weaker when we condition on world equity prices, possibly
reflecting the fact that world equity prices incorporate information, like risk premia, also
captured by the leverage variable.23 When we drop from the sample Japan, Germany,
the United Kingdom, and Switzerland, economies that are relatively large in economic
or financial terms like the United States, we find exactly the same results. Finally, when
we estimate the model with averages of the Local Projections following Jorda (2005),
constructed like our mean group estimates, we find essentially the same results for all
variables except the exchange rate for the forecast step 3, 4 and 5. And even in the case
of the exchange rate response, the results are essentially the same with LPs if we use
the real effective exchange rate, rather than the bilateral rate vis-a-vis the US dollar,
which is less volatile.



5      Understanding Cross-Country Differences
The error bands in Figure 6 for the responses of consumption, house prices, and the
real exchange rate are relatively wide, reflecting significant differences across countries.
In this section, we investigate whether this heterogeneity follows specific patterns.
    We conjecture that the observed cross-country differences are associated with the
interaction between the amplification that asset prices generate in response to an in-
ternational credit supply shock and certain features of the economies in our sample. In
particular, our model suggests that the intensity of the country responses to the credit
  23
    The reason why these additional controls do not alter the results significantly is that the reduced
form residuals of the country VARs are weakly correlated across countries. For example, in the case
of the consumption equation, the average pairwise correlation across countries of the reduced form
innovations is a mere 0.075 in the baseline. Conditioning on world equity prices, it falls only to 0.06.

shocks may be affected by the share of foreign currency liabilities and the maximum
LTV limit prevailing in that country.


5.1                Share of foreign currency credit
As the share of foreign currency debt increases, the collateral exchange rate effect of a
binding borrowing constraint becomes stronger. A higher share of foreign currency debt,
however, strengthens also the debt valuation effect that, all else equal, is contractionary.
The endowment valuation effect instead is unaffected by this country characteristic in
the model.
   Country differences in the share of foreign currency liabilities can account for two
additional expansionary effects in the model. First, a higher share of foreign currency
denominated debt decreases the interest rate burden of debt as global financial inter-
mediaries transfer a smaller cost of hedging onto domestic borrowers. Second, a higher
share of foreign currency denominated debt increases the sensitivity of the real exchange
rate to variations in the level of credit via the demand channel in equation (27).
   Figure 8 provides evidence consistent with our conjecture. The figure plots the
cross-country peak responses of consumption (left panel), house prices (middle panel),
and the real exchange rate (right panel) against the share of foreign currency liabilities


                                                                                            33
(1/(1 + η), horizontal axis). The correlations are particularly strong for consumption
and house prices (about 0.5 and 0.6, respectively). The correlation is slightly weaker
(−0.4), but clearly statistically significant also for the real exchange rate.
   In general, it is not possible to characterize analytically the sign of the net effect
associated with a higher share of foreign currency denominated debt in the model.
However, in the numerical example discussed in Figure 4, the combination of the effects
above implies that consumption, house prices, and the real exchange rate are more
sensitive to international credit supply shocks the higher the share of debt denominated
in Foreign currency. Therefore, we interpret the empirical correlations in Figure 8 as
supportive evidence that the expansionary effects discussed in the model dominate. Of
course, in the data, other channels will be at work that are absent from our model.
These include the traditional expenditure switching effect of exchange rate changes
(which would normally be contractionary, but is muted in our model because of the
absence of production), and the wealth effect of any non-zero, net foreign asset position.
Nonetheless, the scatter plots in Figure 8 suggests that a higher share of foreign currency
debt amplifies the expansionary effect of the international credit supply shock.


5.2    Maximum LTV
A second candidate interpretation of the heterogeneous sensitivity to the international
credit supply shock is country variation in the LTV ratio, which is a key determinant
of leverage in the domestic financial system. For given asset prices, if the borrowing
constraint is binding, a higher maximum LTV ratio allows for additional borrowing,
which contributes to push up house prices, further relaxing the borrowing constraint.
The model predicts that, as long as the borrowing constraint is binding, higher LTV
ratios will increase consumption and house prices more, and lead to a larger appreci-
ation of the real exchange rate. In the model, because of our strong assumptions on
preference and technology, if the borrowing constraint is not binding, a higher LTV
ratio is irrelevant for the response of the economy to the credit supply shock, and there
is no association between the LTV ratio and the sensitivity of the economy to the shock.
   Figure 9 plots the peak impulse responses of consumption (left panel), house prices
(middle panel), and the real exchange rate (right panel) from the VAR (vertical axis)
against the maximum LTV ratio interacted with the home-ownership rate (horizontal
axis). The LTV ratio is weighted with the home-ownership ratio to capture both lever-

age in the local financial system and the availability of housing collateral. Indeed, if
high leverage is permitted, but home-ownership is low, like in the case of Germany and
Switzerland for instance, the economy’s sensitivity to a credit shock should be lower
according to our model.24
   Figure 9 is consistent with the mechanism stressed in our model. This correlation is
economically and statistically significant for house prices (about 0.4) and consumption
(about 0.3), but weaker (about −0.2) and not statistically significant for the real ex-
change rate. Notice here that an upward sloping association between the LTV ratio and
the house price response like the one found in the data, in our model, implies that the
marginal borrower is constrained in most of these economies, as we assumed in deriving
the transmission of the shock.



6             Robustness
The results reported in 8 and 9 are robust to using the average response over the first
4 quarters, or the share of variance of these variables explained by the credit supply
shock during the first year.25
  24
     High home-ownership alone may be a reflection of pervasive cash transactions and an inflation-
hedging demand for housing which is not in our model.

    An alternative way of looking at the heterogeneity in the effects of the international
credit supply shock is to estimate our panel VAR model on different groups of countries,
or ‘bins’, based on the country characteristics. Given the large number of countries, we
can split the sample in two, while preserving the consistency of the mean group esti-
mates. We create these two sub-samples of 25 countries by grouping ‘above’ or ‘below’
the median value of each characteristic (labeled ‘high’ and ‘low’) and recomputing the
mean group estimates within the subsample.
    Figure 10 and 11 report the results for the max LTV limit weighted by home own-
ership and the share of foreign currency liabilities, respectively. Each Figure plots the
baseline impulse responses to the leverage shock, together with the mean (sub)group
estimate for the ‘low’ (solid line with crosses) and ‘high’ (solid line with circles) value
of the characteristics.
   As we can see, the results for the share of foreign currency liabilities and the max
LTV limit give the same message conveyed by the scatter plots in Figure 8 and 9.
But notice here that a lower share of foreign currency liabilities is associated with a

much smoother responses than with a lower maximum LTV limit, with consumption
and the current account almost flat in the former case—and thus suggesting that one
characteristics might be more important than the other.


6.1    Alternative Interpretations of Cross-Country Heterogene-
       ity
The intensity of the country responses to the international credit supply shock seems
to be closely associated with the share of foreign currency liabilities (1/(1 + η)) and the
maximum LTV limit (θ). We focused on these two characteristics because they have a
clear counterpart in the model, which helps interpreting the mechanisms at work. But
it is reasonable to consider that there might be other relevant characteristics.
    For instance, Table 3 reports the correlation between the cross-country peak re-
sponses of consumption, house prices, and the real exchange rate and a small set of ad-
ditional country characteristics, including a measure of exchange rate flexibility (from
the annual fine classification of Ilzetzki et al. (2010), averaged over the 2000-2010 pe-


                                                                        37

riod), a ‘de iure’ measure of controls on capital inflows (from Fernandez et al. (2016),
averaged over the 1995-2013 period), and the mortgage credit over GDP (from Warnock
and Warnock (2008), averaged over the 2001-2005 period).
    Table 3 illustrates that higher exchange rate flexibility is associated with a lower
consumption and house price response to the international credit supply shock, in line
with the notion that a flexible exchange rate can help absorb external shocks. The result
is even starker in Figure D.8 in the supplement, where we plot the impulse response
by sub-groups of ‘low’ and ‘high’ exchange rate flexibility countries, and find that more
flexible regimes are less vulnerable to the shock.
    Table 3 also shows that controls on capital inflows correlate positively with the
incidence of the shock, possibly suggesting that more vulnerable countries may adopt
more controls on inflows. Notice however that there is a strong correlation between the
share of foreign currency liabilities and the tightness of capital controls on inflows (0.56).
So, the positive correlation between capital controls and the consumption response
might be picking up the correlation between the consumption response and the share
of foreign currency liabilities.
    Finally, mortgage debt over GDP is negatively associated with the consumption
responses. But without the aid of a model it is more difficult to assess whether this
reflects better domestic risk sharing opportunities associated with a more developed
financial system or other less intuitive mechanisms.

7    Conclusions
In this paper we set up a model of collateralized borrowing in domestic and foreign
currency with international financial intermediation. Consistent with this model, we
then identify a shock to the international supply of credit in a panel VAR framework.
We find that the identified shock in the data has a transmission consistent with that
implied by the model. International credit supply shocks trigger a consumption boom,
house price inflation, and real exchange rate appreciation, as well as a current account
deterioration. The shock also explains a non-negligible share of the variance of these
variables.
    We find that these effects are quantitatively stronger the higher the share of foreign
currency liability in total liabilities and the maximum LTV limit in the domestic credit
market. In the paper we also show that other country characteristics might be associ-
ated with this heterogeneity, including particularity the flexibility of the exchange rate
regime. We leave the detailed exploration of the role of the exchange rate regime in
explaining the countries difference that we uncover for future research.

A       Appendix: Episodes of Boom-Bust in Capital
        Flows
In this appendix we document the behavior of asset prices and the real economy as-
sociated with episodes of boom-bust in international capital flows in a large sample of
advanced and emerging markets as reported in Figure 1 in the introduction. We fo-
cus on a specific component of capital flows, namely BIS reporting banks’ cross-border
claims to all sectors of the receiving economy (i.e. financial and non-financial) as this is
the measure of international credit that we use in our empirical analysis in the paper.26
For example, if KFij,t is cross-border bank claims from country j to country i in period
t, our capital flows variable for country i is defined as:

                                             N
                                             X
                                    KFit =          KFij,t   ∀j 6= i,                             (A.1)
                                              j=1


where j = 1, ..., N indexes the aggregate of all BIS reporting banks in country j.
    We consider a slightly wider set of variables than those studied in the theoretical
and the VAR models. They include: GDP, private consumption, short-term interest
rates, house prices and equity prices, the effective exchange rate, the exchange rate
vis-a-vis the US Dollar, and the current account as a share of GDP. All variables are
expressed in real terms. The sample period runs from 1970 to 2012 and the frequency
is annual (while in our VAR analysis we use quarterly data). We use annual data to
work with the longest time series available. A description of the variables and their
sources is reported in the appendix below.
    We focus on the behavior of asset prices and the real economy around boom-bust
episodes in cross-border claims. To identify boom-bust episodes we define a boom
(bust) as a period longer than, or equal to, three years in which annual cross-border
claim growth is positive (negative).27 The peak (trough) is defined as the last period
  26
     Consistent with the empirical analysis, in the model, a representative household sector borrows
directly from international financial intermediaries.
  27
     This procedure is similar to the one used in the literature, e.g., Gourinchas et al. (2001), Mendoza
and Terrones (2008). The literature typically defines these episodes as periods in which credit (or
capital inflows) rise more than one-standard deviation above trend level. Our results are robust to
using the traditional approach. The advantage of our approach is that we do not need to detrend
the data or pick a threshold for the amplitude, which introduces spurious variation over time in the
analysis.

within the episode in which the annual rate of growth of cross-border credit is positive
(negative). We then define “boom-bust” episodes as episodes of booms followed by a
bust.
    This procedure identifies 134 booms, 81 busts, and 50 boom-bust episodes. Figure
1 in the paper reports the results. The summary statistics for these episodes (such as
duration and amplitude) are reported in Table A.1 below. Note that, of the 50 boom-
busts, only 20 started after 1994 and about 33 ended by 2005; in the case of the booms,
76 started by 1994 and 83 ended by 2004. Thus, these statistics suggest that the bulk
of the episodes identified are not concentrated in the run up to, or during, the global
financial crisis.

C      Supplement: Model Derivations
This appendix reports the full set of equilibrium conditions of the model. It then derives
expressions for the terms of trade and the credit market equilibrium, discusses the slope
of the credit demand, and finally analyzes the response to a change in χ for the small
open economy case that is relevant to support the VAR identification and interpret the
empirical results.


C.1      Equilibrium Conditions
A competitive equilibrium for our economy is a collection of quantities {c1 , c2 , c∗1 , c∗2 , d, e, f }
and prices {q, µ, Rb , Rd , Re , τ 1 , τ 2 , s1 , s2 } such that:

    1. Domestic households maximize their utility subject to their budget and collateral
       constraint:

                                     1 − µ = βRb ,
                                                s2
                                     1 − µ = βR ,
                                                s1
                                 (1 − µθ)q = κ,
                                (1 + η)s1 f ≤ θq,

                                          c2 = τ α−1
                                                 2   y − (1 + η)s2 Rf,

      with µ ≥ 0, and where κ ≡ v 0 (1)/c̄ > 0 is the marginal utility of housing in units
      of marginal utility of consumption.

    2. Foreign households maximize their utility subject to their budget constraint:

                                         1 = β ∗ Rd ,
                                1 + ψ 0 (e) = β ∗ Re ,

                                        c∗1 = τ α1 y ∗ − [d + e + ψ(e)],
                                                    ∗
                                        c∗2 = τ α2 y ∗ + Rd d + Re e


    3. Financial intermediaries maximize their profits subject to their balance sheet and

                                                 49
      leverage constraints:

                                 R = χRe + (1 − χ)Rd + φ0 (ηf ),
                          (1 + η)f = d + e,
                                  e = χ(1 + η)f.


  4. Goods market clear in every period:

                                           2 c2 + (1 − n) (1 − α ) τ 2 c2 .


  5. The real exchange rate is related to the terms of trade in every period according
     to:

                                           ∗                     ∗
                              s1 = τ α−α
                                     1                s2 = τ α−α
                                                             2   .


   There are 18 equations for 16 variables. Two goods market equilibrium conditions
(one in each period) are redundant by Walras’s Law.


C.2     Small Open Economy Case
We now take the limit for n → 0 so that the Home country becomes a small open
economy, consistent with our identification assumption in the VAR analysis.


C.2.1   Goods Market and the Terms of Trade

We start from the goods market equilibrium:

                                                         ∗
                       ny = nατ 1−α c + (1 − n)α∗ τ 1−α c∗ ,                       (C.1)
                                                                      −α∗
                (1 − n)y ∗ = n (1 − α) τ −α c + (1 − n) (1 − α∗ ) τ         c∗ ,   (C.2)




                                               50
where we dropped the time subscript as these expressions are static and have the same
form in both periods. Rewrite these conditions as

                                 1 − n ∗ 1−α∗ ∗
                  y = ατ 1−α c +       α τ      c,                                (C.3)
                                   n
                        n                                           ∗
                 y∗ =        (1 − α) τ −α c + (1 − n) (1 − α∗ ) τ −α c∗ .         (C.4)
                      1−n

Next, use the relationship between the consumption shares, the country size, and the
degree of openness (α = 1 − (1 − n)λ and α∗ = nλ) to obtain

                                                   1−n
                   y = [1 − (1 − n)λ]τ (1−n)λ c +       nλτ 1−nλ c∗ ,             (C.5)
                                                    n
                   ∗      n
                  y =        (1 − n)λτ  (1−n)λ−1
                                                 c + (1 − nλ) τ −nλ c∗ .          (C.6)
                       1−n

Simplifying and taking the limit for n that goes to zero, the previous expressions yield

                               y = (1 − λ)τ λ c + λτ c∗ ,                         (C.7)
                              y ∗ = c∗ ,                                          (C.8)

which imply that Home demand does not affect the equilibrium in the market for
Foreign goods and that Foreign consumption is exogenous.
    As housing is in fixed supply, in equilibrium, the Home household budget constraint
in the first period becomes

                               c1 = τ 1−λ
                                      1   (1 + η)f + τ −λ
                                                       1 y,                       (C.9)

where we have used the relation above between the real exchange rate and the terms
of trade. Now replace this expression in the Home goods market equilibrium and solve
for the terms of trade to obtain a relation between the terms of trade and credit

                                               λy
                              τ1 =                          ,
                                     λy ∗ + (1 − λ)(1 + η)f

and thus                                                 1−λ
                                         λy
                          s1 =                                   .               (C.10)
                               λy ∗ + (1 − λ)(1 + η)f
Intuitively, higher credit implies higher Home demand, and hence an appreciation of


                                            51
the terms of trade (and consequently of the real exchange rate).
   In period 2, the budget constraint of the Home representative household is

                              c2 = τ −λ     1−λ
                                     2 y − τ2   (1 + η)Rf.

Substitute again into the goods market equilibrium to obtain the terms of trade

                                                 λy
                             τ2 =                             ,                    (C.11)
                                    λy ∗   − (1 − λ)(1 + η)Rf

and and hence the real exchange rate
                                                           1−λ
                                          λy
                          s2 =                                     .               (C.12)
                               λy ∗ − (1 − λ)(1 + η)Rf

The terms of trade in period 2 depend on both debt and the lending rate. Intuitively,
high debt or lending interest rates in period 1 imply lower resources (and therefore
demand) in period 2, and therefore a depreciation.


C.2.2   Credit Market

Next, we can characterize the equilibrium in the credit market.
    Credit Supply. We start with the credit supply. Substituting the expressions for
the return on deposit and the return on equity in the zero profit condition for financial
intermediaries, together with the binding capital constraint, yields an expression for
credit supply
                              1 + χψ 0 [χ(1 + η)f ] ηφ0 (ηf )
                         R=                        +          .
                                        β∗            1+η
This expression is independent of country size and thus holds also in the limit for n → 0.
   Credit Demand. Next, we move on to the credit demand. Start from the optimal
choice of housing services. If the borrowing constraint is not binding (µ = 0), the
equilibrium conditions for domestic households reduce to to q = κ (the first order
condition for housing services), (1 + η)s1 f < θq (the non-binding collateral constraint),
and the consumption Euler equation

                                                1 s1
                                           R=        .
                                                β s2


                                               52
   Consider now the equilibrium with binding borrowing constraint (µ > 0). In this
case, we can solve for the Lagrange multiplier from the Euler equation to yield

                                                     s2
                                      µ = 1 − βR        .                         (C.13)
                                                     s1

Substituting this expression into the housing pricing equation we have
                                                    
                                                s2
                                    1 − θ + θβR          q = κ.                   (C.14)
                                                s1

And solving for q and substituting into the borrowing constraint with equality yields

                                                   θκ
                            (1 + η)s1 f =                     ,                   (C.15)
                                            1 − θ + θβRs2 /s1

which can be solved to obtain
                                                     
                               1 s1     κ         1−θ
                            R=                  −       .
                               β s2 (1 + η)s1 f    θ

C.3     Slope of Credit Demand
Debt valuation effects associated with the real exchange rate may generate a credit de-
mand function with a segment is not downward sloping. So here we study the conditions
under which it is well-behaved.
   Start from the region in which the collateral constraint is not binding. Substituting
the expressions of the real exchange rate gives
                                                       1−λ
                             1 λy ∗ − (1 − λ)(1 + η)Rf
                              
                          R=                                .
                             β λy ∗ + (1 − λ)(1 + η)f

Now define the function
                                                         1−λ
                               1 λy ∗ − (1 − λ)(1 + η)Rf
                                
                   G1 (f, R) ≡                                − R,
                               β λy ∗ + (1 − λ)(1 + η)f

so that we can apply the implicit function theorem. In particular, we have that

                                     ∂R    ∂G1 /∂f
                                        =−         .                              (C.16)
                                     ∂f    ∂G1 /∂R


                                             53
The derivative at the numerator is
                                         λ
                                                 λy ∗ (1 + η)(R + 1)
                                
                    ∂G1    1        s1
                        =−                                               < 0.
                     ∂f    β        s2        [λy ∗ + (1 − λ)(1 + η)f ]2

The derivative at the denominator is
                          "      λ                        #
                 ∂G1           1 s1         (1 + η)f
                      =− 1+                                   < 0.
                 ∂R           β s2   λy ∗ + (1 − λ)(1 + η)f

As both numerator and denominator of (C.16) are negative, in the region where the
collateral constraint does not bind, the credit demand function will be negatively sloped.
    Next, move to the region where the collateral constraint is binding. To simplify the
analysis, start from the limiting case of θ = 1. In this simpler case, substituting for the
real exchange rate at time 2, we can construct the function
                                                                        1−λ
                                              λy ∗ − (1 − λ)(1 + η)Rf
                                          
                               κ
               G2 (f, R) ≡                                                      −R
                           β(1 + η)f                     λy

The slope of credit demand if the collateral constraint binds is

                                     ∂R    ∂G2 /∂f
                                        =−         .                                 (C.17)
                                     ∂f    ∂G2 /∂R

And the derivative at the numerator is

                                                     1 (1 + η)s1−λ
                                                                    
                    ∂G2         κ                              2   R
                        =−                             +               < 0,
                     ∂f    β(1 + η)s2 f              f      λy

while the derivative at the denominator is

                                           κs1−λ
                                                
                              ∂G2            2
                                  =− 1+            < 0.
                              ∂R            βλy

So in the limiting case of 100 percent LTV, credit demand continues unequivocally to
be downward sloping. A simple continuity argument suggests that the result carries
through for high enough values of θ. Indeed, in our numerical example in which we set
θ to the high value of 92% (close to the average maximum LTV in our country sample
of about 90%), credit demand is downward sloping when the collateral constraint binds.

C.4        The Transmission of an International Credit Supply Shock
This appendix derives analytically the approximate response of the economy to a change
in χ. We focus on the region in which the collateral constraint binds. For small enough
changes in χ, a log-linear approximation provides an accurate description of the impact
of the credit supply shock.28
   Start from the expression (C.10) for the real exchange rate in period 1 that can be

   After inverting the matrix A, we can write the solution as

    In the limit, for θ → 1, we have that a31 = 0 and hence d < 0. In this case it is easy
to see that

Therefore, in response to a positive international credit supply shock (a fall in χ), the
real exchange rate appreciates, the real lending rate falls, and the amount of credit
extended to the Home economy increases.
   Given that we are in the region in which the collateral constraint binds, the approx-
imated response of house prices is

                             q̂ = ŝ1 + fˆ ⇒      =      +      .
                                             ∂ χ̂   ∂ χ̂   ∂ χ̂

Substituting the values of the partial derivatives above gives

                               ∂ q̂   b41 (a23 − 1)(a14 − 1)

                               ∂ χ̂              d

which is positive as long as a14 > 1; a condition that is always satisfied for large enough
levels of credit over GDP.
   Finally, the response of consumption to the credit shock is

A positive international credit supply shock increases consumption, both directly (the
first term in the expression above) and indirectly because the real exchange rate appre-
ciation makes the domestic endowment more valuable (the second term in square brack-
ets). The appreciation of the real exchange rate, however, also reduces the purchasing
power of credit denominated in foreign currency (the first term in square brackets).
The overall effect is ambiguous, although our numerical simulations suggest consump-
tion increases in response to a positive shocks for reasonable values of the parameters.



D      Supplement: Additional Empirical Results and
       VAR Robustness
This Supplement (not for publication) reports additional stylized facts and empirical
results, including a a battery of robustness checks on the panel VAR results.


D.1     Time-varying share of foreign currency liabilities
In the model we assume that the share of foreign currency credit (1/(1 + η)) is constant
over time. In fact, 1/(1 + η) is an equilibrium variable that may vary over time in
response to shocks. At the country level, however, there is relatively little time variation.
To illustrate this, we divide our sample in two sub-samples and we plot the average share
of foreign currency credit during the first period through the Asian financial crisis (the
1985-1999 period) against the average share thereafter (the 2000-2015 period).
   Figure D.1 shows that most country data points are close to the 45 degree line,
suggesting that the shares have not changed much over time. Specifically, the correlation
between the two set of shares is 0.9 and highly statistically significant.


D.2     VAR Robustness
In this section, we analyze the robustness of our empirical results. First, we consider a
specification in which both contemporaneous and lagged domestic variables are excluded
from the leverage equation. Second, we consider specifications in which we control
for the possible presence of common country-specific shocks that could invalidate our
identification assumption. The US and international business cycle are interrelated and


                                             59
both can affect US Broker-Dealer leverage. To control for common shocks, we augment
our baseline specification with world GDP or would equity prices, ordering these two
variables before leverage in the system. We consider world equity prices as this is a
forward looking variable.
    The results from these experiments (reported in in figures D.2-D.3, respectively)
show that our baseline results are fairly robust. Both the impulse responses and the
forecast error variance decompositions remain close to the baseline, with some quanti-
tative differences. In particular, we find stronger impacts of the shock when we restrict
the feedback from the lagged country variables to the leverage equation, and slightly
weaker effects when we control for world GDP and especially world equity prices. We
note here that world equity prices capture a broad set of factors, including risk premia
also captured by leverage. It is therefore remarkable that they affect the results only
quantitatively.
    In the baseline PVAR model, the identification of the leverage shock rests on a small
open economy assumption that might not apply to larger economies like Germany, the
United Kingdom, Japan, and Switzerland (like the United States, which for this reason
is excluded from the analysis). In Figure D.5 we we drop these larger economies from
the sample and, for comparison, we also plots our baseline impulse responses (solid line
with circles). The results are virtually unchanged.


D.3     VARs vs. Local Projections
While VARs provide a rich set of statistics on the dynamic properties of a system,
they might be misspecified along multiple dimensions. The Local Projection (LP)
methodology, developed by Jorda (2005) and applied in a similar setting to ours in
Jorda et al. (2015) provides a more limited set of statistics is more robust. As we noted
earlier, in the context of a PVAR model with a large number of countries, lag selection
is particularly challenging.
    To check robustness on our results in this direction, we compute the LPs for each
country, and each variable in our VAR, based on a specification in which Broker-Dealer
leverage is treated as exogenous variable from the perspective of the small open economy.
We then compute a mean group LP as the average of the country LPs like in the case of
the VARs. The LP, in fact, is a dynamic regression, and coefficient heterogeneity would
render a pooled estimate inconsistent like in a standard dynamic panel data model

                                           60
context (e.g., Pesaran and Smith (1995)
    Figure D.6 reports the results and shows that the LP methodology yields essen-
tially the same results over the relevant projection horizons for all variables except the
exchange rate at forecast step 3, 4, and 5. And if we use the real effective exchange
rate rather than the bilateral exchange rate vis-a-vis the US dollar, the results are the
essentially the same also in the case of the exchange rate response (Figure D.7) because
the response of the effective rate is less volatile than the bilateral real exchange rate.


D.4     VARs on Different Groups of Countries (‘bins’): The Role
        of Exchange Rate Flexibility
In this section, we report the results we obtain from estimating our panel VAR model on
different groups of countries, or ‘bins’, focusing on the role of exchange rate flexibility.
As we explain in the main text, this is an alternative way of looking at the heterogene-
ity in the effects of the international credit supply shock. The impulse responses are
reported in Figure D.8.

Note. LPs onto a one-standard deviation (7.5%) increase in US Broker-Dealers.
The dark and light shaded areas are the one- and two-standard deviation con-
fidence intervals. The solid line with circles is the impulse response from the
baseline PVAR. Both LPs and VARs are mean group estimates.

Note. Mean Group impulse responses to a one-standard deviation (7.5%) increase
in the leverage of US Broker-Dealers. The dark and light shaded areas are the one-
and two-standard deviation confidence intervals, respectively. The solid line with
crosses and circles represents the mean group estimate for ‘Low’ (below median
value) and ‘High’ (above median value) exchange rate flexibility from the annual
“fine” classification of Ilzetzki et al. (2010) (average over the 2000-2010 period).
