                                        ABSTRACT

In recent years, there has been widespread concern that misinformation on social media is
damaging societies and democratic institutions. In response, social media platforms have
announced actions to limit the spread of false content. We measure trends in the diffusion of
content from 569 fake news websites and 9,540 fake news stories on Facebook and Twitter
between January 2015 and July 2018. User interactions with false content rose steadily on both
Facebook and Twitter through the end of 2016. Since then, however, interactions with false
content have fallen sharply on Facebook while continuing to rise on Twitter, with the ratio of
Facebook engagements to Twitter shares decreasing by 60 percent. In comparison, interactions
with other news, business, or culture sites have followed similar trends on both platforms. Our
results suggest that the relative magnitude of the misinformation problem on Facebook has
declined since its peak.

1    Introduction

Although the political process has a long history of misinformation and popular misperceptions,
misinformation on social media has caused widespread alarm in recent years (Flynn et al. 2017;
Lazer et al. 2018). A substantial number of U.S. adults were exposed to false stories prior to the
2016 election, and post-election surveys suggest that many people who read these stories believed
them to be true (Allcott and Gentzkow 2017; Guess et al. 2018). Many argue that false stories
played a major role in the 2016 election (for example, Parkinson 2016; Gunther et al. 2018),
and in the ongoing political divisions and crises that have followed it (for example, Spohr 2017;
Azzimonti and Fernandes 2018). In response, Facebook and other social media companies have
made a range of algorithmic and policy changes to limit the spread of false content. In the appendix,
we list twelve announcements by Facebook and five by Twitter aimed at reducing the circulation
of misinformation on their platforms since the 2016 election.
    Evidence on how the scale of the misinformation problem is evolving remains limited.1 A
recent study argues that false stories remain a problem on Facebook even after changes to the
platform’s news feed algorithm in early 2018 (Newswhip 2018). Many articles that have been rated
as false by major fact-checking organizations have not been flagged in Facebook’s system, and
two major fake news sites have seen little or no decline in Facebook engagements since early 2016
(Funke 2018). Facebook’s now-discontinued strategy of flagging inaccurate stories as “Disputed”
has been shown to modestly lower the perceived accuracy of flagged headlines (Blair et al. 2017),
though some research suggests that the presence of warnings can cause untagged false stories to
be seen as more accurate (Pennycook and Rand 2017). Media commentators have argued that
efforts to fight misinformation through fact-checking are “not working” (Levin 2017) and that
misinformation overall is “becoming unstoppable” (Ghosh and Scott 2018).
    In this paper, we present new evidence on the volume of misinformation circulated on social
media from January 2015 to July 2018. We assemble a list of 569 sites identified as sources of false
stories in a set of five previous studies and online lists. We refer to these collectively as fake news
sites. We measure the volume of Facebook engagements and Twitter shares for all stories on these
sites by month. As points of comparison, we also measure the same outcomes for stories on (i) a
set of major news sites; (ii) a set of small news sites not identified as producing misinformation;
and (iii) a set of sites covering business and culture topics.
    The results show that interactions with the fake news sites in our database rose steadily on both
Facebook and Twitter from early 2015 to the months just after the 2016 election. Interactions then
declined by more than half on Facebook, while they continued to rise on Twitter. The ratio of
Facebook engagements to Twitter shares was roughly steady at around 45:1 from the beginning

1 Lazeret al. (2018) write, “There is little research focused on fake news and no comprehensive data-collection system
 to provide a dynamic understanding of how pervasive systems of fake news provision are evolving . . . researchers
 need to conduct a rigorous, ongoing audit of how the major platforms filter information.”

                                                          2
of our period to late 2016, then fell to approximately 15:1 by the end of our sample period. In
contrast, interactions with major news sites, small news sites, and business and culture sites have
all remained relatively stable over time, and have followed similar trends on Facebook and Twitter
both before and after the 2016 election. While this evidence is far from definitive and is subject to
the important caveats discussed below, we see it as consistent with the view that the overall mag-
nitude of the misinformation problem may have declined, possibly due to changes to the Facebook
platform following the 2016 election.
     Our results also reveal that the absolute level of interaction with misinformation remains high,
and that Facebook continues to play a particularly important role in its diffusion. In the period
around the election, fake news sites received about two thirds as many Facebook engagements as
the 38 major news sites in our sample. Even after the post-election decline, Facebook engagements
with fake news sites still average roughly 60 million per month.
     This research demonstrates how novel data on social media usage can be used to understand
important questions in political science around media exposure and social media platforms’ content
moderation practices. Parallel work released soon after our working paper finds broadly similar
results (Resnick et al. 2018).


2   Data

We compile a list of sites producing false stories by combining five previous lists: (i) an academic
paper by Grinberg et al. (2018, 490 sites); (ii) PolitiFact’s article titled “PolitiFact’s guide to fake
news websites and what they peddle” (Gillin 2017, 324 sites); (iii) three articles by BuzzFeed on
fake news (Silverman 2016; Silverman et al. 2017a; Silverman et al. 2017b; 223 sites); (iv) an aca-
demic paper by Guess et al. (2018, 92 sites); and (v) FactCheck’s article titled “Websites that post
fake and satirical stories” (Schaedel 2017, 61 sites). The two lists from academic papers originally
derive from subsets of the other three, plus Snopes.com, another independent fact-checking site,
and lists assembled by blogger Brayton (2016) and media studies scholar Zimdars (2016). The
union of these five lists is our set of fake news sites.
     PolitiFact and FactCheck work directly with Facebook to evaluate the veracity of stories flagged
by Facebook users as potentially false. Thus, these lists comprise fake news sites that Facebook
is likely to be aware are fake. As a result, our results may be weighted toward diffusion of mis-
information that Facebook is aware of, and may not fully capture trends in misinformation that
Facebook is not aware of. It is difficult to assess how large this latter group might be. Our list
almost certainly includes the most important providers of false stories, as Facebook users can flag
any and all questionable articles for review. On the other hand, the list likely excludes a large tail
of web domains that are small and/or active for only a short period.
     Combining these five lists yields a total of 672 unique fake news sites. We report in the ap-


                                                   3
pendix the 50 largest sites in terms of total Facebook engagements plus Twitter shares during the
sample period. In our robustness checks, we consider alternative rules for selecting the set of fake
news sites.
    We select three sets of comparison sites based on Alexa (www.alexa.com). Alexa measures
web traffic using its global traffic panel, a sample of millions of Internet users who have installed
browser extensions allowing their browsing data to be recorded, plus data from websites that use
Alexa to measure their traffic. It then ranks sites based on a combined measure of unique visitors
and pageviews. We define major news sites to be the top 100 sites in Alexa’s News category. We
define small news sites to be the sites ranked 401-500 in the News category. We define business
and culture sites to be the top 50 sites in each of the Arts, Business, Health, Recreation, and Sports
categories. Some previous research on news also uses Alexa’s lists (for example, Flaxman et al.
2016; Allcott and Gentzkow 2017). For each of these groups, we exclude from our sample govern-
ment websites, databases, sites that do not mainly produce news or similar content,2 international
sites whose audiences are primarily outside the U.S.,3 and sites that are included in our list of fake
news sites. Our final sample of comparison sites includes 38 major news sites, 78 small news
sites, and 54 business and culture sites. Table 1 provides examples of sites in each category. The
complete lists can be found in the appendix.
    We gather monthly Facebook engagements and Twitter shares of all articles published on
both fake news sites and comparison sites from January 2015 to July 2018 from BuzzSumo
(www.buzzsumo.com). BuzzSumo is a commercial content database that tracks the volume of
user interactions with internet content on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms,
using data available from the platforms’ application programming interfaces (APIs). We use Buz-
zSumo’s data on total Facebook engagements and total Twitter shares by originating website and
month. Facebook engagements are defined as the sum of shares, comments, and reactions such as
"likes." BuzzSumo does not provide a decomposition of Facebook engagements on the site level,
so we cannot directly compare Facebook shares with Twitter shares. Ideally we would measure
exposure to fake articles using data on views, but such data are not publicly available. We have
data for 569 out of 672 fake news sites in our list and all sites in the comparison groups. The rest
103 fake news sites are missing from BuzzSumo. We sum the monthly Facebook engagements and
Twitter shares of articles from all sites in each category and then average by quarter.
    In practice, the 569 “fake news sites” on our list carry some combination of true news and
clickbait in addition to misleading and false content. To more precisely focus attention on the
latter, besides the site-level data described above, we also gather a list of specific URLs spreading
misinformation. We scrape all claims on the fact-checking site Snopes.com that are classified as
“false” or “mostly false.” In late 2015, Snopes began to provide permanent URLs for the sources

2 Examples   include chase.com, booking.com, xfinity.com, spotify.com, and target.com.
3 Examples   include bbc.co.uk, indiatimes.com, news.com.au, chinadaily.com.cn, and dw.com

                                                        4
of these false claims through a web archiving site, archive.is. We collect all these URLs for articles
published in 2016 or later, yielding an intermediate sample of 1,535 article URLs. We then extract
keywords from the titles of these articles and capture all articles in the BuzzSumo database pub-
lished in 2016 or later that contain these keywords and have at least 100 Facebook engagements or
10 Twitter shares. This yields a sample of 11,351 URLs. Finally, an independent research assistant
manually screen out those that are not in fact spreading the false claims based on the titles of these
articles, leading to a final sample of 9,540 false stories URLs.


3   Results

Figure 1 shows trends in the number of Facebook engagements and Twitter shares of stories from
each category of sites. Note that the scales of the y-axis are different among different categories.
Interactions for major news sites, small news sites, and business and culture sites have remained
relatively stable during the past two years, and follow similar trends on Facebook and Twitter. Both
platforms show a modest upward trend for major news and small news sites, and a modest down-
ward trend for business and culture sites. In contrast, interactions with fake news have changed
more dramatically over time, and these changes are very different on the two platforms. Fake news
interactions increased steadily on both platforms from the beginning of 2015 up to the 2016 elec-
tion. Following the election, however, Facebook engagements fell sharply (declining by more than
50 percent), while Twitter shares continued to increase.
    Figure 2 shows our main result: trends in the ratios of Facebook engagements to Twitter shares.
The ratios have been relatively stable for major news, small news, and business and culture sites.
For fake news sites, however, the ratio has declined sharply, from around 45:1 during the election
to around 15:1 two years later.
    While these results suggest that the circulation of misinformation on Facebook has declined, it
is important to emphasize that the absolute quantity of interactions with misinformation on both
platforms remains large, and that Facebook in particular has played an outsized role in its diffusion.
Figure 1 shows that Facebook engagements fell from a peak of roughly 160 million per month at
the end of 2016 to roughly 60 million per month at the end of our sample period. As a point of
comparison, the 38 major news sites in the top left panel—including the New York Times, Wall
Street Journal, CNN, Fox News, etc.—typically garner about 200-250 million Facebook engage-
ments per month. On Twitter, shares of false content have been in the 3-5 million per month range
since the end of 2016, compared to roughly 20 million per month for the major news sites.
    Figure 3 presents results for our list of false stories URLs. Since the number of URLs we
capture starts close to zero in 2016 and grows from month to month, there is a steeper increase in
Facebook and Twitter interactions with these URLs than that in the site-level analysis. Similar to
the site-level analysis, the ratio of Facebook engagements to Twitter shares has declined by half


                                                  5
or more after the 2016 election. For this set of URLs, we have both Facebook engagements and
Facebook shares and they are highly correlated. We report the same figure using Facebook shares
in the appendix. The median ratio of Facebook engagements to Facebook shares in this set of false
stories URLs is around 6. People should keep this difference in mind when interpreting the results.


4   Interpretation and Robustness Checks

Our evidence is subject to many important caveats and must be interpreted with caution. This is
particularly true for the raw trends in interactions. While we have attempted to make our database
of false stories as comprehensive as possible, it is likely far from complete, and many factors could
generate selection biases that vary over time. The raw decline in Facebook engagements may
partly reflect the under-sampling of sites that could have entered or gained popularity later in our
sample period, as well as efforts by producers of misinformation to evade detection on Facebook
by changing their domain names. It may also reflect changes over time in demand for highly
partisan political content that would have existed absent efforts to fight misinformation, and could
reverse in the future, for example in the run-up to future elections. Actions by policymakers and
civil society organizations to improve media literacy could have also affected the observed trends,
independently of actions by the platforms (Zubrzycki 2017, Strauss 2018).
    We see the comparison of Facebook engagements to Twitter shares as potentially more infor-
mative. If the design of these platforms and the behavior of their users were stable over time, we
might expect sample selection biases or demand changes to have similar proportional effects, and
thus leave the ratio of Facebook engagements to Twitter shares roughly unchanged. For example,
we might expect producers changing domain names to evade detection to produce similar declines
in our measured interactions on both platforms. The fact that Facebook engagements and Twit-
ter shares follow similar trends prior to late 2016 and for the non-fake-news sites in our data, but
diverge sharply for fake news sites following the election, suggests that some factor has slowed
the relative diffusion of misinformation on Facebook. The suite of policy and algorithmic changes
made by Facebook following the election is one plausible candidate, though we have no direct
evidence on this or other possible causes.
    We stress that even the relative comparison of the platforms is only suggestive. Both Facebook
and Twitter have made changes to their platforms, and so this measure at best captures the relative
effect of the former compared to the latter. Engagements on Facebook affect sharing on Twitter
and vice versa. The selection of stories into our database could for various reasons differentially
favor the kinds of stories likely to be shared on one platform or the other, and this selection could
vary over time. Demand changes need not have the same proportional effect on the two platforms.
Some of these factors would tend to attenuate changes in the Facebook-Twitter ratio, leading our
results to be conservative, but others could produce a spurious decrease over time.


                                                 6
    We report a number of robustness checks in the appendix, most of which are designed to
address concerns about selection into our sample of sites. First, as Lim (2018) points out, the inter-
rater reliability between fact-checking organizations may be relatively low due to ambiguity. One
single fact-checking organization may incorrectly includes sites that should not be counted as fake
news sites. So we restrict to sites that are identified as fake news sites by at least two or three of
our original five lists, which leaves 116 and 19 sites, respectively. Second, given that people might
disagree with any one particular study’s list of fake news sites, we run five additional analyses, each
excluding fake news sites identified exclusively by one of our five lists. Third, we focus on sites
that started active operations after November 2016, sites that were still in active operation as of July
2018, and sites that were in active operation from August 2015 to July 2018, which leaves 226,
214, and 81 sites respectively. (Active operation is defined to have a global traffic rank reported by
Alexa of at least one million.) Fourth, we exclude the five largest sites in terms of total interactions
to ensure the trend is not driven solely by outliers. We also look at sites in the first decile and
sites in the bottom nine deciles separately to see if the trend holds for both large sites and small
sites. Fifth, Grinberg et al. (2018) provide three lists of sites classified by different likelihoods to
publish misinformation. We look at each of these lists separately. Our main qualitative conclusions
remain consistent across these checks, though the exact size and shape of the trends vary. Sixth,
we present an alternative comparison group: a small set of politically focused sites such as Politico
and The Hill. These sites do see a decline in engagements on Facebook relative to Twitter, but it
mainly occurred in late-2015. Finally, we show that results look similar when using only the count
of Facebook shares instead of engagements, which includes shares, comments, and reactions such
as “likes.”


5   Conclusion

The diffusion of misinformation through social media is a potential threat to democracy and
broader society. While its potential effects have been much discussed, there is little evidence
on how the scale of the problem has evolved in recent years. We show that user interactions with
false content rose steadily on both Facebook and Twitter through the end of 2016. Since then,
interactions have fallen sharply on Facebook while continuing to rise on Twitter. These results
suggest that the relative magnitude of the misinformation problem on Facebook has declined since
its peak. One hypothesis is that this reflects changes to the Facebook platform implemented since
the 2016 election which were designed to combat misinformation, although directly testing the
ultimate cause is beyond the scope of our study.
