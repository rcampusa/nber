           THE EFFECTS OF GOVERNMENT REGULATION ON TEENAGE
                        MOTOR VEHICLE MORTALITY




                                ABSTRACT


           This   article investigates the impact of a number   of   policy
manipulable variables on the motor vehicle mortality rate of white

males   between   the ages of 15 to 24. Particular emphasis is placed

on the role of alcohol. Utilizing data for the tune period 1970

to 1975, inultivariate equations are estimated for three time
periods in order to examine and compare the before, inmtediate,
and   longer run (one—year) impact of the changes in these relevant
variables on mortality rates.
            results reveal that changes in the minimum legal pur-
          The

chasing age of alcohol has contributed significantly to a higher
mortality rate not only    in the state instituting   the change but
In the border states as    well.

      Motor vehicle mortality has long been cited as one of the princi-

pal causes of accidental deaths in the United States accounting for

over one—half of all such deaths (see National Safety Council Reports).

Significantly influencing these statistics is the age of the driver.

While comprising less than 23 percent of the total licensed driver

population, the fifteen to twenty—four year old age group typically

accounts for more than one—third of the fatal motor vehicle accident

statistics.1 For this age group, motor vehicle accidents are also

the leading cause of death.

      An important factor also affecting the motor vehicle mortality

rate is the level of alcohol consumption. Alcohol is the single most

important factor yet identified in traffic fatalities (Wailer (1979,

p. 117)]. The age of the driver together with the consumption of

alcohol can prove to be a deadly combination. One of the most

frequently cited factors contributing to the relationship between

youth, alcohol, and mortality rates is the minimum legal purchasing

age of alcohol (MPA).

      With the passage of the 26th amendment giving the right to vote

to 18 year olds, came the cry for a reduction in the minimum legal

purchasing age. Prior to 1970, only five states granted individuals

under the age of 21 the right to purchase alcohol publicly. Begin-

ning in September 1970 when Alaska reduced the NPA from 21 to 19 and

continuing to the end of 1975, a reduction in the MPA to 20, 19, or 18

became effective in a total of 25 states.2
                                     —2—

         The consequences of such legislation, primarily a higher number

of motor vehicle mortalities for drivers between the ages of 15 to 24,

soon became a concern. Legislation was introduced in many states to

reverse this trend and between 1976 and 1982, 17 states increased the

age of legal drinking.

         Various studies (Haiimond (1973), Cucchiaro et al. (1974),

Douglass (1974), Douglass and Filkins (1974), Williams et al.

(1975), Zylman (1975), Barsby and Marshall (1977), Fingerman et al,

(1977), Wagenaar (1981), Cook and Tauchen (1982)) have been under-

taken to examine the effects of changes in the minimum legal purchasing

age on motor vehicle mortalities, ceteris paribus. While most of these

studies have concluded that a lower MPA increases the number of teenage

motor vehicle mortalities (or an increase in the MPA reduces the number

of mortalities) the change in the number of teenage motor vehicle mor-

talities cannot be attributed to one specific factor, such as the

minimum legal purchasing age, until alternative explanations are ruled

out. Fluctuations in highway safety measures, travel characteristics,

and social    and economic indicators all may influence the mortality
rates.     Factors other than the minimum legal   purchasing age will af-
fect the amount    of   alcohol consumption.

         The unique aspect of this study is that, with the exception of

Cook and Tauchen (1982), it is the first to use data for all states.

In addition, as opposed to the Cook and Tauchen study, which employs

dummy variables to account for differing state and time effects,      this
study    includes a number of state—specific independent variables, in-

cluding the HPA, to explain differences in teenage motor vehicle mor-

tality. By focusing on the impact of a number of policy manipulable

variables a more specified model is generated.
                                  —3—


       The objective of this   paper   is to fill the gap left by previous

 studies by investigating empirically factors which affect teenage

motor vehicle mortality rates. By utilizing data for the time pe-

 riod 1970 to 1975, multivariate equations are estimated for three

 time periods in order to examine and compare the before, inmiediate,

 and longer run (one—year) impact of changes In relevant variables

on mortality rates.

      Many of these variables used to explain variations in mortal-

ity rates in this study result from government regulations, but some

are exogenous to governmental actions By controlling for those

exogenous variables, the research in this paper will provide un-

biased estimates of the effectiveness of government regulations.

As such, it will be a valuable tool for government policy makers in

their efforts to reduce motor vehicle mortality rates.


                           ANALYTICAL FRANEWORK

      To study the determinants of motor vehicle mortality it is

assumed that individuals make decisions over two time periods. The

individual is concerned with the present period which he is certain

to survive, and one future period which he will survive with some

probability. His expected utility is given as:


                  E(U) —
                           U(C1, A) + (1 — ir) U(C2)                   (1)




where E(U) is expected lifetime utility; U(C1, A) is period 1 utility

which depends on period 1 consumption of all other goods except alco-

hol (C1) and the consumption of alcohol in period 1 (A). (1 —          ir is
the probability of survival to period 2. Thus ii       is   the probability

                                          of mortality. u(C2) is the utility
of not surviving or the probability
                                           including alcohol. Alcohol is not

                                    —5—

must be incurred to obtain and consume it. Such examples of these costs

 are the travel and shopping time required to nurchase alcohol. There-

 fore a youth must sacrifice scarce time as well as scarce resources to

acquire alcohol. It is plausible that time costs are smaller in states

with a larger number of retail outlets per capita. Moreover, the in-

direct cost of obtaining alcohol for a person under 21 should be lower

in states where the legal drinking age is 18 as opposed to 21. Through-

out this study the term availability is used to account for these in-

direct costs.

      Substitution of equation (3) into equation (2) yields a reduced—

form probability of mortality equation

Mortality Production Function

      A simple linear production for mortality is represented by:



                    Da0+a1A+a2H+a3P+u              .        (5)


A is the level of alcohol consumption, H is a vector of highway vari-

ables (rural—urban highway mix, highway travel density, gasoline con—

sumption, driver's license age, and vehicle insnection requirement),

F is a vector of social and economic indicators (educational level,

health care, and unemployment) and u is a random error term with the

usual properties. The alcohol demand function depends on the
                                 —6—


following set of variables:



                                                              (6)
                    A.b0+b1P+b2C+b31+V

P is actual price, C is a vector of availability factors (minimum legal

purchasing age, type of state control, number of establishments, border

state price difference and border state age difference), I is personal

income, and v is a random error term with the usual properties. Sub-

stituting equation (6) into equation (5) yields estimates of the total

impact of both policy and non—policy variables on teenage motor vehicle

mortality. The reduced form equation actually estimated is:



                                                              (7)
                D=a0+a1b0+a1b1P+a1b2C+a1b31

                       + a2H + a3F + a1u + u



      The starting point for the empirical work in this paper is the

interest in the policy manipulable variables; the minimum legal pur—

chasing age, the minimum driving age, the price of liquor and its

availability, etcetera, on teenage motor vehicle mortality. There-

fore, the empirical work will provide estimates of the effects of

these variables on teenage motor vehicle mortality, and in particular,

of (a1, b1), l' b2), (a1, b3), a2 and   a3.

                            EMPIRI CAL IMPLEMENTATION

        Equation (7)   is estimated for white males between the ages of

  fifteen   to twenty—four who reside in 49 of the 50 states in the
 United States plus the District of Columbia.4 The dependent variable,

 the motor vehicle mortality rate, is defined as the number of deaths

 per 1,000 population per year for this group in each jurisdiction

 (MRWM). The justification for the use of a dependent variable that

 is race and sex specific is as follows. Male death rates are much

 higher than female death rates and white death rates are much higher

 than those of non whites.5 Thus, pooling is inappropriate. In addi-

 tion, preliminary results revealed significant race differences in

 slope coefficients which supported the use of race specific data.6

 By concentrating on the white male group factors that affect the ex-

 ceedingly large mortality rate for this group can be identified.

      Although the highest minimum    legal   purchasing age is 21, mortal-

ity data for the 21 to 24 year old age group is included for two rea-

sons. First, it accounts for fatalities that are caused by drfvers

under the age of 21 to those passengers who are in the 21—24 year old

group. Secondly, the effects of other policy manipulable variables

on this older age group can be examined.

      The time period chosen is the years 1970 through 1975. During

this period an important change occurred in one of the independent

variables commonly believed to have a significant impact on the motor

vehicle mortality rate for this specific age group. As discussed

earlier, between 1970 and 1975, many States reduced the minimum legal

purchasing age to below 21 for distilled spirits. A majority of these
                                      —8—

changes were concentrated in the years 1972 and 1973 (3 between 1970

and 1971, 21 between 1972 and 1973, and 1 between 1974 and 1975). To

control for the possibility of a difference between the short—run and

longer—run response to changes in the TIPA separate regressions are run

for three time periods: 1970—71, 1972—73, 1974—75 which are termed

Period 1, Period 2, and Period 3, respectively. Period 1 will examine

the effect of the independent variables on mortality rates prior to

NPA law changes; Period 2 will examine the short—run impact; and

Period 3 the longer (one—year or more) impact. The advantage of this

method is that it allows for the possibility of a lagged effect of a

change in the MPA on teenage motor vehicle mortality. Previous

studies have not examined both the short—run and longer—run effects.

        The   dependent and independent variables are two—year averages,
whenever   possible.    Two—year averages were taken to attenuate random

elements in the variables that were obtained at the state level.

Table 1 contains definitions, means, and standard deviations for all

the dependent and independent variables for the three time periods.

The headings indicate how these variables     relate to the theoretical
factors    appearing in equation (7).


Measurement of Independent Variables

        The independent variables in this study can be characterized as

availability variables, highway variables, and socioeconomic variables.

Most of the variables are adequately described in Table 1 and need no
further elaboration. Those variables that need additional explanation

are    discussed in this   section.

        With regard to the availability variables, the price variable for
distilled spirits is the retail selling price including tax of a four—

fifth quart of Seagram 7 Crown. This price is selected because Seagram

7 Crown is the leading brand of liquor in the United States, and its

price is commonly used as a standard in the liquor industry.7 The own

price   of liquor is deflated by a state and time—specific cost—of—living
index to obtain the own relative     price of this variable (LIQPR). The

Interstate   price index was developed for the year 1967 by Fuchs, Michael,
and Scott (1979). Cross—sectional price indexes for years other than
1967 are developed by assuming that year—to—year t,ercentage changes for
each state equal the year—to—year percentage     change in   the Bureau of
Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index for the U.S.     as a   whole.
        The independent variable generally considered and cited as an im-

portant determinant of teenage motor vehicle mortality rates is the

minimum   legal   purchasing age. Each state has direct control of the age

at which alcohol can be purchased. Typically, the same minimum pur-

chasing age is imposed on the consumption of liquor, wine, and beer.

However, a few states have two minimum purchasing ages. One is for

distilled spirits and a lower one is imposed on the consumption of

beer and wine. In addition, the maximum alcohol content of beer and

vine Is specified for the lower age group. Typically the alcohol con-

tent of beer is limited to 3.2 percent and for wine 14 percent. Since

there is a high correlation between changes in the liquor and beer pur—

chasing   ages, the minimum   age for liquor (ACE) is chosen.

        Lewit and Coate (forthcoming) in a study of cigarette consumption
have   pointed out that it Is difficult to define the relevant price
                                       15 —




variable    due to the purchase, by those individuals in a high price area,

of cigarettes in a lower priced border area. This problem presents it-

self in two ways regarding alcohol consumption. Not only may the price

variable be lower, but the minimum purchasing age may be lower in a

border state. This problem is dealt with via the following method.

         The incentive to travel to a lower price and/or age border state

is higher the greater the difference between own once and lower border

state price as well as own age and lower border state age. Increased

travel distance will affect the probability of mortality. To control

for the border phenomenon (out—of—state i,urchases) the difference

between own price and lower border state price and the difference be-

tween own state and border state minimum      purchasing   age are obtained.

The difference variables are not available on an individual basis, but

on a state—specific basis. The difference variable will only he rele-

vant for    the percentage of the population that lives within a certain
distance    of a border state. The estimate of the relevant population

is obtained by aggregating the population of counties that border a

lower    age and/or price state. The percentage of   the border county

population    total to the state total is then multiplied by the differ-
ence variables    to obtain weighted price and age differences. The

weighted price difference and weighted age difference are entered as

separate independent variables in the regressions. An increase in the

difference variables should provide an incentive to travel to a border

state.

         The variable for the difference between own price and lower    border
state   price is also divided by the state—specific cost—of—living index
                                  — 16 —




to   obtain the relative price difference (APDR). The difference between

the own state age and border state age is denominated in years (AMD).

       The availability measures are subject to government regulation.

By including these variables, the effect of government regulation on

teenage motor vehicle mortality can be measured.

       The highway measures are for the most part self—explanatory. The

effect of density and the urban—rural driving mix, however is somewhat

complex. To account for urban—rural death rate differences, the ratio

of urban to rural highway mileage is entered as an independent variable

(URR). States which are characterized by a large percentage of rural

highways should have Increased distance to be traveled to places at

which alcohol is available. In addition to the urban—rural mix, rural

and urban densities (MUNHT, RIJRHT) are employed. These densities are

the amount of vehicle miles per respective highway miles. Increased

density is generally expected to increase the probability of an

accident at a given speed and thereby the risk of death [see Peltzman

(1975, p. 710)). Increased density, however, may force the average

speed to be lower and can result in fewer deaths. Rural mortality

rates are typically higher than urban rates for the population as a

whole. The speed limit is not taken into account directly, since

data on vehicle speed are not available on a state specific basis.

The   inclusion of the three variables (URR, MUNUT, RURUT)   should pro—

vide   an indirect estimate of the effects of speed.
        The socioeconomic characteristics of youths in each state are
represented by four variables. The first, the state per capita

personal income, is an indication of the adolescent's command     over
                                   — 17 —



 resources.   Money income is deflated by the state Consumer Price Incex

 to obtain real income (INCR). The number of hospitals with emergency

 rooms ner capita (HOSP) serves as a proxy for the availability of

medical resources to an accident victim. A sex and race specific

education variable is entered to account for possible differences in

the ability to read road signs, pay attention to safety and other fac-

tors. The final variable is the state unemployment rate (UN). Though

a higher unemployment rate may reduce the command over resources to

purchase alcohol, gasoline, etcetera, it will also provide more

leisure time available for alcohol consumption and driving. Unemploy-

ment could have psychological effects that may lead to increased alco-

hol consumption.


                               EMPIRICAL RESULTS

        The ordinary least—squares regressions of white male motor vehi-

cle mortality rates for the three time periods are presented in Table 2.

These regressions are unweighted.8 The regressions contain the full

set of Independent varIables that estImate the effect of alcohol avaIl-

ability, highway, and socioeconomic factors on motor vehicle mortality

rate outcomes.

        The results pertaining to the minimum legal purchasing age are

strong, A decrease in the minimum legal purchasing age is generally

cited   as the principal cause of increased mortality rates for this
group and has been changed as a direct result of state legislation.
For white males the age variable has the expected negative sign for
all time periods, and reaches a significant level in the third period.
In this period AGE becomes significant at the 1 percent level.

         An important implication of the significant sign of the AGE vari-

able for white males in the third period is that a lag exists between

the implementation of the law reducing the MPA and the consequences

thereof. Thus, studies undertaken to examine changes in both consump-

tion and mortality limnediately succeeding an age change may not accu-

rately state the full impact of law changes.

         Before estimating the full impact of a change in the minimum

legal purchasing age the significance of the border phenomenon (the

traveling to border states to purchase and/or consume alcohol because

of a difference in the legal drinking age) will be explored. The vari-

able AND, measuring the difference between the own state minimum pur-

chasing age and the border state minimum purchasing age was entered as

an independent variable. The coefficient of the age difference vari-

able (AND) is positive and significant for two of the three time   pe-
riods.

         As the results show, the border nroblem (crossing state lines to

obtain alcohol) is clearly relevant with regard to the age effects for

white males. The significance of the value of the border age difference

(AND), indicates that those states.which have on theirborder states

with a lower drinking age can expect to have a higher motor vehicle

mortality rate. If the incentive to search for sources of alcohol re-

quires increased travel distance and results in driving back to the

higher age state while under the influence of alcohol the cost of this

search (in terms of lives) is clearly evident.

      The significance of the above results is that it addresses the

issue put forth by both Wagenaar (1981) and Cook and Tauchen (1982)
                                  — 20 —




as to the need to consider the border nroblem.9 The results suggest

that studies which have concentrated on variations in mortality rates

in a single state only after reductions in the MPA may understate the

true cost of such legislation.

      The total impact of a change in the minimum legal purchasing

age can now be evaluated. A change in the MPA in one state will

not only increase mortality in the state instituting the law change,

but this change may also affect mortality in the border state. An

important implication of the above is that a rise in the minimum

legal nurchasing age to 21 in all states will significantly reduce

the number of teenage motor vehicle mortalities. The findings of

this paper suggest that an increase in the !PA   to   21 in all states

would result in decrease in the mortality rate of 15—24 year—old

white males by 4 per 100,000 population.10 Thus, it can be approxi-

mated that over 700 lives per year would have been saved for this

age—race group.

      The results regarding the remaining independent variables are

now discussed.

      The coefficients of LIOPR show that the liquor price variable

never has a significant negative impact on mortality. The price differ-

ence variable has the "wrong" sign, but is never significant. These

results may be due to the exclusion of an appropriate price variable

for beer since beer tends to be the most popular alcoholic beverage

for this age group."

      The coefficient of the availability measure, NLIS is positive

and significant for two out of the three time periods. A larger

number      of   licenses per capita implies increased access and lowers the

cost of obtainment. While increased access may also require less

travel and a possible lover probability of mortality, the positive

sign of the coefficient of NTIS provides support to the contention

that increased availability of alcohol adds to increases in consump-

tion and mortality.

           With regard to the availability measure TYPCON, a dichotomous

variable that equals one if the state Is a license state (privately—

owned liquor stores) and zero If the state is a control state (state

monopoly of liquor stores), the coefficient is significant for white

males in all three time periods. In each time period, however, the

coefficient       has the "wrong" sign.
           Additional analysis revealed that when TYPCON           was   dropped from
the    regression equation the license variable (NLIS) was no longer

significant in the second           or third periods. Thus, the impacts of
NLIS must be interpreted with caution.'2

           Turning now     to   the highway variables, the effect of gasoline

consumption per capita (GCPC)           on motor vehicle mortality is clearly
evident. The sign of GCPC is positive and significant for all time

periods. A look back at the means of              the mortality rates and gaso-
line   consumption per capita shows the decline in both over time.

This   is attributed to both the higher gasoline prices              which occurred
in   the    1970's   and   the reduction in    the speed limit to a maximum     of
55 miles     per hour at the end of 1974         (see   National Safety Council
Reports, 1974—1975). The            results   indicate   that   the positive effect
of a decline in gasoline consumption has been lower mortality rates.

        The   interpretation   of the highway variables reflecting both driving

density (MUNUT, RURUT) and the urban—rural highway mix (URR) is difficult.

The variable RURUT was dropped from the analysis due to a high correla-

tion with MUNHT. Variations in mortality rates for white males, however,

can be explained by the two above variables (MUNHT, URR).         For white

males these highway variables (MUNIIT, URR) are significant five out of

six times. These results show that while increased density may increase

the probability of an accident, and thereby death, the discouragement

of faster driving due to this density appears to dominate. This helps

to explain the persistent excess of rural over urban death rates.

        The last two highway variables, DL and INSP, are not significant

in any of the time periods. For the ins'ection variable the negative

sign is consistent with the findings of Fuchs and Leveson (1967, p.           659)

in their analysis of the effectiveness of vehicle inspection in reducing

mortality for all age groups.

        The socioeconomic variables (INCR, HOSP, WME, UN) are now      briefly
discussed. The effect of income is not significant for the white male

group. Differences in income do not contribute to differences in mortal-

ity rates among states. The variable used as a proxy        for   the availabil-

ity of health care (HOSP) varies in sign but is never significant.            The

unemployment variable (UN) is only significant in the second time         pe-
riod.

        The education measure has a significant negative effect in all

time periods. The negative sign of WME is as was expected. Higher

educational levels may imply increased awareness of the dangers asso-

ciated with drinking and driving.

                                CONCLUS IONS

      The purpose of this study has been to examine the effects of gov-

ernment regulations on the 15 to 24 year old white male motor vehicle

mortality rate. Particular emphasis was placed on the role of alcohol

availability variables such as the minimum legal purchasing age in the

jurisdictions under consideration.

      The effects of a change in the MPA is consistent with that found

by previous studies. The findings of this study, however, revealed

that two additional factors must be considered when changing the MPA.

Not only may changes in motor vehicle mortality be subject to a lag,

but as a result of individuals crossing state borders to obtain alco-

hol in lower !4PA states a higher probai1ity of mortality can be ex-

pected. The implementation of a nationally mandated minimum pur-

chasing age of 21 could significantly reduce the number of teenage

motor vehicle mortalities. However, before such policy decisions are

made the significant role of the highway variables as well as the un-

expected results of many of the availability variables must be con-

sidered. Alternative policy changes such as increased enforcement of

drunk driving, stiffer penalties for driving under the influence of

alcohol, or a change in factors that affect the availability of alcohol

(other than the NPA) may achieve the desired results.

      The results of this study will serve as a useful reference tool

for policy makers in evaluating the cost and benefits of alternative

decisions in their efforts to reduce teenage motor vehicle mortality.

the ages of 15 and 24 were as follows: 74.8 deaths per 100,000 popu-

lation for white males, 22.3 for white females, 54.5 for nonwhite males,

and   16.2   for nonwhite females [National Center for Health Statistics

      6A Chow test was conducted to determine the equality of the re-

gression coefficients for the two race groups. The computed F—test

rejected the hypothesis of the equality of the two sets of regression

coefficients.


      7Simon (1966) also adopted this methodology in hiB study of the

price elasticity of liquor.


      8The Goldld—Quandt (1965) test was applied to the regressions.

In all cases the F—statistic calculated on the residuals was not sig-

nificant. Thus, hoinoscedasticity of the error terms was assumed and

unveighted analysis is appropriate.


      9Cook and Tauchen (1982) consider the border problem by incor-

porating an age variable weighted by the percentage of the population

that lives within a certain distance of a lower MPA    state.   These

results, however, were unsatisfactory.

       This result was obtained from the followin model.

                   D' =a0+a121

          To evaluate the effect of an increase in the MPA to 21 in all

states:

                       —    =     (21 —          — a2Z



          From     Table   1 in Period 3


                   A0 = 19.61             Z =   .225


               —   5   (1.39)   (—.024) —       (.042)   (.225) — .043


This is a 6 tercent reduction in the mortality rate.


     Beer and vine tax rates were used as a proxy for price, but were

later dropped from the analysis due to a high correlation with the

liquor price variable. In preliminary work the coefficients of these

variables were not significant.

          The positive sign of the liquor price variable may also be due

to substitution effects. Although the variable for beer price was

not significant in any of the regressions both beer and illegal drugs

are substitutes for distilled spirits. A higher price for liquor can

result in a substituion towards beer and illegal drugs. The consump-

tion of beer and drugs impedes the ability to drive and thus may in-

crease the probability of mortality. The unavailability of price data

for illegal drugs, however, does not enable this conclusion to be

confirmed.

     '2When   NLIS was dronped from the analysis the variable TYPCON was
negative and   significant at the 1 percent level in periods 1 and 3 and

at the 10 percent level in period 2. Additional analysis on license
states ( n 33) revealed that the NLIS was only significant in the
second period.
