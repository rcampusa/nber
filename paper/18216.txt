                                             ABSTRACT

This paper uses recently released data from a national longitudinal sample to present new evidence
of the longer term effects of adolescent depression on labor market outcomes. Results suggest reductions
in labor force attachment of approximately 5 percentage points and earnings reductions of approximately
20% for individuals with depressive symptoms as an adolescent. These effects are only partially reduced
when controlling for channels operating through educational attainment, adult depressive symptoms,
or co-occurring illnesses. Further, the unique structure of the data allows for high-school fixed effects
as well as suggestive evidence using sibling comparisons, which allows controls for potentially important
unobserved heterogeneity. Overall, the results suggest that the links between adolescent depression
and labor market outcomes are quite robust and important in magnitude, suggesting that there may
be substantial labor market returns to further investments in treatment opportunities during adolescence.

Introduction
       Early onset depression is an often crippling mental illness that has been shown to
be strongly linked with many important life outcomes, such as educational attainment and
labor market outcomes (Fletcher 2010, Berndt et al. 2000, Ettner et al. 1997, Marcotte
and Wilcox-Gok 2003). The World Health Organization has recently ranked depression
among the most disabling illnesses affecting the world’s population; it currently ranks 4th
behind lower respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases, and perinatal conditions and is
expected to climb to second place by 2020. Depression affects nearly 340 million people
worldwide, including 18 million people in the US at any point in time (Murray and Lopez
1996), and it is estimated that the economic burden of depression in 2000 in the US was
83.1 billion dollars (Greenberg et al. 2003). This figure is driven largely by workplace
costs, which were estimated to be 51.5 billion dollars. Recent findings suggest that
employees treated for depression incur annual health and disability costs of nearly
$5,500, which is significantly more than costs for other illnesses such as hypertension
and back problems and similar to the costs for diabetes and heart disease (Druss et al.
2000). However, most of these estimates may be partly attributable to environment and
family-level confounding factors as well as issues of reverse causality, which may bias
upward typical estimates. With such substantial potential costs attached to depression, it
is important to further understand how it is linked to labor force outcomes, among other
outcomes, by leveraging new data and research designs not typically used in this
literature. Also needed is an examination of the potential longer term costs of adolescent
depression that have not been explored in the literature.
       Chatterji et al. (2008) describe three mechanisms through which psychiatric
disorders may limit employment: (1) affect factors such as mood, memory, or motivation
(2) employer taste based discrimination and (3) employer’s unwillingness to
accommodate health problems. In fact, there is some support for a relationship between
(contemporaneous) mental illness and impaired productivity as well as work absences
(Adler et al. 2006, Bernt et al. 1998, Chatterji et al. 2007, Kessler and Frank 1997).
Less proximal factors that could reduce employment or labor market earnings for
individuals with depressive symptoms include lower investments in human capital
(Fletcher 2008). It could also be the case that depression is not causally linked with labor



                                                                                             1
market outcomes; instead the correlation may be generated by unobserved heterogeneity,
such as long term effects of family background, as well as co-occurring illness. Another
reason that past empirical correlations may not be causal is that nearly all current studies
link depression to labor market outcomes contemporaneously, which opens up the
possibility of reverse causality—individuals may have higher depressive symptoms
because of their poor performance in the labor market. It is important for policy purposes
as well as increasing our understanding of the determinants of labor market success and
failure to provide additional evidence of whether the observed relationship is causal or
merely reflects a spurious association.
         This paper presents new evidence of the longer term effects of adolescent mental
illness on labor market outcomes by using a national longitudinal sample. Linking
adolescent measures of depression1 to adult labor market outcomes assures the direction
of association in the estimates. Additionally, the unique structure of the data allows for
high-school fixed effects as well as suggestive evidence using sibling comparisons. The
richness of the data also allows controls for many co-occurring poor health and health
behavior measures, which could have confounded earlier results. Results suggest
reductions in labor force attachment of approximately 5 percentage points and earnings
reductions of approximately 20% for individuals with depressive symptoms as an
adolescent. These effects are only partially reduced when controlling for channels
operating through educational attainment and adult depressive symptoms. While the
specifications are able to limit the majority of competing hypotheses that may imply non-
causal explanation for the depression-labor market associations, attributing the estimates
to reflecting causal relationships is likely premature. Overall, the results are suggestive
that the links between adolescent depression and labor market outcomes are quite robust
and important in magnitude, suggesting that there may be substantial labor market returns
to further investments in treatment and opportunities during adolescence.


Literature Review



1
 Throughout I will use “adolescent depression” and “adolescent depressive symptoms” interchangeably,
but the reader should note that this paper uses survey data that captures self-reported symptoms rather than
diagnosis or treatment for clinical depression.


                                                                                                           2
         While there is substantial evidence of robust and important associations between
depression and labor market outcomes, there are at least two issues that have limited the
ability to assign causality in nearly all of the current literature: (1) reverse causality and
(2) unobserved heterogeneity. The first issue is partly a limitation of most currently
available data, which measure mental illness contemporaneously (or nearly so) with the
labor market outcomes of interest (Marcotte and Wilcox-Gok 2003)2. The second issue
is also related to data limitations, as most surveys fail to capture important environmental
factors that may influence both depression and other outcomes of interest and very few
surveys allow sibling comparisons to reduce common influences due to family
background.
         In fact, nearly all current evidence of the impacts of mental illness on labor
market outcomes uses contemporaneous measures of illness. Frank and Gertler (1991)
find a 21 percent reduction in earnings due to measures of mental illness. Ettner et al.
(1997) find evidence suggesting employment reductions of 11 percentage points for those
with mental disorder, though report less consistent evidence on earnings.3 Chatterji et al.
(2008) provide evidence that a contemporaneous psychiatric disorder is related to a
reduction of 9-11 points in the labor force participation. Several authors have attempted
to solve the issue of reverse causality by either using instrumental variables or assessing
the potential magnitude of endogeneity in the estimates. For example, Ettner et al. (1997)
and other authors have used parental history of mental illness as an instrument for own
mental illness. Alexandre and French (2001) used measures of religiosity as instruments.
In many cases in the literature, the instruments are questionable because it is very
difficult to find instrument candidates that are plausibly uncorrelated with unobserved
determinants of the labor market outcomes.4




2
  See Whooley et al. (2002) and Druss et al. (2001) for some recent counterexamples, though the data are
not from national samples. For example, the Druss et al. paper uses a two-year window for individuals
employed in one of three firms
3
  In results not often highlighted, Ettner et al. (1997) present some findings between psychiatric disorders
occurring before age 18 and those occurring as an adult, though the respondents are asked to retrospectively
report prior illness.
4
  Tefft (2008) proposes the use of exposure to sunlight as a potential instrument for poor mental health due
to Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). Fletcher and Lehrer (2009, 2011) examine genetic markers as
potential candidates for an instrumental variables design.


                                                                                                          3
         A second limitation with much research linking mental illness with labor force
outcomes is the inability to control for unobserved heterogeneity. For example, it may be
likely that processes at the neighborhood level affect both depressive symptoms and
employment outcomes, such as crime rates and unemployment rates. Kling et al. (2007)
present experimental evidence that living in a disadvantaged neighborhood may lead to
poor mental health as well as low educational attainments. Similarly, family background
factors may both increase the chances of poor mental health and also reduce opportunities
in the labor market. For example, in addition to using the standard set of instruments to
reduce concerns of reverse causality, Chatterji et al. (2008) implement the approach of
Altonji et al. (2005), which examines the sensitivity of the results to the magnitude of the
endogeneity problem using the rule of thumb that the selection bias based on observable
variables may be approximately the same as the selection bias from unobservable
characteristics5. The authors report relatively robust results for the contemporaneous
relationship between mental illness and employment for men, while the results for
women are more sensitive to specification.
         Finally, there are many illnesses and behaviors that are co-occurring with
depression. For adolescents, depression is associated with poor health and behavioral
outcomes, including higher risks of disruptive behaviors, anxiety, substance abuse, unsafe
sexual practices, and greater likelihood of being involved in fights (Saluja et al. 2004).
Likewise, approximately 45 percent of adults with any kind of psychiatric disorder in the
past 12 months meet diagnostic criteria for two or more psychiatric disorders (Kessler et
al. 2005a). There appears to be little previous research that is able to account for these
types of unobserved heterogeneity. Zimmerman and Katon (2005) appears to be one
exception, where the authors use the NLSY data and individual fixed effects but focus on
estimating robust relationships between employment status and contemporaneous
depressive symptoms and do not have many time-varying covariates. 6 Tekin and

  This method estimates a bivariate specification and examines the sensitivity of the results based on
different values of the correlation coefficient “rho”, which is the correlation between the error terms in the
two equations
6
  In related literature, Fletcher (2010) uses sibling differences to examine the effects of depression on
completed schooling.


                                                                                                                 4
Markowitz (2008) use sibling differences in their examination of the association between
suicidal behaviors and “productive activities” (either being in school or employed).7
        This paper is able to overcome several important challenges to previous research.
In addition to using a national, longitudinal survey, the structure of the data allows
confidence in the direction of the estimated relationships, limiting the issue of reverse
causality, and also allows controls for environmental and family unobserved
heterogeneity as well as individual level heterogeneity, including health behaviors and
conditions that co-occur with depression.


Data
        The Add Health is a school-based, longitudinal study of the health-related
behaviors of adolescents and their outcomes in young adulthood. Beginning with an in-
school questionnaire administered to a nationally representative sample of students in
grades 7 through 12 in 1994-95 (Wave 1), the study follows up with a series of in-home
interviews of respondents approximately one year (Wave 2; 1996), six years (Wave 3;
2001-2002), and thirteen years later (Wave 4; 2007-2008). Other sources of data include
questionnaires for parents, siblings, fellow students, and school administrators. By
design, the Add Health survey included a sample stratified by region, urbanicity, school
type, ethnic mix, and size.8 Add Health represents a substantial improvement in previous
data for research on depression and labor market outcomes because it: (1) is longitudinal
(2) includes an instrument for depression for the full, nationally representative sample of
7-12th graders and (3) provides links to school classmates and siblings in order to control
for several sources of unobserved heterogeneity.

7
  While Tekin and Markowitz use the same data as the current paper, there are many important differences
in the focus and implementation. First, they focus on suicidal behaviors rather than depression--depression
is just a control variable they report in some of their tables. Because depression is not their main focus,
they also use an ad-hoc measure of symptoms not related to any clinical cutoffs (whether the symptoms
were above the 80th percentile). Second, they use Wave 3 of Add Health and I am able to use Wave 4.
The reason they focus on "productive activities" rather than labor market outcomes in their paper is the
average age of the respondents is 22 years old in Wave 3, and thus nearly 50% of the sample is still in
school, which makes it difficult to focus on wages and employment outcomes. Therefore, they do not
examine employment in a traditional way (it is a combined measure of work or school) nor examine wages
at all. In contrast, the current paper examines wages and employment outcomes at age 30, when nearly all
the individuals have completed their schooling. The current paper is the first to actually examine the
associations between adolescent depressive symptoms and wages and employment using a national sample
with the ability to compare siblings.

                                                                                                         5
         While the original wave 1 sample collected information on over 20,000
respondents, approximately 15,000 were followed longitudinally at wave 3 and wave 4.
Limiting the sample to those who appear in waves 1, 3, and 4 allows an analysis sample
of over 12,000 individuals9. At the same time, the data contain a sub-sample of siblings
who have been followed over time; this sample originally numbered approximately
5,400, over half of whom were followed (along with their co-sibling) longitudinally into
wave 4, leaving a sample size for the sibling analyses of nearly 2,80010. In order to
maximize available sample sizes for the analysis, missing family income during high
school and maternal education was sample mean-imputed and a dummy variable is
controlled. Likewise, in some of the auxiliary regressions, missing birth weight and
childhood mistreatment information is imputed in order to retain sample size.11
         Table 1 reports descriptive statistics for the analysis sample.12 The earnings data
from wave 4 come from the following question and are interval coded13: “Now think
about your personal earnings. How much income did you receive from personal earnings
before taxes—that is, wages.”14 Using this coding procedure, the average earnings for
this sample of adults (average age nearly 30) is almost $40,000. Since not all individuals
reported earnings or are in the labor force, I use this information to construct a measure

9
  Appendix Table 1A shows summary statistics comparing the sample in Wave 1 with the sample in Wave
4. The similarity of the sample across the waves suggests limited attrition bias for this study. To more
fully examine this issue, Appendix Table 2A shows that Wave 1 depression is unrelated to attrition within a
regression framework, which suggests that attrition bias is likely minimal.
10
   The reason sample attrition appears more pronounced in the sibling sub-sample than the main sample is
that if either sibling is missing at follow-up, both siblings are dropped from the sample.
11
   Some family level variables are taken from a parent survey, but over 15% of the parents did not respond
to the survey. For the students of these parents, I have imputed family income and maternal education in
two ways. First, in the paper I use regression based imputation (“impute” in Stata) and include student
level characteristics such as age, race, gender in the regression to predict the missing values and control for
missingness. Second, in auxiliary analysis, I simply assign the sample means to the missing responses and
control for missingness. In these cases the key results are nearly identical. If I instead drop those with
missing data (whose parents failed to respond—which is predicted by disadvantaged characteristics), the
results are smaller but very similar. This is what would be expected because I am now dropping those
individuals who are more likely to be depressed and have bad outcomes.
12
   Like Currie and Stabile (2006), who use sibling comparisons with other datasets, there is very little
difference across sub-samples. Fletcher and Wolfe (2008) also do not find large difference between the full
sample and sibling samples using the Add Health data. See Appendix Table 3A.
13
   The midpoint of each interval is used in the analysis. The intervals include: $0, <$5,000, $5,000-9,999,
10,000-14,999, 15,000-19,999, 20,000-24,999, 25,000-29,999, 30,000-39,999, 40,000-49,999, 50,000-
74,999, 75,000-99,999, 100,000-149,999, 150,000 or more.
14
   The interval coding does not allow an adequate examination using quantile regression specification,
though Marcotte and Wilcox-Gok (2003) use interval-coded earnings data with 23 intervals and assign the
midpoint.


                                                                                                             6
of employment, where over 80% of the sample are categorized as working (i.e. report
working over 10 hours a week). Over 40% of the sample completed some college, while
one-third reports completing college. The wave 1 measure of depression uses 19 of the
20 items of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) contained
in the Add Health dataset. This measure has been used by several researchers to examine
adolescent depression and has been shown to have good measurement properties
(Cornwell 2003, Radoff 1977, Roberts et al. 1991). The scale ranges from 0 to 57, and
Robert et al. (1991) find that the optimal cut-off scores for depression are 22 for male
adolescents and 24 for females. Using these cut-off scores, depression in the sample is
approximately 8%.15 Results that use the same depression cut-off for males and females
are nearly identical to those presented in the paper and are available upon request16.
        The data also contains rich information on health conditions and health behaviors.
Individuals report behaviors such as tobacco use (25%), sexual activity (38%), alcohol
use (41%), obese status (7%), and marijuana use (14%) at wave 1 of the survey. In Wave
3 of the survey, respondents report whether they have ever been diagnosed with asthma
(17%) or diabetes (1%), complete an assessment of childhood attention
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD) symptoms (3% for AD, 2.5% for HD) and
childhood mistreatment which is combined into a “mistreatment index” using principal
component analysis.17 Finally, in order to control for skill accumulation (apart from
years of schooling information), the analysis uses scores on the Peabody Picture
Vocabulary Test (PPVT), which was administered at wave 1.18



15
   Goodman and Whitaker (2002) use Add Health and find depression rates around 8% in waves 1 and 2.
Berndt et al. (2000) report that 15.7% of the US population has experienced an episode of major depressive
disorder between ages 15 and 24. The lifetime prevalence of major depression in the National Comorbidity
Survey Replication is 16.6% and the twelve-month prevalence is 6.6% (Kessler et al. 2003).
16
   Results that examine the effects throughout the symptom distribution are presented in Appendix Table
4A, which suggest that the effects of labor market outcomes may occur below the thresholds typically used.
These results will be the subject of future work.
17
   See Fletcher, Green, and Neidell (2010) for details on the asthma questions, Fletcher and Wolfe (2008)
for details on the ADHD scale, and Fletcher (2009) for details on the mistreatment data
18
   The Add Health Picture Vocabulary Test (AHPVT) is a computerized, abridged version of the Peabody
Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised (PPVT-R). The AHPVT is a test of hearing vocabulary, designed for
persons aged 2 1/2 to 40 years old who can see and hear reasonably well and who understand standard
English to some degree. The test scores are standardized by age. Some psychologists interpret PVT scores
as a measure of verbal IQ. Information on the test is provided online at
http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth/files/w3cdbk/w3doc.zip.


                                                                                                        7
         In Table 2, descriptive statistics are presented based on wave 1 depression status.
The differences foreshadow both some of the results in the paper and empirical issues
with comparing depressed vs. non-depressed individuals. Employment rates are 10
percentage points lower for depressed individuals and earnings are over $9,000 lower
(conditional on employment). While a similar share of individuals attend college, the
results show that 35% of non-depressed individuals graduate from college in comparison
to only 15% of depressed individuals. The depression scale at wave 4 is also higher for
individuals who experience adolescent depression (4.1) vs. those who do not (2.5).
Family background differs along several measures, where individuals with adolescent
depression come from poorer families, were less likely to grow up with married parents,
and had less educated mothers, on average19. These differences in family background as
well as unobserved family factors will be controlled in the analysis. Depressed
individuals also have several co-occurring illnesses and unhealthy behaviors—they are
more likely to be obese, have asthma, smoke marijuana and tobacco, drink alcohol, and
be sexually active. The empirical analysis will be able to control for these important
differences between depressed and non-depressed individuals.


Empirical Models
         Following much of the literature, an examination of labor force participation is
accomplished using standard techniques:
         Employment t   0  1 Depressiont 1  X 2                                    (1)
where the outcome is employment at wave 4 (time t), depression is a binary variable at
wave 1 (time t-1), the x-vector includes standard sociodemographic variables (age,
gender, race, maternal education), and the error term is assumed to be an idiosyncratic
innovation. The error term may be correlated with depression, so additional controls are
added in order to reduce this potential bias.




19
  An important caveat to these results is that (unobserved in the data) receipt of treatment may also differ
by socioeconomic status. If treatment is effective, it would lower depressive symptoms in children from
advantaged families so that depressive symptoms may be higher in disadvantaged families due in part to
differences in treatment receipt.


                                                                                                               8
         Likewise, traditional Mincer models are used to link log(earnings) with
depression and other individual and family-level characteristics ( X ) (following Marcotte
and Wilcox-Gok 2003, among others):
          log( earnings )t  0  1Depressiont 1  X 2                                 (2)
where earnings are measured at time t (wave 4) and depression is measured at wave 1.
Because some individuals in the sample report zero earnings or do not respond to the
question, the analysis will focus on those with measured earnings20. Also, this temporal
structure reduces concerns with reverse causality in the estimated effects. In order to
examine the potential biases from either community (c) or family (f) level unobserved
heterogeneity, the empirical models are expanded to allow for school-of-origin fixed
effects or family fixed effects for each outcome, Yi (employment and earnings):

         Yi   0  1 Depressioni  X i  2   c   ic                                   (3)

         Yi  0  1Depressioni  Zi  2   f   if                                      (4)

where the Z vector in equation (4) is limited to individual level variables that vary within
families (e.g. gender). A comparison of (2) and (4) will indicate whether baseline
methods are driven by omitted variable bias at the family level (Currie and Stabile, 2006;
Fletcher and Wolfe, 2008)21. Further examinations will include additional individual
level variables, including educational outcomes and co-occurring illnesses to further
examine potential pathways linking depression and labor market outcomes as well as
reduce the chances of individual-level heterogeneity.


Results
Results for Employment
         Table 3 presents baseline OLS estimates of the effects of adolescent depression on
employment at Wave 4. Column 1 shows evidence that adolescent depression is
associated with a 7.5 percentage point decrease in employment. Separating the results by
gender (columns 2 and 3) suggests that the effects are nearly twice the magnitude for


20
   If individuals with missing earnings are instead assigned zero earnings, not surprisingly the results are
even larger than those reported in the paper.
21
   It is important to note that if the depressive symptoms are measured with error, the use of sibling fixed
effects may exacerbate the bias associated with the measurement error.


                                                                                                               9
females (a female-depression interaction in a pooled model was statistically significant;
results not shown). In order to control for measures of environmental factors (e.g. local
unemployment rates) during adolescence as well as narrow the comparison groups,
controls were included for high school of origin fixed effects in column 4; however these
controls do not alter the estimates from column 1. A vector of (endogenous) health
behaviors and outcomes are controlled in column 5, which shrinks the coefficient on
depression by approximately 15%. Asthma and teenage smoking reduces adult
employment while alcohol consumption is positively related.22 This evidence is
suggestive that the effects of remaining unobservables that may bias the estimate are
modest.
         One pathway that may link adolescent depression with employment is human
capital accumulation (Fletcher 2008, 2010). Column 6 adds controls for educational
attainment, which reduces the coefficient on adolescent depression to 5 percentage
points23. Finally, a separate pathway linking adolescent depression to employment is the
persistence of depression. Column 7 controls for depressive symptoms at wave 4, which
reduces the coefficient on adolescent depression symptoms to 3.3 percentage points.
Two additional pathways were examined and available upon request—whether the
respondent was “ever married” and a measure of skills—the respondent’s score on the
PPVT test at Wave 3. These variables had no detectable influence on the relationship
between adolescent depression and adult employment. These results suggest both a large
total impact of adolescent depression on future employment as well as two important
pathways—human capital accumulation and the persistence of the illness.
         To further examine an alternative potential explanation for the link between
depression and employment—shared family background factors—Table 4 examines
sibling comparisons. Columns 1 and 2 show that the baseline results from Table 3 are
similar for the sibling sub-sample—an 8 percentage point reduction in employment that is
largely immune to controlling for high school of origin. Column 3 focuses on within-
sibling comparisons by controlling for family fixed effects, reducing the association to

23
  In these and similar results throughout the paper, it is important to recall that adding endogenous
intermediate outcomes (such as education) will not allow a clear picture of the potential causal effects of
adolescent depression on later labor market outcomes. These analyses are performed to descriptively
examine the differences across specifications and control vectors.


                                                                                                              10
under 6 percentage points (p-value < 0.16). Columns 4 and 5 separate the results into
brother-pairs and sister-pairs and again finds that the employment effects of depression
appear largely concentrated among women, who experience a 10 percentage point
reduction (p-value < 0.15). Column 6 attempts to control for individual heterogeneity
within families, but these controls actually increase the coefficient to over 6 percentage
points (column 6 vs. column 3). Columns 7 and 8 show that some of the effect of
adolescent depression and adult employment may be related to the level of education and
adult depression. Finally, the sister and brother-pair specifications are revisited in the
final two columns to show that the results are similar in magnitude. In results not shown,
I examine whether there is evidence that individuals who sought psychological
counseling before wave 4 seem to have differential outcomes, but no results are
statistically significant (results available upon request).24 Additionally, I find no
interaction effects between reporting a diagnosis of depression by wave 3 and adolescent
depressive symptoms (results available upon request).25 Overall, the effects of adolescent
depression on adult employment appear concentrated in women, are only partially
explained by education and adult depression, and the magnitude of the coefficient is quite
robust to controls for several sources of heterogeneity.


Results for Earnings
         Results for log(earnings) are presented in Tables 5 and 6. It is important to note
that these empirical models are conditional on employment. Baseline OLS results in
column 1 of Table 5 indicate a nearly 23%26 earnings reduction for those with adolescent
depression.27 Splitting the sample by gender in columns 2 and 3 shows very little
difference in effects. The entire black earnings disadvantage appears concentrated in
men, while the entire Hispanic earnings premium is concentrated in women. Like
previous results, school fixed effects (shown in column 4) do not affect the findings.
Adjusting for health behaviors and health conditions in column 5 shows a slight reduction

24
   Unfortunately, the questions for psychological counseling available in the data are not specific to
counseling for depression, but are asked for any counseling experience.
25
   Unfortunately, medication information is not available in the data
26
   This calculation uses the exp(beta)-1 formula.
27
   Results using interval regression are nearly identical to those reported in column 1 and are available upon
request.


                                                                                                           11
in the depression-earnings association, which now indicates a 20% penalty. Like
previous research (Cawley 2004), obesity is found to be associated with lower earnings,
as is high school marijuana use and tobacco use, asthma, diabetes and childhood
mistreatment. Column 6 adds controls for educational attainment, which shrinks the
coefficient on adolescent depression by approximately 25% to a 16% earnings reduction.
Controlling for contemporaneous depression reduces the earnings disadvantage to nearly
12%--still a substantial difference, which is similar in magnitude to the adjusted black-
white earnings gap. Similar to prior literature, the earnings effect of contemporaneous
depression is also important. Finally, two additional pathways were examined, but not
reported in the tables—whether the respondent was “ever married” and a measure of
adult skills—the respondent’s score on the PPVT test at Wave 3. These variables had no
detectable influence on the relationship between adolescent depression and adult
employment.
        Results controlling for family background are presented in Table 6. Column 1
shows that the results for the sibling sample are quite similar to the full sample and also
shows that school fixed effects do not change the results—a nearly 30% earnings
reduction from adolescent depression. Column 3 adds family fixed effects controls,
which reduces the coefficient slightly. Although some coefficients that follow are
sometimes not statistically significant at conventional levels, the magnitudes generally
follow the results from the baseline specifications, which indicates that they are relatively
robust. Interestingly, the adjusted male-female difference in earnings does not change
once family fixed effects are controlled. Columns 4 and 5 separate the results by gender
and find that, unlike employment, the earnings effects of depression appear heavily
concentrated among men, which differs from the results from the full sample without
controls for family fixed effects.28 The difference in results between the basic model and
the preferred specification with fixed effects may suggest that, within families, a part of
the effect operates through intrahousehold allocations. Moving back to the results for
both genders, column 6 controls for additional individual heterogeneity associated with
co-occurring health conditions and unhealthy behaviors. The estimated magnitudes of

  An interaction between depression and gender in unreported results also suggested that the effects are
concentrated on men (statistically significant at the 10% level).


                                                                                                           12
the earnings results are not affected by these controls, nor are they substantially affected
by inclusion of human capital accumulation (column 7). Consistent with prior research,
birth weight differences are shown to be related to earnings reductions (Black et al.
2007). Even within sibling pairs, obesity is shown to reduce earnings by nearly 20% and
adolescent tobacco use is associated with a nearly 14% earnings reduction, though this
effect is partially explained by human capital accumulation differences. In column 8,
there is some evidence that adolescent depression may reduce wages in part due to the
likelihood of adult depression, but again this type of analysis is descriptive rather than
definitive.


Conclusion
         This paper provides the best available evidence that adolescent depressive
symptoms are associated with adult employment and earnings. This evidence advances
previous literature because it is immune to issues of reverse causality and also allows
controls for unobserved heterogeneity at the environmental and family levels as well as
many measures of co-occurring health outcomes and behaviors. Overall, the magnitude
(though not always the statistical significance) of the results are quite robust across
specifications and suggest that adolescent depression reduces adult employment by
approximately 5 percentage points and earnings by 20 percent.29 Further, the
employment reductions appear to be concentrated among the women and the earnings
reductions appear to be concentrated among the men. While these results are not
conclusive due to remaining threats of unobserved heterogeneity, the ability to control for
a range of important factors (e.g. family fixed effects, test scores, co-morbid illness) is
highly suggestive that any remaining bias associated with unobservables is likely modest.
         To place these results into perspective, Leigh and Gill (1997) present evidence of
an 8-10 percent earnings premium associated with community college completion.
Currie and Hyson (1999) report wage reductions of between 2-4 percent associated with
low birth weight status. Both of these comparisons suggest that interventions that can
reduce adolescent depressive symptoms have the potential to be quite cost effective.

29
  As there is some evidence from the literature that the effects of mental illness are differential across the
earning distribution (Marcotte and Wilcox-Gok 2003), it would be interesting to pursue this question as
continuous earnings data become available in complementary datasets.


                                                                                                             13
       While not conclusive, the results could be policy relevant along several
dimensions. First, the results suggest that adolescent depressive symptoms may be an
important determinant of labor market outcomes. Increasing our understanding of labor
market outcomes may allow additional policies to be suggested to increase labor force
participation and productivity, which could have long term implications for important life
outcomes such as income and wealth accumulation, occupation, and adult population
health. Second, the results suggest that interventions that successfully reduce depressive
symptoms during adolescence may have downstream benefits that may not be
comprehensively measured in many cost-benefit analyses and suggest that further
interventions may be desirable. For example, even though depression is generally highly
responsive to treatment, adolescents have low rates of recognition and diagnosis
(Hirschfeld et al 1997). Increases in treatment options, particularly for high schoolers,
may provide substantial long term benefits in terms of future labor productivity.
