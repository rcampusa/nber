              Excess Sensitivity of Consumption to Current Income:
                        Liquidity Constraints or Myopia?


                                   ABSTRACT


     Almost all of the recent empirical tests of the rational expectations —

permanent income hypothesis (RE—PIH) have rejected the hypothesis. The null

hypothesis in this empirical literature typically consists of the joint

hypothesis that 1) agents' expectations are formed rationally, 2) desired

consumption is determined by permanent income, and 3) capital markets are

"perfect" in the sense that agents can lend or borrow against expected future

income at the same interest rate. This paper attempts to determine whether

the excess sensitivity of consumption to current income can be attributed

to a failure of the third component of the joint hypothesis ——   the assumption
of "perfect" capital markets —— as opposed to a failure of one or both of

the first two assumptions.

     The paper examines, as a specific alternative to the PIH, a simple

"Keynesian" consumption function in which the behavioral MPC out of transitory

income is different from zero. Interpreting the unemployment rate as a proxy

for the proportion of the population subject to liquidity constraints, the

paper uses a generalized version of the econometric model in my earlier paper

(1981) to conduct a specification test of the "Keynesian" consumption function.

The finding that the estimate of the MPC out of transitory income is drama-

tically affected, in both magnitude and statistical significance, by the

inclusion of the proxy for liquidity constraints suggests that liquidity con-

straints are an important part of the explanation of the observed excess

sensitivity of consumption to current income.

      Almost all of the recent empirical tests of the rational expectations —

 permanent income hypothesis (RE—PIH) have rejected the hypothesis.1 Using a

 rich variety of data sets and estimation methods, the empirical work indicates

 that the failure of the RE—PIlL Is significant, both statistically and quanti-

 tatively. The null hypothesis in this empirical literature typically consists

of the joint hypothesis that 1) agents' expectations are formed rationally, 2)

desired consumption is determined by permanent income, and 3) capital markets

are "perfect" In the sense that agents can lend or borrow against expected

future income at the same interest rate. Most previous studies have concluded

that consumption is more sensitive to current income than is consistent with

the joint hypothesis stated above, without attempting to determine which

component of the joint hypothesis is responsible for the rejection.

     This paper attempts to determine whether the excess sensitivity of con-

sumption to current income can be attributed to a failure of the third compon-

ent of the joint hypothesis ——   the   assumption of "perfect" capital markets ——

as opposed to a failure of one or both of the first two assumption. The first

two assumptions simply reflect the basic postulates that economic agents form

expectations rationally and make decisions based on Intertemporal utility

maximization. If these postulates fail in the context of consumption behav-

ior, some doubt is cast on their validity in other macroeconomic applications.

If, on the other hand, capital market imperfections prevent agents from foll-

owing their desired, permanent—income consumption path, the observed excess

sensitivity of consumption to current income may be fully consistent with

the basic postulate of the rational, forward looking agent.

     This paper examines, as a specific alternative to the permanent income

hypothesis, a simple "Keynesian" consumption function in which the behavioral

MPC out of transitory income is different from zero. Empirical evidence that
                                                                                     2



the MPC out of transitory income is significantly different from zero is inter-

preted as evidence of myopic behavior; that is, evidence of a violation of

one or both of the basic postulates of rational expectations and intertemporal

utility maximization. As a specification test of the "Keynesian" consumption

function, the consumption equation is modified by the inclusion of an additional

variable; if the coefficient of the additional variable is different from zero,

then the simple "Keynesian" consumption function is incorrect or incomplete.

In principle, the specification test could be executed for an arbitrary choice

of the additional variable. However, because the purpose of the paper is to

investigate whether the observed excess sensitivity of consumption to current

income arises because capital market imperfections (liquidity constraints)

prevent agents from realizing their desired consumption paths, the specifica-

tion of the simple "Keynesian" consumption function is tested with respect

to a variable which is selected as a proxy for the severity or prevalence of

liquidity constraints. Interpreting the unemployment rate as a proxy for the

proportion of the population subject to liquidity constraints, the paper uses

a generalized version of the econometric model in my earlier paper (1981) to

conduct the specification test.

The model

      Permanent income, y, is defined as the current resource flow which,

conditional on expectations in period t, can be sustained for the remainder

of the individual's lifetime:

              =
                            T s+l
(1)               k(T)(wt + sO    Ex+)
where 5 =   l/(l+r).    In this discrete time formulation, w represents real

(nonhuman) wealth at the beginning of period t: x represents labor income,

assumed to be paid at the end of the period; and r denotes the real discount

rate. E x         denotes the mathematical expectation of x         conditional on
         t t+s                                                t+s
                                                                                        3



  Information available in period t. The length of the individual's remaining

  lifespan Is denoted T; and the annuity rate, which Is a function of T, Is

 denoted k(T).

        In an infinite horizon version of the model, T =          and k(T) has a con-

 stant value equal to the discount rate. In the finite horizon case, the

 annuity rate obeys the non—linear difference equation


 (2)         k(T—1) =   k(T)/(1+r—k(T))

 and the terminal condition k(O) = 1.

        Following Hall (1978) and FlavIn (1981), the permanent Income consumption

 hypothesis is represented as:


 (3)        c =

where      Is the marginal propensity to consume out of permanent income.

Substituting (3) into the definition of permanent Income, the evolution of

permanent income over time is given by:


            y = (l+k(T)(1— ))y1 + k(T)[w —
(4)
                                                      Eiw    +
                                                                 s=O
                                                                       6'(Et_Eti)x+]

If expectations are rational, both the expectation of next period's revision

In expected future labor Income, (Et—E 1)Xt+g, and the expectation of unan-

ticipated capital gains, Wt—Et_iWt, conditional on information available in t—

I, are equal to zero. Thus if         =   1   permanent income, as defined in equation

(1), has the random walk property


(5)        EtIY =

which was stressed by Hall (1978). If            < 1, then permanent income is a

nonstationary first order autoregressive process.

Tests of the PIH against alternative hypotheses

      In a series of nested tests, the permanent income hypothesis (PIH) is

tested against two alternative hypotheses. In the first alternative, the NPC

out of transitory income, T' is nonzero. The hypothesis is stated in first

differences rather than levels in anticipation of the specification used in

the empirical work:


(6)        Ac =        + T(AYt —


      Equation (6) includes as special cases both the PIH (with      =   0) and an
extreme form of the Keynesian consumption function in which consumption simply

responds to current income      =   ). If   0 <
                                                  T   <   consumption is deter-

mined by a blend of the permanent income and Keynesian hypotheses. Because a

nonzero value of      indicates that there is some element of truth to the

Keynesian view of consumption, equation (6) will be referred to as the

"Keynesian" consumption function.

      In addition to testing the PIH against the simple "Keynesian" alternative

hypothesis by testing the restriction T =   0,    the empirical work reported in

this paper tests the validity of the Keynesian consumption function as specified

by equation (6). As a specification test, equation (6) is modified by including

another variable, denoted


(7)
          IC   = p't +   Tt            +


If y is nonzero, the consumption function specified in equation (6) is incorrect
or incomplete. Of the many possible sources of misspecification, this paper

focuses on the potential misspecification of equation (6) arising from the

exclusion of liquidity constraints as a determinant of consumption. That is,

the specification of equation (6) is tested with respect to a variable which

is selected as a proxy for the severity or prevalence of liquidity constraints.
                                                                         5

     Of the potential explanations of the observed excess sensitivity of

consumption to current income, perhaps the most obvious is that individuals

are "myopic" in the sense that the behavioral MPC Out of transitory income,

    is substantially different from zero. If the excess sensitivity of con-

sumption to current income arises because of this type of myopic behavior on

the part of consumers, equation (6) is a valid specification of the consumption

function. Alternatively, even if individuals are rational and forward looking,

as posited by the PIH, and the behavioral MPC out of transitory income is

zero, the observed excess sensitivity of consumption to current income could

arise if liquidity constraints prevent the individual from realizing his

desired consumption plan. n individual who is unable to borrow against

expected future income and whose stock of nonhuman wealth is insufficient to

maintain the desired consumption plan for the duration that transitory income

is expected to be negative is considered to be liquidity constrained. If

consumption is constrained by current income, actual consumption and transitory

income will be positively correlated even though desired consumption may be

determined by the PIll,

     Of the variables which might proxy for the prevalence of liquidity con-

straints, the specification test focuses on the rate of unemployment. A person

becoming unemployed in a given year can expect to spend 3 to 5 months in one

or more spells of unemployment that year.3 The unemployment spell or spells

will reduce the individual's permanent income, although not by as much as the

reduction in current income. Thus individuals who are unemployed will typically

have negative transitory income.

     Whether or not a significant fraction of the population has net worth

insufficient to smooth their consumption path in the face of the negative

transitory income realizations associated with a spell or spells of unemploy—

ment is an empirical question. According to survey data on the financial

characteristics of consumers compiled by the Federal Reserve System in 1963

(Projector (1964)), 25% of all families4 and 40% of all families with income

below the median had net worth less than $3,000 (in current dollars). Further,

these families held the bulk of their assets in illiquid form (equity in home,

auto, business or profession, and life insurance, annuities, or retirement plans);

the average holdings of liquid assets, stocks, and bonds was about $300 for this

group. Thus the survey data indicates that a significant fraction of the pop—

sumption   path from the negative transitory income realizations associated with

a moderate spell of unemployment.

      Even individuals with little or no nonhuman wealth could achieve their

permanent income consumption path if they are able 1) to borrow against future

expected labor income or 2) to insure against individual—specific risk in

their labor income. While markets for collateralized consumer borrowing are

well—developed, the personal bankruptcy laws would tend to prevent or distort

the development of a market for non—collateralized consumer borrowing. Further,

the problems of adverse selection and moral hazard may explain the absence of

a private market for insurance against individual—specific risk in labor income.5

Thus there seem to be important niicroeconomic factors which indicate that the

Arrow—Debreu contingent claims markets which would eliminate liquidity con-

straints in an ideal world might not actually exist.

     If liquidity constraints are responsible, at least in part, for the excess

sensitivity of consumption to current income, an increase in the prevalence or

severity of liquidity constraints should reduce consumption, ceteris

Because the coefficient y in equation (7) represents the effect on consumption

of an increase in unemployment, the estimated value of y is expected to be neg—

ative if liquidity constraints affect consumption. It should be emphasized that
                                                                                      7




 the coefficient y is estimated for the purpose of constructing a test statistic

 to check the specification of the consumption function given by equation (6);

y should not be interpreted as a structural parameter.

       Combining equations (3) and (4), one obtains:

 (8)        c — (l+k(T)(l—     ))c      =
                                            k(T){w - E   1w +    E6(E —        Ei)x+}.
In order to simplify the estimation, the marginal propensity to consume out of

permanent income, ,    is   assumed to be exactly unity. With I3 =    1,   the left

hand side of equation (8) is simply the first difference of consumption,

       Because the implications of equation (8) will be tested using aggregate

data, it is necessary to consider the effect on aggregate consumption of a

systematic trend in per capita income. Even though an individual's permanent

income is defined (assuming          = 1) so that its movement over time is trendless,

the presence of a trend in per capita income will induce a trend in aggregate

permanent income and therefore in aggregate consumption, If per capita income

has an exponential trend, due to advances in technical knowledge, for example,

later generations will have greater lifetime wealth than earlier ones. As the

older generations die and are replaced by the younger generations, aggregate

consumption will trend upward at the same rate of growth as per capita income.

Since the model is intended to explain revisions in planned consumption which

are caused by changes in expectations about future income, equation (8) applies

to the movement of consumption around a trend attributable to the trend in

per capita income.

       If an accurate measure of nonhuman wealth were available for the sample

period under consideration (1929—1981), one could eliminate Eiw from equation

(8) by using the relation:


(9)        Eiw = (l+r)wi + x1 — cr1.
                                                                                           8



This is the basic approach taken by Hayashi (1982). However, in the absence

of a reliable and consistent series on nonhuman wealth for the 1929—81 sample

period, I take a different approach to measuring unanticipated capital gains

(w —     Eiwt)    in this paper.

        Unanticipated capital gains on nonhuman wealth can be defined as the

present value of the revision in the expected earnings associated with the

current asset holdings:6

                                     s+l
(10)
             w Et1wt          s05 (E —             Ei)r+w.
The actual path of nonlabor income, r+5w÷, will reflect both the movements

in the return to capital, r+ which we want to capture, and the endogenous

changes in earnings flows which result from the individual's decisions to

accumulate or decumulate nonhuman wealth, w
                                                        t+s
                                                              •    I assume that the time series
properties of aggregate nonlabor income are dominated by fluctations in the

rate of return to capital, r÷5 rather than the endogenous changes in w1.7

With this assumption, unanticipated capital gains are approximated as the

present value of the revision in expecled nonlabor income. Replacing w —

         with   the present value of the revision in expected nonlabor income,

equation (8) becomes:

                           T s+1
(11)              =   k(T) sO5 (E —         Ei)y+
where        denotes total (labor plus nonlabor) disposable income in period

t+s, stated in deviations from an exponential trend.

        The information content of various observable variables for predicting

future income is modeled using an autoregression which includes disposable

income as one variable:

                                                    I                 +     it

In equation (12), AA(L), AB(L), BA(L), and BB(L) are polynomials in the lag

operator, L; for example, AA(L)    = a1(L)      + a2(L) + ...   + aLn. Constant terms

are included in the autoregression but are suppressed to simplify the notation.

The disturbances, c and €2t are independently distributed across time, but

may be contemporaneously correlated.

        Inverting (12) to obtain the moving average representation of (Y,Z]

and evaluating the moving average polynomial at L =         5   =   (l+r),    one obtains

the 2 x 2 matrix which gives the partial derivative, with respect to each

innovation, of the present discounted value of the revision in the expected

available to agents,                and a component which is orthogonal to the agent's

entire information set, Cit:


               =
                   cit   + Tilt_i

            C2t = C2t + Ti2ti


The         terms are assumed to be serially uncorrelated and uncorrelated with

lagged values of         and z. By definition, the innovations perceived by

agents, c1 and            are uncorrelated with          2t—i' and lagged values of

   and z.

      In revising their estimates of permanent income, agents respond to all

available information, not just the new information contained in             and


               =   k(T) [ ct + 2t1 +

where the error term         is included to reflect the fact that agents are re-

sponding to many sources of new information in addition to the current

observations on      and Zt. As a component of the revision in permanent in-

come, O is uncorrelated with all lagged variables in the agent's information

set, including its own lagged values. Substituting equations (15) and (16)

into the permanent income consumption function yields:


               =
                   k(T)[ci      + cC2t1 {k(T)( Tilt_I + Z2t1)

To simplify the notation, denote the consumption error term as c3t:


               =   k(T)[ li +           112t 1 +

      In summary, the model consists of the 3—equation system:
 (1.l)      't i + AA(L)y + AB(L)zt + lt

 (19.2)
            at 2 + BA(L)y + BB(L)zt +


                   IL3 + k(T)[ci + (T)c2t1 +
 (19.3)


 In the empirical application of the model, the polynomials AA(L), AB(L),

 BA(L), and 13B(L) were each specified as third order. Note, from equations

 (15) and (le), that because agents form their forecasts of future income using

an information set which contains variables in addition to
                                                               t and Zt, 3t is
negatively correlated with       and E2t. Under the assumptions specified

above, the structural disturbances, c1, 2t and E3t, are each serially

uncorrelated.

       Equation system (19) represents the restricted version of the model, in

the sense that current Yt and Zt affect consumption only to the extent that

they induce agents to revise their estimate of permanent income. In the

unrestricted version of the model, the consumption equation (19.3) is replaced

with a more general specification in which consumption responds directly to

changes in t and       in addition to the response consistent with the permanent

income hypothesis:


(20)       £Ct =   3 ÷ k(T) ( £1t +   zC2t + O't +
                     + 2't—2 ÷ YOAZ +                       + 3t
                                      Y1AZt 1 +

Equation (20) is a generalization of equation   (8) in   the sense that lagged as

well as current changes in y and       are included. (Note that the subscript T

has been dropped from the notation for the marginal propensity to consume out

of transitory income, o• Since the role of current Income in signaling

changes In permanent income has been explicitly included in the model, the
                                                                                          12




will differ from zero only if consumption is correlated with transitory in-

come. Similarly, non—zero values of the                 indicate that the variable z has

some effect on consumption beyond its role in providing new information about

future income.



Estimation of the model          —
        The three equation system consisting of the bivariate autoregression and

the consumptIon equatIon was estimated by Full InformatIon MaxImum LIkelIhood

(FIML). Estimates of the model were obtained for four different specifica-

tions of the consumption equation — a fully unconstrained version with no

restrictions on the          and y1, a fully constrained version with the restric-

tion      =       =0   imposed, and two partially constrained versions:            uncon-

strained with the restriction              =   0 imposed, and vice versa.

        In interpreting the empirical results, it is important to understand the

relationship between the empirical approach pursued here, a single equation

 instrumental variables approach, and the approach used by Hall (1978).

 Consider the reduced form of the system. The reduced form of equation (20)

 is:



              EC —      +   0(p.1 + (AA(L)—L)y + AB(L)z)
                   + y0(tt2 + BA(L)y + (BB(L)_L)z) +                  +

                   + ytz1     + y2tz   2
                                               +


where         =
                  (k(T) +     o1t   + (k(T) + yo)c2 +         3t     Equations (19.1) and

(19.2) are already reduced forms. Since f3 =                 =0    under the null hypo-

thesis, the fully restricted reduced form consumption equation is simply:



(22)          Ac =      +
                                                                                  13


        Instrumental variables estimates of the excess sensitivity parameters,

 the 13. and         could be computed by specifying the consumption equation as:

 (23)
                IC       + Ot +            + 2AYt   2
                                                        +    +
                                                                     1
                                                                         + '*2t2 +

where       =              and estimating the equation using lagged values of
                (l—0)zy,
and z as instruments. Since the revision in permanent income, which consti-

tutes the disturbance in equation (23), is uncorrelated with previously avail-

able information, the lagged values of         and z a.re valid instruments.

Referring to the reduced form of the fully unconstrained system (equations

(19.1), (19.2), and (21)) it is easy to show that, in the absence of any

further restrictions, the structural parameters are just identified. When the

system is just identified, estimating the multivariate system by FIML provides

estimates of the excess sensitivity parameters, the 3. and y., which are

numerically identical to the estimates obtained by estimating equation (23)

by instrumental variables, using           and z1, 1=1,2,3, as instruments. That

is, in the just identified case, FIML is equivalent to Two Stage Least Squares

(2SLS) equation—by—equation, which in turn is equivalent to instrumental

variables, using the predetermined variables, in this case           and z1,
i1,2,3, as instruments.

        Next, consider the restricted reduced form consumption equation (22), By

definition the reduced form expresses the conditional expectation of the

endogenous variable,           given the predetermined variables. Thus the emp-

irical content of the restriction 3. =         = 0 is that the conditional expec-
tation of Lic given lagged values of         and z is zero, which is an example

of the basic empirical implication of the permanent income hypothesis tested

by Hall (1978). To test this implication of the permanent income hypothesis,

Hall estimated by OLS the conditional expectation of c given ci and an

array of variables dated t—1 or earlier, then tested the hypothesis that the
                                                                                   14


lagged variables (other than cci) had no predictive content for current

consumption. As an application of Hall's test, one could estimate by OLS

equation (24):

(24)             =
                     U3+      + 2t—2 + 'T3t3 + TF4Z + lISZt 2        + •116t 3   + "3t

and conduct an F—test of the hypothesis r. = 0.       Since the multivariate system

consisting of equations (19.1), (19.2), and (21) is just identified, there are

no over—identifying restrictions on the consumption reduced form, equation

(21); thus equations (21) and (24) both represent the identical reduced form

consumption equation. Further, imposing the restriction          =    =0   implies

that all of the reduced form coefficients (except the constant) should be

zero, which is exactly the restriction tested by Hall.8 Although both Hall's

approach and the approach pursued here lead to the same specification of the

reduced form consumption equation, under both the alternative and null hypo-

theses, the test procedure used here differs from Hall's in that the restric-

tion is tested by computing the likelihood ratio statistic for the multi—

variate system (equations (19.1), (19.2), and (21)) while Hall's test sta-

tistic is computed by estimating the consumption equation alone. As proved

in Flavin (1981), however, the two tests yield numerically identical values

of the likelihood ratio test statistic,9

       The purpose of this discussion is to establish that both the estimates of

the excess sensitivity parameters, the         and y.,, and the likelihood ratio

                                               = 0 are robust with respect to the
test statistic for the hypothesis 13. =   y.
approximation introduced to measure capital gains on nonhuman wealth when the

multivariate model (equations (19.1), (19.2), and (21)) is just identified.

Without even attempting to measure unanticipated capital gains, one could

obtain consistent estimates of the 3. and y. by estimating equation (23) by

instrumental variables and test the restrictions imposed by the permanent
                                                                                 15



income hypothesis by using Hall's reduced form approach. Since the point

estimates of the excess sensitivity parameters and the value of the associated

likelihood ratio test statistic obtained by estimating the multivariate model

by FINL are numerically identical to the estimates and test statistic obtained

by the procedures which do not involve the approximation, these empirical

results do not depend on the approximation.1°


Data

       In contrast to my earlIer paper (1981), the models examined in thIs paper

were estimated with annual rather than quarterly data. One advantage to using

annual data is that the annual series are available for a longer sample period,

1929 to present, than quarterly data, In addition, it is important to know

whether the results of the earlier paper are confirmed when the sampling

interval is changed from quarterly to annual. Observations for the years

1942— 1949 were excluded from the sample on the grounds that rationing during

World War II probably caused departures of actual from desired consumption.

After allowing for the construction of lags, the basic sample period was 1933—

41 and 1950—81.

       Assuming that the utility function is separable in the major categories

of consumption ——   durables,   nondurables, and services ——   the model was estimated
using real consumption of nondurable goods alone as the consumption concept.

In principle, a series on the service flows from durable goods could be con-

structed. However, the model incorporates the assumption that consumption

adjusts fully to a revision in permanent income within the current time period.

Because of the costs associated with adjusting stocks of durable goods, a more

complicated adjustment model would be required to explain consumption of services

of durable goods. Consumption of services, which is dominated by the imputed

service flow of housing, was excluded for the same reason. Consumption of
                                                                             16


nondurables accounts for about 45% of total personal consumption expenditure.

Both the consumption and income series, which was personal disposable income,

were stated in 1972 dollars per capita.


Empirical results for the model with univariate income forecasting equation

     The model considered in my 1981 paper is a special case of the model

developed in the previous section. For comparison with the results of the

earlier paper, the basic tests of the simpler model with the univariate income

forecasting equatIon were repeated with the longer, annual data set,

     Based on series of F—tests of the exclusion of higher order autoregres-

sive parameters, the per capita disposable income series was modeled as a

third order autoregression with a deterministic exponential trend, The

estimated exponential growth in disposable income was 2,15482 percent annually,

with a standard error of .114 percent. The precision of the estimate of the

trend, even when estimated simultaneously with the autoregressive parameters,

supports the view that income can be modeled as a stationary process around

a positive trend. To simplify the estimation, the trend of 2.15482 percent

was removed from the income series, and the tests were conducted using the

detrended data. As mentioned above, the presence of an exponential trend

in per capita income will induce an exponential trend in per capita consump-

tion. Because the consumption variable is expenditures on nondurable goods

rather than total consumption, the trend in nondurable goods consumption

will not be equal to the trend in income unless the income elasticity of

nondurables consumption is unity. For this reason, the consumption series

was detrended by its own estimated exponential trend of 1.59896 percent.

     With the univariate income forecasting equation, the model consists of

equations (19.1) and (21) with the parameters of AB(L), BA(L), and BB(L),

and 2'          and 2 constrained to equal zero. The estimates of the struc—

tural parameters and their standard errors are reported in Tb1e 1.

     Based on the estimated autoregressive parameters of the income process

and an assumed real interst rate of 5%, the present discounted value of the

revision in expected future Income associated with an innovation in current

income, ,     is       3.28. Assuming that the horizon of the representative

individual is 20 years, T=20, the annuity rate, k(T), is 0.079. Thus, the

change in permanent income induced by an innovation in current income,

k(T)yIS .26, With a likelihood ratio statistic of 23.786 for the restriction

         =        =    0,   the null hypothesis of no excess sensitivity of consumption
             62
to current income can be rejected at the .5% level,

     In summary, the empirical results based on the model with a univariate

income forecasting equation indicate that the excessive sensitivity of

consumption to current income is significantly greater than zero, both

statistically and quantitatively. Keeping in mind that the parameter

measures the excess sensitivity of nondurables consumption alone, a point

estimate of .37 for 6o respresents a very large departure from the permanent

income hypothesis. Further, the estimate of 13o is reasonably precise, accord-

ing to the standard error of .09, These results are in very close agree-

ment with the 1981 paper based on post war quarterly data. With the quarterly

data set, the point estimate of 6o was .355 (standard error .275) and the

restriction 6. = 0 could be rejected at the .5% level.

 Empirical results using the unemployment rate to help forecast disposable income

      In this section the general model with a bivariate income forecasting

 equation is estimated, using the overall unemployment rate as the variable z.

 Under the permanent income hypothesis, the current observation on the unemploy-

 ment rate affects consumption only to the extent that the unemploymenrLnnovation

 contains new information on future inocme. In the unrestricted version of the

 model, equation (20), current and lagged changes in the unemployment rate also

 have a direct impact on consumption. Results from the FIML estimation of the

 unconstrained system consisting of equation (19.1), (19.2), and (21) are re-

 ported in lines 5, 6, and 1 of Table 2.

     When the    are included without constraint and the     are constrained to

be equal to zero, the specification of the alternative hypothesis is cotnpar—

able to the alternative hypothesis in the model with the univariate income

forecasting equation. In this version of the model, the unemployment rate is

included as part of the information set used to predict future income but

assumed to have no direct impact on consumption. The resulting estimates of

the excess sensitivity of consumption to current income, the t31, are reported

in line 2 of Table 2. The estimate of o is .368, with a standard error of

.070; the estimates of    and 2 are numerically small and insignificantly

different from zero. Further, the estimates of the      are in very close

agreement with the estimates obtained from the model with the univariate

income forecasting equation.

    When the unemployment rate is included in the model as possibly having a

direct Impact on consumption, the estimate of f3ç drops from .368 to .146 and

becomes statistically insignificant. Estimates of the      and y1 obtained from

the fully unrestricted version of the model are reported in line 1 of Table

the prevalence of liquidity constraints, the excess sensitivity of consumption

to the unemployment rate is negative: y0 = —11.0.      The point estimate

of    of —11.0 indicates that a one percentage point increase in the unemploy-

ment rate decreases consumption by $11.00 per capita (in 1972 dollars). The

economic significance of the estimate of     is more easily interpreted if the

decrement to consumption is stated in terms of the dollar change in consump-

tion per additional person unemployed as the unemployment rate increases by

one percentage point, rather than the change In consumption per capita.

Renormalizing the estimate of y, by multiplying by the ratio of total popul-

ation to 1% of the labor force (232,060/1,123.83 in 1982) the excess sen-

sitivity of consumption to unemployment amounts to a decrement of $2,271.50

per additional person unemployed (1972 dollars). In assessing the magnitude

of this estimate of the excess sensitivity of consumption to the unemployment

rate, it is Important to keep in mind that the estimate of       of —11.0 was

obtained from the fully unconstrained version of the model. Since the para-

meters measuring the excess sensitivity of consumption to current income,

the , were   included in the specification of the alternative hypothesis, the

estimated decrement of $2,271.50 per additional person unemployed measures the

effect of unemployment on consumption, holding current income constant. With

a likelihood ratio statistic of 33.04, the full set of restrictions imposed by

the permanent income hypothesis ( =        = 0)   can be rejected at the .5%

level. As explained above, the likelihood ratio test statistic for the

hypothesis    =   =0   and the estimates of the        and    in the fully unre-

stricted version of the model are robust with respect to the approximation

introduced to measure capital gains on nonhuman wealth.

     In addition to testing the permanent income hypothesis, a primary purpose

of the paper was to conduct a specification test of the simple "Keynesian"
                                                                                 20




 consumption function In which the behavioral marginal propensity to consume

 out of current income is greater than zero Interpreting the alternative

 hypothesis with the    unconstrained and the restriction     = 0 imposed as the

 "Keynesian" consumption function, the specification test is executed by

 testing the restriction that the y1 are zero. With a likelihood ratio sta-

tistic of 6.282, the hypothesis that the     are each equal to zero is

marginally rejected at the 10% level of significance.

      At thIs juncture, the statIstIcal results concernIng the Importance of

liquidity constraints appear to be mixed: In both magnitude and statistical

significance, the estimates of the     are dramatically affected by the inclu-

sion of the y1, the estimates of the     are of the predicted sign and indicate

a quantitatively large direct effect of unemployment on aggregate consumption,

but the formal specification test of the restriction     = 0 cannot be rejected

at conventional levels of significance, such as the 5% level, although it can

be rejected at the 10% level. Given the high correlation between aggregate

income and the unemployment rate, however, one might suspect that the formal

specification test has relatively low power against the restriction      = 0

when the . are included in the consumption equation without restriction.

      To check this conjecture, the symmetric hypothesis test was executed: If

the     are included in the consumption equation without constraint, can the

restriction      0 be rejected? When the      are included in the consumption

equation, the likelihood ratio statistic for the hypothesis      = 0 is 5.066,

which has a marginal significance level of .167. Estimates of the        obtained

with the restriction    = 0 imposed are reported in line 3 of Table 2. In

summary, when either the    or the     are included In the consumption equation

without constraint, the restriction that the other set of excess sensitivity

parameters is zero cannot he rejected at the 5% level of significance. Based
                                                                                                   21


    on this finding, I would interpret the failure of the specification test to

    reject the restriction              = 0 at a high level of significance as an indication

    that the test has relatively low power. Since the symmetric hypothesis j3 = 0

—   cannot be rejected even at the 10% level, the empirical results cannot be in-

    terpreted as empirical confirmation of the simple "Keynesian" specification.

           In addition to the estimates of the excess sensitivity parameters, the

    model provides estimates of the summary measures of the information content

    of innovations in income and the unemployment rate for the prediction of future

    income. Based on the estimated parameters of the bivariate autoregression and

    a real interest rate of 5%, the value of                      was 3.72; the value of       was 27..

    It is important to keep in mind that in the contett of the bivariate income

    forecasting model, the parameters                and c1       have the interpretation of parti-'l

    rather than total derivatives. In order to directly compare the information

    content of an innovation in y in the bivariate autoregression to the infor-

    mation content of an innovation in the univariate income autoregression, one

    can calculate the total derivative
                                        T = d(PDV of y                  t

    univariate income forecastIng model.

           Similarly, the total derivative of the present discounted value of future

    income with respect to an innovation in the unemployment rate is:

    to 1% of the labor force, as before, the value of                       implies a reduction in the

    present discounted value of future income of $12,514 (or a reduction in perman-

    ent income, k(T)T, of $988.61) per additional person unemployed.

Conclusions

     When the unemployment rate is included as part of the information set

used to predict future income but assumed to have no direct impact on con-

sumption, the estimated excess sensitivity of consumption to current income

is quantitatively large and statistically significant, When the unemployment

rate, which is interpreted as a proxy for the severity and prevalence of

liquidity constraints, is included in the model as possibly having a direct

impact on consumption, the estimate of the excess sensitivity of consumption

to current income drops from .368 to .146 and becomes statistically insig-

nificant. Consistent with the interpretation of the unemployment rate as

a proxy for liquidity constraints, the estimated excess sensitivity of con-

sumption to the unemployment rate is negative. Further, the estimate of the

excess sensitivity of consumption to the unemployment rate implies that

consumption declines by $2,271.50 per additional person unemployed, holding

current income constant.

     If the observed excess sensitivity of consumption to current income

arises because agents are myopic in the sense that the behavioral MPC out

of transitory income is nonzero, the proxy for liquidity constraints is an

extraneous variable in the consumption equation. The finding that the

estimate of the MPC out of transitory income is dramatically affected, in

both magnitude and statistical significance, by the inclusion of the proxy

for liquidity constraints indicates that the simple "Keynesian" consumption

function with nonzero MPC out of transitory income is an incomplete model,

and suggests that liquidity constraints are an important part of the explan-

ation of the observed excess sensitivity of consumption to current income.

and Mishkin (1982), Hayashi (1982) and Sargent (1978). In his original paper,

Hall (1978) did not reject the RE—PIH decisively. However, Flavin (1981)

showed that with a minor alteration in the specification of the alternative

hypothesis, the RE—PIll could be rejected using Hall's test and data set.

Bernanke (1981), studying panel data on automobile expenditures, did not find

evidence aginst the hypothesis. For an extensive survey of the empirical lit-

erature on the RE—PIH, see King (1983).

2.   Because the model is estimated using aggregate data, the assumption

implicit in equation (3) that transitory consumption is identically zero can

be restated as an assumption that realizations of transitory consumption at

the micro level are distributed independently across the population. Thus

even if the variance of the individual's transitory consumption is nonnegli—

gible relative to the variance of permanent income, aggregate transitory con-

sumption will be negligible as long as the individual realizations are mutually

independent.

3.   Akerlof and Main (1980) argue compellingly that statistics on the average

duration of completed unemployment spells substantially underestimate the

effective duration of unemployment because about half of all spells of uneni—

ployment in a given year are incurred by persons suffering multiple spells.

Thus the average number of weeks spent in unemployment by a person who becomes

unemployed in a given year is substantially larger than the average duration of

an unemployment spell: persons experiencing one spell of unemployment during the

year spent an average of 11.5 weeks unemployed, persons with 2 spells spent an

average of 15.5 weeks unemployed, and persons with more than 2 spells were un-

employed an average of 18.3 weeks (Akerlof and Main (1980) p. 888).

 Census Bureau concept of "unrelated individuals".

 5.    The public unemployment compensation program provides partial insurance

 against individual—specific risk in labor income.

 6.    In an exact specification, the rate at which future income is discounted,

5, would vary with the ex ante real interest rate. To keep the model     tractable,
 the discount factor is approximated as a constant.

7.     [n recent years aggregate annual saving flows (defined as personal saving

plus undistributed corporate profits) have been in the range $l00—$150 billion,

or about 1% to 3% of aggregate nonhuman wealth (assuming, based on the data

in Hayashi (1982, p. 914) that the value of aggregate nonhuman wealth in the

U.S. is in the $5,000—$l0,000 billion range.) Thus even if the real interest

rate is as high as 10%, the change in nonlabor income due to endogenous savings

flows is on the order of .2% per year.

8.    While Hall's approach and the approach followed here lead to the same

restrictions on the reduced form of the consumption equation, the methodology

used in this paper has the advantage that it permits the recovery of the point

estimates of the parameters measuring the excess sensitivity of consumption to

current income and other variables, the . and y., and their individual

standard errors. With Hall's approach, the quantitative importance of a

departure from the predicted behavior of consumption is difficult to assess

since only reduced form    coefficients are estimated.
9.    In   Flavin (1981) the result is proven in the context of the simpler model
considered in that paper. An appendix proving the more general version of the
result appropriate for the model in this paper is available from the author.
10,   Since just—identification of the multivariate model was required to
establish that the estimates and the test statistics were robust with respect
to the approximation concerning capital gains on nonhuman wealth, the point
estimates and test statistics associated with the partially constrained versions,

which are over-identified, do depend on the validity of the approximation.

        Proof that the likelihood ratio test statistic for the

hypothesis           =        =0   in the multivariate system consisting of equations

(19.1), (19.2), and (21) is numerically identical to the likelihood ratio test

statistic for the hypothesis 7T1= 0 in equation (24).

the 7x3 matrix of reduced form coefficients.

        Let Q denote the 3x3 covariance matrix of the reduced form disturbances

and let P denote the lower triangular matrix P such that PP' =             Q   .   By post—

multiplying equation (Al) by P, one obtains the CLS transformation of the

system:



(A2)             =   1p   + vt




        Since the covarfance matrix of the transformed disturbances is diagonal,

the    value   of the log likelihood function of the three equation system (A2) is

equal to the sum of the values of the log likelihood functions of the three

individual equations. Consider the second equation in the transformed

system. The vector of coefficients of the transformed second equation (given
by the second column of UP) consists of a linear combination of the second and

third columns of [1.

     The log likelihood of the transformed second equation is not affected by

restricting the reduced form coefficients of the consumption equation (given

in the third column of U) because each of the parameters in the second column

of 11 is a free parameter. By an analagous argument, one can show that the log

likelihood of the transformed first equation Is not affected by restricting

the reduced form coefficients of the consumption equation. Thus all of the

decrease In the log likelihood function of the three equation system (A2)

associated with the restriction         =   0 is attributable to the decrease in

the log likelihood function of the consumption equation alone.
