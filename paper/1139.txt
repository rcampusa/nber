     Unionization   and Productivity in Office Building and School Construction




                                      Abstract

       This paper examines the difference in productivity between union and nonunion

contractors in the construction industry over a sample of 83 commercial office

buildings   and another sample of 68 elementary and secondary schools. The popular
belief   that the building trades unions reduce productivity in the industry is
soundly rejected in both samples. Square     footage per manhour   is 38 percent higher
in   office buildings built predominantly by union labor, controlling for differences

in capital-labor ratios, observable labor quality, region, and building character-

istics. Estimates of the union-nonunion productivity difference in the school

sample range from zero (when output is measured in physical units) to 20 percent

greater for union contractors (when output is measured as value added deflated

by regional price differences), controlling for the same factors.

      Possible sources of higher union productivity in the office building sample

are explored. A lower ratio of supervision to production worker hours and use of

technologies and materials that economize on labor account for as much as 25 percent

of the higher productivity observed in the union sample. The remainder is probably

attributable to apprenticeship training, unobserved labor quality, economies of

recruiting and screening, and improved manangement.

 Introduction

     A number of recent controversial studies have found productivity is

frequently higher in union establishments than otherwise identical nonunion

establishments in the same industry.1 So far critics such as Addison have

used two types of arguments to claim none of these studies really show higher

productivity in the union sector.2 First, data limitations are severe enough

in each study to leave lingering doubts about the results. For instance when

productivity is measured in terms of value added, cross section deflators are

needed to distinguish between price and output differences. Some studies do not

deflate at all, while in others the deflators are far from ideal. With better

deflators, 4hese union productivity effect estimates could have been much lower.

Also, broad geographic and industry aggregates are used in many of these same

studies, which may mask considerable market segmentation and again bias estimates

upward. Second, the sources of the estimated union productivity advantage remain

largely unidentified. In construction the occupational mix and apprenticeship

programs accounted for no more than 27 percent of the estimated union productivity

advantage. In manufacturing, Brown and Medoff Could only identify lower

turnover as a source of higher union productivity.

     This paper attempts to add to our understanding of the union productivity

effect by examining two rather unique data sets: one sample of 83 commercial

office buildings and another of 68 elementary and secondary school buildings.

These data sets have the advantage that output can be measured in terms of physical

units—-square feet of space and, in the school sample, student capacity and classrooms,

When the dependent variable is expressed in physical units instead of value added,

the union coefficient in the production function can be interpreted solely as

a productivity effect, not as a wage effect.3 Also, there will not be any

aggregation bias in these estimates because the units of observation are
                                       2

separate construction projects, rather than state or regional totals containing

various types of structures and markets with various levels of unionization.

     The sources of estimated union-nonunion productivity differences can also

be examined in greater depth with these two data sets. Hours worked are reported

by detailed occupational categories with separate entries for journeymen and

apprentices. Separate totals can be calculated for skilled trades, operating

engineers, semiskilled and unskilled workers, and administrative and supervisory

workers. Two routes by which unions allegedly alter the occupational mix to

change productivity--raising the ratio of skilled to unskilled production hours

and lowering the ratio of supervisory to production hours--can then be isolated.

Each data set also provides some background information on the general contractor

for each project, such as annual volume and the extent to which he specializes

in a particular type of construction. This should provide better controls for

entrepreneurial efficiency. In the office building sample each contractor was

asked whether strikes, weather, building codes, skilled labor supply, apprenticeship

programs, and prefabricated or standardized components had any effect (positive,

zero, or negative) on productivity during construction of the building. The

influence of these factors on the union productivity effect can be gauged by

incorporating the contractors' impressions as separate variables in the quantita-

tive analysis.4

     Although the focus in this paper is on union-nonunion differences, the results

also shed some new light on productivity measurement issues in construction.

Researchers have shied away from attempting to develop measures based on physical

units because of the allegedly extreme heterogeneity of the product.5 While

this issue will be explored more carefully in subsequent work, the results
                                       3

reported here indicate that in at least one of the two samples heterogeneity

may not distort productivity comparisons as much as previously thought.

How Do Unions Affect Productivity in Construction?

      I have discussed the mechanisms through which unions influence productivity in

the construction industry elsewhere and will provide only a brief summary here.6

Basic price theory predicts observed labor productivity will be higher in

the   union sector because higher union wage rates lead employers to screen workers
more carefully to obtain higher quality labor and to substitute other inputs
for   labor in the production process. This is allocatively inefficient, however,

because buildings could be constructed at lower cost if the union wage effect

were zero. Without careful controls for these adjustments, the institutional

effect of unionism cannot be distinguished from the price theoretic effect of

higher union wages.

       The overall institutional effect of the building trades unions on productivity

may be either positive or negative. Even though most union members receive their

training from other sources, the apprenticeship programs in the union sector create a

core of well—rounded journeymen that has no counterpart in the open-shop sector.

Unless these highly skilled tradesmen spend much of their time doing simple

tasks, this should provide the union sector with more human capital per production

worker hour and higher productivity. Also, since thoroughly trained workers

requiremuch less assistance and monitoring, there is less need for supervision

on union job sites. Union hiring halls can    also serve to increase efficiency

when large numbers of workers are needed by making adequate supplies of labor

available on relatively short notice. Interview evidence indicates that many

open—shop contractors do not bid on larger projects because of the risk of being

unable to find enough workers. In addition, reduced uncertainty about labor

supply permits management to plan projects and schedule work assignments more

efficiently. The halls also screen workers, reducing uncertainty about labor
                                        5

quality in a market predominated by short term relationships between individual

workers and contractors. Offsetting these employer search economies are

potential restrictions on the contractor's choice of workers when contract

provisions are being strictly enforced. A final route through which unionism

could serve to raise productivity in the construction industry is the behavior

of management.   In order to maintain profits in the face of increased wages,

managers may change organizational practices, such as materials management,

quality control, cost estimating, or work scheduling methods in an attempt to

squeeze more output out of the same quantity of rionmanagerial inputs.

     Other union practices work in the opposite direction. The most frequently

cited indicators of lower productivity in the union sector are work rules which

restrict contractors from using certain types of tools or equipment or force them

to hire more workers than necessary to do a job. Another institutional factor which

places union contractors at a comparative disadvantage is the craft jurisdiction

system which assigns each task to a particular craft union. This reduces the

union contractor's flexibility in making work assignments and is a non-negligible

source of work stoppages. While there is evidence these rules and customs are not

always enforced (and the probability of enforcement is itself a function of the

overall state of labor-management relations), they can potentially offset or override

the factors which enhance productivity in the union sector.

     Note these mechanisms are quite distinct from those in manufacturing, where

previous studies of the union productivity effect have focused. One of the

primary sources of higher union productivity in that sector is reduced turnover.

In construction there are only short term attachments between workers and

employers. This puts a premium on minimizing search and screening costs per
                                      6
hire via improved information about job vacancies and reduced qualitative

uncertainty about new hires as opposed to minimizing the number of persons

hired via lower quit rates. The argument that union seniority systems reduce

worker rivalry and increase cooperation and informal training also is not very

applicable in construction. Instead the impetus toward more training in the

building trades comes from craft traditions and formal apprenticeship systems.

Two other mechanisms emphasized in the manufacturing sector--increased managerial

efficiency and improved communication between workers and management--should

apply to construction.

     Another important difference between construction and manufacturing is the

magnitude of the union wage effect. The OLS estimates in Allen using the May

1973—75 Current Population Survey (CPS) showed union wages Iii   construction
across all occupations were 54 percent higher than those for nonunion workers

with identical observable characteristics, in contrast, using a more or less

identical model for manufacturing over the same data source the union wage

effect is between 10 and 20 percent.7 If union contractors are to compete

effectively with the open-shop, the union productivity effect must be much

larger in construction than in manufacturing.

     The union wage effect can be estimated for both samples of buildings by

regressing average hourly earnings for each occupation group for each contractor

on union status, occupation dummies (74 in the office building sample, 55 in the

school sample), SMSA status, and three region dummies. The results are as follows:

                          Union status
                           regression           Standard             Union wage
Sample                     coefficient             error               effect
Office buildings              .297                 .008                34.6%
Schools                       .201                 .010                22.2%
                                       7


These are considerably smaller than the CPS estimates. The main reasons for

this are the degree of occupational detail and the limitation of the samples to

particular types of construction. If age and schooling data were available,

these estimates would probably be even smaller.8 The omission of fringe benefits

produces a bias in the opposite direction.

Empirical Model

    Assume that the production function for commercial office buildings and

elementary and secondary schools is Cobb-Douglas and is written


           Q = AK'L,                                                                              (1)


          =
where         output   (measured in terms of value added, square feet, classrooms, or

student capacity), A = a constant reflecting organizational factors and building

characteristics,        =
                            capital   input, L =          labor    input, a =   elasticity   of

output with respect to capital , and                 =   elasticity   of output with respect to

1abor Dividing each side of (1) by L and taking logs produces the conventional

estimating equation


              ln(Q1/L) = lnA +    aln(K/L)            +   (a+-l) lnL                              (2)




where (a+-l) measures returns to scale. The impact of unionization through

price—theoretic routes is measured in terms of changes in K1/L and the quality-

adjustment of L. In order to measure the organizational and labor-relations

impact of unionization on productivity, let A = An for nonunion contractors

and A =            for union contractors, where b is the percentage change in
          A(1+b)
productivity resulting from unionization. Then (2) can be rewritten



              ln(Q1/L) = lnA     +
                                      bU1
                                            +
                                                aln(KJL1)
                                                               +   (ci±-l)   lnL                  (3)


where      is a binary variable equal to one for projects built with 50 percent or

more union labor.1° This specification does not assign the union productivity

effect to either labor or capital. If the effect operates solely through labor,

then b must be divided by            to get a measure directly comparable to the union
                                                 9


 effect on wages. Note also that the union productivity effect could operate

 through a   or   , i.e.,   that these terms may be different for union and nonunion

 contractors. In this case (3) should be written


             ln(Q/L1) =           +        +
                            lnA       bU       cx ln(K1/L.)   +
                                                                  (czu-a) ln(K./L.)U.
                                                                                             (4)
                   +
                                  lnL +        uu_1)    lnLU.
      Both data sets were gathered as part of the BLS Construction Labor and

 Material Requirements series. The school survey was conducted in 1972;

 commercial office building, in 1974.             In each survey the general contractor

 was asked to provide information on the total value of the contract,
                                                                                    building

 characteristics, building materials, construction dates, and factors that

 affected productivity. The general contractor and each subcontractor also

 provided data on the type and cost of each material item, fair rental value or

depreciation for each type of equipment, and hours and wages for each occupation

used for onsite labor.

     Different types of capital expenditure data were provided in the two

surveys. In the school survey, each contractor for each project was asked to

provide the rental cost, the allowance by the contractor for owned equipment,

or the equivalent of rental cost for each type of equipment.                  In addition,

the number of hours operated is also reported for each. The sum of all capital

equipment expenditures for all contractors on a particular project is used

here as the capital measure for schools.             (The sum of all hours operated was

also examined, but produced essentially the same results.) In the office

building survey, each contractor provided equipment expenditure information

(depreciation or rental cost), as well as the interest expense incurred on

money borrowed for the contract. The sum of these two sets of expenses for all
                                       10

contractors for a particular office building is the capital measure for this

sample. Offsite capital (e.g., structures, office furniture and equipment)

is not reported.

     Labor input in each sample equals total onsite hours worked for all occupations.

Virtually all of this represents production labor. The only nonproduction

categories reported are clerical workers (e.g., timekeepers), professional

and technical workers (e.g. ,   draftsmen, engineers), and foremen. No offsite
labor input information is provided. If offsie labor (or capital) can be

substituted for onsite labor (or capital), this omission may bias the results.

For instance, if more units of management are used per onsite labor hour in

union (nonunion) projects, this will bias the estimate of b upward (downward).

Nothing in the institutional literature on union or open-shop construction indicates

that such a bias •is likely. Nonetheless, the general contractor's 1974 dollar

volume in private office building construction is used as an independent variable in

some specifications reported below as a proxy for offsite inputs.

     The only observable indicator of labor quality for each project is the

occupational distribution. Workers from 75 different occupational categories

were used in the office building sample; 56 in the school sample. Separate

totals are reported for journeymen and apprentices. This information is

converted into a labor quality index for each building (o) by the formula


              =                                                                (5)

                   J   J
where L1 = hours worked on project i by occupation j and y is 1969 median
earnings for males in occupation j.12 The index represents the predicted annual

 income for the labor force on a particular project and is positively related

 to skilled labor intensity. Three region dummies and an SMSA dunny are added

 to further control for differences in labor quality (and production technology)

 across geographic locations.
                                      11

     A final set of variables is needed to control for building characteristics

and materials. Each project in each sample is designed to meet the particular

needs of its buyer, so designs are likely to vary considerably. Some buildings

in each sample are likely to have distinctive designs and numerous amenities;

others are likely to be 'no-frills" structures. This makes interpretation of

(3) difficult because of possible correlation between unionization and design

characteristics which influence output per manhour. For instance, suppose

union (nonunion) contractors tend to specialize in 'no-frills" structures which

can be completed with less labor input per square foot than those with more

design amenities. Then failure to control for these design characteristics

upwardly (downwardly) biases the union coefficient.

     The frequency distributions in Table I for selected building characteristics

show some sizable union-nonunion differences are present. The most striking

difference is in the size of the buildings. Over half of the nonunion office

buildings are single story structures, in contrast to one fourth of the union

sample. Over a quarter of the union office buildings are more than 10 stories

tail, in contrast to none of the nonunion buildings. Nonunion schools also tend

to be smaller than union schools.13

     The choice of building materials varies with unionization in some cases.

Union office buildings are most likely to have steel frames; nonunion, wood

frames. However, steel frames predominate in both union and nonunion schools

and appear more fraquently in the nonunion saniple. Labor cost per square foot

tends to be lowest in buildings with a steel franio.'4 Without controlling for

this characteristic, the union coefficient will be biased upward in the office

building sanple; downward in the school samp1. Wooden and precast concrete

exterior walls tend to have the lowest labor cost per square foot, followed by

                                                            office buildings is
 most likely to be steel or concrete; in
                                             nonunion office buildings, steel or
 wood. The effect of these differences on the union coefficient cannot be

 assessed ex ante.16 Union-nonunion differences in interior wall and floor

 base materials are less pronounced and thus less likely to bias the

 estimates.

       The simplest way to control for building characteristic differences
                                                                           across
 buildings is to include dummy variables in
                                            (3) corresponding to each characteristic,
 making the intercept a function of the characteristics.
                                                          This cannot be done for
 three reasons. First, there are almost
                                           as many characteristics reported in each
 survey as there are observations. Second, some of the
                                                           characteristic coeffi-
cients have implausible values,
                                  presuniably because of collinearity with other

characteristics or inadequate sample variation.     This signals a serious specifica-
tion error which can be compounded if
                                        the magnitude of the estimate of    a, ,
or   b is sensitive to the inclusion of the var4able in question. Third,
                                                                         some of
the characteristics are observed in
                                      only one building, clouding the interpretation
of the coefficient--does it represent the effect of the characteristic
                                                                       or the
idiosyncracies of a particular building?

      The following decision rules were followed to determine which building

characteristics were included in the estimated equations. First, the

characteristic had to appear in more than one building in a particular sample.

Second, the sign of the coefficient had to be consistent with engineering data.

The 1977 Dodge Construction Systems Costs manual reports labor cost per
                                                                        square
foot for most building characteristics
                                       reported. Characteristics with positive
(negative) coefficients were not included if they tended to raise (lower) labor

cost per square foot. If a sign prediction was unavailable, a variable was
                                         14

included if it lowered the estimate of b. This stacks the deck against the

hypothesis that productivity is higher in the union sector. Third, either the

coefficient of the characteristic had to be larger than its standard error or the

magnitude of the c,   , or b   estimates had to be sensitive to the inclusion of the

characteristic in the equation. Inclusion of additional characteristics would

bias the standard errors of coefficients upward. If this rule were not followed,

there would not be enough degrees of freedom available to test hypotheses. The

sensitivity of the results to alternate regression strategies, including omission

of all building characteristics, will also be discussed.

prica1 Results: Commercial Office Buildings

     Two different measures of productivity are used for the office building

sample: value added per manhour and square feet per manhour. The former is

the standard measure of productivity used by economists and reported in the

national income accounts. The problems with using it to make union-nonunion

productivity comparisons, mentioned above, are discussed in greater detail elsewhere.17

Despite probable upward bias, I report value added per manhour results so they

can be compared to those obtained using a more appropriate productivity measure,

square feet per manhour. This is a variation of the standard productivity

(actually unit labor cost) measure used in the industry, cost per square foot.

As long as design characteristics can be held constant, valid productivity com-

parisons can be made across union and nonunion projects using square feet per

manhour in residential and most types of commercial construction.

     The sample, union, and nonunion means of the two productivity measures are

reported in Table Ill.   For each measure productivity is roughly 50 percent higher

in the union sample. This is not surprising, given the substantial difference in

the capital-labor ratios and the smaller but nontrivial difference in the skill

mixes. The key issue is whether, once one controls for these two factors as

well as for building characteristics, any productivity difference remains.

     The following procedure was used to select the building characteristics

included in the regressions reported in Table III. First, mean square foot per

manhour was calculated for each category of each characteristic. Characteristics

showing marked differences by category were included in the initial regressions.

Second, variables were then dropped if they did not meet the criteria outlined

in the previous section. Third, a new set of regressions was examined where

each of the characteristics previously eliminated and those not previously

considered was added to the "core' variables. Separate equations were

estimated for each characteristic. Variables were then added or dropped from

the "core" category according to the criteria. All variables excluded from

the newly defined "core" were then each added separately to the new "core"

variables in a new set of regressions. This procedure was repeated until all

variables in the core met the criteria and inclusion of any variable outside

the core could be rejected along those criteria. This specification is reported

in columns 2 and 5 of Table III. To demonstrate the sensitivity of the results

to the inclusion of the building characteristics, specifications with all

building characteristics omitted are reported in columns 1 and 4.

     The key result, reported in column 5, is that productivity, measured in

terms of square feet of space built per manhour, is 37.6 percent higher under

unionism. If building characteristics are omitted, the estimate falls slightly

to 36.1 percent.   In contrast the estimates obtained using the value added

per manhour measure are 50.8 and 38.9 percent, respectively. The upward bias

 in the union coefficient that results from use of an undeflated value added measure

 is as much as 35 percent.

      The union coefficient is somewhat sensitive to which building characteristics

 are included in the estimating equation.   When controls for different types

 of exterior walls are added in columns 3 and 6, the union productivity effect

 falls slightly to 49.8 percent in the value added specification and declines

 substantially to 29.8 percent in the square feet specification.    However, the

 coefficients for the exterior wall variables are not consistent with enqineering
                                      21


 data. Labor costs per square foot are highest for poured concrete walls,

 followed by masonry, precast concrete, and wood.18 Labor costs per square foot

for other types of exterior walls (metal, stucco, and curtain walls) vary all

across this range. Regression coefficients which indicate that productivity

is lowest in buildings with wood exteriors are not credible. While exterior

wall characteristics do not meet our criteria, these results merit some attention

nonetheless as conservativ&' estimates of the union productivity effect.

     The union coefficient was also quite sensitive to another set of variables

which did not meet the criteria for inclusion--type of floor covering. When these

variables are included, the union coefficient (S.E.) jumps to .398 (.131),

implying a union productivity effect of 49.0 percent. However the floor

covering coefficients imply that productivity is lower when floors are covered

with carpet or vinyl than when they have terazzo, tile, masonry, concrete, or

special finishes. Once again, this makes no sense at all.19

     Finally, because two different dependent variables were examined, some

variables met the criteria for inclusion for one specification, but not the other.

If controls for floor base, air conditioning and heating system are dropped

from the value added equation in column 2, the union coefficient (S.E.) goes

to .412 (.092). If the control for the presence of other commercial areas

besides office space is dropped from the square foot equation in column 5, the

union coefficient (S.E.) drops to .294 (.133).

     The main point which emerges from this analysis is that the key result--

that productivity is at least 30 percent greater in the union sector--is

quite robust to alternative specifications. Before attempting to account

for this result, three points should be noted about the other coefficients.

First, the capital-labor ratio, scale, and labor quality coefficients
                                        22

are more sensitive to the inclusion of building characteristics than the

union coefficient. This sensitivity reflects the fact that these variables

are to a large extent functions of the building characteristics.      For instance,

a high rise is likely to be more capital and labor quality intensive than a

low rise building. Thus once one controls for number of stories, part of the

effect of scale and increased capital intensity and labor quality becomes

embodied in the height coefficient. The coefficients of c and        may very well

be measured more accurately in column 4 than in columns 5 and 6.

     Second, there seem to be significant diseconomies of scale in the

construction of office buildings. This does not show up in the value added

results, probably because increased input costs are counted as output.

     Third, the labor quality variable accomplishes very little. It is always

very imprecise and is negative when the building characteristics are included

in the model.2° The absence of controls for worker experience is probably the

major shortcoming. A measure containing such information may reduce the

union cuefficiant somewhat, since the CPS data used in Allen showed the

average age of union construction workers was 38.8; nonunion workers, 34.3.

However, when a labor quality variable reflecting union-nonunion differences

in age, schooling, occupation, and location was included in Allen it reduced

the union coefficient by only 10 percent, so it is doubtful that this omission

seriously contaminates the results.
                                                           =   and
     Equation (4) was also estimated to test whether                 u =

The coefficient (S.E..) of (ct-       was .042 (.23l) while that of (-) was

-.010 (.053). The F ratio for the joint hypothesis that (c-ct,.)       0 and

  un 0 is .029 with 2 and 53 degrees of freedom. Clearly the null

hypothesis that (au_cn) =   U-) = 0      cannot be rejected.
                                         23

       In the Cobb-Douglas specification the a estimate should equal capital's

share of output. In the 1974 national income accounts this is 22 percent; the

1977 Census of Construction Industries, 34 percent.2' (Since fringe benefits and

offsite inputs are not reported, capital's share in our sample cannot be

determined.) The a estimates are below these values, especially in the square

fL..et equations. Since the estimated covariance between a and b is negative, a

downwardly biased a estimate means our b estimate is too large. To put the

same point differently, union-nonunion differences in capital-labor ratios may

not have been totally eliminated in the b estimates reported in Table II. These

results cannot be interpreted as total factor productivity effects unless labor

and   capital inputs are appropriately weighted.
      To determine the potential bias in the b estimates, we re-estimated the
equations in columns 1, 2, 4, and 5 under the restriction that a = .34.    The

results are as follows:

           Specification                      Union Coefficient (S.E.)

These estimates are 10 to 15 percent smaller than those reported in Table II

but the key result remains unaffected.

Why is Productivity Higher in Union Office Buildirrn?

     The most likely sources of a 30 percent or more productivity advantage

for union labor are superior training, lower supervisory requirements, reduced

recruiting an selection costs, and better management in the union sector.

How can the impact of these causal forces be quantitatively isolated? The

only one of these possibilities for which there is any direct evidence is the

occupational mix. This information has already been used to construct the

labor quality variable O.. But since supervisors receive higher wages than

skilled construction workers, projects with large supervisory staffs will have

higher values of O., despite lower labor quality among production workers. To

isolate the impact of lower union supervisory requirements, the ratio of

supervisor hours •to total hours is added to the model. Since this variable

is also likely to be correlated with the skill mix of the labor force and
                                                                            O.
did not control for the skill mix very satisfactorily, the ratio of semiskilled

and unskilled hours to total hours is also included.

     The contribution of contractor characteristics to higher union labor

productivity can be indirectly evaluated. Each general contractor was asked

to report (1) what percentage of his 1974 dollar volume was for private office

buildings, public office buildings, other commercial buildings, and other

projects and (2) his 1974 dollar volume of business in private office building

construction. This information can identify the effect of contractor specializa-

tion in this particular type of construction on productivity. If contractors

using union labor are more (less) specialized and this specialization raises

productivity, the union coefficient should fall (rise). The latter variable is

also a reasonable proxy for offsite capital and labor and can be used to examine

whether omission of those inputs biases the estimates in Table III.
                                            25

        Some further indirect evidence about the sources of higher union labor

 productivity can oe obtained from the responses of union and nonunion contractors

 to a series of questions about the effect of seven factors on productivity in

 their project: strikes, weather, building codes, apprenticeship programs,

 prefabricated components, standardized components, and supply of skilled

 workers. For each factor the contractor reported wh2ther
                                                                    it raised, loiered
 or had no effect on the employee-hours required to construct
                                                                       the project, as

 contrasted to any similar projects on which he participated durinri the past

 two years.

       The responses to this battery of questions by union and nonunion contractors

 are reported in Table IV. "No effect" was by far the most frequently observed

 response for any factor in the survey. The factor which seemed to have the

biggest   impact on hours requirements was the weather. Union projects were more
likely to be slowed down by problems with strikes, building codes, prefabricated
components, and skilled labor supply and less likely to be slowed down by

problems with apprenticeship programs. Interestingly, standardized and pre-

fabricated components were more likely to have raised productivity on union

projects, while loriuni on contractors were      ilore likely   to cite apprenticeship

programs and skilled labor supply as lowering hours requirements. This runs

counter to the institutional literature surveyed i Allen.            Union contractors

are allegedly less likely to use prefabricated components because of restrictive

work rules, while inadequate training and access to pools of skilled labor

supposedly limit the ability of nonunioH contractors to compete successfully.

      This still begs the question of whether any of these factors really

contribute to higher union labor productivity. The contractor responsesto

the   questionnaire   may be based upon crude impressions and thus be completely

uncorrelated   with the actual experience on the project. But if the         responses

accurately reflect project conditions, the impact of these factors on union-.

nonunion productivity differences can be isolated by adding them to the model

and observing their effect on the union coefficient.

     The impact of variables representing union-nonunion occupational mix

differences can be examined in columns 1 through 3 of Table V. While the

ratio of supervisor hours to total hours is only slightly higher for nonunion

projects (7.7 percent) than for union projects (7.5 percent), adding this

variable to the model in column 5 of Table III lowers the union coefficient from

.319 to .286, a reduction of 10 percent. There is a much bigger difference

between the ratio of semiskilled and unskilled hours to total hours between

union (21.8 percent) and nonunion (28.8 percent) projects. However this variable

has a slightly smaller impact on the union coefficient, lowering it to .294, a

reduction of about 8 percent. Including both variables in the equation lowers

the union coefficient to .275, an overall reduction of 14 percent. (Keep in mind

that 01 is included in all of these specifications.) Thus, holding overall labor

quality (as indexed by O) constant, the reduced use of supervisors in union

projects accounts for about 10 percent of the union productivity effect.

    The results for the skill ratio are more difficult to interpret. On the

one hand, since projects with more unskilled workers and the same ratio of

supervisor hours to total hours should have lower values of O, inclusion of

the skill ratio should have no effect on the union coefficient unless the weights

used to construct 0 are inappropriate. This may very well be the case here.

On the other hand, even if the weights in 01 are accurate (i.e., equal to the

average output of each category of workers), can such a variable really capture

overall labor quality? The assumption behind the construction of 01 is that labor

inputs are strongly separable.   If they are not and if unionism has an effect on the

 occupational structure independent of the union wage effect (e.g., the craft

 tradition), then the skill ratio results could
                                                   also be interpreted as showing
 aiother way in which unionism raises
                                        productivity.
      The contractor specialization variable which has the biggest impact
                                                                          on the

                                                  volume in projects other than
 commercial buildings to 1974 dollar volume.
                                                The coefficient (S.E.) of this
 variable (not reported in Table V) is -.326
                                                (.181), a fairly reasonable result.
 But the union coefficient (S.E.) increases
                                               to .393 (.145) when this variable is
 included. The other variables representing the share of
                                                         1974 dollar volume in
 various types of buildings either have no effect
                                                    on the union coefficient
(public and private office buildings) or increase it    slightly   (other commercial
buildings), it thus seems unlikely that any portion     of the higher union
productivity can be attributed to specialization
                                                    of union contractors in the
construction of commercial office buildings.

     A somewhat different picture emerges when one controls for the general

contractor's 1974 dollar volume in commercial
                                                 office building construction.
This is roughly eight times larger for the average union general contractor

($11.8 million) than the average nonunion general contractor ($1.4 million).

When this variable is added to the model in column 4 of Table V, the
                                                                     Union
coefficient drops slightly to .312, a 2 percent reduction. Each million dollars

of business is associated with a 7.4 percent reduction in square feet built
                                                                            per
hour, indicating once again the presence of diseconomies of scale in the

industry. Since the union coefficient should
                                                rise if productivity falls with
contractor size and union contractors are larger than nonunion contractors, it

is unclear whether contractor volume is really a source of higher t.uiion productivity
                                      30

or is acting as a proxy for some other omitted variable. In fact, if it is a

good proxy for overhead capital and labor, these results show that failure

to control for them does not seriously contaminate the findings in

Table III.

    As one might expect from the cross tabulations in Table IV, the contractor

responses to the questionnaire were not very helpful in econometrically

identifying sources of higher union productivity. For instance since nonunion

contractors were more likely to have labelled 'supply of skilled workers" as a

factor raising productivity (and less likely to label it as a factor lowering

productivity), including two binary variables corresponding to those responses

raises the union coefficient (S.E.) to .354 (.148). The one factor which does

seem to be a possible source of higher union productivity is the use of

standardized components. When one controls for whether the contractor felt

that standardized components raised productivity, the union coefficient drops

to .295, a fall of eight percent. This suggests that union contractors are more

sensitive to labor requirements when selecting technologies, a result consistent

with Mandelstamm's case study evidence. It also provides further evidence that

union work rules are not as much of a barricade to contractor decision making as

popular accounts would have one believe.

     How much of the union productivity effect can be accounted for by these

three sets of variables? When they are all included in the model in column 6

of Table 'I, the union coefficient falls to .237, a 26 percent reduction.

The most likely factors which remain unidentified include, first of all, the

type of training received by union and nonunion workers. No information was
                                      31


available about the sources of training for each crew.   If the percentage of

workers who have participated or graduated from apprenticeship programs were

reported in future research efforts, the role of this factor could be

identified. It would also be useful to have information about worker experi-

ence. Another factor which is probably at work is greater use of materials

and technologies that economize on labor. The use of standardized components

represents only one dimension of this decision. Finally, despite the negative

results obtained for the questionnaire responses regarding the supply of

skilled labor, it would probably be fruitful to collect information about how

workers are actually recruited and selected in any future surveys.

Empirical Results: Elementary and Secondary Schools

     A broader range of productivity measures is available for examination in

the school sample.   In addition to value added and square feet, output can

be defined in two additional ways: number of classrooms and student capacity.

It would be arbitrary to label any one of these as the ideal measure. For

instance, depending upon how the schools were designed, structure A with more

square feet of space than structure B could also have fewer classrooms or a

lower student capacity. If the same number of labor hours were required to

build each, productivity would be higher in structure A using the square footage

measure but lower using classrooms built per hour or student capacity built per

hour. Since the results may be very sensitive to the choice of the dependent

variable, all of these possible measures are examined below.

     All but one of the nonunion buildings are located in the South, making

some of the difference in the union and nonunion means in Table VI attributable

to locational factors. When productivity is measured in physical units, it is

higher in the nonunion sample in spite of a higher capital labor ratio and a

higher predicted wage for union projects. With respect to classroom square

feet, student capacity and classrooms per hour, there is a sizable nonunion

productivity advantage--at least 16 percent higher. Nonunion productivity is

also 6 percent higher when productivity is measured in terms of total square

feet per hour (including nonclassroom space). Except for the classrooms per

hour figure, however, none of these differences is statistically significant.

In contrast, the value added per hour measure indicates a union productivity

advantage that is roughly comparable to that observed for the same measure over

the office building sample. Even though it is distorted by higher union wages,

keep in mind that differences in building characteristics could also distort the

physical unit measures.

     Production functions using five different productivity measures with and

without building characteristics are reported in Table VII. The results show

productivity is at least as high in the union sector as in the nonunion sector.

In the value added specifications without building characteristics union produc-

tivity is 11.4 percent higher, but the null hypothesis can only be rejected at

the 15 percent confidence level. When building characteristics are added to

this specification, union productivity is 19.6 percent higher.

     This estimate is suspiciously close to the union wage effect over this

sample. If value added were deflated by a cross section price index, the results

could be substantially altered. To test this possibility, the Dodge cost indexes

reported in Allen were used as deflators in the rcsults in columns 3 and 4.

Since individual states are not identified in the Labor and Material Requirements

data (to protect Contractor confidentiality), a separate deflator was calculated

for each of the nine Census subregions. This deflation has little impact on

any of the coefficients. This is surprising because one would have at least

expected the South dummy to increase substantially as a result of this adjustment.

It is thus   hard to say whether the deflated results 'verify' the undeflated
results or whether they indicate that the deflator does not accurately reflect
price variation across this sample.
     The results for the physical   unit productivity measures are even more

difficult to interpret. Not only is there no union-nonunion productivity

difference in these specifications, but also productivity does not seem to vary

with capital intensity. This was also the case in a variety of other specifica-

tions such as   estimation of separate a and   r   for   union and nonunion projects

omission of various independent variables, inclusion of additional independent

 variables,   and restriction of the sample to either elementary or Southern schools.

The scale coefficient is the only parameter which is consistently estimated

with precision. While the estirnatos indicate that diseconomies of scale are

present in school construction, the      estimates in the student capacity and

total classroom specifications are so much larger than that in the square feet

specification that they are difficult to take seriously. Furthermore, the

absence of acceptable estimates of cx may also be contaminating the      estimates.
       When output is measured in physical units, the model systematically
overestimates (underestimates) the dependent variable in buildings with low (high)

productivity, suggesting misspecification. Since the data set is fairly small,

it was possible to examine it closely to determine possible sources of bias.

One likely candidate   is measurement error in the   capital variable. Unl Ike

the   office building sample, interest expenses are not reported for schools. When
the   data are sorted by square feet per hour, there are implausible values of K/L

in all ranges of the distribution. Further support for this view was obtained

by dropping the projects with the 13 most extreme values of K/L from the sample.

This raised the     coefficient (S.E.) to .131 (.105) in the square feet specifica-

tion. The other coefficients remained relatively unchanged.

      Since the regression results are so inconclusive, correlation coefficients

for the key dependent and independent variables are reported in Table VIII. The

interrelations among the dependent variables can be examined in the first five

lines. While the physical unit productivity measures are highly correlated with

each other, they tend to be uncorrelated with the two value added measures. The

only noticeable correlation between these two sets of variables is that between

the deflated value added and the square feet variables (.175), which is statistically

significant from zero at the 85 percent confidence level .   The interrelations

between the dependent variables and the independent variables and those among

the independent variables are reported in the bottom four lines. The independent

variables are all highly correlated with the value added productivity measures,

but are mostly uncorrelated with the physical unit productivity measures. This

suggests that either there is severe measurement error in some of the independent

variables or there are differences in building amenities which make physical output

measures misleading.

     In summary, no clear picture of the effect of unions on productivity emerges

from the school sample. Simple union-nonunion comparisons of mean productivity

in terms of physical output indicate no difference. The regressions and

correlation coefficients indicate the same thing. The value added per manhour

production function results point to higher productivity in the union sample.

Despite probable bias in the union coefficient, this is the only specification

where reasonable estimates of a and the labor quality coefficient were obtained.

It is entirely possible that the union coefficient is more biased (in directions

unknown) in the physical output specifications.

Conclusion

     Samples of two different types of buildings have been examined in this

paper in an attempt to measure the impact of unionism on productivity in the

construction industry. The commercial office building results strongly support

the conclusion of my earlier paper of higher productivity in the union sector.

Square footage per manhour is 38 percent higher in buildings built predominantly

by union labor. This estimate is quite a bit larger than the 17 to 22 percent

difference that I obtained over the deflated Census of Construction Industries sample.

     The sources of this difference are only partially identified. Lower

supervisor to production worker ratios and greater use of technologies and

materials that economize on labor hours seem to be part of the story. Unob-

served labor quality, economies of recruiting and screening, managerial inputs,

and training are no doubt also important but their impact could not be

quantified here.   It would be useful in future work to design an experiment

combining the detailed hours, equipment, and materials data which BLS collects

with questionnaire data similar to that collected by I3ourdon and Levitt. While

the results reported here should eliminate any doubts that at least in some

institutional settings productivity can be significantly higher under unionism,

the mechanisms through which this happens have not been fully identified.

between 20 percent in the value added specification to zero in the physical

output specifications. Why are the latter results so different across the two

samples? One possible explanation is that schools are so heterogeneous that output

cannot be represented in a single reasure. In addition to classroom space,

schools contain such features as gymnasiums, auditoriums, swinining pools, and
                                       40

laboratories. To explore this possibility, the ratio of classroom to total

square feet was added to the model. The estimates of a,    , and   b changed very

little in any of the specifications. Addition of square footage to student

capacity ratios to the model also shed no new light on the results. While

these probes of the data are admittedly crude, they nonetheless suggest that

heterogeneity may not be a severe source of bias. Aiiother reason for discounting

this explanation is the fairly well behaved nature of the office building results.

Reasonable estimates were obtained over that sample even though the structures

ranged in size from 3,000 to 1.7 million square feet. Is the school sample more

heterogeneous than that?

     Another   explanation is that the owners of elementary and secondary schools
do not have the same incentives as the owners of commercial office buildings,
which may prevent resources from being allocated efficiently. The demand

elasticity for structures is likely to be lower for state and local governments

than for the private sector. Government officials are given a budget by a legislative

body which sets an upper limit for the cost of the building. Contract officers

have little incentive to obtain bids below that amount. They cannot spend

any money that they save on other projects; they cannot receive any personal

reward. In areas where elected officials are heavily indebted to unions or

contractor associations, attempts on the part of government employees to minimize

costs may even be actively discouraged.

     Even if government officials had the incentive to produce buildings at

minimum cost, they usually lack the means. Collusion is always possible in

sealed bid auctions. Private sector owners have several devices at their

disposal to prevent this, including delay or cancellation of the project,

relocation   of the project, and egotiation with   individual bidders for further
                                        41


cost reductions before signing the contract. None of these options is usually

available in the public sector. As a result, contractors and unions stand to

collect rents in public construction.

     The mere existence of rents of course does not imply inefficient factor

allocation. In fact one would expect nonunion contractors to appropriate all

rents for themselves by minimizing costs. This is niuch less likely in the

union sector. But even if unions have the bargaining power to share the rents,

how are they distributed? Agreements which raise wages on public construction

projects above those in the private sector would signal to the entire community

(especially potentidi opponents of those in office) that rents are present, so

this is not a stable solution. However, if rents are distributed in the form of

such commodities as increased on the job leisure or job opportunities for the

least skilled union members, the data are not likely to trace out a production

function reflecting cost minimizing behavior.

     Some support for this explanation can be obtained by comparing our commercial

office building sample with a sample of federal office buildings built in about

the sarie time period. Cost per square foot is greater in the federal sample

($41.28) than in the commercial sample ($22.36). Labors share of output is also

higher in the federal sample. Onsite wages represent, on average, 34.0 percent

of the contract amount in the federal sample; 26.7 percent in the commercial

sample.22 Similar results emerge when the comparison is between public and private

housing. Cost per square foot in a sample of 1968 public multifamily projects

was $15.22, with onsite labor accounting for 32.4 percent of total cost. In a

sample of private multifamily projects built three years later, cost per square

foot was $12.96 and labor's share was 28.0 percent.23 While this evidence is far

from conclusive in and of itself, further work investigating this hypothesis is

ci early warranted.
                                      42

     It has also been suggested that the behavior of union workers on the job

is sensitive to the demand for their services. Since the construction industry

was heading into a recession at the time of the office building survey, it is

possible that a study during another period would yield different results.

     Even in cases where productivity is higher in the union sector, the 'bottom

linìe" issue is whether this is more than offset by the higher wages union

contractors have to pay.24 The union wage effect estimate for office buildings

reported above falls well within the range of the union productivity effect point

estimates. This indicates not only is unionization correlated with higher

productivity in that sector, but also the returns from that productivity have

been shared by capital and labor, exactly the same result obtained by Mandelstamm

for residential construction in Ann Arbor and Bay City, Michigan in 1957. The

school results suggest this will not always be the case. Further research over

other types of buildings and in different time periods will be needed to

establish the overall effect of the building trades unions on efficiency.

     3The use of value added as a measure of output will produce upward bias

in the union coefficient in a production function when both of the following

conditions hold:    (1) higher union wages are passed on to customers in the form

of higher prices (for i,stance, in markets where there is no nonunion competition)

and (2) product demand is inelastic.

         the May 1973-75 CPS the union wage effect estimate increases from 54

to 66 percent when age and schooling are dropped from the model.

     9The Cobb-Douglas specification imposes three important restrictions:

(1) the elasticity of substitution between labor and capital equals one; (2) homo-

theticity (i.e., all isoquants along a ray from the origin have the same slope);

and (3) homogeneity (i.e., the elasticity of cost with respect to output is

constant). Unless these factors are correlated with unionization, the estimates

of the union intercept in the Cobb-Douglas specification will be unbiased. These

restrictions are removed in another paper, in preparation, which examines union-

nonunion differences in the cost of building office buildings and schools.

    lOThis specification was selected because the distribution of observations

by percent union is highly clustered near zero and one, as shown below:

Replacement of U1 by the continuous percent union variable has virtually no

effect on the coefficients, but does increase standard errors.

     13These size differences are equally apparent when one compares average

square footage. The average for union office buildings is 208,815; nonunion,

27,319. The average for union schools is 98,108; nonunion, 85,250. To test

whether this size difference biased the results, (3) was estimated over samples

where the union buildings which were larger than the largest nonunion building

were excluded. The union coefficients were not sensitive to this restriction,

so these results are not reported below.

(New York, N. Y.: McGraw-Hill, 1976), pp. 221-247. Two qualifications on the

use of these data should be noted. First, the BLS does not distinguish between

precast and poured concrete in the surveys. Onsite productivity is considerably

greater when the former is used. second, the specific type of wood, steel concrete,

brick, and the like used in the building is not reported. There is often

considerable variation in unit labor costs within, say, all buildings with

masonry exterior walls ($1.47 to $6.68 per square foot).   This range often over-

laps with that of other materials. For instance, cost per square foot of
                                        46

 various wood exterior wall systems ranges between 59 cents to $1.57 per square

 foot. Both of these factors introduce error into all predictions made about

building characteristic coefficients with the Dodge data.
