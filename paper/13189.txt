                                             ABSTRACT

Real investors and markets are too complicated to be neatly summarized by a few selected biases and
trading frictions. The "top down" approach to behavioral finance focuses on the measurement of reduced
form, aggregate sentiment and traces its effects to stock returns. It builds on the two broader and more
irrefutable assumptions of behavioral finance -- sentiment and the limits to arbitrage -- to explain which
stocks are likely to be most affected by sentiment. In particular, stocks of low capitalization, younger,
unprofitable, high volatility, non-dividend paying, growth companies, or stocks of firms in financial
distress, are likely to be disproportionately sensitive to broad waves of investor sentiment. We review
the theoretical and empirical evidence for these predictions.

           The history of the stock market is full of events striking enough to earn their own names:

the Great Crash of 1929, the 'Tronics Boom of the early 1960s, the Go-Go Years of the late

1960s, the Nifty Fifty bubble of the early 1970s, and the Black Monday crash of October 1987.

Each of these events refers to a dramatic level or change in stock prices that seems to defy

explanation. The standard finance model, where unemotional investors always force capital

market prices to equal to the rational present value of expected future cash flows, has

considerably difficulty fitting these patterns. Researchers in behavioral finance have been

working to augment the standard model with an alternative model built on two basic

assumptions. 1

           The first assumption is that investors are subject to sentiment. Investor sentiment, defined

broadly, is a belief about future cash flows and investment risks that is not justified by the facts

at hand. The second assumption is that betting against sentimental investors is costly and risky.

And so, rational investors, or arbitrageurs as they are often called, are not as aggressive in

forcing prices to fundamentals as the standard model would suggest. In the language of modern

behavioral finance, there are limits to arbitrage. Recent stock market history has cooperated

nicely, providing the Internet bubble and the ensuing Nasdaq and telecom crashes and thus

validating the two premises of behavioral finance. A period of extraordinary investor sentiment

pushed the prices of speculative and difficult-to-value technology stocks to unfathomable levels

in the late 1990s. Instead of creating opportunity for contrarian arbitrageurs, the period forced

many out of business, as prices that were merely high went higher still before an eventual crash.

           Now, the question is no longer, as it was a few decades ago, whether investor sentiment

affects stock prices, but rather how to measure investor sentiment and quantify its effects. One

                                                                                                       1
approach is “bottom up,” using biases in individual investor psychology, such as overconfidence,

representativeness, and conservatism, to explain how individual investors underreact or overreact

to past returns or fundamentals. 2 A related class of models, discussed by Hong and Stein in this

issue, relies on differences of opinion across investors, often combined with short sales

constraints to generate misvaluation. When aggregated, these models make predictions about

patterns in market wide investor sentiment, stock prices, and volume.

         The investor sentiment approach that we develop in this paper is, by contrast, distinctly

“top down” and macroeconomic. The starting point for this approach is that many of the bottom

up models lead to a similar reduced form of variation over time in mass psychology, and

certainly none is uniquely true. Real investors and markets are too complicated to be neatly

summarized by a few selected biases and trading frictions. The top down approach focuses on

the measurement of reduced form, aggregate sentiment and traces its effects to market returns

and individual stocks. The new directions in this top down approach build on the two broader

and more irrefutable assumptions of behavioral finance—sentiment and the limits to arbitrage—

to explain which stocks are likely to be most affected by sentiment, rather than simply pointing

out that the level of stock prices in the aggregate depends on sentiment. 3

         In particular, stocks of low capitalization, younger, unprofitable, high volatility, non-

dividend paying, growth companies, or stocks of firms in financial distress, are likely to be

disproportionately sensitive to broad waves of investor sentiment. As the reader will recall, small

startup firms represented a majority of the excitement and subsequent carnage of the Internet

bubble, so this statement may ring true already. Theoretically, it follows because these groups of

sort.

 As an analogy, aggregate risk aversion is another one-dimensional variable that will affect all stocks to some
degree but will also affect some more than others.



                                                                                                                  2
stocks tend to be harder to arbitrage, for example they have higher transaction costs, and because

they are more difficult to value, making biases more insidious and valuation mistakes more

likely.

          The remainder of the paper develops these theoretical predictions in more detail, shows

how one might measure sentiment explicitly, and finally how to use the sentiment measures to

validate the key predictions of the top down approach. Certainly, both the bottom up and top

down approaches to investor sentiment deserve continued attention. The advantage of the top

down approach is its potential to encompass bubbles, crashes, and more everyday patterns in

stock prices in a simple, intuitive and comprehensive way. The advantage of the bottom up

model is in providing microfoundations for the variation in investor sentiment that the top down

model takes as exogenous.




Theoretical Effects of Investor Sentiment on Stocks



          A pioneering and well-known set of studies of sentiment and aggregate stock returns

appeared in the 1980s. They were largely atheoretical, testing in various ways whether the stock

market as a whole could be mispriced. Authors looked for: the tendency of aggregate returns to

mean revert; volatility in aggregate stock index returns that could not be justified by volatility in

fundamentals, which is in fact another way of characterizing mean reversion in returns; or




                                                                                                    3
predictability of aggregate returns using simple valuation ratios like the ratio of aggregate

dividends to stock market value. 4

        In these studies, the role of sentiment was left implicit, and the statistical evidence was

not usually very strong. Practically speaking, it is hard to distinguish a random walk from a long-

lived bubble, especially in a short time series containing at best a few bubbles. Even when

statistical inferences seemed robust, the economic interpretation was still unclear. Predictability

of stock returns could reflect the correction of sentiment-induced mispricings or, arguably, time-

varying risk or risk aversion that causes time variation in expected stock returns.

        The more recent studies, such as Baker and Wurgler (2006), utilize interim advances in

behavioral finance theory to provide sharper tests for the effects of sentiment. In particular, in the

many behavioral models of securities markets inspired by De Long et al. (1990), investors are of

two types: rational arbitrageurs who are sentiment-free and irrational traders prone to exogenous

sentiment. They compete in the market and set prices and expected returns. But, arbitrageurs are

limited in various ways. These limits come from short horizons or costs and risks of trading and

short selling. So, prices are not always at their fundamental values. In such models, mispricing

arises out of the combination of two factors: a change in sentiment on the part of the irrational

traders, and a limit to arbitrage from the rational ones.

        The key predictions of this framework come from its two moving parts. Consider first the

possibility that sentiment-based demand shocks vary across firms, while arbitrage is equally

difficult across firms. For example, suppose one thinks about investor sentiment as the

propensity to speculate by the marginal investor, akin to a propensity to play the lottery. Then

sentiment is almost by definition a higher demand for more speculative securities, and when

4
  See Shiller (1981) on excess volatility, Fama and French (1988) and Poterba and Summers (1988) on mean
reversion, and Campbell and Shiller (1988) and Fama and French (1989) on valuation ratios.



                                                                                                           4
sentiment increases we expect such “speculative” stocks to have contemporaneously higher

returns.

       What makes some stocks more speculative than others? We believe that the crucial

characteristic is the difficulty and subjectivity of determining their true values. For instance, in

the case of a young, currently unprofitable but potentially extremely profitable growth firm, the

combination of no earnings history and a highly uncertain future allows investors to defend

valuations ranging from much too low to much too high, as befits their prevailing sentiment.

During a bubble, when the propensity to speculate is high, investment bankers can join the

chorus arguing for high valuations. By contrast, a firm with a long earnings history, tangible

assets, and stable dividends is much less subjective to value, and thus its stock is likely to be less

sensitive to sentiment. One could appeal to psychological foundations here. Uncertainty means

that the effect of overconfidence (Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyman, 1998),

representativeness, and conservatism (Barberis, Shleifer, and Vishny, 1998) is more pronounced.

And, differences of opinion (Miller, 1977), even when investors have the same basic

information, can be large. The changes over time in these biases, we would call shifts in the

propensity to speculate.

       Now suppose instead that we view investor sentiment as simply optimism or pessimism

about stocks in general, and we allow the limits to arbitrage to vary across stocks. A large body

of research shows that arbitrage tends to be particularly risky and costly for certain stocks:

namely those that are young, small, unprofitable, or experiencing extreme growth. Such stocks

tend to be more costly to buy and to sell short (D’Avolio, 2002). Such stocks have a high degree

of idiosyncratic variation in their returns, which makes betting on them riskier (Wurgler and

Zhuravskaya, 2002). Such stocks’ higher volatility may lead to second-guessing by the investors




                                                                                                       5
who provide funds to the arbitrageur, ultimately leading to withdrawals from contrarian

arbitrageurs just when the mispricing is greatest (Shleifer and Vishny, 1997). By not paying

dividends, such stocks’ fundamentals remain far in the future and therefore subject to speculation

(Pontiff, 1996). Thus, again, we might expect that sentiment has a greater effect on such stocks.

       The key point is that in practice, the same securities that are difficult to value also tend to

be difficult to arbitrage. Therefore we are left with a very robust and testable conclusion: The

stocks most sensitive to investor sentiment will be those of companies that are younger, smaller,

more volatile, unprofitable, non-dividend paying, distressed or with extreme growth potential, or

having analogous characteristics. Whereas “bond-like” stocks will be less driven by sentiment.

Again, note that this assessment does not depend on specifying a fine definition of investor

sentiment or rely on just one arbitrage mechanism such as short-sales constraints.



       The Sentiment Seesaw

       Figure 1 summarizes this into a simple, unified view of the effects of sentiment on stocks.

The x-axis orders stocks according to how difficult they are to value and arbitrage. Bond-like

stocks, such as regulated utilities, are toward the left; stocks of companies that are newer,

smaller, more volatile, distressed or extreme growth are toward the right. The y-axis measures

prices, with P* denoting fundamental values which, of course, can vary over time. The lines then

illustrate the basic hypotheses about how stock valuations are affected by swings in sentiment.

High sentiment should be associated with high stock valuations, particularly for the hardest to

value and arbitrage stocks. Low sentiment works in the reverse direction. In the absence of

sentiment, stocks are, on average, assumed to be correctly priced at P*.




                                                                                                    6
       An empirical question that arises in the drawing of Figure 1 is where to locate the

crossing point of this seesaw. One case (not in Figure 1) is that no crossing point exists: the

upward-sloping high sentiment line lies entirely above the no sentiment P line, which in turn lies

entirely above the downard-sloping low sentiment line. That is, when sentiment increases, all

stocks’ prices go up, but some more than others. In this case, the aggregate effects of sentiment

will be strong, because aggregate stock indexes are simply averages of the underlying stocks.

       As drawn, Figure 1 reflects the more complex case where the prices of particularly safe,

easy-to-arbitrage stocks actually are inversely related to sentiment. This could occur if sentiment

fluctuations induce substantial changes in the demand for speculative securities, for example

engendering “flights to quality” within the stock market. Such episodes may, controlling for any

changes in fundamentals, reduce the prices of speculative stocks and at the same time increase

the prices of bond-like stocks. In this case, the effect of sentiment on aggregate returns will be

muted, as stocks are not all moving in the same direction.

       Behavioral theory thus delivers clear cross-sectional predictions about the effects of

sentiment—but the aggregate predictions are somewhat less clear, which may help to explain

why the 1980s studies did not always reach strong statistical conclusions. The rest of the paper

reviews some empirical evidence regarding three critical aspects of Figure 1. First, we discuss

how investor sentiment can be empirically measured.

       Second, we ask whether more speculative and harder to arbitrage stocks are indeed more

sensitive to sentiment, in the sense that their prices comove more with an index of sentiment

changes. In finance parlance, we ask whether speculative and harder to arbitrage stocks have

higher “sentiment betas.” (The term is by analogy to the famous concept of market beta, which

measures the exposure of a stock to returns on the stock market as a whole. A stock with a




                                                                                                     7
market beta of 1.0 appreciates by 1 percentage point, on average, when the market return is one

percentage point. Market betas above 1.0 indicate relatively high market risk exposure.) We also

test whether bond-like stocks have negative sentiment betas, i.e. their returns are negatively

related to changes in sentiment, as represented in Figure 1.

       Third, we investigate whether current investor sentiment levels predict future returns as

sentiment wanes (perhaps spurred by fundamental news or an absence thereof) or as arbitrage

forces eventually accumulate to correct mispricings. This is an important test, because sentiment

measures may, despite our best efforts, be contaminated by economic fundamentals, and

fundamentals should of course affect stock returns contemporaneously. In other words, the

comovement patterns are subject to a correlated omitted variables critique. Return predictability

helps to address this concern because it suggests a profitable trading strategy, which by

definition cannot exist if stocks are priced correctly.



       Ruling Out Other Explanations

       Contrasting Figure 1 with some other finance frameworks helps to clarify the unique

predictions of the sentiment model. The classical risk-based and the behavioral disagreement

models make distinct predictions about the slope of the thick, or overall, valuation line. Neither

makes predictions about the dashed valuations, conditional on sentiment.

       In the risk-based asset pricing models, such as the capital-asset pricing model, a stock’s

expected return depends on its risk exposure, measured by market beta, times the market risk

premium, which is the expected return on the stock market as a whole. Furthermore, since

investors are rational and risk averse in these models, the market risk premium is always




                                                                                                     8
positive, though it may change over time. See Fama and French (2004) and Perold (2004) for

introductions to this model.

       What does this imply for tests of return predictability? Even if speculative and hard-to-

arbitrage securities have higher market betas, as is likely the case, classical models predict that

such stocks always have higher expected returns than bond-like stocks. In fact, as we will see

below, this is not true. When sentiment is measured to be high, speculative and hard-to-arbitrage

stocks have lower future returns, on average, than bond-like stocks. This is a powerful

confirmation of the sentiment-driven mispricing view.

       In a behavioral model of disagreement among regular investors combined with short-

sales constraints by arbitrageurs, on the other hand, hard to short stocks can become overvalued.

As fundamentals are revealed, this mispricing will disappear, so the future returns of such stocks

will be relatively low on average. The sentiment seesaw in Figure 1 makes a distinct and testable

prediction that hard to arbitrage stocks can, conditional on the state of sentiment, be undervalued

as well. We will also investigate this point.




Measuring Investor Sentiment



       Investor sentiment is not straightforward to measure, but there is no fundamental reason

why one cannot find imperfect proxies that remain useful over time. We discuss some generic

issues involved in measuring sentiment and describe proxies for sentiment that have come into

use. We then describe a sentiment index which combines several of these proxies, and we show

that it fluctuates with the major speculative episodes of the past 40 years.



                                                                                                      9
       Potential Sentiment Proxies

       An exogenous shock in investor sentiment can lead to a chain of events, and the shock

itself could in principle be observed at any or every part of this chain. For example, it might

show up first in investor beliefs, which could be surveyed. These beliefs might then translate to

observable patterns of securities trades, which are recorded. Limited arbitrage implies that these

demand pressures might cause some mispricings, which might be observed using benchmarks for

fundamental value like the book-to-market ratio. These mispricings might engender an informed

response by insiders, such as corporate executives, who may have both the superior information

and the incentive to take advantage of it, and the patterns of firms in whether they choose to

adjust their balance of equity or debt could be observed.

       The bad news is that each part of this chain is also subject to confounding influences.

Economists always treat surveys with some degree of suspicion, because of the potential gap

between how people respond to a survey and how they actually behave. Trades net to zero, so

measuring sentiment with trading activity means taking a stand on the identity of irrational

investors. Market prices of securities normally reflect fundamentals, by and large, with sentiment

playing a lesser role. And, corporations may alter their financial structure for many reasons,

including a change in business fundamentals, rather than simply acting as corporate arbitrageurs.

       Such considerations suggest that the practical approach is to combine several imperfect

measures. Candidate ways of measuring sentiment, ordered from origins in investor psychology

to responses by corporate insiders, include: surveys, mood proxies, retail investor trades, mutual

fund flows, trading volume, dividend premia, closed-end fund discounts, option implied

volatility, first-day returns on initial public offerings, volume of initial public offerings, new




                                                                                                     10
equity issues, and insider trading. We comment on these sentiment proxies and then choose

among them.

       Investor Surveys. Perhaps just by asking investors how optimistic they are, we can gain

insight into the marginal irrational investor. Robert Shiller has conducted investor attitude

surveys since 1989. UBS/Gallup surveys randomly-selected investor households, and Investors

Intelligence surveys financial newsletter writers. Qiu and Welch (2006) point out that although

consumers polled for the University of Michigan Consumer Confidence Index are not asked

directly for their views on securities prices, changes in that consumer confidence index

nonetheless correlate highly with changes in the UBS/Gallup index. They show that changes in

the consumer confidence measure correlate especially strongly with small stock returns and the

returns of firms held disproportionately by retail investors.

       Investor Mood. Some papers have creatively tried to connect stock prices to exogenous

changes in human emotions. Kamstra, Kramer, and Levi (2003) find that market returns are on

average lower through the fall and winter, which they attribute to the onset of seasonal affective

disorder, a depressive disorder associated with declining hours of daylight. Patterns at different

latitudes and both hemispheres also are consistent with this interpretation. Edmans, Garcia, and

Norli (2006) use international soccer results as a mood variable and find that losses in major

games predict poor returns in the losing country the next day, particularly among small stocks.

       Retail investor trades. The inexperienced retail or individual investor is more likely than

the professional to be subject to sentiment. Greenwood and Nagel (2006) find that younger

investors were more likely than older investors to buy stocks at the peak of the Internet bubble.

More generally, Barber, Odean, and Zhu (2003) and Kumar and Lee (2006) find in micro-level

trading data that retail investors buy and sell stocks in concert, which is consistent with




                                                                                                  11
systematic sentiment. Kumar and Lee suggest constructing sentiment measures for retail

investors based on whether such investors are buying or selling.

       Mutual fund flows. Data are easily available on how mutual fund investors allocate across

fund categories. Brown, Goetzmann, Hirkai, Shiraishi, and Watanabe (2002) propose an overall

market sentiment measure based on how fund investors are moving into and out of, for example,

“safe” government bond funds to “risky” growth stocks funds. Mutual fund investors are well-

known to chase investments with high recent returns (e.g. Warther, 1995), so whether the

causality also goes the other direction—whether their allocation decisions actually lead to

mispricing—is a tricky question. Frazzini and Lamont (2005) find some affirmative evidence by

using fund flows to proxy for sentiment for individual stocks. They find that when funds that

hold a particular stock experience strong inflows, the subsequent performance of that stock is

relatively poor.

       Trading volume. Trading volume, or more generally liquidity, can be viewed as an

investor sentiment index. For instance, Baker and Stein (2004) note that if short-selling is costlier

than opening and closing long positions (as it is, in practice), irrational investors are more likely

to trade, and thus add liquidity, when they are optimistic and betting on rising stocks rather than

when they are pessimistic and betting on falling stocks. In Scheinkman and Xiong (2003),

volume reveals underlying difference of opinion, which are in turn related to valuation levels

when short selling is difficult. Market turnover, the ratio of trading volume to the number of

shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange, is a simple proxy for this concept.

       Dividend premium. Dividend-paying stocks resemble bonds in that their predictable

income stream represents a salient characteristic of safety. The first price-based measure we

mention here is therefore the relative “premium” for dividend-paying stocks, which may be




                                                                                                   12
inversely related to sentiment. Baker and Wurgler (2004a, b) define the dividend premium as the

difference between the average market-to-book-value ratios of dividend payers and nonpayers.

The dividend premium explains well the major historical trends in firms’ propensity to pay

dividends, such as the post-1977 decline documented by Fama and French (2001)—that is, when

dividends are at a premium, firms are more likely to pay them, and less so when they are

discounted. On the margin, firms appear to cater to prevailing sentiment for or against “safety”

when deciding whether to pay dividends.

        Closed-end Fund Discount. Closed-end funds are investment companies who issue a

fixed number of shares, which then trade on stock exchanges. The closed-end fund “discount”

(or occasionally premium) is the difference between the net asset value of a fund’s actual

security holdings and the fund’s market price. Many authors, including Zweig (1973), Lee,

Shleifer, and Thaler (1991), and Neal and Wheatley (1998), have argued that if closed-end funds

are disproportionately held by retail investors, the average discount on closed-end equity funds

may be a sentiment index, with the discount increasing when retail investors are bearish.

        Option implied volatility. Options prices rise when the value of the underlying asset has

greater expected volatility, and options pricing models such as the Black-Scholes formula can be

inverted to yield implied volatility as a function of options prices. The Market Volatility Index

(“VIX”), which measures the implied volatility of options on the Standard and Poor’s 100 stock

index, is often called the “investor fear gauge” by practitioners. Whaley (2000) discusses the

spikes in the VIX series since its 1986 inception, which include the crash of October 1987 and

the 1998 Long Term Capital Management crisis.

        IPO First-Day Returns. Initial public offerings sometimes earn such remarkable returns

on their first trading day that it is difficult to find an explanation that does not involve investor




                                                                                                        13
enthusiasm. For example, Netscape’s return on the day of its August 1995 IPO was 108 percent.

Interestingly, IPO first-day returns are not idiosyncratic. Average first-day returns display peaks

and troughs which are highly correlated with IPO volume (below) and other sentiment proxies

that are not fundamentally related. 5

         IPO Volume. The underlying demand for initial public offerings is often said to be

extremely sensitive to investor sentiment. Investment bankers speak of “windows of

opportunity” for an initial public offering that capriciously open and close. Such caprice could

explain the fact that IPO volume displays wild fluctuations, with a rate of over 100 issues per

month in some periods and zero issues per month in others.

         Equity Issues Over Total New Issues. A broader measure of equity financing activity is

the equity share of total equity and debt issues by all corporations. This measures all equity

offerings, not just IPOs. Baker and Wurgler (2000) find that high values of the equity share

portend low stock market returns, and suggest that this pattern reflects firms shifting successfully

between equity and debt to reduce the overall cost of capital. This pattern need not imply that

individual firms or their managers can predict prices on the market as a whole. Rather, correlated

mispricings across firms may lead to correlated managerial actions, which may then forecast

correlated corrections of mispricings – that is, it will forecast market returns.

         Insider Trading. Corporate executives have better information about the true value of

their firms than outside investors. Thus, legalities aside, executives’ personal portfolio decisions

may also reveal their views about the mispricing of their firm. If sentiment leads to correlated

5
  Why IPOs are “underpriced” to such an extreme degree is still a puzzle, since the prices are set in consultation with
investment bankers well-informed about market conditions. The extreme unpredictability of investor sentiment may
be a factor. The offer price is typically set in advance and indications of interest are then gathered from potential
investors. It may be better to issue shares at a likely discount to first day prices than risk an undersubscribed offering
in a period of generally high sentiment and valuations. This raises the question of why companies do not simply
auction their shares. See Ritter (2003) for a discussion of underpricing and Ljungqvist, Nanda, and Singh (2006) for
a sentiment-based model.



                                                                                                                      14
mispricings across firms, insider trading patterns may contain a systematic sentiment component.

See Seyhun (1998) for evidence on the ability of insider trading patterns to predict stock returns.



       An Operational Sentiment Index

       Which of the above measures to choose? Data availability narrows the list considerably.

Sentiment may vary daily, but major episodes occur over years, and the most convincing tests of

the effects of sentiment are those in which it is used to actually predict long-horizon returns—

tests which suggest a contrarian trading strategy. This rules out using data that do not go back as

far as our stock returns data (i.e. to the 1960s), for example including insider trading, micro-level

data on trading behavior, and implied volatility series.

       Instead, we construct an index based on the six proxies used by Baker and Wurgler

(2006): trading volume as measured by NYSE turnover; the dividend premium; the closed-end

fund discount; the number and first-day returns on IPOs; and the equity share in new issues. All

these data are available at www.stern.nyu.edu/~jwurgler. Later on, we will also consider some

mutual fund series.

       Although these six proxies are highly correlated in the expected directions, some of them

also contain idiosyncratic components that are unrelated to sentiment. For example, the 1975

deregulation of brokerage commissions and the subsequent long decline in trading costs has led

to a decades-long upward trend in turnover, so we use the log of turnover minus a five-year

moving average. With respect to closed-end fund discounts, if the majority of individual

investors have come to prefer open-end funds in recent years, the discount provides a less useful

summary of the opinion of the marginal investor than it once did. And the evolution of public




                                                                                                   15
debt markets has made the equity share less useful in recent years. But, no obvious patch

suggests itself in these cases.

         Also, some of the sentiment proxies reflect economic fundamentals to some extent. For

instance, IPO volume depends, in part, on prevailing investment opportunities. To remove such

influences, at least partially, we regress each proxy on a set of macroeconomic indicators—

growth in industrial production, real growth in durable, nondurable, and services consumption,

growth in employment, and an NBER recession indicator—and use the residuals from these

regressions as our sentiment proxies.

         Since the six sentiment proxies, especially given that major macroeconomic influences

have been removed, will have a common sentiment component, we can iron out the remaining

idiosyncracies by averaging them together into an index. We form a sentiment levels index to

test for return predictability conditional on the state of sentiment and also a sentiment changes

index to test for return comovement patterns associated with changes in sentiment. The levels

index is simply the first principal component of the six proxies. 6 The changes index is the first

principal component of the changes in the six proxies. 7



6
  Brown and Cliff (2004) also use a principal components methodology to define a sentiment index. The first
principal component of a set of time series variables is simply the linear combination of the variables with the
coefficients chosen to capture as much of the joint variation across the series as possible. The second principal
component performs the same analysis but defines the relevant series as the residuals from the first principal
component, etc. A decision with defining which of our six series to include in the analysis is timing. Some variables
may reflect the same shift in sentiment before others. In general, proxies that involve firm supply decisions are
further down the chain of events and likely to lag behind proxies that are based directly on investor trading patterns
or prices. Baker and Wurgler (2006) find that the best combination to capture the common variation in annual series
includes the current values of the closed-end fund discount, the equity share, and IPO volume, and one-year-lagged
versions of the three other variables. We are using monthly data here, but for simplicity we also adopt this
convention.
7
  While we could simply take the changes in the sentiment levels index, a better approach is to form a second index
based on the first principal component of the changes in the six proxies. The reason for this preference is that the
proxies have differential noisiness in going from levels to changes. E.g., turnover has low frequency error related to
falling transaction costs, but high frequency changes are more informative; the equity share, on the other hand, has
low frequency error related to long-term shifts in financing patterns plus high frequency error because corporations
can respond to sentiment only with a lag (which itself is unlikely to be consistent enough to try to align the changes


                                                                                                                   16
         Figure 2 shows the sentiment indexes graphically. As expected, variables positively

associated with sentiment levels include share turnover, IPO volume and first-day returns, and

the equity share in new issues, and those negatively associated are the closed-end fund discount

and the dividend premium. The bottom panel reports the changes index. The coefficients all have

the same signs as in the levels index, with the exception of the equity share. We regard its

unexpected sign as a chance event made possible by the fact that its changes at high frequencies

are largely unrelated to sentiment, but we retain it to avoid data mining.

         While data availability is the key constraint, some judgment has entered this approach to

measuring sentiment. Robustness is a natural question. We offer two remarks in response. First,

the process of averaging the six proxies is not crucial. They are strongly correlated and if they

were each studied as independent sentiment indexes, some would display empirical results even

stronger (i.e., more consistent with a strong role for sentiment) than those we present below. We

pursue the index approach so as not to arbitrarily elevate individual proxies and to iron out

idiosyncratic variation. Second, Baker and Wurgler (2006) find that macro fundamentals explain

little of the common variation in the six series. In other words, indexes formed from the “raw”

series would look and perform almost identically to those used here. Nonetheless we include this

step to illustrate an approach to controlling for fundamentals.



         Does This Index Capture Major Fluctuations In Sentiment? An Eyeball Test

         Perhaps the best evidence that the index generally succeeds in capturing sentiment is

simply that it lines up fairly well with the anecdotal accounts of bubbles and crashes written by


in the series). Hence, equity share fluctuations will feature prominently in a changes in the levels index, but will
likely drop out in an index based on changes.




                                                                                                                       17
authors such as Brown (1991), Dreman (1979), Graham (1973), Malkiel (1999), Shiller (2000),

and Siegel (1998). The first major bubble in our data period developed in 1967 and 1968. Brown

(1991, p. 90) writes that “scores of franchisers, computer firms, and mobile home manufactures

seemed to promise overnight wealth. … [while] quality was pretty much forgotten.” The early

1970s, on the other hand, are invariably described in bear market terms. Yet a set of established,

large, stable, consistently profitable stocks known as the “Nifty Fifty” enjoyed extreme price-

earnings ratios. Siegel (1998, p. 106) writes, “All of these stocks had proven growth records,

continual increases in dividends … and high market capitalization.” The Nifty Fifty is a mirror

image of the speculative episodes that occurred before and after it, which generally involved

small, young, unprofitable growth stocks in high sentiment periods.

       The late 1970s through mid-1980s are described anecdotally as a period of generally high

sentiment and witnessed a series of speculative episodes involving gambling issues in 1977 and

1978 and—more apparent in the levels index—natural resource startups in 1980 on the heels of

the second oil crisis (Ritter, 1984) and the high-tech and biotech booms in the first half of 1983.

But by 1987 and 1988, Malkiel (p. 80) writes, “market sentiment had changed from an

acceptance of an exciting story … to a desire to stay closer to earth with low-multiple stocks that

actually pay dividends.” Consistent with this view, the overall index shows sentiment at a high

level during the early 1980s and tailing off somewhat toward the end of the decade.

       The late-1990s bubble in technology stocks will be familiar to many readers. By all

accounts, sentiment was broadly high before the bubble started to burst in 2000. Malkiel draws

parallels to episodes in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, and Shiller and others compare the Internet

bubble to that of the late 1920s. The sentiment index flags 1999 as a high-sentiment year, and the

dividend premium and first-day returns on IPOs hit record levels that year.




                                                                                                  18
       The sentiment changes index in the bottom of Figure 2 is harder to decipher in an eyeball

test. However, when the series is viewed in light of major speculative episodes, one pattern does

appear: The volatility of sentiment rises in a speculative episode. This suggests that the relative

influence of fundamentals and sentiment on aggregate market returns changes over time.



       Mutual Fund Flows

       Detailed data on mutual fund flows are not available back to the 1960s, so we do not

include these in our main indexes. However, we use the period of overlap to correlate patterns in

fund flows and the indexes. This is useful because fund flows provide a transparent measure of

decisions made by a large set of investors who are, on average, less sophisticated and more likely

to display sentiment. Moreover, the fund flows data help us to investigate the precise mechanism

through which sentiment affects stock prices, as we explain.

       The Investment Company Institute offers monthly data on flows into various categories

of funds. We look at net flows into the eight stock-oriented fund categories for which data exist

back to January 1990. The categories vary from speculative “Aggressive Growth” funds to safer,

dividend-paying “Income” funds.

       Figure 3 shows the results of a principal components analysis of changes in fund flows,

as in Goetzmann et al. (2000). Once more, the principal components analysis helps us detect

general patterns across several time series while ironing out distracting idiosyncratic fluctuations.

The results in the figure show that across the eight stock fund categories, the first principal

component is a “general demand” effect. It reflects the fact that investors often shift in and out of

stock funds en masse. In contrast, the second principal component shows that the next most

important effect is shifts between more speculative funds and safer funds. Thus we call this the




                                                                                                   19
“speculative demand” component. Therefore, controlling for the overall generic equity fund

demand, when flows fall in the more speculative categories they tend to rise in the less

speculative categories. Barberis and Shleifer (2003) would call this “style investing.”

       With these two principal components in hand, we can construct monthly time series of

the two most important sources of changes in mutual fund flows: one reflecting general demand

and another reflecting speculative demand. We then correlate these with the sentiment changes

index. During the period of overlap, the sentiment changes index has a marginally significant

correlation of 0.16 with general fund demand and, perhaps more interestingly, a highly

significant correlation of 0.36 with speculative demand. This latter correlation is particularly

suggestive that our overall sentiment indexes do, to a large extent, capture a prevailing “greed”

versus “fear” or “bullish” versus “bearish” notion.

       Finally, recall that there are essentially two distinct channels by which sentiment will

have cross-sectional effects: when general investor demand for risky assets is uniform but stocks

differ in the costs and risks arbitrage, and when investor demand focuses on relatively

speculative stocks and the difficulty of arbitrage is held constant. The fairly clean empirical

break of fund flows into general and speculative demand components suggests the possibility of

empirically separating the two channels. Of course, both can operate at the same time.



Using Sentiment to Explain Current Returns



       With the index of sentiment changes and the fund flow series in hand, we now turn to

testing the key hypotheses about how sentiment affects stocks. We start by asking whether




                                                                                                    20
speculative and harder-to-arbitrage stocks are relatively more affected by sentiment changes. At

the end of the section, we briefly consider effects on the aggregate market.



         Defining Speculative, Difficult-to-arbitrage Stocks

         To study the differential effects of investor sentiment across firms, we first need to settle

on a way of sorting stocks according to their speculative appeal and their difficulty of arbitrage.

A natural proxy for speculative appeal would be the dispersion of professional analysts’earnings

forecasts for that company, but such forecasts are not available for all stocks back to the mid-

1960s. A possible proxy for difficulty of arbitrage could be a direct measure of transaction costs

for given stocks, but those too are unavailable for a long time series.

         We simply sort stocks according to their recent return volatility, specifically the standard

deviation of monthly returns over the prior year. Returns data are from the Center for Research

in Securities Prices (CRSP). High volatility is characteristic of stocks with strong speculative

appeal; low volatility is a bond-like feature. Moreover, highly volatile stocks are generally riskier

to arbitrage, so an arbitrageur with limited risk-bearing capacity will hesitate before making large

bets against mispricing. Each month, we place each stock into one of ten portfolios according to

the decile of their return volatility of the previous year, and we use the returns on the resulting

portfolios to represent the cross-section of stock returns. 8




8
  Baker and Wurgler (2006) divide stocks in several other ways, including firm age, market capitalization, dividend
payment, and profitability. These are natural given an intuition that larger, older, dividend paying and profitable
firms tend to be more bond-like and generally easier to arbitrage. They also sort stocks on growth and distress
indicators such as the market-to-book equity ratio, asset growth, and sales growth. When sorted this way, bond-like
stocks now lie in the middle deciles while speculative stocks, whether due to their extreme growth potential or risk
of financial distress, are found at both extremes. These other sorting methods produce qualitatively similar results,
so we report results only for volatility portfolios here.



                                                                                                                   21
         Sentiment Betas: Cross-Sectional Effects of Sentiment Changes

         Figure 4 shows the relationship between sentiment changes and the returns on the ten

volatility portfolios. The dependent variable is the monthly return on one of the ten volatility

portfolios. For each one of these ten portfolios, we run three time-series regressions. In Panel A,

we plot the coefficients on the general or speculative mutual fund demand factors. In Panel B, we

plot the coefficients on the sentiment changes index. Each of the regressions also includes the

value-weighted market return as a control variable, because high volatility stocks are likely to

have higher market betas, an effect that we do not want to contaminate the sentiment betas.

         The results are as expected. The effect of general demand for stock funds on monthly

returns is higher for higher volatility portfolios, presumably because stocks therein are harder to

arbitrage. In addition, the effect of speculative demand is also increasing, presumably reflecting

the more speculative nature of volatile stocks. The convex pattern in the coefficients is

intriguing—stocks in the extreme volatility decile, which are often small, rapidly growing, or in

financial distress, are disproportionately more sensitive to both components of fund flows.

         Sentiment betas also increase as stocks become more speculative and harder to arbitrage. 9

The figure shows that controlling for market returns, a one-standard-deviation increase in the

sentiment changes index increases returns on the eighth volatility decile portfolio, for example,

by about one percentage point. The effect on the tenth decile portfolio is over two percentage

points. For particularly bond-like stocks, on the other hand, the effect is slightly negative. This is

consistent with the most bond-like stocks actually having slightly negative sentiment betas, i.e.

as conjectured in Figure 1. Once again, there is a convex pattern in the sentiment betas.



9
 See Glushkov (2005) for sentiment betas for portfolios sorted on other characteristics as well (as opposed to only
volatility). All of his results are closely consistent with the argument that hard to arbitrage and value stocks are more
sensitive to sentiment.



                                                                                                                      22
        Although these results are all highly consistent with the seesaw diagram, there are other

interpretations. For example, perhaps speculative flows are highly correlated with the returns of

speculative stocks simply because mutual fund investors chase returns, not because their trading

has any causal effect on its own. Or, the sentiment changes index may include components, such

as the dividend premium, which lead to mechanical differences in the correlations between

sentiment changes and different stocks (e.g., dividend paying and nonpaying stocks). 10 Or, the

sentiment index may, despite our best efforts, be contaminated by economic fundamentals,

which should of course affect returns independently. The fact that sentiment actually helps to

predict returns, as we illustrate below, suggests that these considerations cannot fully account for

the patterns in Figure 4.



        Aggregate Effects

        Although our main focus is on cross-sectional differences, a positive correlation will exist

between aggregate market returns and sentiment changes if the average stock is affected by

sentiment. Indeed, the correlation between an equal-weighted market return index and the

sentiment changes index is a highly significant 0.43. The correlation between equal-weighted

returns and speculative demand estimated from fund flows is 0.26, and the correlation between

equal-weighted returns and general demand from fund flows is 0.48. Using capitalization-

weighted market returns, which give more weight to large firms, the respective correlations are

0.32, 0.29, and 0.39, again all highly significant.




10
  Excluding any particular component from the sentiment indexes, including the dividend premium, does not alter
our conclusions.



                                                                                                              23
Using Sentiment to Predict Stock Returns



       We have perhaps saved the best for last. The strongest tests of the effects of sentiment

involve return predictability. If high sentiment indeed causes overvaluation, we may be able to

document low future returns on sentiment-prone stocks as sentiment wanes and fundamentals are

revealed. But predictability is not a natural implication of, for example, the skeptical view that

the correlation between returns and sentiment arises because the latter is contaminated by

fundamentals, for example.



       Cross-sectional Predictability

       To test these ideas further, we create an empirical version of the sentiment seesaw and

compare it to the predictions in Figure 1. We use the same volatility-based characterization of

stocks to identify those that are speculative and difficult to arbitrage. Next, we split the time

series into high- and low- sentiment periods using the previous month’s measure of the sentiment

level. Finally, we compute average returns for each of the ten volatility portfolios, for the two

separate periods and overall. As with the calculation of sentiment betas, we control for the value-

weighted market return.

       The resulting picture, in Figure 5, is strikingly similar to the predictions of the seesaw

diagram. When sentiment is low, the average future returns of speculative stocks exceed those of

bond-like stocks. When sentiment is high, the average future returns of speculative stocks are on

average lower than the returns of bond-like stocks. This is a telling pattern—the fact that riskier

stocks (at least, stocks that are riskier by all outward appearances) sometimes have lower




                                                                                                     24
expected returns is inconsistent with classical asset pricing in which investors bear risk because

they are compensated by higher expected return.

         The unconditional average returns are slightly lower for speculative stocks, consistent

with behavioral models of disagreement among investors combined with short-sales constraints

such Hong and Stein (2003) and others they discuss in this volume. The market-adjusted returns

are on average positive because of the well-known size effect—in January, small capitalization

stocks earn high returns, on average—which increases the average return of our equally-

weighted portfolios. Controlling for equal-weighted market returns instead of value-weighted

returns shifts the market-adjusted returns down across all ten portfolios, but the overall similarity

to Figure 1 remains intact.



         Aggregate Predictability

         When sentiment is high, subsequent market returns are low. Figure 6 shows that when the

sentiment level is more than one standard deviation above its historical average, monthly returns

average -0.34 percentage points for value-weighted market index returns and -0.41 percentage

points for equal-weighted returns. And when the investor sentiment level is very low, for

example more than one standard deviation below its historical average, monthly returns average

1.18 and 2.75 percentage points for value- and equal-weighted indexes, respectively. 11

Therefore, just as the correlation between sentiment changes and returns is higher for an equal-

weighted index of returns, so is the correlation between sentiment levels and subsequent equal-




11
  Figure 6 breaks the historical time series into four sentiment states, while Figure 5 conditions breaks it into only
two. We made the latter choice to allow for an easier comparison to the seesaw diagram. If Figure 5 were to display
results for four sentiment states, it would display all of the expected patterns, e.g. when sentiment is very high, the
highest-volatility stocks subsequently earn particularly low returns, and so on.



                                                                                                                     25
weighted stock returns. The gap between equal-weighted and value-weighted market returns

again demonstrates that the impact of sentiment is stronger on small stocks, as predicted.

       While Figure 6 indicates economically important gaps, the statistical significance is

modest, as is the case with other non-sentiment predictors of aggregate returns such as the

dividend-price ratio. Put another way, market crashes tend to occur in high sentiment periods,

but the timing of the crashes within these periods is very hard to predict.




Conclusion



       This paper takes a “top down” approach to behavioral finance and the stock market,

whereby we take the origin of investor sentiment as exogenous and instead focus on its empirical

effects. We show that it is quite possible to measure investor sentiment, and that waves of

sentiment have clearly discernible, important, and regular effects on individual firms and on the

stock market as a whole. In particular, stocks that are difficult to arbitrage or to value are most

affected by sentiment. The seesaw diagram in Figure 1 summarizes our approach.

       Looking forward, the investor sentiment approach faces a number of challenges:

characterizing and measuring uninformed demand or investor sentiment; understanding the

foundations and variation in investor sentiment over time; and determining which particular

stocks attract speculators or have limited arbitrage potential. Much remains to be done in terms

of spelling out this framework, but the potential payoffs of an improved understanding of

investor sentiment are substantial. For example, the standard methodology for estimating

fundamental market betas, an input to long-term capital budgeting and other important financial



                                                                                                      26
decisions, does not account for sentiment; doing so might improve estimates and clarify their

interpretation. Finally, we have seen that sentiment affects the cost of capital. Therefore it may

have real consequences for the allocation of corporate investment capital across safer and more

speculative firms.

The contribution of a one standard deviation change in each equity-oriented mutual fund category to the first two
principal components of changes in mutual fund flows, which we label general and speculative demand components.
Each bar shows the impact of a one standard deviation change in mutual fund flow. For example, a one standard
deviation change in flows into Aggressive Growth funds increases the first principal component by 0.23 and the
second principal component by 0.29. Flows are net sales minus redemptions by category, scaled by total mutual
fund assets across categories.

Figure 5. Sentiment and future returns. Average monthly returns over the value-weighted market index for
volatility sorted portfolios following a month with a positive sentiment level (short dash); a negative level (long
dash); and the overall average market-adjusted return. The latter are positive because of the small firm effect over
this period: the volatility portfolios are equal weighted while the market index is value weighted.
