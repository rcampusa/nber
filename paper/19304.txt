                                              ABSTRACT

The extant literature on cultural transmission takes competing cultures in society as given and parental
cultural preferences as fixed. We relax these assumptions by endogenizing both societal and parental
preferences. We use smoking as a case-study of a cultural trait which did not always exist, and which
over time has switched from being perceived as socially acceptable to being perceived as undesirable.
In our model, parents' preferred cultural traits depend on the perceived health costs of smoking, and
societal preferences depend on the behavior of a tobacco industry that aims to maximize smoking prevalence.
We derive conditions for the emergence and persistence of the smoking habit, and find new implications
for the relationship between parental and societal influences. We then test explicitly for the validity
of our theoretical framework using novel US data. We find that our framework is able to capture features
of smoking behavior which existing models are unable to explain.

1     Introduction

Cultural traits and norms, like risk-preferences, corruption, and altruism, are important in shaping individual


economic behavior. The process by which such traits get transmitted from one generation to the next determines


whether they survive and and how they are geographically distributed. In this study, we explain how cultures rst


emerge in society and how they may persist across generations even when parental preferences change over time.


Our study adds to a growing economics literature that looks at the joint role of parental and social channels of


cultural transmission.


    Researchers from a wide range of scientic disciplines have long debated the nature/nurture question to evaluate


the relative contribution of cultural (or environmental) and genetic eects on cognitive and psychological traits


(Sacerdote 2011). Economists have also contributed to this debate, and have provided elaborate theory predicting


that the genetic transmission of traits determines behavior (Robson and Samuelson 2011). However, this literature


generally concurs with the standard Darwinian prediction of the survival of the ttest, and is at odds with evidence


for the resilience of minoritarian ethnic and religious traits, e.g.   among the US immigrant population.        The


`melting pot' hypothesis, which suggests that characteristics and traits of the immigrant population in the US will


converge over time until they resemble those of the general population, is not consistent with observed patterns.


The observed behavior and characteristics of migrants conforms more closely to the `salad bowl' hypothesis,


which suggests that dierent ethnic and minoritarian communities can simultaneously co-exist and maintain their


respective cultural identities. In fact, norms in the country of immigrant origin are found to signicantly predict


the behavior of second- and third-generation US immigrants (e.g Borjas 1992, Fernandez and Fogli 2009, Algan


and Cahuc 2010). Starting with Bisin and Verdier (2001), the cultural transmission literature emerged to provide


a rationale for this previously unexplained persistence of cultural traits (see Bisin and Verdier 2011 for a review).


    Bisin and Verdier (2001) developed a model in which children acquire traits either via societal role models or via


parental socialization eorts. They assume that children are more likely to acquire a given trait the more prevalent


that trait is in society, and that all parents want to transmit their own cultural trait to their children.    Given


these assumptions, their model identies a key feature of the social environment that ensures the co-existence


of cultural traits in equilibrium. This property, which Bisin and Verdier term cultural 'substitutability', states


that parents socialize their children less when their cultural trait is more prevalent in the population. Although


ground-breaking, Bisin and Verdier's model fails to explain the persistence of traits that all parents want to avoid


passing on to their children, even if they themselves possess them (e.g. insincerity, preferences for unprotected


sex, substance use, low educational attainment). Saez-Marti and Sjogren (2008) address this failure by imposing


that societal role models who belong to the minority group have a disproportionate inuence on children. This


condition ensures the resilience of traits that parents do not actively transmit.




                                                          2
   Still, existing theory fails to account for two important aspects of cultural transmission. First, it says little


about how traits emerge. If societal role models of a new cultural trait do not exist then it is unclear how that


culture would arise in a society where all parents socialize their children to the same preferred culture. Second,


the theory does not inform us about how and why parents with the same cultural trait may prefer dierent traits


for their children.   Most eorts have focused on developing a framework for contexts where parents' cultural


attitudes are xed. Yet, history is alive with examples of newly born cultural traits (e.g. the culture of social


networking) and traits that switched from being perceived as virtuous or socially acceptable to being perceived


as bad or undesirable, and vice versa (e.g.   preferences about smoking, polluting the environment, pre-marital


sex, polygyny, divorce, womens' rights etc.).   Using the smoking habit as a case-study, we adapt the cultural


transmission framework to account for this general class of traits.


   Smoking of tobacco was rst adopted before the 15th century by native Americans, who used it for recreation,


medicinal purposes, or as a hallucinogenic in rituals. When Christopher Columbus and his crew discovered the


American continent, they also discovered smoking of tobacco and introduced the practice to Europe.         In 1854,


Philip Morris made the rst hand-rolled cigarettes in London's Bond Street. The second industrial revolution then


saw the invention of the cigarette rolling machine, which made it possible to mass produce cigarettes cheaply. From


that time and till the 1960s, the habit of smoking diused rapidly, producing high prots for the tobacco industry.


By the time of the world wars, smoking had become so socially acceptable that governments in most countries


distributed cigarettes to troops as part of their regular daily rations. Some even continued to subsidize cigarette


consumption during peacetime. The social perception of smoking started to change only after the publication of


the Royal College of Physicians 1962 report on Smoking and Health (RCPL, 1962) and the US Surgeon General's


Report on Smoking (USDHEW 1964).          Those reports compiled and distilled for public consumption scientic


evidence about the health consequences of tobacco use that had been accumulating for more than three decades.


In the ensuing years, public campaigns against tobacco consumption followed. Over time, those campaigns and


the ever accumulating evidence impacted the popularity of the smoking habit.


   What this brief history of smoking teaches us is that the dynamics of the smoking culture have been shaped


by the strategic behavior of a prot-maximizing industry, and the discovery and diusion of scientic evidence.


We take this lesson to theory and build the rst model of cultural transmission that is able to predict both the


emergence and the long-term persistence of culture in a world where outside forces may aect parents' preferred


trait for their children. In our model, the exibility in parental preferences is due to the availability and spread


of information aecting perceptions about the health cost of smoking. This makes our setup more general than


existing models, each of which assumes a particular distribution of parental preferences, e.g.     that all parents


promote their own trait (Bisin and Verdier 2001) or that all parents promote the same trait (Saez-Marti and


Sjogren 2008). We also relax a standard assumption in the literature that children are more likely to acquire a


given trait the more popular that trait is in society. Instead, we assume the existence of a tobacco industry which




                                                         3
can manipulate youth smoking behavior (e.g. via advertising). We respectively dene as cultural conformity and


cultural distinction the positive and the negative relationship between the probability of adopting a trait and the


prevalence of that trait in society. Our theory formalizes the relationship of parental and social inuences that


existing models predict by showing that cultural substitution in the parental channel of transmission is always


tied to cultural conformity in the social channel of transmission. It also makes the novel prediction that cultural


distinction is always tied to cultural complementarity. To establish support for our predictions, we carry out an


empirical investigation of smoking behavior using U.S. data.


    Our empirical exercise adds to a small but growing group of `structural socialization studies' that explicitly test


the properties of the transmission mechanism (e.g. Jellal and Wol 2002, Namoro and Roushdy 2008, Patacchini


and Zenou 2011, Dohmen et al. 2012). Consistent with our theoretical set-up, we model smoking participation by


children as a function of parental socialization eorts and societal inuences. We then estimate this function using


a novel dataset. Specically, we use data on the smoking behavior of parents and children, and on parental eorts


to socialize children against substance use, from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. We combine these data


with newly constructed smoking prevalence rates from the Current Population Survey, and newly collected data


on individual exposure to anti-smoking information based on the content of magazine articles. Our identication


of the causal eect of parental socialization relies on state- and time-variation in parental exposure to anti-smoking


information. Our identication of the causal eect of the societal inuences relies on the state-level measurement of


the smoking prevalence, which rules out bias due to peer-choice and residential selection, and on the use of xed


eects, which account for unobserved factors that drive both individual and group behavior. We nd evidence


that supports our variant of the cultural transmission theory. Using our results, we project smoking participation


rates of children to future generations and show that they converge to a steady-state in which smoking persists.


    The paper is structured as follows. In section 2, we summarize the health economics literature on smoking


behavior and explain how this falls short of describing smoking dynamics across generations.          In Section 3 we


formally present our model. In Sections 4-6, we describe our empirical strategy, the data we use, and our empirical


results. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper.




2     Health economics literature on the transmission of smoking

Empirically, children whose parents smoke are themselves more likely to smoke. But researchers have not estab-


lished that this simple correlation reects a causal relationship. Available evidence is often suspect because studies


use poor data, small samples, or fail to account for the endogeneity of parental smoking decisions. Even the better


studies have produced mixed evidence. Loureiro et al. (2010) nd correlations consistent with sex-specic trans-


mission using a UK sample. GÃ¶hlmann et al. (2010) nd no sex dierences using German data. Using the same


data but a dierent identication strategy, Lillard (2011) nds that parental smoking behavior does not inuence




                                                           4
whether children start smoking (for a review of earlier studies see Avenevoli and Ries Merikangas 2003).        One


explanation for these mixed ndings is that parental behavior may have countervailing inuences on their children


smoking habits and these inuences may cancel out each other's eect. For example, a child of a smoker may be


discouraged from smoking by parental advice and anti-smoking rules in the home (Powell and Chaloupka, 2005).


Conversely, a child of a non-smoker may be attracted to smoking as an act of revolution against parental control


(Huver et al., 2007). Such diverse inuences of parenting styles have been overlooked by most of the empirical


studies.


   Further, social transmission mechanisms of smoking may also be at play.         Children may copy the smoking


behavior of their peers or societal role-models irrespective of their parents' behavior.   This channel of smoking


transmission has been the subject of a large and growing literature in economics, which consents that `peer-eects'


are important drivers of smoking participation.    This general conclusion is qualitatively robust across dierent


denitions of peer groups, e.g. school-mates, classmates or friends (Gaviria and Raphael 2001, Powel, Tauras and


Ross 2005, Lundborg 2006, Clark and Loheac 2007, Fletcher 2010); siblings (Harris and Lopez-Valcarcel 2008);


partners (Clark and Etile 2006); and the population residing in the same state or prefecture (DeCicca et al 2008,


Yamamura 2011). Christopoulou and Lillard (2013) argue that, in fact, societal inuences on smoking participation


stretch beyond current generations and across national borders. They show that the smoking prevalence of the


children of British immigrants in Australia, South Africa, and the US, varies systematically with the smoking


behavior of their parents' birth cohort in the UK when that cohort was at the same point in their life-cycle. The


implication is that immigrant parents who grew up in a culture that tolerated (or even condoned) smoking will


carry and transmit those values (consciously or subconsciously) to their children, thereby increasing the probability


that they smoke.


   The available theory on the economics of smoking does not reect the intuitive processes that the empirical


evidence describes. To analyze smoking behavior, researchers typically use either a myopic addiction model or a


rational addiction model. These models aim to explain the life-course dynamics of the consumption of addictive


goods assuming that individuals introspectively change their own preferences.      The former model assumes that


current consumption depends on one's own past consumption (Pollak 1970, 1976a); the latter model assumes


that current consumption depends both on its past levels and on expectations of future consumption (Stigler and


Becker 1977; Becker and Murphy 1988). Both models ignore the possibility that one's consumption may depend


on the (past, present, or future) consumption of another person. As importantly, both models stipulate that the


initial consumption of the addictive good (i.e. when previous consumption has been consistently zero) depends


only on current factors and characteristics (e.g. prices). Thus, neither model is able to account for the fact that


two individuals with similar characteristics who face exactly the same environment may take dierent smoking


initiation decisions depending on their familial experiences during childhood. In eect, the models fail to achieve


their purpose of describing consumption dynamics over the life-course, and they completely ignore consumption




                                                         5
dynamics across generations. The same holds for subsequent models that were built to reconcile the myopic and


rational addiction theories (e.g. Orphanides and Zervos 1995, 1998).


     The economic theory on social interactions, which was developing concurrently with the theory of addiction,


oers a less restrictive framework of analysis.               The benchmark study by Pollak (1976b) developed a model of


habit formation and learning, allowing individual preferences to depend on others' behavior, which either provides


information about the costs and benets of behavior, or establishes a point of reference. However, rarely have the


theoretical implications of this approach been drawn with respect to smoking behavior, and in the few occasions


that they have, they have focused on peer eects and have ignored the parental channel of transmission (e.g.


Nakajima 2007, Poutvaara and Siemers 2008).                     In this paper, we draw on the literature of intergenerational


transmission of cultural traits to extend the theoretical analysis in this direction.




3      The model


3.1        Environment

Assume that there are an innite number of periods (t                  = 1, 2, 3, ...), and each individual is alive for two consecutive

periods. A person born in period           t   is a child in period     t   and an adult in period   t + 1.   Each individual bears one


child in adulthood. Hence, in period            t+1   the population consists of two overlapping generations: adults (born in


period     t)   and children (born in period     t + 1).   We use he to refer to a generic child and she to refer to a generic


adult.


     Individuals are either smokers or non-smokers; we call                  qt   the proportion of the youth who smoke in period      t.

We then denote         Qt+1   the proportion of adult smokers in period               t + 1.   An individual's smoking behavior need


not be constant throughout the course of a lifetime, since a smoker may decide to quit smoking. To simplify the


exposition, we however impose           Qt+1 = qt .    This is consistent with the literature on cultural transmission, which


assumes a cultural trait is acquired once and for all during childhood.
                                                                                           1 Our results are qualitatively robust to

extending the model to one where parents may quit smoking in adulthood.




3.2        Socialization process

Children are born without predened traits and acquire their smoking behavior through a transmission process.


A child is rst exposed to his parent's inuence, a process we refer to as                     vertical transmission.     The parent's


preferred       trait need not coincide with her           exhibited   trait, and so our specication does not force parents to


socialize their children to their own traits. In particular, a smoker parent may choose to socialize her child away

    1 By   implicitly assuming that socialization is a function of a parent's youth (rather than adult) smoking behavior, we are imposing
that attitudes towards smoking are acquired early on in life. This modeling assumption allows us to abstract away from the strategic
considerations that would arise from a situation where it would be Pareto optimal for all parents to quit smoking for their childrens'
sake, but who cannot credibly commit to doing so because they each have an incentive to freeride on others' eorts.




                                                                         6
from smoking, while remaining a smoker herself. The driving force for this divergence between own behavior and


desired behavior could be, for instance, that quitting has addiction costs that are only incurred by someone who


already smokes. To our knowledge, Saez-Marti and Sjogren (2008) and Patacchini and Zenou (2011) are the only


studies to have theoretically investigated in a cultural transmission framework the possibility that parents agree


on the trait to be passed on to future generations (e.g.                            educational attainment).         In contrast, the bulk of the


literature on cultural transmission has been motivated by the study of traits like religion, where parents want to


promote their own trait.


      Bisin and Verdier call `direct' transmission the process of having parents socialize children to their own traits.


`Vertical transmission' can thus be thought of as a generalization of `direct transmission'.
                                                                                                                        2 We will then refer to a

parent socializing her child to her own trait as                   direct socialization, and to a parent socializing her child to a trait
other than her own as            active socialization.        From here on, we focus on the case where all parents want to discourage


their children from becoming smokers. A smoker parent does not directly socialize her child to smoke, nor does


a non-smoker parent actively socialize her child to smoke. This feature arises endogenously once we let parents


choose the extent of vertical transmission, as it would be counterproductive to ever encourage children to acquire


the unwanted cultural trait. In the terminology of the model, non-smoker parents directly socialize their children


to their own trait with probability                d (qt ),   while smoker-parents actively socialize their children to the other trait


with probability        a (qt ).   With remaining probability                1 â d (qt )   for non-smoker parents, and      1 â a (qt )   for smoker


parents, the child acquires his trait through non parental inuences, a channel which the literature typically labels


as   horizontal transmission.               With probability        S (qt )    /   1 â S (qt ),   the child then becomes a smoker/non-smoker.


We think of        S (qt )   as reecting not only the inuence of societal role models but also the advertising eorts of a


prot-maximizing tobacco industry, as well as the child's own choices.


      Throughout the analysis, we impose one of two possible assumptions on the vertical transmission process:


cultural substitution         or   cultural complementarity.           The concept of cultural substitution has been a cornerstone of


the literature starting with Bisin and Verdier (2001), while cultural complementarity has received less attention


(e.g. Bisin, Topa and Verdier 2004; Patacchini and Zenou 2011).



      Assumption V1              (Cultural Substitution):          d (qt )   and a (qt ) are increasing in qt , and d (0) = a (0) = 0.

      Assumption V2              (Cultural Complementarity):             d (qt )    and a (qt ) are decreasing in qt , and d (1) = a (1) = 0.

      Assumption V1 says that a parent's vertical transmission eort is an increasing function of the unwanted trait


in society, and that parents exert no eort when the unwanted trait is absent from society.                                    When smoking is


the unwanted trait, parents want to make sure their children do not fall prey to the inuence of smoker role


models, and so         d (qt )   and   a (qt )   are increasing functions of smoking prevalence               qt .   Assumption V2 says that a

     2 Note   however that our terminology deviates from the literature, which interchangeably uses vertical and direct transmission
to refer to children mimicking their parents.




                                                                                7
parent's vertical transmission eort is a decreasing function of smoking prevalence in society. This phenomenon


can emanate in two possible ways. Parents may either give up on socializing their children when the outside threat


becomes greater, or the threat of the unwanted trait might be decreasing with its prevalence in society.


    We also impose one of two assumption on the horizontal transmission process:                    cultural conformity    or   cultural
distinction.   While cultural conformity has been an implicit feature of existing models on cultural transmission,


cultural distinction has been largely overlooked by theoretical studies. In a recent paper, Bisin et al. (2013) call


cultural conformity (distinction) the drop (increase) in psychological costs of interacting with a member of an


outside cultural group when that outside group becomes more dominant. They use those notions to understand


the implications of ethnic identify on marriage outcomes in a cultural transmission framework.                         We, however,


dene those concepts dierently:



    Assumption H1 (Cultural           conformity):    S (qt )   is increasing in   qt .

    Assumption H2 (Cultural           distinction):   S (qt )   is decreasing in   qt .

    A large literature on identity formation in psychology, sociology, and political science argues that cultural or


ethnic minority groups may either pursue cultural assimilation into the majority population or they may strive to


keep their distinct identities.
                                  3 We follow this reasoning to assume that the child culturally distinguishes himself

when he horizontally adopts the minority culture, and he culturally conforms when he horizontally adopts the


majority culture.    Thus, cultural distinction predicts that the greater smoking prevalence is in society, the less


likely the child is to adopt this trait. Cultural conformity makes the opposite prediction, that the greater smoking


prevalence is in society, the more likely the child is to adopt this trait.


    As we noted above, our denition of cultural conformity has been implicitly assumed in the literature as part


of the horizontal socialization. Existing work has thought of              S (qt )   as representing a   matching process,      i.e. the


likelihood a child is matched to a smoker role model from the population of adults (random-matching (e.g. Bisin


and Verdier 2001; Bisin et al.2013); non-random matching (e.g. Bisin et al. 2004; Saez-Marti and Sjogren 2008)).
                                                                                                                                      4

This matching process must satisfy two basic properties: (i) A child can only be matched to a non-smoker/smoker


when there are only non-smokers/smokers (S             (0) = 0     and   S (1) = 1),      and (ii) the likelihood of being matched


to a smoker increases with the proportion of smokers in society (i.e. our denition of cultural conformity). As


we will show in the empirical section of this paper, there is strong support for the possibility of having cultural


distinction, which cannot be accommodated by existing models.                      More importantly, the study of dynamics in


Section 3.5 reveals that under cultural substitution, assuming             S (0) = 0      leads to the disappearing of the smoking


culture in steady state, which is at odds with real-world behavior. The mechanism for horizontal transmission


that we propose addresses this gap in the theoretical literature.

  3 See Bisin and Verdier (2011) for a survey of this literature and a list of references.
  4 Saez-Marti and Sjogren (2008) refer to as conformism a non-random matching process           that favors the dominant trait.   Their
denition of conformism thus diers from both our and Bisin et al. (2013)'s denition of cultural conformity.




                                                                    8
3.3    Endogenous vertical transmission

We now explicitly dene the likelihood that a child follows his parent's desire to not smoke as a function of parental


socialization. We nd the optimal level of parental investment, and derive comparative statics for the eect of


smoking prevalence and health costs of smoking.


   As before, the subscript    i â {0, 1}       denotes the adult's smoking behavior. When the child is born, his parent


decides how much to invest in his anti-smoking socialization,              Î»i â¥ 0.   The cost of socialization is   c (Î»i ),   and causes


the child to become a non-smoker with probability          v (Î»i ).     With remaining probability       1 â v (Î»i ), the child becomes

a smoker with probability    S (q),   and a non-smoker with probability              1 â S (q).

   We normalize a parent's utility from not seeing her child smoke to                 0.   We then denote by    ui (H) < 0     the utility


of having a child who smokes, where         H   represents the   perceived     (but not necessarily actual,    H ) detrimental health

eects of smoking. All parents alike value their children's health status, and so                 ui (H) decreases with the perceived

health costs of smoking. Formally, an adult's utility function can be written as follows:




                                       U (Î»i ; q, H) â¡ (1 â v (Î»i )) S (q) ui (H) â c (Î»i ) ,


where a parent's investment is associated with a probability             (1 â v (Î»i )) S (q) of seeing her child smoke.    Proposition


1 gives the optimal interior investment in the anti-smoking acculturation of a child.



   Proposition 1:     Let v (.) be a dierentiable, increasing and concave function, and c (.) be a dierentiable,
increasing and convex function. When interior, a parent's optimal investment choice Î»âi solves

                                                     v 0 (Î»âi )        1
                                                                =               .                                                     (1)
                                                     c0 (Î»âi )    âui (H) S (q)

The assumptions on   v (.)   and   c (.)   are standard to ensure the existence of a unique solution to the maximization


problem. They state that (i) more eort leads to a greater likelihood (cost) of dissuading the child from acquiring


the unwanted behavior, and (ii) the eectiveness (cost) of this investment decreases (increases) in the amount of


eort that is invested. The optimal investment choice simply equates the marginal cost of investing to its expected


marginal benet. The assumption that             ui (H) < 0   for   i = 0, 1   makes it not optimal for any parent to invest in


pro-smoking culturalization, as this would promote the parent's undesired trait. Had we assumed instead that


smoker parents perceive a non-negative net utility from smoking,                 u1 (H) â¥ 0       , we would be in the world of Bisin


and Verdier (2001) where each type of parent promotes her own trait. Ceteris paribus, this possibility is more likely


to arise when the health costs of smoking are small, since both parents perceive children's utility to be decreasing


the more harmful the smoking habit is. From the result in Proposition 1, we can then derive comparative statics


on the investment choice:




                                                                    9
   Proposition 2:          Performing comparing statics on the optimal investment derived in Proposition 1, we obtain
the following predictions:

   â¢   Prediction 1: Parents who perceive             larger   health costs from smoking invest        more    in anti-smoking cultural-
       ization.

   â¢   Prediction 2: We have cultural substitution i cultural conformity holds, and cultural complementarity i
       cultural distinction holds.


   Prediction 1 is straightforward; it states that parents invest more in the anti-smoking culturalization of their


children the more serious the health costs of this habit. Prediction 2 says that vertical socialization follows cultural


substitution when horizontal socialization follows cultural conformity, which is a well-known theoretical result in


the literature, starting with Bisin and Verdier (2001). It implies that when a higher smoking prevalence increases


the likelihood that a child smokes, it is more worthwhile for the parent to exert socialization eort.                         However,


Prediction 2 also says that vertical socialization follows cultural complementarity when horizontal socialization


follows cultural distinction, which is a result that is not emphasized in the literature.                          It implies that when


smoking prevalence decreases the likelihood that a child smokes, it also lowers the value of socialization to the


parent. Patacchini and Zenou (2011) produce the opposite nding in a cultural transmission model augmented


with peer eects at the vertical transmission stage. Their result requires assuming that both the cost and marginal


cost of socialization are increasing in the proportion of smokers. Like the rest of the literature, we instead favor


a framework where society only plays a role through horizontal transmission; i.e. in the event that the parent is


unsuccessful at socializing her child to the desired trait.




3.4      Endogenous horizontal transmission

To complete the model, we explicitly dene the likelihood that the child adopts smoking through non-parental


channels. Before parents decide how much to socialize their children, a prot-maximizing monopolist chooses a


level of investment    Î¸   into increasing the appeal of smoking to the youth. Such a feature could arise, for example,


through celebrity endorsements of this habit. Advertising                  Î¸      can be thought of as stimulating "demand", but to
                                                                              2
have diminishing marginal returns, so that
                                                       âS(q,Î¸)

                                                                             âÎ¸ 2      < 0.5   The function   Îº (Î¸) represents the convex

implied between the monopolist and parents.



  5 We   put this word in quotation marks given that children do not make any active choice in the cultural transmission framework.




                                                                      10
Proposition 3:        In a subgame perfect equilibrium, we have S (0, Î¸â (0)) > 0, which ensures a heterogeneous
distribution of traits in steady state. Moreover, both cultural substitution and cultural conformity may obtain.


    S (0, Î¸â (0)) > 0   follows directly from assuming an interior solution to the problem. It ensures that the tobacco


company would always want to invest a positive amount in making the smoking habit emerge. The second part of

                                                        dS            âS        âS     âÎ¸ â

this quantity is positive, and cultural substitution otherwise. While determining the sign of this quantity involves


the interaction of numerous terms, it is possible to talk loosely about when each possibility obtains using the


ndings in Proposition 2. For example, cultural distinction obtains when: 1) an increase in smoking prevalence

                                                             â 2 S(q,Î¸)
decreases the value of the investment sharply (                         negative enough), or 2) smoker parents are less tolerant

of their children becoming smokers (a          > d).     The main take away message is that both cultural conformity and


cultural distinction are realistic possibilities. We leave it to the data to tell us when each obtains.

havior of the system.




    Proposition 4:        In a steady state, there always exists a fraction of non-smokers. Moreover, under cultural
complementarity the smoking habit always persists, while under cultural substitution it persists as long as S (0) > 0.


    Under cultural complementarity, we must have cultural distinction (Proposition 2), and therefore children al-


ways have the proclivity to reject the status-quo so that neither traits disappear in steady state. Under cultural


substitution, smoking never becomes the unique trait since parents have an incentive to prevent this from hap-


pening. In contrast, smoking may disappear if no outside factor forces it to persist. Given Proposition 3, we know


that the existence of a tobacco industry can guarantee the coexistence of both traits under this scenario.

     Equation (3) is the empirical counterpart of                 PT ,    as described in the previous section. It is a structural form


equation that treats           P r(socialization = 1) as the endogenous regressor.                 Equation (4) is the empirical counterpart


of (1).   In this rst-stage equation we identify parental socialization using dierent indicators of the parent's


exposure to health information                as instruments.         X   denotes exogenous control variables;       Î±   denotes a structural


parameter; and        Î²   denotes a reduced-form parameter. Indexes                 c   and   p   stand for child and parent, respectively;   s

stands for state; and           j   identies each characteristic (individual, parental, or state) that we include as a control


variable. Finally,        Î½   and   Ï   are the jointly distributed error terms.


     We estimate (3) and (4) as a system by IV probit, even though this method is meant to be used when the


endogenous regressor is continuous rather than binary. Because Heckman's (1978) maximum likelihood bivariate


probit was built to accommodate binary endogenous regressors, it would have been more appropriate to use in our


case. However, we choose not to use it because it is computationally cumbersome,
                                                                                                              6 and it does not signicantly

outperform IV probit or even IV linear probability models in terms of accuracy (see Nichols 2011 and references


therein). To conrm the latter point, we test the robustness of our baseline specication to a range of alternative


estimation methods, including the bivariate probit.


     To statistically identify exogenous variation in parental socialization we assume that, controlling for the child's


own exposure to anti-smoking articles, we can exclude parental exposure to health information as a direct deter-


minant of the child's decision to smoke. To test this exclusion restriction, we calculate the Amemiya-Lee-Newey

    6 Researchers   nd that to run a bivariate probit often takes 10 or 20 times as long as other similar models, and that standard
statistical software like Stata and R frequently fail to nd the maximum of the likelihood (e.g. Freedman and Sekhon 2010)




                                                                             12

power, we calculate the       Ï2   statistic under the null that the instruments are jointly statistically insignicant in


the reduced form. We also calculate the Hausman                Ï2   statistic to test whether there is a statistically signicant


dierence between IV probit and probit (naive) estimates. The null of this test is that the probit model provides


both consistent and ecient estimates while IV probit estimates are only consistent, and that the dierence be-


tween the two is normally distributed with mean zero. Further, we calculate the Wald                Ï2   statistic to test the null


that the correlation coecient between         Î½   and   Ï   is zero and, therefore,   P r(socialization = 1)   can be treated as


exogenous. Finally, we check the robustness of our baseline estimates to the inclusion of a wide range of controls


and instruments.


   To statistically identify the social transmission of the smoking trait we rely on the fact that the smoking


prevalence of the role-model population is measured at the state-level.                 Because we can plausibly assume that


state-specic smoking prevalence is exogenous to the parental choice of the state of residence and it cannot be


aected by endogenous peer-choice, we rule out selection and simultaneity bias from the estimated eects. Bias


due to exogenous correlated eects, however, remains a possibility (Manski 1993, 2000). The smoking prevalence


of the role-model population is the aggregation of individual behavior which (depending on how the role-model


population is dened) may include the parent or the child. Thus, our estimate of                   Î±2   may reect the fact that


individuals in a given state have similar smoking behavior because they have unobserved similar characteristics or


because they are exposed to the same institutional or contextual factors (`Manski's reection problem'). To account


for such unobserved common factors, we follow the health economics literature and use a xed eects specication


(see, for example, Nakajima 2007 and references therein). Because, as we describe below, the smoking prevalence


of the role model population varies by state and child age, we include a full set of state and age xed-eects. We


thus identify causality of the social eects by using variations in the proportion of smokers between age-groups


within a state.


   We use the results to assess whether socialization by parents and role models aect a child's smoking decision,


to identify the relative contribution of the two types of socialization to the transmission of the smoking culture,


and to test important properties of the transmission process; namely, cultural substitution versus complementarity,


and cultural conformity versus cultural distinction. Finally, we use the structural parameter estimates to forward


project how the rate of ever-smoking of 10-18 year olds will evolve under dierent policy scenaria.

present in this paper are derived using the maximum likelihood IVprobit estimator.




                                                                    13
5     Data

Our empirical analysis exploits new as well as existing data in novel ways.      Below we discuss the source and


construction of each type of data. Table 1 provides summary statistics of selected variables.




5.1    Individual level data on children and care-givers

We draw individual level data on children aged 10-18 from the 2002 and 2007 waves of the Panel Study of


Income Dynamics (PSID) - Child Development Supplement/Transition to Adulthood (CDS-TA) surveys, and


supplementary data on parents of each child from the main family les of the PSID. The CDS-TA sample was


originally drawn from PSID families with children 0-12 years in 1997 and reinterviewed in 2002 and 2007. We use


sample weights provided by the PSID to account for unequal probabilities of being selected into the CDS sample


and for dierential attrition rates of PSID and CDS participants. The 2002 and 2007 wave of CDS-TA directly


surveys children age 10 and older about tobacco use and other types of behaviors. These data were collected by


an audio computer assisted self-interview.   In such interviews, youth listen to the questions through a headset


and record their responses directly into a laptop computer. Neither the child's parents nor the interviewer knew


how s/he answered the questions. Aquilino (1994) documents that this method generates more accurate data on


socially sensitive topics such as psychological well-being, sexual behaviors, and experiences with tobacco, alcohol,


and drug use.   We use the data on whether a child ever smoked (dened on the survey as smoking at least 1


cigarette every day for 30 days) to represent   P r(ever smoke = 1)c .   Eighteen percent of our sample smoked at


some time between age 10 and 18.


    The CDS-TA surveys asks questions not only of the child but also of the person in the PSID household who


identied herself/himself as the `primary' care-giver (PCG) of that child.      Table 1 documents that biological


mothers comprise 93 percent of self-identied care-givers, six percent of care-givers are biological fathers, and


the rest are adoptive mothers or step-mothers.     Because of the disproportionate share of biological mothers in


our sample, we cannot separately model how cultural transmission varies with the nature of the parent-child


relationship.


    While the CDS-TA surveys do not ask questions that are specically about smoking socialization eorts of the


PCG, the surveys do collect information that is likely to proxy for it. Ideally the surveys would ask each PCG to


report how much eort she spends socializing her child about the health risks of smoking. Instead the CDS/TA


surveys asked each care-giver to report how frequently during the past month she talked to each child about the


dangers of substance use (e.g.   drinking alcohol or taking drugs).   The survey specied ve response categories


that ranged from not in the past month to every day.     While these data are not ideal, we expect answers to


them to be correlated with the conceptual variable of interest. In addition, we identify variation in the pattern


of responses in these data using variation in information that is specically about health risks of smoking. As a




                                                        14
result, though imperfect, the CDS data are likely to proxy well for the conceptual variable of interest. Table 1


shows that 21 percent of care-givers reported they had not spoken with their child about the dangers of substance


use in the past month. Most (42 percent) care-givers discussed this subject once or twice per month. However, 37


percent of care-givers discussed substance use at least once a week during the previous month.


   In addition to the socialization data, we draw CDS-TA data on age, sex, race, and religion of the child;


household income; family size; and measures of parenting styles, reading habits, and employment status of the


PCG.


   We also draw data on the smoking behavior and educational attainment of the PCGs from the main PSID


les. We use data on smoking behavior from the 1986, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2009 family les and data


from a special 1990 questionnaire administered to all PSID household members over the age of 55 to construct our


measure of whether a parent ever smoked. Finally, we draw data on years of completed schooling from all waves


of the PSID. In our sample, 45 percent of PCGs smoked at some point in their lives and the average PCG has


completed 13 years of schooling.




5.2    Smoking prevalence rates of the role model population

To construct measures of role-model smoking behavior, we use data from the Tobacco Use Supplements to the


Current Population Survey (TUS-CPS). Sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and administered as part


of the U.S. Census Bureau's continuing labor force survey, the TUS-CPS data have been collected intermittently


since 1955. We use responses from 21 surveys conducted in August 1967, August 1968, September 1989, September


1992, January and May 1993, September 1995, January and May 1996, September 1998, January, and May 1999,


June and November 2001, February 2002, February, June, and November 2003, May and August 2006, and January


2007. Each survey asks respondents: Have you ever smoked regularly?; If yes, what is the age when you started?;


Do you currently smoke?; and If not, what is the age when you last smoked regularly?.


   After dropping multiple observations for each individual across monthly waves of the same calendar year, we


pool all data from these waves and use the smoking questions to construct the smoking history of every TUS-CPS


respondent. To do this we identify all respondents who ever smoked and who report a start age, a current smoking


status, and a quit age (former smokers only). We then assume that a person smoked in every year between the


age she started and either the age at the survey date (current smokers) or the age she quit (former smokers).


Because in each calendar year our sample includes all respondents who were alive in that year and retrospectively


answered the smoking questions in any later year, we start with an enormous sample of current, ever, and never


smokers (approximately 81 million observations). We combine our computed smoking life-histories with data on


the state of residence (at the time of the survey) to construct smoking prevalence rates by sex, cohort, state, and


calendar year (weighted by the CPS sampling weights).




                                                        15
    To match our empirical specication as closely as possible with our theory, we assume that a child's role model


is drawn from his parent's generation. This assumption means that we create smoking prevalence rates of the role


model population using males and females who are 20-29 years older than the child.
                                                                                                     8 Table 1 shows that among

the potential social role models of children in our sample, the average smoking prevalence rate is 26 percent. Later


in the analysis we experiment with dierent denitions of the role-model population (by age and sex).


    To illustrate the variation in the data we develop, Figure 1 plots the smoking rates by sex, state, and calendar


year for the social role models of children who are age 14 at the time of the survey (i.e. at mean age). While these


data have rich variation across all dimensions, the variation we can exploit is limited because we only observe a


child's smoking behavior and his parent's socialization eort in 2002 and 2007. Despite that limitation, plenty of


variation remains available to us: across states, gender, and by child age. Figure 2 showcases the data that we


actually use in the analysis.
                                    9 Clearly, the smoking rates vary signicantly by gender and state, but note that,

because the state-specic curves cross, the rates also vary by age of the child/parent generation.




5.3         Information about the health risks of smoking

To instrument parental socialization we use temporal and geographic variation in exposure to information about


the health risks of smoking. The basic data consist of counts of articles published between 1924 and 2009 that


warn readers about the health risks of smoking.               We use counts of articles published in each of more than 21


popular consumer magazines. To generate additional geographical, but also temporal variation, we also exploit


data on the number of issues of each magazine that were sold in each state in each year.


    The data on articles were generated by rst searching two electronic databases (ProQuest and the Historical


Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature) using a keyword search on  smok* and cancer,  smok* and health,


 cig* and cancer,  cig* and health and similar text strings. Successive searches produced roughly 5,000 titles of


articles published between 1890 and 2009. Two undergraduate research assistants then independently reviewed all


5,000 titles to identify articles that potentially warned about the health risks of smoking. This review eliminated


roughly 2,500 articles that focused on the eect of the health risk information on nancial returns of tobacco


companies, tobacco growing agriculture, and international trade in tobacco. The remaining set included articles


whose titles suggested that the articles discussed content about risks individuals faced.                      A team of research


assistants collected copies of all articles and read them. Two of them independently rated the articles as a)  pro-


smoking, b)  neutral, and c)  anti-smoking when they judged that an article conveyed to readers the impression


that smoking a) improved, b) did not aect, or c) degraded the health of smokers. Any disagreement was discussed

   8 i.e.   we assume an average generation gap of 25 years, which is slightly smaller than the average generation gap that we observe
in our data (28 years).
   9 Note    that instead of 2007 data we use data that correspond to 2006 because the 2007 survey was conducted in January. Aside
from the fact that the sample is smaller, smoking behavior in January does not represent average smoking behavior throughout the
year because more people quit smoking in January to implement a New Year's resolution. Many of these people fail in their resolution.
Consequently, smoking prevalence rates in January are lower and more widely distributed than smoking prevalence rates over the
whole year.




                                                                   16
and resolved. The resulting list of articles generated a list of magazines in which the articles appeared.


   We then compiled data on sales of each of those magazines in every state in each year. We got the sales data from


the Audit Bureau of Circulation. The Audit Bureau of Circulation is an organization that publishers voluntarily


join. Its sole purpose is to audit and verify circulation gures the publishers provide to them. Their independent


auditing provides a valuable service to publishers because they charge advertisers more for space in more widely


circulated magazines. Advertisers therefore demand (and publishers willingly provide) an independently veried


count of circulation. The magazine circulation data vary by month, year, and state.


   We assume that, when a magazine is sold, it is seen by all members of the household in which the purchaser


resides.
          10 To capture this exposure, we divide estimates of each state's population from the Current Population

Reports of the Census Bureau by 2.3 (the average household size) and divide the number of issues sold in each


state in each year by that number. The resulting gure is an estimate of the fraction of each state's population


that read each magazine (in each year). We then multiply the fraction of each state's population that read each


magazine by the number of articles that appeared in that magazine. This step yields the exposure of a randomly


drawn person from a given state to an article that appeared in a given magazine in a given year.                           Finally, we


sum across all magazines in which an anti-smoking article appeared. The nal data proxy for the total potential


exposure to anti-smoking magazine articles in a given state in a given year. Currently we compute this sum using


articles that appear in 21 magazines that accounted for 70 percent of all anti-smoking magazine articles produced


by the above searches. Formally our measure is given by:



                                                                        21
                                                                        X                    Issuesmst

                                                                                          Populationst /2.3
                                                                        m=1

where    s   denotes state,   t   denotes calendar year, and    m   denotes each of 21 magazines.


   Figure 3 plots the resulting measure for all states between 1929 and 2009. We use these data to compute several


alternative measures of exposure to anti-smoking information of both PCGs and children. The two measures we


select to use in the baseline specication are: (i) the accumulated sum of articles (potentially) seen by the PCG or


the child since age 10, which should capture the degree of exposure; and (ii) the standard deviation in the articles


read since age 10, which should capture the            in frequency      of the information ow.         Similar measures have been


shown to predict changes in consumption of fats and oils as information developed and spread about the health


risks of consumption of saturated, monounsaturated, and poly unsaturated fats (Chern et al. 1995). We start


counting exposure from age 10, assuming that it is the earliest age a child can comfortably read. Year 1929 is the


earliest year in which a PCG in our sample was age 10, and year 1994 is the earliest year in which a child was age


10. Thus, our measures of exposure for PCGs (i.e. our instruments) encompasses all temporal and state variation


illustrated in Figure 3. In contrast, our equivalent measure for children (which we use as a control) encompasses

 10 In   fact we only assume a household member   potentially   sees the article. From now on we use the terms exposure and potential
exposure interchangeably.




                                                                    17
the variation illustrated in the shaded area only. The `typical' PCG in our sample has been exposed to about 12


anti-smoking articles since age 10, while the corresponding number for the `typical' child is 4.




5.4    Indicators of the economic environment

In our regressions, we control for time-varying state-specic economic factors that may aect the child's probability


to smoke or the PCG's socialization eorts. Specically, we control for state and federal cigarette taxes and state


per-capita income. We use the measure of `full' taxes on cigarettes described in Lillard and Sfekas (2013). This


measure is the sum of the state and federal cigarette tax and the per pack escrow payments that are required


on the 1998  Master Settlement Agreement between the four major cigarette manufactures and the US states.


Viscusi and Hersh (2011) and Lillard and Sfekas (2013) document that this payment is functionally equivalent to


a per pack cigarette tax. We draw data on real per capita state income from the Regional Economic Information


System of the Bureau of Economic Analysis in the U.S. Department of Commerce (SA05 series) and adjust them


in units of real 2008 dollars. To illustrate the variation in these two variables, we plot them by state and year in


Figures 4 and 5.




6     Results


6.1    Vertical versus horizontal transmission of the smoking trait

The naive way to think about the cultural transmission of the smoking trait would be to assume no reverse


causality between parental socialization eorts and the childrens' decision to smoke. Table 2 presents estimates


of equation (3) under this assumption; that is, by treating    P r(socialization = 1)   as exogenous. In column 1 we


use the socialization data in their `raw' form; i.e.   in ve categorical dummy variables: not in the past month


(the reference category), once/twice a month, once a week, several times a week, and daily. In columns 2-5 we


dichotomize the data into a single dummy to denote that children are socialized with `at least' a given level of


frequency (at least once/twice per month, at least once a week etc.).      The resulting estimates vary across the


combinations.   In column 1, PCG socialization eorts are associated with a higher probability that the child


ever smokes, even though that association decreases as the frequency of socialization increases. The estimates in


column 2 also suggest a positive association, while columns 3-5 suggest a weak negative association (which in 3


and 5 is statistically insignicant). The probable cause of these counterintuitive results is the endogeneity of the


socialization variable. Children may be less likely to smoke when their parents socialize them against it, but it


is also likely that a PCG will discuss substance use more often if a child smokes or the parent suspects a child is


likely to smoke. To isolate the former eect we abandon the naive approach.


    Table 3 presents our baseline estimates of jointly determined equations (3) and (4), as described in Section




                                                          18
4.
  11 To simplify the analysis, we dichotomize the socialization variable,                   P r(socialization = 1),     to indicate the


probability that the PCG socializes the child about the dangers of substance use at least once a week.
                                                                                                                               12 As we

mentioned earlier, we instrument the PCG's socialization eorts with the parental exposure to smoking-related


health information since age 10 and the infrequency of that exposure. In contrast to the results in column 3 of Table


2, the coecient on the instrumented socialization variable is negative and statistically signicant, suggesting that


a parent's eort to socialize her child is eective. The performance of the instruments in the rst-stage equation


is satisfactory: they are statistically signicant and the sign of their coecients are in the direction described in


Prediction 1. Those PCGs who are exposed to more anti-smoking articles on average also exert more eort to


socialize their children. Holding the average level of exposure constant, PCGs socialize their children less if their


exposure varies more over time. That is, PCGs socialize their children more when they are exposed to a constant


stream of information about the health risks of smoking compared to PCGs who see the same number of articles on


average but who see no articles in some years and many articles in others. The diagnostic test results corroborate


the good performance of our instruments and of the baseline specication in general.


     We should note that a factor contributing to instrument validity is that the baseline specication controls for


the child's exposure to anti-smoking articles since age 10. Again, the estimated coecient on this variable makes


economic sense: a higher information exposure of the child is associated with a lower probability that the child


ever smokes and with a lower socialization eort by the PCG (as s/he now relies on the external information to


do the job). Although the statistical signicance of these eects is somewhat weak, it is important to mention


that removing the measure of child exposure from the estimation signicantly impacts the ALN test of over-


identication. In this case, the        Ï2   statistic increases to 3.255 and the probability values drops to 0.071, so that


we reject the hypothesis that the instruments are valid at the 10% level of signicance.


     In all regressions reported in Tables 2 and 3, the probability that the child ever smokes increases with the


state-specic smoking prevalence rates of the role-model population, providing evidence for cultural conformity.


In the rst-stage of Table 3, the socialization eort of PCGs also increases with the smoking prevalence in the


role model population and it is statistically unrelated to parental smoking status, providing evidence for cultural


substitution.      The co-existence of cultural substitution and conformity supports Prediction 2 of the model.                         It


suggests that all parents wish to discourage smoking and, because they know that their children will conform to


societal trends, they will increase their anti-smoking socialization eorts when smoking becomes more popular in


society (we expand this discussion in Section 6.3).

  11 From   this point onwards all regressions are estimated by IV probit. See Table 4 in the Appendix for a set of robustness test of
the baseline estimates to alternative methods of estimation.
  12 We   dichotomize the socialization variable because the coecients on the dierent versions of the socialization variable presented in
columns 2-5 of Table 2 suggest that socialization categories once a week, several times per week and every day produce results that
are similar among them but much dierent to the results produced by category once/twice a month. This implies that the response
distribution we observe could be a mixture of two distributions, each capturing a dierent kind of decision process.          Nonetheless,
our baseline results show low sensitivity to the denition of the dichotomized socialization variable. See Table 5 for the robustness
analysis. In a similar exercise, Patacchini and Zenou (2011) use the frequency that a parent reads to a child to capture parental eort
to cultivate interest in education to the child. They dichotomize their socialization variable the same way.




                                                                     19
    To compare the importance of the parental (vertical) and social (horizontal) channels of transmission of the


smoking habit, we calculate marginal eects of `equivalent' changes in parental socialization eorts and the smoking


prevalence of the role model population on the probability that the child smokes.                        Clearly, dening changes of


equivalent magnitude in two completely dierent variables is a challenge. We take a `let the data speak' approach


and allow both variables to increase by half their standard deviation. This corresponds to a 9.8 percentage point


increase in the share of parents who socialize their children at least once a week (from 41.6% to 51.4%)
                                                                                                                             13 , and to a

2.6 percentage point increase in the smoking prevalence rate of the role model population (from 26.3% to 28.9%).


We nd that these changes cause the likelihood that the child smokes to decrease by 3.9 percentage points and to


increase by 2.8 percentage points, respectively. The implication is that parental inuences are stronger than social


inuences in the determination of youth smoking participation. Note that we reach this conclusion without taking


into account the direct eects of parental smoking behavior on the probability of youth smoking participation (e.g.


due to genetics, mimicking, nicotine addiction from passive smoking, or easier access to cigarettes). Our results


suggest that this channel of transmission is also important; the child is more likely to have ever smoked when the


PCG has ever smoked. The reported marginal eects, therefore, understate the true eect of the parental channel


of transmission.


    All regressions in Tables 2 and 3 control for the PCG's education, family income, state cigarette tax, state


income, and a wealth of demographic variables.
                                                          14 The signs of the estimated coecients on all these variables are

in the expected direction and consistent with empirical ndings in the health economics literature. The child is


more likely to have ever smoked when the PCG is less educated, when family and state income is low, and when


cigarette taxes are low. The PCG is more likely to socialize the child at least once a week when s/he is highly


educated, when family and state income is higher, and when cigarette taxes are higher (e.g. because, when taxes


are high, smoking by the child entails a higher nancial cost for the entire family). From this point on, we do not


show estimated coecients on the control variables, but rather focus on the variables of interest.




6.2       Robustness analysis

Although the baseline specication is already very conservative, there are reasons that induce us to test its


robustness to new instruments and controls. First, the performance of our instruments may be impaired by their


limited variation; e.g., our measure of PCG exposure to health information does not vary across PCGs who live


in the same state and were born in the same year. We could benet from an exposure measure that is parent-


specic and adds individual-level variation to our instrument. Second, our denition of the exposure measure (i.e.

  13 Because   the parental socialization variable is binary, we calculate its standard deviation (0.19) using its estimated value from the
reduced-form regression. To induce an increase in this variable that corresponds to half of its standard deviation, we had to randomly
shift PCGs from category 0 to category 1 so that the mean of the variable increases by 9.8 percentage points. This is mathematically
equivalent to increasing the probability of socialization for those parents who do not socialize their kids at least once a week from 0
to 0.17 (=(0.19/2)/(1-0.416)).
  14 To   save space, we do not present coecients on the age xed eects of the PCG and the age, sex, state, race, and religion
xed-eects of the child. However, full results for all models are available on request.




                                                                    20
as the accumulated sum of anti-smoking articles) imposes the restrictive assumptions that information does not


decay and that it has constant returns to scale. More exible specications of the exposure measure may be more


appropriate. Third, in our baseline specication we do not account for dierences in the personality of children or


in parenting styles. Both of these have been shown in the psychology literature to vary with children's smoking


behavior and the eectiveness of parental socialization eorts (e.g. Huver et al. 2007). Fourth, in our baseline


specication we do not control for dierences across PCGs in the cost of the parental socialization eorts. We next


try to address these issues using a new set of variables which Table 6 presents along with some basic descriptive


statistics.


   Our rst exercise aims at introducing individual-level variation in our set of instruments.       To do this, we


draw from the PSID-CDS-TA a variable that measures how often the PCG reads the newspaper during the


week. Assuming that this variable is highly correlated with magazine readership, we interact it with the PCG's


information exposure measure to generate a new variable that varies across PCGs. Column 1 of Table 7 tests the


robustness of the baseline specication to this inclusion. The results are highly robust, and the new instrument


appears with a positive and signicant coecient, suggesting that anti-smoking information is more eective at


increasing parental socialization eorts when parents have the habit of reading the newspaper often. In comparison


to the baseline results, the diagnostic test results are slightly improved (e.g. the probability value of the the ALN


test statistic increases to 0.578).


   As a further robustness test, we dene information exposure to be the average number (instead of the accu-


mulated sum) of anti-smoking articles that the PCG or the child potentially read since age 10. This specication


essentially decreases the contributing value of each anti-smoking article by a factor proportional to the age of


the PCG, so that (older) PCGs who see a given number of articles over a longer life-span end up with a lower


information exposure score than (younger) PCGs who see the same number of articles over a shorter life-span.


In other words, the new exposure measure allows the value of information to decay over time. Columns 2 and


3 of Table 7 show how the baseline estimates change when we replace the original exposure measure with this


new measure, and when we interact it with the frequency the PCG reads the newspaper. Although the results


are qualitatively robust to this change and the instrument coecients are positive and statistically signicant, the


tests of instrument identication reject the hypothesis that the instruments are valid.


   Finally, in Table 8 we check the robustness of the baseline estimates to controls that capture personality traits


of the child and parenting styles of the PCG (column 1), to controls that capture the cost of PCG socialization


eorts (column 2), and to both set of controls together (column 3).


   The rst set of controls includes: (i) an indicator of whether the child has a tendency to break rules, which


we create by combining a selection of variables documenting problematic past behavior (see note of Table 6 for


the exact denition); (ii) an indicator of high and strict parental control, which we create by combining responses


of the PCG to questions about the number of rules s/he impose on the child, whether these rules are strictly




                                                         21
enforced, and whether s/he discusses these rules with the child; (iii) an indicator of violent parenting, which ags


whether the child is spanked more than 3 times per week; and (iv) an indicator of complete lack of communication


among the PCG and the child.       Controlling for these variables is potentially important because it may further


address the problem of reverse causality between socialization eorts of the PCG and the smoking behavior of the


child. Rebellious children or children subject to authoritative parenting may react against parental anti-smoking


pressure and may be more likely to smoke when the socialization eorts of the PCG are more frequent.               We


nd that the these controls signicantly predict the dependent variables in both the structural and reduced-form


equation, while leaving the remaining coecients almost unaected. As expected, children who are rule-breakers


and children who are spanked regularly are more likely to ever smoke and more likely to be socialized by PCGs.


In contrast, children who are under strict parental control are less likely to ever smoke and are less often socialized


by parents. Finally, children who never discuss any subject with their parents are more likely to ever smoke.


   Our measures of the parental socialization cost include: (i) the number of individuals younger than 18 in the


family unit; (ii) an indicator of whether the PCG is employed; (iii) the weekly hours that the PCG spends at work;


(iv) an indicator of whether the PCG works a regular daytime schedule; and (v) an indicator of whether it takes


the PCG over an hour to get to work each way. Once more, we nd that, when included in the baseline regression,


these variables signicantly predict the dependent variables and only result in small quantitative changes in the


estimated coecients of the other variables. Children who live in households with many other children are less


likely to smoke and more likely to be socialized by PCGs. Children of working parents are less likely to smoke


but also less likely to be socialized, whereas children whose parents work more and regular hours are more likely


to smoke and more likely to be socialized.


   When we insert in the baseline specication all the new controls together we obtain similar results. All three


specications of Table 8 pass the diagnostic tests. In fact, the probability values of the ALM test for specications


(1) and (3) are higher in comparison to that of the baseline specication (0.860 and 0.648, respectively), suggesting


that the addition of the controls aids identication.




6.3    The mechanisms underlying the transmission process

In the previous sections we found a positive coecient on the smoking prevalence of the role-model population in


both the reduced-form and the structural-form equations. We interpreted these ndings as evidence for cultural


substitution and conformity. In this section, we scrutinize these results by carrying out two exercises. First, we


interact parental smoking status with the prevalence rate of the role-model population to inform our discussion


of cultural substitution.   Second, we use alternative denitions of the role-model population to inform our dis-


cussion on cultural conformity. Both exercises allow us to conrm the links between substitution and conformity


and between complementarity and distinction. We conclude this section by further exploring dierences in the


socialization process between smoker and non-smoker parents.



                                                          22
6.3.1   Substitution versus complementarity

Assuming that both smoker and non-smoker parents wish to discourage smoking, cultural substitution entails


that all parents should increase anti-smoking socialization eorts in response to the smoking rate in society. The


rst-stage estimates in columns 1 and 2 of Table 9 show that this prediction is supported by the data. We nd


positive and signicant coecients on all interactions of smoking prevalence and parental smoking status.       We


read this result to suggest that our extension of the Bisin and Verdier model is more appropriate to use when


studying the transmission of traits like smoking than the Bisin and Verdier model in its original version. If smoker


parents wished to transmit the smoking culture to their children, like the Bisin and Verdier model would assume,


then we would expect to nd evidence of cultural complementarity for smoker parents and cultural substitution


for non-smoker parents (i.e. positive coecients on the interaction terms in Table 9 for non-smoker parents, and


negative coecients for smoker parents). However, our results suggest otherwise.


   As our model predicts, we nd similar behavior across smokers and non-smoker parents because there is an


exogenous force (anti-smoking information) that has changed people's perceptions of smoking from a `good' trait


to a `bad' trait. As a result, parents wish to socialize children to be non-smokers, even if they themselves smoke.


We follow this logic to develop another implication: we should nd evidence of culture complementarity among


smoker PCGs exposed to little (or very low) anti-smoking information because, absent other information, these


would still consider smoking to be a good trait. In column 3 of Table 9 we attempt to test this hypothesis by


interacting the parental smoking status with smoking prevalence in the role model population at dierent quantiles


of parental information exposure (quantiles 0-10, 10-50, 50-90, and 90-100).


   We note that, in our data there is no PCG who is subject to no anti-smoking information.          All PCGs are


exposed to some non-negligible level of information. In fact, the PCG at the 10th percentile of the distribution


of our exposure variable saw 8 articles, relative to a mean of 12. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that we do


not nd evidence of cultural complementarity in our results (none of the estimated coecients carries a negative


sign). Nonetheless, there is enough variation in the data to reveal two important patterns that corroborate our


theoretical set-up. First, when the smoking prevalence of the role model population increases, all parents respond


by increasing their socialization eorts, and their response is larger the more exposed they are to information


about the health risks of smoking. Second, this response is not statistically dierent from zero for smoker parents


who are exposed to very low levels of information. These ndings encourage us to speculate that, had we observed


in our data parents with no or negligible information exposure, we would be able to document a switch in the


direction of the relationship between parental socialization and the proportion of smokers in society from positive


to negative.




                                                        23
6.3.2    Conformity versus distinction

To this point, all the results we have reported are based on the assumption that children derive their role-models


from the population that is 20-29 years older. Next, we test whether the probability that the child ever smokes is


associated with the smoking prevalence rate of the population of individuals 0-9 and 10-19 years older than the


child, and whether that association diers by gender.
                                                              15 We present our results in Table 10. Estimates in columns

1-4 are based on the total sample, while estimates in columns 5 and 6 are based on data on male and female


children, respectively.


   The structural form estimates suggest that the probability that the child ever smokes increases with the smoking


prevalence rates of all population sub-groups, except for males who are 0-9 years older. The implication is that,


in relation to the bulk of the population, children form their smoking decisions based on their needs to achieve


assimilation, inclusiveness, and cultural conformity.           In relation to the sub-group of young boys, however, the


childrens' motive is the exact opposite. In this case, it is their need to generate a sense of distinctiveness from


individuals that are part of that group that motivates their smoking decisions.                  To put it bluntly, our results


suggest that young boys operate as anti-role-models. Although this result might seem surprising, one should note


that health economic studies on peer eects have not reached a consensus on gender dierences in social inuence.


For example, Nakajima (2007) study peer eects of smoking among school-mates in the US and nds that these


are positive and signicant within the same gender but statistically negligible across genders. In contrast, Clark


and Loheac (2007) study peer eects on dierent types of risky behavior among friends and school-mates in the


US and nd signicant cross-gender interactions for alcohol use, with young males being more inuential than


young girls. While we are the rst to provide evidence on cultural distinction using smoking data, our evidence


complements those presented in the study of ethnic identity formation by Bisin et al.(2013). These authors nd


that, in neighborhoods in which the share of a given ethnic group is high, the association between the share of the


ethnic group and individual ethnic identities is negative.




6.3.3    The link between substitution (complementarity) and conformity (distinction)

In both Tables 9 and 10, the smoking prevalence rates signicantly predict the PCGs socialization eorts in the


reduced form and the probability that the child smokes in the structural form. Importantly, these eects always run


in the same direction, a result which reconrms the inter-connection between cultural substitution and conformity


and between cultural complementarity and distinction, and corroborates Prediction 2 of the model. This result


suggests that, because all parents wish to discourage smoking, they will increase their anti-smoking socialization


eorts when smoking becomes more popular among all societal groups to which their children will conform, and


they decrease their anti-smoking socialization eorts when smoking becomes more popular among young boys

 15 Naturally,   the alternative measures of smoking prevalence rates are correlated with each other, but there is still independent
variation in the smoking prevalence rates across the dierent groups. See Table 11 for correlation coecients and Table 6 for means
and standard deviations.




                                                                 24
from which their children will want to distinguish themselves.


   It is worth noting that both our theory and ndings contradict those produced by Patacchini and Zenou (2011),


although they apply a comparable exercise to identify the cultural transmission mechanisms of preferences for ed-


ucation.    Like our assumption that both smoker and non-smoker parents wish to transmit preferences against


smoking to their children, Patacchini and Zenou assume that both educated and uneducated parents wish to


transmit preferences in favor of education to their children. However, unlike our prediction that cultural comple-


mentarity is tied with cultural distinction, these authors predict that complementarity is tied with conformity. As


we briey discuss in section 3, this prediction relies on their assumption that a high prevalence of education in


society creates positive externatilities in the eectiveness of parental socialization eorts by decreasing socializa-


tion costs (e.g. because more educated neighbors can help a less educated parent to better socialize the children).


Their results support their theory. They nd that all parents socialize their kids in favor of education, that their


socialization eort increases with the prevalence of educational attainment in the population residing in the same


neighborhood and, at the same time, the neighborhood education level increases the probability that children


acquire education.




6.3.4      Other mechanisms

Also relevant is that the theoretical predictions of Patacchini and Zenou rely on the assumption that educated


parents are more eective in socializing their children than uneducated parents because they face lower cost of


socialization.   Our model necessitates no particular assumption about the mechanisms underlying the vertical


transmission process of smoker versus non-smoker parents. On the contrary, it allows many mechanisms to be at


work at the same time. For example, smoker and non-smoker parents may or may not dier in the eectiveness of


their socialization eorts, in their tolerance of having children who smoke, in their perception of the health-risks


of smoking, and other dimensions. Whether or not each of these scenaria is true is an empirical question.


   The evidence we present in Table 9 already shed some light on this issue. We nd that never-smoker parents


respond to the popularity of smoking in society by increasing their socialization eorts both more than ever-


smokers (column 1) and more than current and ex-smokers (column 2).            Further, we nd that this dierence


persists at all levels of information exposure (column 3). We present more evidence in Table 12. There we show


that never-smoker parents also have a higher responsiveness to health information both relative to ever smokers


(column 1) and relative to current and ex-smokers (column 2). Both these ndings suggest that smoker and non-


smoker parents evaluate dierently the health risks that their children face when they smoke, and are consistent


with existing empirical evidence that non-smokers tend to overestimate the impact of smoking on health (e.g.


Viscusi and Hakes 2008).    In Table 12 we also show that never-smoker parents lower their socialization eorts


when they work and increase their socialization eorts when their child is a rule-breaker less than ever-smokers


(column 3 and 5, respectively). This may be because, unlike parents who smoke, never-smoker parents are more




                                                         25
eective at socializing their kids to be non-smokers by setting the right example and can, therefore, aord to lower


their socialization eorts when socialization cost increases or when they have reactive children. Somewhat at odds


with this interpretation is our nding that the responsiveness to the socialization cost does not statistically dier


between never-smokers and current smokers (column 4), whereas the responsiveness to having a reactive child does


not statistically dier between never-smokers and ex-smokers (column 6).




6.4     Forward projections of the share of children who ever smoke

As a nal exercise, we simulate the dynamics of youth ever-smoking rates over time as described by equation (2)


in section 3.5. To do this we use the estimated structural parameters from column 3 of Table 8 (i.e. our most


restrictive specication), and the mean probability that a child ever smokes that we observe in our sample as the


initial condition. This exercise serves two purposes. First and foremost, it shows that the smoking trait persists in


the steady state of the population dynamics, it provides an estimate of the smoking rates at the steady state, and


it provides an estimate of the time that smoking rates would need in order to adjust to that steady-state. Second,


this exercise provides a framework that we can use to test how dierent policy regimes can aect the speed of


adjustment of the youth smoking rates to equilibrium. We draw the projections in Figure 6.


   The solid line shows how the youth ever-smoking rates would fare in future generations all else equal.                            It


indicates that the share of youth ever-smokers converges to a steady-state value just above 11 percent.
                                                                                                                              16 This

evidence conrms the long term persistence of the smoking trait, and is consistent with Predictions 3 and 4. Full


convergence to that steady-state occurs within ve generations (which are on average 25 years apart); i.e.                          for


individuals that are born between 2108-2121.             However, 90 percent of the adjustment occurs within only three


generations; i.e. for individuals who are born between 2058-2071.


   This trajectory can be altered by a social planner via several policy instruments. Here we give the examples


of `reasonable' increases in cigarette taxes and in parental socialization eorts during the lifetime of the children


observed in our data. The dotted line shows how the smoking rates would fare under half a standard deviation


increase in cigarette taxes (i.e. under a 0.27 dollar increase); and the dashed line shows how they would fare under


half a standard deviation increase in the share of parents who socialize their children at least once a week (i.e. an


increase of 9.8 percentage points). The former is an example of a policy that targets children directly, while the


latter is an example of a policy that targets children indirectly, via parental behavior.


   We nd that the proposed increase in taxes accelerates the rate of adjustment of youth ever-smoking rates


so that 90 percent of the adjustment is achieved within two generations. In comparison, the proposed increase


in socialization accelerates the rate of adjustment so that 90 percent of the adjustment is achieved within only


one generation.      Similarly, the increase in taxes reduces the rate of young smokers at the steady-state by 0.8

 16 Because   we use our most restrictive specication to carry out the projections, our results are based on a sample size of 2074. The
probability that the child ever smokes in this sample equals 19.6% (as opposed to the 18% reported in Table 1). Our results suggest
that, in order to reach their equilibrium value, youth smoking rates need to drop by 8.6 percentage points (from 19.6% to 11%).




                                                                   26
percentage points, whereas the increase in socialization reduces it by 1 percentage point. By no means, do we


present these results to suggest that subsidizing parental socialization is a preferred tobacco control policy relative


to a tax increase. Such a claim would require evidence on the cost of each policy regime. Rather, this evidence


demonstrates that a policy maker has the tools to signicantly change both the steady-state smoking rates of


young people and the speed of adjustment to that steady state. For example,        Healthy People 2020    reports that


19.5 percent of adolescents in grades 9 through 12 smoked cigarettes in 2009 and sets the objective to reduce


that percentage to 16 percent by 2020. The results we present in Figure 6 suggest that, by using the right policy


regime, the government can achieve and even surpass that goal.




7    Conclusion

Building on the literature on cultural transmission, we develop a model of smoking dynamics that focuses on


the role of parents and social norms; we use novel data to test its theoretical predictions; and we nd empirical


support. Our paper advances the literature in several ways.


    On the theory front, we extend the seminal work by Bisin and Verdier (2001) to provide a rationale for why


traits rst emerge, why parents may change the traits they prefer to transmit to their children, and how long-term


cultural heterogeneity can be achieved when that occurs.       We argue that a cultural trait may emerge when a


prot-maximizing industry promotes it, and the way people perceive that trait can be inuenced by the ow of


related information.   Thus, relative to the existing theory, we contribute a framework of analysis to study the


transmission mechanisms of a wider variety of cultural traits.     Specically, our model can be used to study (i)


cultural traits that already exist and the way people perceive them does not change over time (e.g. preferences


on education; trust; religion); (ii) cultural traits that already exist but the way people perceive them changes over


time (e.g. preferences on smoking, polluting the environment, or women's rights); and (iii) cultural traits that are


brand new (e.g. the culture of social networking). To date, the cultural transmission theory has focused on the


traits in the rst category.


    In developing our model, we introduce new mechanisms to characterize the cultural transmission process.


Specically, we relax a standard assumption in the cultural transmission theory that, when children adopt their


traits from society, this happens via a (random or non-random) matching process. This matching process entails


that the probability of acquiring a trait always increases with the prevalence of that trait in society. In our model,


we allow the industry to aect the direction of this relationship. Borrowing terminology from the literature on


identity formation, we formally dene the positive relationship between the probability of adopting a trait and


the prevalence of that trait in society as cultural conformity. We show that conformity in the social channel of


transmission is always tied to substitution in the parental channel of transmission, which posits that parents in-


crease their socialization eorts the more prevalent their preferred cultural trait is in society, and is a cornerstone




                                                          27
assumption in the literature.   Conformity and substitution will co-exist because parents will lower their social-


ization eorts when their preferred trait becomes more popular among societal groups to which they know that


their children will conform. Correspondingly, we formalize the assumption of cultural distinction to predict the


opposite of cultural conformity; i.e. a negative relationship between the probability of adopting a trait and the


prevalence of that trait in society. We show that distinction in the social channel of transmission is always tied


to complementarity in the parental channel of transmission, which posits that parents decrease their socialization


eorts the more prevalent their preferred cultural trait is in society. Distinction and complementarity will co-exist


because parents will increase their socialization eorts when their preferred trait becomes more popular among


societal groups from which they know that their children will distinguish themselves. We take all our theoretical


predictions to U.S. data and we nd supporting evidence.


   To test our model, we carefully account for the endogeneity of the parental socialization eorts using a novel


measure of parental exposure to anti-smoking information as an instrument. We also avoid selection, simultaneity,


and exogenous correlation bias in the estimated social eects by measuring smoking prevalence of the role-model


population at the state-level, and including a full set of xed eects in our regression models. Thus, our empirical


analysis contributes to the health economics literature causal estimates of parental and social inuences on youth


smoking participation. Whether smoking behavior is transmitted through parents, role-models, or peers is relevant


for designing tobacco control policy and anti-smoking campaigns. If children primarily pick up smoking from their


parents, policies that target parental behavior may be more eective at preventing smoking onset than policies that


target young people directly. If children primarily pick up smoking from the society, then this implies externalities


that can lead to large dierences in smoking behavior through social-multiplier eects. On the one hand, social


pressure can cause consumption to be sticky in the face of policy instruments; on the other hand, social inuences


can complement government interventions to prevent smoking initiation among young people. Our results suggest


that parental inuences are more important than social inuences in the transmission of the smoking trait, and


they showcase the spread of anti-smoking information as a key instrument to lower smoking rates among young


people.


   Finally, we demonstrate how the cultural transmission theory can provide an analytical framework which policy


makers can use to evaluate the long-term eects of tobacco control policies.      Specically, we use our empirical


results to project what will be the steady state rate of youth smoking in future generations. We show that the rate


converges to a steady state in which smoking persists. But we also show that a policy maker can aect both the


level of smoking at that steady state and the speed of adjustment to that steady state. Our projections suggest


that, under the right policy regime, it is possible to achieve the youth smoking rate objectives set by      Healthy
People 2020.

Proof of Proposition 4:                     When     q = 0,    we have     qÌ = (1 â d (0)) S (0).                Under cultural substitution we have


d (0) = 0     and so    qÌ > 0   i   S (0) > 0.     Under cultural complementarity we have                           d (0) > 0    and so     qÌ > 0   i   S (0) > 0

and   d (0) < 1.       When   q = 1,    we have       qÌ = (1 â a (1)) S (1) â 1.         Under cultural substitution we have                      a (1) > 0       and


so   qÌ < 0   always. Under cultural complementarity we have                          a (1) = 0   and so        qÌ < 0   i   S (1) < 1.      By Proposition 2,


we have       S0 < 0   under cultural complementarity, and so                   S (0) > 0      and    S (1) < 1. 

Controls: Dummies for age of PCG, and age, sex, state, race, and religion of child. Observations: 2246. Standard errors in

parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. The child socialization variable in (1)-(4) is the Prob(child socialized at least

once/week) and in (5) it is the original ordinal variable that takes values 1-5 to measure how often PCGs socialize children.

In (5) we estimated the 1st stage by ordered probit, and the 2nd stage by probit using the hat values from the 1st stage as

the socialization variable. We did not adjust the errors.
