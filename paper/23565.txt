                                          ABSTRACT

The sensitivity of the main global liquidity components, international loan and bond flows, to
global factors varied considerably over the past decade. The estimated sensitivity to US monetary
policy rose substantially in the immediate aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis, peaked around
the time of the 2013 Fed “taper tantrum”, and then reverted towards pre-crisis levels. Conversely,
the responsiveness of international bank lending to global risk conditions declined steadily
throughout the post-crisis period. We show that the main driver of the fluctuations in the
estimated sensitivities to US monetary policy was the degree of convergence among advanced
economy monetary policies. Meanwhile, the post-crisis fall in the sensitivity of international bank
lending to global risk was mainly driven by increases in the lending shares of better-capitalized
banking systems.

1. Introduction

International capital flows channel financial resources across borders to both public and
private sector borrowers. As such, they are critically important for economic growth and
financial stability. Understanding their main drivers is crucial, as flows should contribute to
economic growth and risk sharing internationally, without excessive volatility. Moreover, the
structure and volatility of international loan and bond flows changed considerably in the
aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC).

       The initial sharp decline in cross-border loans after the GFC was followed by a feeble
recovery and a second sharp contraction during the peak of the euro area crisis (Graph 1).
Meanwhile, international bond issuance remained relatively robust. As a consequence, the
composition of global liquidity has shifted away from cross-border bank loans and towards
international bonds in what has been dubbed “the second wave of global liquidity” (Shin,
2013). Events such as the “taper tantrum” in 2013, when the Federal Reserve signalled it
would start tapering its bond buying program, were marked by especially sharp capital
outflows from a number of emerging markets (Khatiwada, 2017). An extensive literature has
established that the two main global liquidity components, cross-border loan and bond
flows through market-based participants, are impacted not only by local factors, but also by
global factors. Advanced economy monetary policies and global risk aversion are established
as the two most important global drivers (e.g. Forbes and Warnock, 2012a; Schularick and
Taylor, 2012; Miranda-Agrippino and Rey, 2015; Cerutti, Claessens and Ratnovski, 2017; Ha et
al., 2017). Yet, little attention has been paid to the time variation in the sensitivities of key
capital flows to those drivers.

       In this paper, we fill a key gap in the literature by studying the nature and the causes
of the time variation in the sensitivities of the main components of global liquidity to global
factors. Our contribution to this important strand of the literature has multiple layers. First we
document in a robust manner that the sensitivity of the main global liquidity components to
global factors varied considerably in the period after the GFC. Second, we decompose the
variation in sensitivities into behavioural components and compositional components of
banking systems participating in global liquidity flows. Last but not least, we drill down into



                                                  1
the observed time variation, examine its proximate reasons, and distinguish between
persistent versus transitory drivers.

       This empirical analysis takes advantage of the rich dimensionality of multiple datasets
- the BIS International Debt Securities (IDS) Statistics, the BIS Locational Banking Statistics
(LBS) and the BIS Consolidated Banking Statistics (CBS). The combined information in the
above datasets facilitates examining the behaviour of key global liquidity components while
distinguishing among borrowing countries, lending national banking systems, instrument
types (debt securities versus bank loans), borrowing sectors (bank versus non-bank). We also
utilise information on lending banking systems’ balance sheet characteristics and on
monetary and prudential policy developments in both borrowers and creditor countries. The
combination of the above datasets generates a rich quarterly panel of international bank
loan and bond flows to 64 recipient countries for the period between 2000:Q1 and 2015:Q4.

       The first key set of results documents the considerable shift in international capital
flow sensitivities to global drivers since the GFC. US monetary policy became a more potent
driver of both cross-border loan and international bond flows, with estimated policy impact
peaking in 2013 and then partially retracing toward pre-crisis levels. Our estimates suggest
that a 100-basis point increase in the Federal funds rate would reduce total cross-border
flows by an estimated 8 percent in the years immediately after the crisis and by 4.5 percent
afterwards, up from just 2 percent pre-crisis. Meanwhile, the sensitivity of cross-border bank
loan flows to global risk conditions declined considerably post-crisis and became similar to
the traditionally lower risk sensitivity of international bond flows. A one-percent change in
the VIX measure would reduce total cross border flows by 3 percent pre-crisis, with this
effect falling to about 1 percent after 2013. Overall, aggregate global liquidity flows (the
sum of international bank loan and bond flows) became more sensitive to US monetary
policy and less sensitive to global risk after the GFC.

       The second key set of results reveals that the dynamics of the sensitivities to the two
major global drivers (US monetary policy and global risk conditions) are explained by
fundamentally different sets of factors. The post-crisis fluctuations in the sensitivities to US
monetary policy were driven by transitory behavioural factors. By contrast, the post-crisis




                                                  2
fluctuations in the sensitivities to global risk conditions were primarily driven by persistent
creditor compositional factors.

        The third set of key results pinpoints the main determinants of the post-crisis shifts in
sensitivities. The increased post-GFC sensitivity to US monetary policy is shown to be
attributed to a higher degree of monetary policy convergence among advanced economies
in the years following the GFC, with US monetary policy serving as a stronger indicator of
global monetary policy trends. This effect began to unwind as the monetary policies of major
advanced economies started to diverge in 2013. Meanwhile, the decline in the sensitivity to
global risk occurred mainly as a result of a post-crisis shift in the composition of global
lenders: the better-capitalized national banking systems, which tend to be less responsive to
global risk conditions, significantly increased their market share.

        These results have important implications for global liquidity flows. First, the finding
that the post-GFC increases in sensitivities to US monetary policy were driven largely by the
unusual convergence in advanced economy monetary policies suggests that they were
largely a transitory phenomenon. This result also implies that greater cross-country business
cycle (and, consequently, monetary policy) synchronization would make the stabilisation of
international capital flows more challenging. Second, the finding that the overall decline in
the sensitivity of international bank flows to global risk conditions was due to increases in
the lending market shares of better-capitalized banking systems, which are themselves less
responsive to global risk, suggests that the post-GFC regulatory reforms had the additional
benefit of stabilising international capital flows.

        The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we review relevant
findings of the existing literature on global liquidity and its drivers. We describe the data in
Section 3. We estimate the sensitivities to global factors and their post-crisis shifts in Section
4. In Section 5, we decompose these shifts into behavioural components and compositional
components. In Section 6, we examine the drivers of the post-crisis shifts in sensitivities. We
present robustness tests in Section 7 and conclude in Section 8.

2. Previous literature

         Global liquidity and drivers have been explored in many related studies. The most
extensive literature is on international capital flows. A second strand of literature is more
explicitly focused on global liquidity, international debt securities versus loans, and balance
sheet constraints across banks and non-banks. A third strand addresses international
monetary policy spillovers, covering the transmission channels through banks and capital
markets, interest rate and asset price co-movements, and the broader structure of the
international monetary system and policy instrument availability.

         The large literature on the drivers of capital flows historically focuses most extensively
on emerging market economies (EMEs), and more recently considers advanced economies
also as destinations of capital. Surges in cross-border flows to EMEs reflect improved
macroeconomic fundamentals of the borrowing country (pull and local factors) and more
favourable global conditions of a primarily cyclical nature (push and global factors). 2 Studies
of gross (as opposed to net) international flows and distinguishing across different
institutional participants provide a window in the mechanisms which shocks transmit
internationally. Higher volatility is observed in gross flows than in net flows, specifically in the
context of business cycles and crises (Broner et. al., 2013). The most extreme capital flows
episodes are driven by global factors, notably global risk aversion, particularly visible when
extreme episodes are classified into four categories: surges, stops, flight and retrenchment
(Forbes and Warnock, 2012b). Within the various capital flows components, the Global
Financial Crisis demonstrated the dominant contraction of international banking flows and
the relative stability of foreign direct investment (Milesi-Ferretti and Tille, 2011). Regional
reallocations in international participation also occurred, with post-crisis declines in bank-
based cross-border lending, particularly by euro area banks, alternatively described as
financial deglobalization (Rose and Wieladek, 2014; Forbes et al., 2015) or “the great cross-
border bank deleveraging” (Cerutti and Claessens, 2017; Bussière et al., 2018) or mainly just a
cyclical deleveraging of European banks’ large overseas operations (Benetrix, McCauley,
McGuire, von Peter, 2019). Possible explanations include weaker economic activity, capital

  Examples of such studies include those by Calvo et al. (1993), Ghosh and Ostry (1993), Fernandez-Arias (1996), Taylor and
Sarno (1997), and Chuhan et. al. (1998). See Koepke (2015) for a comprehensive summary of the literature in the drivers of
capital flows to emerging markets.

controls, the slower pace of financial liberalization, deleveraging, and risk aversion (CGFS
2011).

         Micro-banking data analyses show which bank-specific features magnified
contractions or expansions post-crisis. Individual global banks received balance sheet shocks
through holdings of asset-backed commercial paper (Cetorelli and Goldberg, 2012a), or later
through exposure to European sovereign debt (Popov and van Horen, 2015). Transmission of
impulses through global banks to their affiliate locations internationally via internal capital
markets follows a pecking order, with the degree of shock transmission to countries
dependent on their bank-specific importance in lending and funding activity (Cetorelli and
Goldberg, 2012b). Prudential policies and unconventional monetary policy in the form of a
funding for lending scheme jointly contributed to a retrenchment of cross-border lending by
UK banks (Forbes, Reinhardt and Wieladek, 2017). Consistent with these observations, some
countries with banks that were well-capitalized pre-crisis, like Canada, expanded
international activities post-crisis when foreign jurisdictions tightened capital requirements
(Damar and Mordel, 2017). Overviews of results from macroprudential policy spillover studies
and monetary policy spillovers likewise tend to find roles for bank capitalization and business
models (Buch and Goldberg, 2017; Buch, Bussiere, Goldberg and Hills, 2019).

         Meanwhile, bank balance sheet characteristics clearly matter for responses to shocks.
Higher bank capital, and more retention of bank earnings, reduces the cost of debt financing,
increases bank lending growth, and reduces the magnitude of monetary policy transmission
into lending (Gambacorta and Shin 2018). US monetary policy tightening and episodes of
dollar appreciation are associated with deleveraging of global banks, reduced capital flows
to emerging markets, and an overall tightening of global financial conditions (Bruno and
Shin, 2015). Banks have more pronounced bank lending channel responses to liquidity risk
when they have low levels of capitalization and low deposit funding shares (Cornett et al.
2011; Buch and Goldberg, 2015). Evidence from a large cross-country initiative on monetary
policy consequences for lending flows to nonbanks through global banks shows a mixture of
bank characteristics matter, even while the effects are not always quantitatively large (Buch,
Bussiere, Goldberg, and Hills, 2019).




                                                5
          Beyond banks, a post-crisis shift in international financial intermediation has
occurred, with a reduction in the role of bank lending and an increase in bond market
financing internationally. The bank-dominated phase of global liquidity was partially
replaced by a second bond-dominated phase of global liquidity (Shin, 2013). 3 This
composition links the evolution of global monetary aggregates to the financial activities of
non-financial corporations (NFCs), with the non-core liabilities of NFCs reflecting global
credit conditions and predicting global trade and growth (Chung et. al., 2016). Of course,
these shifts also result from policy developments. Unconventional monetary policy
contributed to shifting the balance of dollar credit transmission from global banks to global
bond investors, as demonstrated by a post-crisis negative relationship between the term
premium on 10-year Treasury bonds and international bond issuance (McCauley et. al.,
2015). Regulatory changes also have played a role in this transition as banks were subjected
to tighter requirements. Monetary policy rates across a large sample of countries can closely
track advanced economy policy rates, particularly those of countries playing a central role in
the international monetary system (Obstfeld, Shambaugh and Taylor, 2015). The form of
exchange rate and monetary regimes in place influences the degree of co-movement.
Greater near term autonomy has been linked to some restrictions on international capital
movements (Klein and Shambaugh, 2008) and lower levels of banking globalization
(Goldberg 2013).

          We contribute to this broader literature by examining the flows through both banks
and non-banks as borrowers and lenders. Our analysis of the effects of key global liquidity
drivers, including risk and advanced economy monetary policy, demonstrates structural
breaks, and tests conjectures about why and how effects of key drivers change over time.
Our analysis documents the clear influence of advanced economy monetary policy stances,
lenders’ balance sheet characteristics and creditor composition on the shifting drivers of
global liquidity.

  These observations pertain to volumes of cross-border flows, not to co-movements of asset prices. During this same broad
period, co-movements in international asset prices continue to be at least as strong and sensitive to global risk sentiment and
liquidity conditions as pre-crisis state. This type of evidence does not support de-globalization.


                                                                 6
3. Data

We use three databases to capture the dimensionality needed to explore the main
components of global liquidity: the BIS Locational Banking Statistics (LBS), the BIS
International Debt Securities Statistics (IDSS), and BIS Consolidated Banking Statistics (CBS).
The BIS LBS captures the outstanding claims and liabilities of internationally active banks
located in 44 BIS LBS reporting countries 4 against counterparties residing in more than 200
countries. Banks record their positions on an unconsolidated basis, including intragroup
positions to capture international flows between offices of the same banking group. The
data, which are aggregated at the country level and compiled following balance of payments
statistics principles, capture around 95% of all cross-border interbank business (Bank for
International Settlements, 2015). The counterparty sector breakdown available in the BIS LBS
enables us also to distinguish between cross-border bank lending to bank and non-bank
borrowers. We use the BIS CBS in order to obtain information on the relative importance of
lending countries for a given borrowing country. The BIS IDSS data capture borrowing in
money and bond markets. They encompass what market participants have traditionally
referred to as foreign bonds and eurobonds. International debt securities (IDS) are issued in
a market other than the local market of the country where the borrower resides (Gruić and
Wooldridge, 2012). The sample used for the empirical analysis consists of quarterly data from
Q1 2000 to Q4 2015. On the borrowing side, we focus on a set of 64 countries; on the bank
lending side, we use data on the positions of all 44 BIS LBS and 31 CBS reporting countries. 5

            The typical lenders and borrowers connected by each flow type differ considerably in
composition and size, as illustrated within Table 1. Cross-border loans are typically supplied
by internationally-active banks, which tend to be relatively large. Meanwhile, the creditors in
international debt securities markets are usually non-bank financial intermediaries, such as
pension funds, insurance companies, money market mutual funds, and hedge funds. The
variation on the borrower side is even greater. International bond issuance by non-banks
tends to be dominated by sovereigns and large non-financial corporates. The latter are also

important players on the borrowing side of the cross-border bank loan market, which also
channels funds to export/import firms and leveraged non-bank financials.

            Appropriately capturing changes in stance of US monetary policy is key for our
analysis. The existing empirical literature discussed in Section 2 mainly corresponds to the
period prior to the introduction of unconventional monetary policy and almost exclusively
uses a short-term policy rate. However, monetary policy at the zero lower bound is a
defining feature of the post-crisis period, and changes in communications, interest on effect
reserves and quantitative easing actions became more instrumental. We use the Wu-Xia
policy measure (Wu and Xia, 2016) as a sufficient statistic for the stance of US monetary
policy. This construct uses the effective US Federal Funds target rate prior to Q4 2008 and
estimates of the shadow Federal Funds rate from Q1 2009 through end of 2015 (Graph 2, left
panel). Since all shadow rate estimates are sensitive to the underlying modelling
assumptions, we also conduct robustness analysis using alternative US monetary policy
measures (Section 7).

            We proxy for monetary policy divergence among advanced economies using the
difference between the two-year futures on the policy rate for the United States and the
average of the two-year futures on the respective policy rates for the United Kingdom,
Switzerland, Japan and a group of “core” Eurozone countries (Austria, Belgium, Germany,
Finland, France, the Netherlands, Spain).6 As shown in Graph 3, monetary policy divergence
was unusually small in the years immediately following the Global Financial Crisis, with the
gap opening up again after 2013.

            For global risk conditions we follow the literature in our baseline by using the VIX
index of the implied volatility in S&P500 stock index option prices from Chicago Board
Options Exchange (CBOE). As alternative metrics have been derived in the finance literature
to separate out risk sentiment from underlying risk levels, we perform robustness results
using the Bekaert, Engstrom and Xu (2017) risk index. Very similar results arise as the two
measures are strongly positively correlated (Graph 2, right panel).

            Three borrowing country variables (pull factors) are included in baseline
specifications: local real GDP growth, sovereign ratings, and the degree of financial

    Summary statistics for the explanatory variables used in our empirical analysis are presented in Table B1 in Annex B.

                                                                     8
openness. For each borrowing country, the sovereign ratings variable is defined as the
average ratings across the three major credit ratings agencies (S&P, Moody’s and Fitch). The
degree of financial openness is captured by the Chinn-Ito index (Chinn and Ito, 2008),
normalized between 0 and 1. In addition, we account for changes in prudential policy. The
IBRN Prudential Instruments dataset covers widely-used prudential instruments, keeping
track of the intensity of their usage in 64 countries between 2000 and 2014 at a quarterly
frequency. The instruments that are covered are: general capital requirements, sector-specific
capital requirements (split into real estate credit, consumer credit, and other), interbank
exposure limits, concentration limits, loan-to-value (LTV) ratio limits, and (local currency and
foreign currency) reserve requirements. We specifically focus on the three prudential policy
instruments that have been shown to have the largest impact on international bank lending:
loan-to-value ratio caps, capital requirements and local currency reserve requirements
(Cerutti et al., 2017; Avdjiev et al., 2017; and Buch and Goldberg, 2017). 7

          The balance sheet characteristics of national banking systems are constructed using
Bankscope data. We obtain the balance sheet items of interest for the set of internationally
active banks that report to the BIS consolidated banking statistics, and then aggregate bank-
level characteristics to national banking system-wide variables, using weighted averages
across the individual banks of a given nationality. Data are adjusted for mergers and
acquisitions to correct for balance sheet jumps that are unrelated to lending (Brei et al.,
2013). We focus on i) capital to total assets, ii) average bank size, iii) deposits to total assets,
iv) net interest income over total income, and v) net interest income to total assets. Two bank
business model measures considered are: i) an income diversification ratio (defined as net
interest income to total income); and ii) net interest income to total assets. The first indicator
ranges from 0 to 1 and indicates the fraction of a bank’s profitability that derives from
traditional intermediation activity (i.e. lending and deposits). If a bank has a large portion of
non-interest income (trading income, fees and commissions for services) than this indicator
tends lower values. The second indicator is the return per unit of assets that derives from
traditional intermediation activity. It represents the profitability of intermediated assets that
is obtained by the bank getting deposits and supplying loans.

 Cerutti et al. (2017) provide an extensive discussion of the properties of the quarterly changes in these prudential instruments
and the cumulative changes over time.

4. Post-crisis shifts in sensitivities to global factors

We start our empirical analysis by estimating a specification that is commonly used in the
existing literature. 8 In it, the main global liquidity components are functions of global (push)
and country-specific (pull) drivers. We replicate findings from that literature as a baseline
before delving into differences in sensitivities across different borrower groups (banks and
non-banks) and across different types of financing instrument (international loan and bond
flows).

          The baseline model for international capital flows is given by:

                                     𝑗𝑗

aggregate. For our analysis, 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 can be cross-border loans - to all sectors, to banks, to non-

banks - or international debt securities - issued by all sectors, by banks, or by non-banks. As
is standard in the literature, the model is expressed in stationary variables to avoid problems
of spurious correlations. The international flows on the left-hand side of the equation are
expressed in growth rates 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡𝑗𝑗 . All specifications include country fixed effects 𝜇𝜇 𝑗𝑗 .

          The right-hand-side of the equation contains three global liquidity drivers - the US
federal funds rate 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 (as a gauge for the stance of US monetary policy), the VIX (as a
measure global risk conditions) and global GDP (as an indicator of global economic activity).
As the US federal funds rate does not reflect all of the monetary policy interventions for the
post GFC period, we use the Wu-Xia shadow rate measure (Wu and Xia, 2016) as a proxy to

  As discussed in Cerutti, Claessens and Rose (2017), this type of specification dates back to Calvo et al (1993, 1996) and has a
long history of applications. Koepke (2015) provides a review of approximately 40 papers, with recent panel regressions in
Fratzscher (2011), Forbes an Warnock (2012), Broner et al (2013), Bruno and Shin (2015), and Cerutti, Claessens and Ratnovski
(2017). Goldberg and Krogstrup (2018) derive similar specifications from a model of capital flow pressures using balance of
payments and international portfolio demand equilibrium conditions.

                                                                     10

corresponding to borrowing country j and flow type include sovereign credit ratings

GDP growth 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑗𝑗𝑡𝑡 . The latter measures overall economic performance. Sovereign ratings

proxy the role of country risk and the perceived creditworthiness of borrowers by country.
The Chinn-Ito index gauges the degree of capital account openness. The Fed funds rate and
the sovereign ratings are in first differences, while local and global GDP are in growth rates.
The Chinn-Ito index is in levels and the VIX enters the equation in logs. 10 The model is
estimated under the assumption that the two key global liquidity drivers, the Fed funds rate
and the VIX, are exogenous when controlling for local and global GDP, government ratings
and degree of financial openness 11.

          The estimated coefficients from the baseline specification in equation (1) for the
entire sample 2000:Q1 – 2015:Q4, presented in Table 2, are largely in line with those
obtained in the existing literature. Namely, the results from the baseline model indicate that
an increase in global risk conditions (measured by the VIX) has a negative and strongly
statistically significant effect on all (loan and bond) flows. The US federal funds rate has a
sharply negative impact on cross-border bank loans. Its estimated impact on international
debt securities is also negative, albeit only marginally statistically significant. Local factors are
statistically significant drivers. Borrowing countries with higher GDP growth rates and with
better sovereign credit ratings tend to attract more cross-border loans. The degree of
financial openness, as reflected in the Chinn-Ito index, has a positive (and statistically
significant) effect on the international bond flows, especially to banks.

          As both anecdotal evidence and the literature discussion of phases of financial
globalization hint at the presence of a possible structural break around the global financial
crisis, we relax the (implicit) constant-coefficient assumption of the existing literature and

  As there are multiple shadow policy rates available in the literature, we perform extensive robustness checks using alternative
indicators of U.S. monetary policy. The main findings are robust to alternative proxies.
10
   The Chinn-Ito index is only available at an annual frequency. We have tested the robustness of the results by using a quarterly
linear interpolation of the Chinn-Ito index and by eliminating the index from the regressions. In both cases, the main results of
the study remain qualitatively similar.
11
   We add the following controls in robustness checks: lagged flows, the borrowing country’s monetary policy stance (proxied
by the borrowing country’s policy rate), the log change of the exchange rate between the borrowing country’s currency and the
US dollar, the change in longer maturity interest rates. See Section 6.2 for details.

                                                                 11

formally examine whether the estimated coefficients from equation (1) are stable over time.
Rather than exogenously imposing an ad-hoc break date, we test for its presence and exact
timing endogenously. Using the tools developed in Bai (1994, 1997), Kurozumi (2002) and
Carrion-i-Silvestre and Sansó (2006), for each quarter 𝑇𝑇 starting in 2007:Q1, we estimate the
following equation:

and 𝐼𝐼(𝑡𝑡 ≥ 𝑇𝑇) is an indicator function that takes the value 1 when 𝑡𝑡 ≥ 𝑇𝑇 and 0 otherwise.
Notice that for each candidate break date 𝑇𝑇, all the parameters of equation (2) are different.
For each type of cross-border flow 𝑌𝑌 and each quarter 𝑇𝑇 we compute the sum of squared
residuals (𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆) of the regression in order to get a sequence {𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑇𝑇𝑌𝑌 } 𝑇𝑇≥2007:𝑄𝑄1 . The most likely

candidate for the break is the date 𝑇𝑇 that minimizes the sequence, hence maximizing the fit
of the model: 𝑇𝑇𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏

                           = 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 𝑇𝑇≥2007:𝑄𝑄1 {𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑇𝑇𝑌𝑌 }. Once we detect the endogenous date for the

break (𝑇𝑇𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏
          𝑌𝑌
                    ), we re-estimate the baseline model with the appropriate break dummy and
use a Wald test on 𝜅𝜅 and 𝛾𝛾′ to determine whether the break is statistically significant. The

vector 𝛽𝛽 ′ captures the sensitivities of international financial flows to the drivers in 𝑋𝑋𝑡𝑡 before
                                                                                                                                                   𝑗𝑗


the break. The sum 𝛽𝛽 ′ + 𝛾𝛾′ captures the post-break sensitivities.

             The results we obtain from the above formal tests suggest that the break date for
both main global liquidity components (cross-border loan flows and international bond
flows) is 2009:Q1. Wald (or Chow) tests on the coefficients 𝜅𝜅 and 𝛾𝛾′ in equation (2) indicate
that the break is statistically significant for the global liquidity components that we
examine. 12

             Table 3 summarizes the estimated sensitivities to the main global drivers (the federal
funds rate and the VIX) during the pre-crisis and the post-crisis periods, respectively. Two
sets of estimates are provided for the post-crisis period – one for the full sample (ending in
Q4:2015) and one for a sub-sample ending in Q1:2013. The latter set of results provides

initial perspective on how the 2013 Fed taper tantrum, which started the divergence across
advanced economy monetary policies, marked a turning point in the post-crisis sensitivities
to global factors 13.

          The results confirm that the relationship between the main global factors and
international capital flows (from the borrowing country perspective) has changed profoundly
since the Global Financial Crisis 14. The impact of US monetary policy on cross-border loans,
which was already negative and statistically significant during the pre-crisis period, rose even
further in the immediate aftermath of the GFC. While prior to the crisis a 100-basis point
increase in the federal funds rate was associated with a 3 percent decline in cross-border
bank lending flows, in the aftermath of the crisis this effect rose to 8 percent. The respective
negative impact on international bond issuance, which was not statistically significant prior
to the crisis, also increased considerably after the GFC. In quantitative terms, the impact of a
100-basis point increase in the federal funds rate on international bond issuance surged
from slightly more than 1 percent before the crisis to 8 percent immediately after the crisis.

          After 2013, global liquidity sensitivities to US monetary policy reverted towards their
respective pre-crisis levels, especially for cross-border loans. Once the sample is extended to
include the post-taper tantrum period, a 100-basis point increase in the federal funds rate
becomes associated with an approximate 3 percent decrease in loan flows, a level of
responsiveness much closer to the one observed prior to the crisis. The responsiveness of
international bond flows reverted to about 4 percent.

          The sensitivity of both loans and bonds to global risk conditions declined sharply.
Whereas prior to the crisis a 1 percent change in the actual VIX measure was associated with
an approximate 4 percent contraction in loan flows, after the crisis this effect became
statistically insignificant and about 32 basis points in magnitude. Similarly, the sensitivity of
bonds to a 1 percent increase in the VIX declined from a peak of about 3 percent right after


13
  As a robustness exercise, we replicate the analysis using a smaller pre-crisis sample (2002:Q1 – 2008:Q4) to match the span of
the post-crisis one (2009:Q1 – 2015:Q4). The signs, magnitudes and time patterns of the coefficients are very similar and
qualitatively the same as those in Table 3. All results from that robustness exercise are available upon request.
14
   Table B2 in Annex B presents the results from formal tests of the significance in the differences between the estimated
coefficients of US monetary policy and global risk (reported in Table 3) for key sample periods (post-break – up to 2015:Q4 or
up to 2013:Q1 – minus pre-break, as well as post-break up to 2015:Q4 minus post-break up to 2013:Q1). Each difference in
estimated coefficients is accompanied by its robust standard error; the stars represent the usual conventional significance levels,
computed using a t-test on the difference between the two coefficients.

                                                                  13
the crisis to slightly more than 1 percent afterwards. These findings are in line with the
argument of Shin (2016) that the VIX has lost its power as a barometer of banks’ appetite for
leverage since the GFC.

     Given our special interest in the sensitivities of international loan and bond flows to US
monetary policy and global risk conditions, we conduct an additional closer investigation of
the evolution of the respective estimated coefficients. In particular, we sequentially estimate
equation (2) with the appropriate break date, starting with data for 2000:Q1 – 2013:Q1 and
adding one quarter at time until we reach the full sample period (2000:Q1 – 2015:Q4).

     The above procedure generates a distinct set of parameter estimates for each sample-
end quarter from 2013:Q1 through 2015:Q4. This allows us to track how sensitivities to US
monetary policy and global risk conditions have evolved during that period. As with the

baseline analysis, for this approach to time variation 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 respectively covers gross flows of
                                                                             𝑗𝑗


cross-border loans to all sectors, to banks, to non-banks, and international debt securities
issued by all sectors, by banks or by non-banks, all taken from borrower country j’s
perspective 15.

     This deeper empirical analysis reveals considerable variation in the estimated parameters
of interest across global factors through the post-crisis period, as shown in Graphs 4 and 5.
The graphs also include in each panel a black line designating the pre-crisis estimates of
comparable sensitivities. The post-crisis evolution of the sensitivity to US monetary policy is
dramatic, and common across instruments and borrowing sectors (Graph 4). It is strongest
right before the start of the US taper tantrum and becomes gradually weaker afterwards. By
the end of 2015, sensitivities remain stronger than during the pre-crisis period for all but one
of the global liquidity components.

          The sensitivity to global risk conditions decreases steadily throughout the post-GFC
period (Graph 5). Notably, even though the estimated sensitivities are still significantly lower
than zero in mid-2013, this is not the case by 2015. In the case of cross-border loans, the
sensitivity to global risk conditions is significantly weaker in the post-crisis period than in
pre-crisis. The sensitivity of international debt securities to the VIX is almost always not

   The approach described above may be subject to shrinking confidence bands over time due to artificially larger samples. As a
robustness exercise, we compute rolling window estimates with a fixed sample size of 16 quarters. The results generated by this
alternative estimation, which are available upon request, are very similar to the benchmark estimates.

                                                                14
significantly different from zero, with the only exception being flows of bonds issued by non-
banks 16.




5. Decomposing the shifts in sensitivities to global factors

The next step of the empirical investigation examines the deeper underlying causes of the
shifts in sensitivities to global factors documented in the previous section. More concretely,
the shifts in the sensitivities are decomposed into compositional components and
behavioural components.

         Since the baseline specifications include controls for local country j drivers of global
liquidity, the evolution of estimated global factor coefficients 𝛽𝛽1 and 𝛽𝛽2 on advanced
economy monetary policy and risk are associated with creditors. For any class of creditor and
borrower type, the aggregate sensitivities of international bank lending flows to global
factors (𝛽𝛽1 and 𝛽𝛽2) can be expressed as weighted averages of the national creditor-specific
sensitivities to global factors (𝛽𝛽1𝑖𝑖 and 𝛽𝛽2𝑖𝑖 ). Some changes in estimated 𝛽𝛽1 and 𝛽𝛽2 are
attributable to a combination of shifts in the composition of international creditors (a
compositional component) and shifts in the sensitivity of flows from each respective country
creditor vis-à-vis advanced economy monetary policy and risk metrics (a behavioural
component). While this observation is general, our derivation of the decomposition takes the
perspective of international bank lending.

Combining (4) and (5), the baseline regression specification implies that the observed
borrower j sensitivities to the federal funds rate (𝛽𝛽1 ) and to the VIX (𝛽𝛽2 ) can be expressed as
weighted averages of the respective sensitivities (𝛽𝛽1𝑖𝑖 ) and (𝛽𝛽2𝑖𝑖 ) for the individual lending
national banking systems: 17


                                            𝛽𝛽1 = ∑𝑖𝑖�𝑤𝑤1,𝑡𝑡−1 𝛽𝛽1𝑖𝑖 � and 𝛽𝛽2 = ∑𝑖𝑖�𝑤𝑤2,𝑡𝑡−1 𝛽𝛽2𝑖𝑖 �.                                   (6)
                                                             𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗                                  𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗



             The compositional component is captured by the 𝑤𝑤1𝑖𝑖 ′𝑠𝑠 and 𝑤𝑤2𝑖𝑖 ′𝑠𝑠 and the behavioral
component is captured by the 𝛽𝛽1𝑖𝑖 ′𝑠𝑠 and 𝛽𝛽2𝑖𝑖 ′𝑠𝑠. The compositional factors 𝑤𝑤1𝑖𝑖 ′𝑠𝑠 and 𝑤𝑤2𝑖𝑖 ′𝑠𝑠 are
directly observable from data on bilateral international claims. Meanwhile, we estimate the
behavioural factors 𝛽𝛽1𝑖𝑖 ′𝑠𝑠 and 𝛽𝛽2𝑖𝑖 ′𝑠𝑠 using a variant of the baseline specification.

             The above decomposition procedure is implemented by taking advantage of the BIS
consolidated banking statistics (CBS). The BIS CBS contains bilateral data on banks’
international claims 18, with information on the nationality of the lending banks (i) and on the
residence of the borrower (j). The composition of lending national banking systems (the 𝑤𝑤1𝑖𝑖 ′𝑠𝑠
and the 𝑤𝑤2𝑖𝑖 ′𝑠𝑠) is directly observable and obtained from the CBS matrix of bilateral stocks of
international claims. Meanwhile, the factors that capture the behavioural component, i.e. the
national banking system-specific sensitivities to global factors (the 𝛽𝛽1𝑖𝑖 ′𝑠𝑠 and the 𝛽𝛽2𝑖𝑖 ′𝑠𝑠), are
obtained as the estimated coefficients on the respective global factors in the creditor-
country banking system-specific regressions presented in equation (6). Thus, we provide the
creditor country history of changes in sensitivities and the precision of estimates of those
sensitivities for global liquidity flows through international banks to both bank and non-bank
counterparties. 19

             After obtaining the pre- and post-crisis lender-specific weights and lender-specific
sensitivities to global drivers, we estimate the contributions of the behavioural components

     In the BIS CBS, international claims are defined as the sum of cross-border claims and local claims denominated in foreign
         currencies.

     As comparable data is not available for market-based finance, our decomposition does not extend to international debt
        securities.

                                                                                 16
(the first terms on the right-hand side of equations (7) and (8)) and compositional
components (the second terms on the right-hand side of equations (7) and (8)) to the shifts
in sensitivities from the perspective of borrowers. 20 Recall that a borrower can experience a
changing sensitivity of financing flows to global factors if there is an evolution in the
composition of creditors, where the creditors have distinct sensitivities, and if there is an
evolution of the behavioural sensitivities of creditors.

          The results from the decompositions of borrower sensitivities into the composition
and behaviour of creditors are summarized in Graph 6. The behavioural component
dominates the shifts in realized borrower sensitivities to US monetary policy (Graph 6, left-
hand panel). For all three borrowing sectors, the estimated contributions of the behavioural
component are negative (i.e. they increase the absolute value of the estimated sensitivity).
The contributions of the behavioural component dwarf the respective contributions of the
compositional component. These results strongly suggest that the post-crisis increases in the
sensitivity of international bank lending flows to US monetary policy were driven by increases
in the sensitivities of individual banking systems rather than by shifts in the composition of
international lending from less to more sensitive banking systems.

          The decomposition of the sensitivities to the VIX show that the contributions of the
compositional component are all positive and much larger than their counterparts for the US
monetary policy sensitivities (Graph 6, right-hand panel). The overall declines in sensitivities
to the VIX of both lending to the non-bank private sector and interbank lending are clearly
driven by the compositional component. The behavioural component is not nearly as
dominant as in the case of US monetary policy and plays a non-negligible role only for
lending to the public sector.

          The sensitivities of international bank lending flows to the public sector increase
considerably during the post-crisis period vis-à-vis both the US monetary policy and the VIX.
These results could be interpreted as evidence that banks have adjusted treatment of
sovereign risk since the crisis. Such an interpretation is consistent with evidence that banks
treated (most of) their sovereign exposures as virtually risk-free before the crisis, but started


20
   By design, these decompositions represent approximations of the underlying estimation procedure. Even though the
“synthetic” sensitivities derived as a weighted average of the lender-specific sensitivities tend to be very close to the global
sensitivities obtained using the benchmark regression specification, the two measures do not overlap perfectly.

                                                                17
to assess sovereign risk in a more realistic manner after the crisis (Acharya et al., 2013; Farhi
and Tirole, 2016; De Grauwe and Ji, 2013).




6. Drivers of the post-crisis shifts in sensitivities

       Having decomposed the post-crisis shifts in the sensitivities into compositional
components and behavioural components, we attempt to identify the key individual drivers
of those components. We conjecture that the evolution of the estimated sensitivities to US
monetary policy may be influenced by the overall advanced economy (AE) monetary policy
stance. The reaction to US monetary policy as a global liquidity driver could be especially
pronounced if it is a signal for a broader based set of (expansionary) policies across AE
countries. In the period between the global financial crisis and the 2013 Fed taper tantrum,
there was considerable convergence between the monetary policies of advanced economies,
all of which were conducting various forms of quantitative easing to stimulate the real
economy. In 2013, the Federal Reserve signalled that it would start tapering its bond buying
program. As the central banks of other advanced economies, most notably the European
Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, did not follow suit, the monetary policies of advanced
economies diverged from 2013 through the end of our estimation period in 2015, with
divergence metrics returning to levels that were common pre-crisis. Thus, we conjecture that
the sensitivities to US monetary policy could be stronger during the convergence period and
weaker as policy diverges. Indeed, the left-hand panel of Graph 7 already provides some
preliminary evidence in support of that hypothesis by illustrating that the estimated
sensitivity of cross-border loans to US monetary policy co-moved very closely with the
degree of monetary policy divergence between the US and other advanced economies.

       When it comes to the VIX, we conjecture that the shifts in both the compositional
components and the behavioural components of the sensitivities of cross-border loans could
be driven by the characteristics of the lending national banking systems characteristics.
Lenders’ capitalisation levels, size, business models and profitability affect the responsiveness
of their cross-border lending to shocks. The right-hand panel of Graph 7 displays some
preliminary evidence that lending banks’ capitalisation levels may have been an important



                                                 18
driver of the post-crisis evolution in the estimated sensitivity of cross-border bank loans to
global risk.

         The rest of this section provides formal empirical tests of the above hypotheses. We
use the decomposition results from the previous section in order to customise our empirical
frameworks for examining each of the above hypotheses. Since the compositional
components component explains the majority of the shifts in sensitivities to the VIX, we
examine the drivers of the post-crisis compositional shifts a cross-sectional set-up.
Meanwhile, since the compositional component does not play a significant role in explaining
the shifts in sensitivities to US MP, we examine the potential drivers of that set of sensitivities
using a more direct panel regression approach.




6.1 Drivers of the shifts in sensitivities to global risk
The drivers of the shifts in sensitivities to global risk are investigated using a two-stage
analysis that compares (i) the pre- and post-crisis sensitivities of individual banking systems
to the VIX (the behavioural component) as well as (ii) the pre- and post-crisis shares of
national banking system i lenders (the compositional component). The analysis examines
which banking systems characteristics and policies are associated with changes to lender-
specific sensitivities and weights during the post-crisis period.

         We test for the main drivers of the shift in sensitivities to global factors by estimating
specifications in which the changes in the estimated coefficients are regressed on a set of
pre-crisis variables. In particular, we estimate the following regressions:

                         (𝛽𝛽2,𝑘𝑘,𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃
                            𝑖𝑖                𝑖𝑖
                                          − 𝛽𝛽2,𝑘𝑘,𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃            𝑖𝑖
                                                          ) = 𝛾𝛾2 ′𝐹𝐹2008          𝑖𝑖
                                                                          + 𝜁𝜁2 ′𝑃𝑃2008               𝑖𝑖
                                                                                        + 𝜃𝜃𝑠𝑠,𝑘𝑘 + 𝜀𝜀2,𝑘𝑘   (7)


where (𝛽𝛽2,𝑘𝑘,𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃
         𝑖𝑖                𝑖𝑖
                       − 𝛽𝛽2,𝑘𝑘,𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 ) is the difference in the coefficients for 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 taken from equation

(4), estimated for lending country i and borrowing sector k (banks, non-bank private sector
and public sector). 𝜃𝜃𝑠𝑠,𝑘𝑘 is vectors of borrowing sector fixed effects. The vector 𝐹𝐹2008
                                                                                       𝑖𝑖
                                                                                            includes

two banking system indicators: i) the capital-to-asset ratio; ii) the average bank size. Bank
capital acts as a buffer against contingencies triggered by shocks and can limit the credit
effect of increased global uncertainty and volatility (Gambacorta and Shin, 2018). The vector

                                                                  19
  measures (capital requirements and loan-to-value limits) and a regulatory stringency index
  based on the World Bank’s Bank Regulation and Supervision Survey. We use pre-break
  characteristics at the national banking system level in order to limit endogeneity issues. Since
  the dependent variable in those regressions is a function of estimated coefficients, each with
  an associated standard error around it, meta-regressions techniques are utilized 21.

                Likewise, the drivers of the shifts in lending banking systems’ international lending
  shares (“weights”) are analyzed using a similar regression specification to (𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘,𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃
                                                                                 𝑖𝑖              𝑖𝑖
                                                                                             − 𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘,𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 ):

                                            𝑖𝑖
                                          𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘,𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃     𝑖𝑖
                                                        − 𝑤𝑤𝑘𝑘,𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃           𝑖𝑖
                                                                      = 𝛾𝛾𝑤𝑤′ 𝐹𝐹2008           𝑖𝑖
                                                                                     + 𝜁𝜁𝑤𝑤 ′𝑃𝑃2008               𝑖𝑖
                                                                                                    + 𝜃𝜃𝑤𝑤,𝑘𝑘 + 𝜀𝜀𝑤𝑤,𝑘𝑘                                           (8)

  In this case, as weights represent values that have no standard error associated with them,
  we estimate equation (8) by OLS. We also test the robustness of the results by including in
  equations (7) and (8) additional pre-break banking system indicators: i) the average banks’
  expected default frequency; ii) the deposit-to-total funding ratio; and iii) the ratio of net
  interest income to total income.
                The first two columns of Table 4 present the results for the determinants of the shifts
  in the sensitivity of international bank lending to global risk. The main determinant of the
  changes in the sensitivities to global risk appears to be the capitalization level of the
  respective creditor banking system. The better capitalized a given banking system was at the
  time of the structural break, the more likely it was that the sensitivity of its international
  lending to global risk declined during the post-crisis period.

                The main drivers of the shifts in the composition of international lending
  (approximated by the lending weights defined above) between the pre- and the post-crisis
  periods are estimated per equation (8), in which the difference in lending national banking
  system weights before and after the crisis (𝑤𝑤k,𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃
                                                𝑖𝑖             𝑖𝑖
                                                           − 𝑤𝑤k,𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 ) is regressed on a set of pre-crisis

  business model indicators. The third column of Table 4 indicates that the banking systems
  that were more likely to gain market share during the post-crisis period were those that were




 21
     The meta-regression allows for residual statistical heterogeneity in the results of different estimation (between-study variance)
by assuming that the true effects follow a normal distribution around the linear predictor (Stanley and Jarrell, 1989). The meta-
regression can be formally defined as: 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 |𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖 ~𝑁𝑁(𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖 , 𝜎𝜎𝑖𝑖2 ), where 𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖 ~ 𝑁𝑁(𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 𝛽𝛽, 𝜏𝜏 2 ) therefore: 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 ~𝑁𝑁(𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 𝛽𝛽, 𝜎𝜎𝑖𝑖2 + 𝜏𝜏 2 ), where 𝛽𝛽 is the vector of
estimated effects of study characteristics. This type of equation is estimated by weighted least-squares, in which the weight of
each estimated coefficient depends inversely of its variance and corresponds to the inverse of the sum of two standard deviations
(𝜎𝜎 2 , 𝜏𝜏 2 ).

                                                                                        20

systems characteristics (the fourth column of the Table 4). 22



6.2 Drivers of the shifts in sensitivities to US monetary policy
Since the compositional component does not play a significant role in explaining the shifts in
sensitivities to US MP, we examine the drivers of the evolution of those sensitivities using a
direct panel regression approach. More concretely, we formally examine the relevance of the
degree of divergence among advanced economies’ monetary policies by interacting it with
the coefficients of Δ𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 in equation (2), while controlling for several lending banking system
characteristics. The resulting model is:

         The results from the estimation of the above regression specification are shown in
Table 5. They strongly suggest that the degree of AE monetary policy convergence played a
large role in driving the post-GFC fluctuations in the estimated sensitivity of cross-border
bank lending flows to US monetary policy. More concretely, the positive and highly
statistically significant coefficient on the interaction term between the US monetary policy


22
     We further check the robustness of the results presented in Table 4 by estimating a couple of additional alternative
     specifications. In the first additional set of robustness checks, we re-estimate all specifications in Table 4 while including
     controls for the (credit-ratings implied) implicit bailout guarantee at the national banking system level. More specifically,
     we construct a variable that is equal to the average difference between the “All-in” credit rating and the “Stand-alone”
     credit rating of each bank headquartered in a given country for which both of the above ratings are available. In the
     second additional set of robustness checks, we re-estimate all specifications in Table 4 while including a dummy for
     Germany, Japan and the US, the three national banking system with the largest changes in the international lending
     weights during the post-crisis period. The results generated by both of these robustness checks, which are available upon
     request, are qualitatively very similar to the benchmark estimates reported in Table 4.

                                                                        21
variable and the MP Divergence variable implies that the sensitivity of cross-border bank
lending to US monetary policy was at or close to its peak during periods of AE monetary
policy convergence. This was exactly the case during the period between the GFC and the
Taper Tantrum. Once the degree of AE monetary policy convergence declined after 2013, so
did the sensitivity of international lending to US monetary policy. Importantly, the statistical
significance of AE monetary policy convergence is robust to the inclusion of several (lenders)
balance sheet characteristics, such as capitalization, profitability and the relative importance
of interest income.




7. Robustness

We conduct several sets of robustness checks. First, all benchmark specifications are re-
estimated using alternative measures of US monetary policy. Second, additional controls are
added to our baseline specifications. Third, alternative measures of international bond flows
are used.


7.1    Alternative measures of US monetary policy

The baseline results for the sensitivities to US monetary policy are obtained using the Wu-Xia
(2016) shadow rate measure, which is generated by a discrete time multi-factor term
structure model and assumed to be a linear function of three latent variables which follow a
VAR (1) process. The latent factors and the shadow rate are estimated with the extended
Kalman filter.

       The Wu-Xia (2016) shadow rate has established itself as the preferred measure of the
US monetary policy stance during the post-crisis period. Nevertheless, it is one is several
such measures, each of which has its own advantage and disadvantages (see discussion of
trade-offs by Lemke and Vladu, 2017). We test the robustness of our results by using
alternative measures the US monetary policy stance, re-estimating our benchmark
specifications while replacing the Wu-Xia (2016) shadow rate with alternative shadow rate
estimates by Krippner (2014) and by Bauer and Rudebusch (2016). Furthermore, we also
conduct robustness checks using two-year Treasury bond yields instead of shadow rates.



                                                22
This allows us to test the sensitivity of our main results to replacing the model-based shadow
rates with rates that are based on hard market data (Swanson and Williams (2014)).

       The shadow rate of Krippner (2014) is based on a two state-variable shadow yield
curve model estimated using the iterated extended Kalman filter on month-end US yield
curve data from 1985 with times to maturity spanning 0.25 to 30 years. When estimating
their shadow rate, Bauer and Rudebusch (2016) replace the affine short-rate specification of
standard dynamic term structure models with an identical affine process for an unobserved
shadow short rate. The Wu-Xia shadow rate tends to be in between the two alternative
shadow rates. Table B3 (in Annex B) reports the estimations using the two alternative shadow
rates as well as two-year US Treasury bond rates, showing coefficients that are in line with
the benchmark results obtained using the Wu-Xia shadow policy rate in Table 2.


7.2    Additional controls

Next, we further test the robustness of the results by including additional control variables in
the benchmark specifications. More specifically, the following additional explanatory
variables are inserted into the baseline regressions: lagged growth rates of cross-border
loans or international debt securities; policy rates of the receiving country to account for the
local monetary policy stance; 10-year US rates to account for yield curve effects; exchange
rates vis à vis the US dollar; other advanced economy policy rates. Tables B5 and B6 in
Appendix B contain the results.

       Table B4 presents the results from the alternative specifications, estimated without a
structural break. The sensitivities to US MP are negative and statistically significant, as in the
baseline estimations. The sensitivities to the VIX are also negative and statistically significant
in some, but not in all, cases. This is most likely due to the fact that the data availability
constraints associated with the inclusion of the above additional control variables results in a
considerable reduction (of roughly one third) in the size of the sample

       Table B5 presents the results from the alternative specifications, estimated with a
structural break. The results are qualitatively similar to the ones reported in Table 3 in the
main text. Namely, the sensitivities to US MP increase post-GFC up to the Taper Tantrum and




                                                 23
then revert back to pre-GFC levels. The sensitivities to the VIX are once again negative and
statistically significant before the crisis and insignificant after the crisis.


7.3          Alternative international bond flow measures

Our benchmark regressions use international debt securities from the BIS IDSS as measure of
international bond flows. International debt securities in the IS IDSS are defined as those
issued in a market other than the local market of the country where the borrower resides
(Gruić and Wooldridge, 2012). For most borrowing countries and sectors, the universe of
international debt securities tends to largely overlap with the universe of debt securities held
by external investors. Nevertheless, the match between the above two sets is not always
perfect as securities issued in foreign markets may be purchased and held by domestic
residents, and domestically issued debt securities could be bought by external investors. For
robustness, the international debt securities series used in our benchmark regressions are
replaced with data on portfolio debt from the Balance of Payments, using the quarterly
growth rate of the respective (gross) outstanding IIP stocks. 23 The estimated impacts of US
monetary policy and global uncertainty on portfolio debt flows remain negative and
statistically significant for aggregate flows and their main sectoral (bank and non-bank)
components (Table B6 in Annex B).




8. Conclusions

Significant changes have occurred in the sensitivity to global factors across the two main
components of global liquidity, cross-border bank loans and international debt securities.
The impact of US monetary policy increased dramatically between the GFC and the 2013 Fed
Taper Tantrum and then reverted back to pre-crisis levels. By contrast, the responsiveness of
cross-border loan flows to global risk conditions declined significantly throughout the post-
crisis period.

             The post-crisis fluctuations in the sensitivity of international bank lending flows to US
monetary policy were driven mainly by increases in the sensitivities of individual banking



23
     The exact series from the Balance of Payments is ‘Portfolio Investment Debt, Liabilities’ (Line 79led).

                                                                      24
systems. The latter increases were, in turn, largely driven by the convergence in advanced
economy monetary policies that took place in the immediate aftermath of the GFC. As the
monetary policies of advanced economies started to diverge in 2013, these transitory effects
gradually weakened.

        Conversely, compositional changes were the main drivers of the decline in the
sensitivity of international bank lending to global risk conditions. National banking systems
that were ex-ante better capitalized experienced larger increases in their international
lending shares and smaller increases in sensitivities to global risk. This combination resulted
in a sharp decrease in the overall sensitivity of international bank lending to global risk
conditions. Since both of the above developments are likely to be persistent, so are the
declines in sensitivities to global risk.

        Overall, our analysis demonstrates the dynamism in global liquidity drivers, as well as
in international monetary policy spillovers and risk effects. This dynamism, not previously
explored in depth, is relevant for debates on the use and potential efficacy of capital
regulation and the autonomous use of monetary policy.            Regardless of the degree of
integration with international financial markets, funding flows may be more responsive when
policy cycles of advanced economies are more aligned. Funding flows through global banks
appear to be less volatile for banks with greater capital buffers and for larger banks.

        Last but not least, the results demonstrate that initiatives to make banking systems
more robust in advanced countries, for example through prudential instrument changes and
policies aimed at boosting capitalisation and stable funding levels, have had the positive side
effect of reducing the amplitude of fluctuations in some forms of international capital flows
to both advanced and emerging markets. Such policies can complement borrower country
macro-prudential policies and capital flow management instruments. Open questions still
remain around the behaviour of international debt securities and await both richer data and
more research on these financing flows.

Note: Coefficients are obtained from the baseline model with structural breaks. This model is estimated for each of
the available 29 lending countries (we excluded South Korea for which data are not available in the pre-break
period) and for three different borrowers: banks, public sector and non-banks. We obtain therefore 29*3=87
observations. The lending national banking system weights are expressed in percentage terms. Robust standard
errors in parentheses *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. (1) Prudential measures include loan-to-value ratio caps and
capital requirements. The regulatory stringency index is based on the World Bank’s Bank Regulation and
Supervision Survey. The index takes a value between 0 (least stringent) and 1 (most stringent) based on 18 questions
about bank capital requirements, the legal powers of supervisory agencies, etc. (2) They include the following pre-
break average banking system characteristics: expected default frequency, deposit to total asset ratio and net interest
income over total income. (3) The Q Measure evaluates the level of homogeneity/heterogeneity among studies. It is
calculated as the weighted squared difference of the estimated effects with respect to the mean. The statistical
distribution of this measure follows a χ2 distribution. The null hypothesis of the test assumes homogeneity in the
effect sizes. (4) This percentage represents the magnitude of the level of heterogeneity in effect sizes and it is
defined as the percentage of the residual variation that it is attributable to between study heterogeneity. It is defined
as the difference between the Q measure and the degrees of freedom divided by the Q measure. Although there can
be no absolute rule for when heterogeneity becomes important, Harbord and Higgins (2008) tentatively suggest
adjectives of low for I2 values between 25% and 50%, moderate for 50%-75% and high for values larger than 75%.
(5) τ2 is a measure of population variability in effect sizes. It depends positively on the observed heterogeneity (Q
measure) and its difference with respect to the degrees of freedom. The expected value of Q measure under the null
hypothesis of homogeneity is equal to the degrees of freedom; a homogeneous set of studies will result in this
statistic equal to zero. Under the presence of heterogeneity this estimate should be different from zero.
