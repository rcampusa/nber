               Labor Relations, Wages and Nonwages
               Compensation in Municipal Employment
                            ABSTRACT


In the private sector. 'unionization' typically refers to employees who

are organized, recognized, and covered by contracts, according to the

procedures established by the National Labor Relations Board. The

municipal sector provides an instructive contrast. There. 'unionizationS

encompasses five mutually exclusive combinations of organizational

structure and labor relations practice. These 'modes' form a hierarchy

of employee power, from strongest to weakest: recognized bargaining

units, unrecognized unions in cities which contain other recognized

unions, unorganized employees in cities which contain recognized unions,

unrecognized unions in cities which contain no recognized unions, and

unorganized employees in cities which contain no recognized unions.

Differences in the effects of each mode on compensation for municipal

employees demonstrate differences in the intrinsic strength of different

union institutions..

   Municipal compensation levels are dramatically higher for employees

represented by more powerful modes of unionization, regardless of other

conditions in factor and output markets. Union effects on total compen-

sation, in comparison to its mean, range from 3.8 for unrecognized

unions in cities which contain no recognized bargaining units, to li.8

for recognized bargaining units, themselves.

   In addition, union effects on total compensation are reater than

union effects an wages in all modes. Relative union effects on expendi-

tures for paid time not worked and pension benefits are usually more

than twice wage effects, Union effects on medical benefits re nearly

twice wage effects.

In October i9BO. municipal qovernments had 2,560,516 full- and part-time

employees (Labor-Management Services Administration), or 2.4 of the

American labor force in that month (Economic Report of the President)

More than half of full-time employees. 53.9. were members of unions or

employee associations (Labor-Management Services Administration). The

size of the municipal sector, and the prominence of unions within it,

have stimulated many studies of these unions and their economic ac-
          I
tivity.




   In addition, municipal unions provide several comparisons with

unionization in the private sector. Municipal unions may be able to

exercise greater influence over compensation levels than can unions in

the private sector, because they have political as well as economic

power (Wellington and Winter). That ability may be rarely exercised:

current estimates of union wage effects in municipal employment seem to

be modest in comparison to those in private sector employment, both in

the aggregate (Freeman) and in individual functions (Edwards and Ed-

wards, 1982a)




   Furthermore, municipal unionization also offers a comparison --

unique in the American economy -- between different institutions of
labor relations. The strengths of both municipal and private sector

unions may vary with conditions in product and factor markets. Only

municipal unions vary importantly in strength because of differences in

union structure. The opDortunity to study these differences has been

iqnored in previous work.




   In the private sector, 'unionization' typically refers to employees

who are orqanized, recognized, and covered by contracts, accordinq to

the procedures established by the National Labor Relations Board. Excep-

tions to this characterization are only temporary: new unions still

seeking recognition, and bargaining units whose most recent contract has

lapsed prior to agreement on a successor. Private sector unions are at

once employee associations and representatives of bargaining units. The

bargaining units they represent are legally entitled to binding con-

tracts (Beal, Wickersham and Kienast).




   In the municipal sector, 'unionization' encompasses five mutually

exclusive combinations of organizational structure and labor relations

practice. These 'modes' form a hierarchy of employee power. Municipal

compensation levels are dramatically higher for employees represented by

more powerful modes, regardless of other conditions in factor and output

markets. This paper describes the five modes of municipal labor rela-

tions and estimates the effects of each on total compensation levels,

wages and four types of nonwage compensation.




                -            f
There is no single definition cf unionization' in municipal employment.
Municipal employees may be organized by an employee association which is

not recognized as a bargaining unit. They may be represented by a bar-

gaining unit which is not covered by a contract. They may benefit from

employment by a bargaining city, even if they are members of neither a

bargaining unit nor an employee organization.




   Accordingly, there is no single measure of unionization among

municipal employees. Unfortunately, previous attempts to analyze the

relationship between unionization in the local public sector and

municipal compensation have not successfully differentiated between weak

and powerful union structures. As examples, Ashenfelter, and Edwards and

Edwards (1982b) use only a dummy variable indicating the presence of a

union. Schmenner, Ehrenberg (1973) and Ichniowski use both this variable

and a dummy for the presence of a contract, though only Schmenner uses

them simultaneously. These studies present only polar concepts of

municipal labor relations. Union membership, by itself, is the weakest

form of municipal unionization. The strongest form is represented by an

enforceable union contract.




   These representations, in isolation, ignore two important dimensions

of the relationships between municipal employers and employees. First,

common patterns of municipal organization are intermediate to unioniza-

tion and contractual agreement in sophistication arid   in   union power.

Second, union power is 'additive'; distinctive characteristics of weak

municipal labor relations practices are incorporated into stronger

forms, to whose power they contribute.
   Munc±pai unionization takes on five different forms, each repre-

senting the joint effects of different levels of organization and dif—
                                2
ferent bargaining practices.        Bargaining -is the most important aspect

of municipal labor relations. Employees in individual municipal func-

tions experience one of three bargaining environments; no bargaining, a

barqaininq city or a barqaining function. Nonbarqaininq functions,

regardless of whether their city bargains, may or may not contain

employee organizations.




      Teble i summarizes the levels of organization and the bargaining

practices which define each mode. It also introduces several additional

features of municipal unionization which further distinguish powerful

modes from weak. The distribution of those features across modes

demonstrates that institutions of municipal labor relations become more

sophisticated as bargaining practices become more formal.




      Nonunion functions in nonbargaining cities represent the first,

weakest mode of municipal labor relations. Employees in these functions

are unorganized, and are employed by cities which do not bargain with

any of their employees in any function Table 1 confirms that nonbar-

gaining cities in which nonunion functions are found do not enter into




  2
      State laws impose limits on municipal bargaining and organizational
      practices which may vary. No convenient summary of these laws ex-
      ists. Therefore, the analysis of this paper does not introduce them
      explicitly.

      Employees in bargaining   functions   always   belong to an employee
      associstion.

   Employees who organize, thouqh the                                city     for which they work does not
bargain, belQnq to the second mode -- union functions in nonjarqaininq

cities. Union formation is the first initiative open to employees who

wish to increase their influence. Organized employees may, through

informal interactions with administrators in which their solidarity is

expressed, obtain greater compensation than were they unorganized,

though their union is not legally entitled to bargain.




     Unorganized and organized functions, in conjunction with cities that

bargain, form the bases of modes three and four. Bargaining cities are

those in which at least one bargaining unit is recognized, or in which

unrecognized functions are routinely invited to meet-and-confer discus-

sions.     As indicated in Table 1, bargaining cities have typically

signed binding contracts, as well as memoranda of understanding.




     Nonunion and union functions in bargaining cities represent 39 of

all functions which do not contain a bargaining unit. Employees in these

functions enjoy some of the benefits which accrue to formal nego-

tiations. Some cities may prefer to establish conditions of employment

through a uniform procedure for all functions, whether or not they are

legally entitled to bargain. Many cities may offer unrecognized func-

tions conditions which are similar to those obtained by recognized




     Most cities that meet this definition do so because a bargaining
     unit has been recognized.

     The Surveys of Government, from which these data are taken, report
     only total contracts per city. They do not identify the functions
     with which contracts are signed.
 6
     The observations in these modes disproportionately represent sanita-
     tion departments. They may regularly profit from the activities of
functions, in order to forestall organization and rec.oqnition drives.

In either case, compensation levels for municipal employees in nonbar

gaining functions are increased because other functions bargain.




         Bargaining functions --   the   fifth mode of municipal labor relations

--
         represent   the apex of employee power. Employees in these functions

are organized, their unions are recognized, and they are entitled to

legally enforceable contracts.            These functions are ordinarily respon-

sible for the contracts signed by cities in which they are contained.

Their employees have greater influence than any others over municipal

compensation levels.




      Table 1 lists the defining characteristic of bargaining functions,

the presence of a bargaining unit. This table also reveals that recogni-

tion may entail more than the presence of a single bargaining unit.

Municipal bargaining units vary widely in their scope. The broadest

units include all workers in a function, and their supervisors, as well.

Units with more narrow definitions may exclude supervisors, and may even

exclude other 'rank—and-file' employees within the same function. In

this latter case, several such units may coexist. The union status of

supervisors and the presence of multiple bargaining units define dis-

tinctions between municipal employees. These distinctions offer

strategic opportunities in negotiation to both employer and employee.

functions in which a bargaining unit is present.          These functions

represent approximately one-sixth of the total. The influence and

sophistication of municipal bargaining units may be increased by the

inclusion of supervisory staff. However, their exclusion from municipal

management may indicate that function employees are alienated from the

city administration. The net effect of supervisor representation on

municipal compensation levels depends on the relative strengths of these

         Twelve percent of all functions, or nearly one-quarter of functions

with bargaining units, harbor more than one bargaining unit.          Municipal

employees at different grade levels may demand separate bargaining

units, for two reasons. First, they reinforce professional hierarchies.

Second, multiple bargaining units create opportunities for negotiations

with different units to demand escalating concessions under the rubric

of 'comparability'. Municipal employers may welcome multiple bargaining

units as presenting opportunities to reduce employee solidarity. As with

supervisory representation, the net effect of mulitiple bargaining units

on municipal compensation depends on the relative advantages of com-

parability over solidarity.

Regression estimates of compensation levels which account for many of
their determinants, in addition to labor relations practices,

demonstrate the effects of municipal unionization predicted above. All

important measures of compensation per hour worked increase with in-

creased engagement in bargaining activity. At any level of bargaining.

compensation is higher in organized than in unorganized functions.

'Union compensation effects' increase monotonically across the five

modes for all measures of compensation with the exception of miscel-

laneous benefits.




   The analysis in this section tests the models of municipal labor

relations presented above against the relationships between union

characteristics and compensation levels observed in a large sample of

functions from American cities. This sample is a pooled cross-section

time-series of function-years. Each observation represents one of four

functions (police, fire, sanitation and an aggregate of all other non-

educational functions) in one of three years (1975. 1977 and 1979), in
                      10
one of 889 cities.




      Total compensation per hour worked in this sample is comprised of

five components; wages, paid time not worked, medical benefits, pension

benefits and miscellaneous benefits. Levels of these compensation

measures depend upon characteristics of demand for municipal services,

supply of municipal services, and labor supply, as well as characteris—

tics of labor relations. OLS equations discussed here take total compen—

sation and its five components as dependent, and measures of all these

determinants as independent, so as to distinguish their influences. 11

These equations account for compensation determinants other than union

status with thirty-nine measures of population characteristics, alterna-

tive employment opportunities, government structure, function,

qeographic area, and year of observation.




      ?!easures of the eight labor relations characteristics presented in

Table 1 represent union status in these equations. Four variables --      the
percent of employees belonging to employee associations, the presence

and number of bargaining units, and the union status of supervisors --

      A description of the sample, a complete list of variables, the
      complete regressions and their summary statistics comprise the
      Appendix to this paper. Zax (1984a) discusses these matters further.

      The compensation packages analyzed here are measured in unusual
      detail. Previous attempts to estimate the effects of local public
      sector unionization on nonwage compensation have relied upon single,
      aggregate measures of expenditure. Ichniowski measures fringe
      benefits as "city contribution to employees' retirement benefits and
      insurance programs". Edwards and Edwards (1982b) use an expanded
      measure which additionally includes vacation and sick pay. Bartel
      and Lewin use the difference between total expenditures for person-
      nel costs and total expenditures for salaries, presumably a number
      which is similar to that of Ichniowski,

within the city as a whole.        One variable measures the interaction

between city-wide practices and union status within functions; an in-

   The coefficients for these eight variables are presented in Table

They are the basis for the aggregate estimates of mode-specific compen-

sation effects with which this analysis culminates. As a preliminary to

these estimates, the effects of individual union characteristics are

worthy of some notice in their own right. Bargaining practices are more

important than any other aspect of municipal unionization in the deter—

mination of municipal compensation levels. Organization is important in

its own right, as well as a precursor to recognition and bargaining.

Municipal unionization usually elicits larger relative increases in

      percent covered for individual functions.

      Coefficient estimates for union variables in this specification are
      subject to potential biases arising from two different considera-
      tions. First, current compensation levels and current union status
      may he chosen simultaneously. This bias is limited, here, because
      union variables are measured in the year prior to that in which
      compensation measures are made. Second, past compensation levels may
      determine both current union status and current compensation. This
      specification would spuriously attribute the effects of past on
      current compensation to current union status. However, if current
      unionization is due to low levels of past compensation, such at-
      tribution would yield underestimates of union compensation effects.
      Effects reported here would be lower bounds. Both sources of bias
      are probably best dealt with in panel data sets. Bartel and Lewin
      attempt to deal explicitly with these issues in a cross-section
      context.

work bargains.                  Bargaining cities increase total compensation for

nonbargaining functions by .29 .                               Total    compensation increases by $.042

with each increment of ten percentage points in the proportion of

      Municipal union compensation effects are seriously underestimated if


      pensation for all compensation measures with the exception of medi-
      cal benefits.
 15
      Alternative estimations, not reported here1 demonstrate that the
      effects of percent organized on compensation levels are estimated at
      twice their true magnitudes and significance if equations do not
      include variables for the presence of bargaining units and a bar-
      gaining environment, Estimates derived from these incorrect
      specifications notably exaggerate the actual power of organization.
their effects on nonwage compensation components are ignored. Bargajniriq

functions and bargaining cities display marked preferences for nonwage

compensation. Only 4O of their effects on total compensation are allo-

cated to wages. Thirty—three percent take the form of additional paid

time not worked. Twenty-two percent take the form of increased pension

benefits. Organization, in itself, emphasizes nonwage compensation less.

Even so, 39? of the union effect on total compensation is attributable

to union effects on nonwage components, while these components comprise

only 28 of the total, on average.




   Previous analyses of municipal union compensation effects draw

similar conclusions, though they employ less sophisticated measures of

unionization and nonwage compensation. Hall and Vanderportea estimate

that the practice of collective bargaining has greater impact on compen-

sation levels than do signed contracts. Ehrenberg and Goldstein --     in
analogy to the effects of bargaining cities --   find   that compensation

levels within function depend upon unionization in other functions.

Ichniowski, and Edwards and Edwards (1982b) estimate greater municipal

union effects on nonwaqe than on wags compensation.




   These individual effects are interesting, but the principle theme of

this paper is that individual union characteristics do not exist in

isolation. Tables 4 and 5 combine the coefficients of Table 3 arid mode-

specific mean values for labor relations variables from Table I to

construct estimates of compensation effects for each of the five pos-

      Modes of municipal unionization vary in their efects on compensa-
      tion levels because they represent different assortments of union
      characteristics, not because these characteristics have effects
      which vary. F-tests reject singly and jointly, the hypotheses of
      different effects in different modes, for all five measures of labor
      relations which appear in more than one mode; percent organized,
      bargaining environment, contracts, memoranda and percent covered.
outcome i.




      Functions in all modes which include organization or barqaining

obtain increases in total compensation, compared to levels in mode one,

nonunion functions of nonbargaining cities. All components of compensa-

tion, with the exception of miscellaneous benefits, are increased, as

well. Absolute union effects on all but one measure of compensation

increase across modes. Again, miscellaneous benefits provide the sole

exception.




      These estimates provide three interesting comparisons between the

power of union functions and barqaining cities. Union functions achieve

larger compensation increases in bargaining than in nonbargaining cities
--    effects   in mode four exceed those in mode two. Compensation is higher

for nonunion functions in bargaining cities than in union functions in

nonbargaining cities        effects in mode three exceed those in mode two.

Organization and bargaining cities reinforce each other --     their   ioint

impacts, as estimated for mode four, exceed the sum of their individual

effects in modes two and three.




      Table 5 restates these absolute union effects as percentages of mode-

specific means. The same patterns reappear: relative effects increase in

      Where comparable, these effects are consistent with the range of
      effects summarized in Freeman, and Ehrenberq and Schwarz Total
      compensation effects in modes two and five are representative of the

                             III.   Conclusion




Municipal   labor relations are conducted under one of five mutually

exclusive modes. These modes form a hierarchy of employee power. Union

effects on total compensation and all its components are uniformly

greater in more powerful modes. In particular, union compensation ef-

fects increase as bargaining practices become more formal. Union wage

effects are uniformly smaller than are union effects on any other com-

ponent of compensation, in all modes.




   These results demonstrate that outcomes in municipal labor markets

depend significantly upon the level at which municipal unions par-

ticipate. That participation may have several aspects. Compensation

increases associated with municipal unionization are explicable in terms

of supply restrictions, but other evidence indicates that strong unions

can increase employment, as well (Zax). Together, these results suggest

that municipal unions can also alter the conditions of demand for

municipal output, thereby altering the demand for their own services. In

addition, intermode differences in union strength do not explain all

intermode differences in compensation levels. They may be more corn-
pletely explained by interactions between labor relations mode and other

determinants of labor market outcomes, such as that with structure of

municipal   government (Zax).




   These results are provocative, but they do not constitute a complete

explanation of municipal union behavior. That.   explanation   requires more

comprehensive empirical models which treat compensation, employment and

union status simultaneously. Comparisons between function-specific union

effects may provide the best perspectives on interactions between

employee unionization, publicness and politicization of output. On the

evidence accumulated to this point, these further studies are worth

pursuing.

The municipal labor market measures analyzed here are drawn from three

identical surveys of municipal employment and compensation, conducted in

17 1q77 ,rr4 qq (nr d P4tt ind nd v?,enR rnr4
Lufkin).   These surveys report numbers of full-time employees, standard

work schedules, paid time not worked, and fifteen categories of compen-

sation expenditures for employees in police, fire, sanitation, and all

other noneducational departments. Eight hundred and eighty nine cities

provide complete records for at least one function in one year.




   The observations in this study consist of labor market outcomes in

one function, in one year. These observations are pooled across the

three survey years, and across the four functions. The sample which

results contains 5629 function-years.




   Several sources provide the variables which appear in this analysis.

The Municipal Yearbook, 1978 (ICMA) reports government structure for

each of the cities in this sample. Censuses of Population and Housing,

1970 and 1980, publish characteristics of city residents and city hous-

ing stock. Data from these sources are specific to individual cities,

but do not vary over functions or years. Annual Surveys of Government

record the characteristics of municipal labor relations. Three of these
measures are specific to each city in each year. Five are observed in

each   function, in each of the three years.




   The complete sample yields six dependent measures of municipal com-

pensation levels and 47 independent variables. The compensation measures

are total compensation, wage payments, payments for time not worked,

expenditures on medical benefits, expenditures on pension benefits, and

expenditures on miscellaneous benefits per hour worked. By definition,

the five component measures sum to the total.




   Compensation is measured as municipal expenditures rather than

employee income. This distinction is important with regard to nonwaqe

compensation components. In particular, the relationship between pension

expenditures and pension liabilities is not reported.
