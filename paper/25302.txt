The present study builds on the insights of two papers that were concurrently written: Beerli and
Peri (2018) and Ruffner and Siegenthaler (2017). The first paper analyzed the employment, wage,
mobility and occupational specialization effects of the labor market liberalization in Switzerland.
The second studied the firm-level impact of the same reform, establishing its effects on the
employment of foreigners within firms and on size, productivity, innovation, location and staffing
decisions of firms. We are indebted to the editor and three referees for unusually helpful

We study a reform that granted European cross-border workers free access to the Swiss labor
market and had a stronger effect on regions close to the border. The greater availability of cross-
border workers increased foreign employment substantially. Although many cross-border
workers were highly educated, wages of highly educated natives increased. The reason is a
simultaneous increase in labor demand: the reform increased the size, productivity, and
innovation performance of skill-intensive incumbent firms and attracted new firms, creating
opportunities for natives to pursue managerial jobs. These effects are mainly driven by firms that
reported skill shortages before the reform.

1       Introduction
Policies that open the labor market to foreigners are often opposed by na-
tives on the ground that they could harm their labor market opportunities.
Yet, free mobility of workers means more opportunities for businesses to
hire a wider variety of skills. Firms usually welcome a less restricted access
to foreign workers.1 If firms benefit from open borders through increased
productivity and growth, this may counteract the effects of increased la-
bor market competition and expand job opportunities for native workers.
However, our knowledge on how immigration policies affect firms’ success,
and whether such effects shape the labor market effects of immigration, is
limited. This study attempts to extend our knowledge on the labor market
effects of and firms’ responses to opening the border.
    We study a far-reaching and controversial policy change: the complete
removal of all immigration restrictions for workers from the European Union
(EU) in Switzerland when the latter introduced the principle of the “free
movement of persons.” This principle allows EU citizens to access jobs with
no restrictions within the territory of member states. This paper analyzes
the consequences of one central aspect of the reform: the removal of all pre-
existing restrictions on European cross-border workers (CBW). CBW are
employed in Switzerland, live in its neighboring countries (Italy, Germany,
Austria and France), and commute across the border for work. CBW were
already a sizable group in Swiss regions near the border prior to the policy
changes. However, there were several administrative hurdles to hiring them.
For example, CBW were subject to a bureaucratic process that aimed at
ensuring that firms only hire them if they did not find an equally qualified
resident worker (the so called priority requirement). These prior restrictions
were gradually abolished after the announcement of the reform in 1999. The
priority requirement was abolished in 2004, and CBW thus gained free access
    1
     In a survey by BAK (2013), 75% of all employers in Switzerland, the country analyzed
in this paper, consider access to foreign workers as “important,” “very important,” or even
“indispensable” for their competitiveness and profits.

to Swiss labor markets close to the border.
    How did the greater availability of CBW affect Swiss workers and firms?
To study this question, we leverage the fact that the greater availability of
CBW had stronger effects on firms and native workers close to the border. In
locations farther than 30 minutes driving distance from the border, employ-
ment of CBW remained negligible. One reason is that CBW could not be
employed outside the so-called “border region” until 2007—a clearly defined
set of municipalities close to the border. Another reason is that CBW rarely
work in places located far away from the border simply because they are
commuters from abroad and not residents of Switzerland. Empirically, we
thus compare changes in outcomes in labor markets close to the border with
changes in outcomes in labor markets further away from it, distinguishing
a pre-treatment (before 1999), a transitional (1999–2003), and a free move-
ment phase (2004 onward). This Difference-in-Differences (DiD) strategy has
important advantages compared to many previous studies in the immigra-
tion literature because both the increase in the availability of foreign workers
and its uneven regional impact are a direct consequence of the exogenous
change in the policy related to CBW.2 Our analyses are based on data from
a large-scale employer survey conducted between 1994 and 2010, micro-level
panel data from the Business Censuses 1991–2011 covering the universe of
Swiss establishments, and a series of innovation surveys conducted between
1996 and 2013.
    We first show that, between 1999 and 2010, the labor market liberal-
ization for CBW produced a net increase of foreign workers equal to 10
percentage points of the total 1998 employment in municipalities within 15
minutes travel time to the border. The increase was most pronounced in the


   2
     Studies on the firm and labor market effects of immigration are typically based on the
so-called area approach, and isolate supply-driven variation in immigration into regional
labor markets by applying a ”shift-share” instrumental variable approach. The approach
hinges on the assumption that historical immigrant settlement patterns are uncorrelated
to the regional distribution of current unobserved labor demand shocks. This assumption
is not always plausible (see Jaeger et al., 2019, for a discussion).

                                            2
post-2004 period and two thirds of all new CBW were highly educated. We
also observe a small disproportionate increase in employment of permanent
resident immigrants close to the border. While Switzerland also removed all
barriers for EU immigrants when introducing free movement of persons, this
aspect of the reform affected all regions uniformly, independently of their
distance to the national border. The finding thus suggests that the greater
availability of CBW complemented and crowded in resident immigrants from
EU countries.
   We then document that the greater availability of CBW did not have
a statistically significant negative effect on average employment or wages
of Swiss native workers. In fact, we find that the reform increased wages of
highly educated native workers by around 5%. If anything, their employment
increased as well. As many of the incoming workers were highly educated,
these results cannot be rationalized by a simple model with high- and low-
skilled labor in which immigration represents a pure supply shift (as in,
e.g., Borjas, 2003). They are also striking considering that CBW almost
certainly generate weaker consumption-side effects (on demand for local non-
tradable services) than normal immigrants because they do not relocate to
Switzerland.
   Based on a search and matching framework with heterogeneous labor,
we argue that a greater availability of CBW can have limited displacement
effects because it may make it easier for firms to find certain skilled workers
that were hard to find before, thus generating incentives to create new jobs
for skilled workers. In such a framework, the positive wage effects on highly
educated natives can be rationalized if the policy additionally increased pro-
ductivity, innovation performance, or capital formation of firms.
   We present four pieces of evidence in line with these predictions. First,
we show that the inflow of CBW was largest in high-tech manufacturing and
the knowledge-intensive business service sector—i.e. industries that depend
on the availability of skilled workers. We find that the positive wage ef-


                                      3
fects on natives are nevertheless concentrated in these skill-intensive sectors
because the reform increased labor productivity of incumbent firms in the
sectors. Second, we show that the reform boosted firm expansion by relax-
ing prior constraints to recruit skilled workers. In particular, we observe
substantial gains in labor productivity in incumbent firms that reported to
be constrained by a lack of specialized personnel or limited by labor mar-
ket regulation for foreign workers before the reform. Third, we show that
the free movement policy increased R&D employment, patent applications,
and product innovations. Again, these effects are concentrated in firms that
reported scarcity of R&D workers before the reform. Fourth, we find evi-
dence for relatively quick capital adjustments to immigration: the share of
new establishments increased by 4 percentage points in the regions closest
to the border. In sum, these firm effects created opportunities for natives to
grow professionally and their likelihood to work in top managerial positions
increased. These transitions into high-paying management explain roughly
one third of the positive wage effects for highly educated natives.
   We provide a large set of robustness checks that corroborate the causal
interpretation of these findings. Most importantly, we show that our re-
sults are not driven by firms and industries that were most affected from the
trade liberalizations between Switzerland and the EU that occurred largely
simultaneously with the changes in the commuting policy. We also discuss
whether regions close to the border may have partly grown at the expense
of regions further away. Indeed, some of our firm-level findings are consis-
tent with such an interpretation. However, we do not find evidence for a
systematic mobility response of natives that would likely arise if one region
benefited at the expense of other regions. Although these results are no ul-
timate empirical proof, they reduce concerns that our DiD estimates mainly
reflect relative rather than absolute causal effects.
   Ours is one of the first studies exploiting changes in policies for cross-

border commuters to study the effects of immigration.3 The closest precursor
to this paper is Dustmann et al. (2017) who analyze the labor market effects
of the opening of Germany’s labor market to Czech CBW workers in 1991.
Dustmann et al. (2017) show that the inflow of Czech workers had strong
negative short-run effects on native employment and smaller but significant
negative effects on native wages. We believe that the strikingly different con-
sequences for natives of the opening of the German labor market are due to
differences in the design and in economic circumstances of the policy change
compared to the one in Switzerland. First, the Czech inflow was mainly
composed of less-educated workers hired in relatively low-skill-intensive in-
dustries. In contrast, many new CBW in the Swiss case were highly skilled,
and the beneficial effects on natives arose in industries dependent on skilled
workers. Second, the policy change in Germany was unexpected, affected
regions that had not experienced significant immigrant inflows previously
and that had a less developed industrial structure. In contrast, the Swiss
policy change was announced early and phased-in gradually, and it had the
strongest impact on regions that were used to foreign workers and had a
more competitive industry structure. Presumably, the firms were more pre-
pared to match the new workers to jobs in an efficient way. Finally, the
episode studied by Dustmann et al. (2017) took place when both Germany
and the Czech Republic underwent a major economic transition. In contrast,
Switzerland opened its labor market at a time when the unemployment rate
was very low and demand for skilled workers was high. Relaxing the con-
straints on the supply of skilled workers appears to have benefited firms that
had suffered from lack of skilled labor before the reform.
    This paper makes four main contributions to the literature. First, it
shows that firms’ responses to changes in the availability of skilled labor
determine the labor market effects of opening the border. Our labor market

   3
      The idea to exploit the changes in Switzerland’s commuting policies to study the
effects of immigration was also pioneered in two policy reports by Henneberger and Ziegler
(2011) and Losa et al. (2014).

                                            5
findings can only be rationalized when accounting for firms’ productivity,
capital investment, innovation and specialization responses. So far, “there is
very little tradition for considering firms in analyses of immigration” (Kerr
et al., 2015, p. S148). In fact, very few previous papers analyzed firm and
labor market effects of immigration jointly.4 Second, our study is one of the
first to rigorously evaluate the consequences of a policy that permanently
removed all barriers to labor market access for (a group of) foreign workers.
Our variation is thus different to many other quasi-experimental papers that
focus on temporary push-driven surges in immigration such as the Mariel
Boatlift where a large number of immigrants are exogenously placed in spe-
cific local labor markets. In contrast, the permanent change in immigration
policy analyzed here rather leads to a gradual matching of new CBW to jobs
in Switzerland, and plausibly has a strong direct effect on firms’ incentives
to create jobs. Third, our study directly informs policy makers about the
potential economic benefits of the principle of free movement of persons.
This is highly relevant against the background of mounting opposition to
free labor mobility in Europe, which culminated in 2016 with Britain’s deci-
sion to leave the EU. Fourth, our study contributes to the literature on the
impacts of skilled immigration on productivity, innovation, and production
technology in the receiving country (see Kerr et al., 2015, for an overview).
Studies at the regional level (e.g., Hunt and Gauthier-Loiselle, 2010; Peri
et al., 2015a,b) or that focus on inventors (Moser et al., 2014) tend to find
positive impacts on productivity and innovation. Firm-level studies examin-
ing these links are still rare, focus mostly on the US5 , and reach conflicting
conclusions.6

      Examples of empirical papers that study the labor market and firm effects of immi-
gration jointly include Dustmann and Glitz (2015) and Aksu et al. (2018). Waugh (2018)
provides a theoretical analysis how the dynamics of the firm affect economic outcomes
from changes in immigration policy.

      The exceptions are Paserman (2013), who examines how immigration from the former
Soviet Union affected Israeli manufacturing firms in the 1990s, and Mitaritonna et al.

French manufacturers.

2      The immigration reform
The process of opening the Swiss labor market to citizens from the EU
started with the signing of the bilateral agreements between the EU and
Switzerland on June 21, 1999. The so called “Agreement on the Free Move-
ment of Persons” (AFMP) introduced free worker mobility among the signing
countries. The relevant details of this agreement were publicly announced
in Switzerland in late 1998. The agreement was then discussed by the Swiss
parliament. After the treaty had been signed, it required the approval of the
Swiss electorate, which accepted it in a national referendum in May 2000
with an approval rate of 67.2%. The European parliament and each EU
member state also approved the treaty in year 2000. The AFMP was en-
acted in June 2002, one-and-a-half years later than planned at the time of
the first announcement. Given the timing of the reform, anticipatory effects
of the reform are possible from 1999 onward.7 Given the political circum-
stances, it appears very unlikely that the local economic conditions of the
regions most affected by the agreements were a consideration in the timing
and the content of the treaty.8
    Table 1 provides a time-line for the stepwise introduction of free move-
ment of persons. The table distinguishes three reform phases (the pre-reform,

results in Ghosh et al. (2014) and Kerr and Lincoln (2010) suggest that greater access
to H-1B workers generally increases the size, productivity, and innovation performance
of firms that rely heavily on H-1B visas. Doran et al. (2015), on the other hand, find
that winning an additional H-1B worker has no effect on patenting and firm size but
increases profits and crowds out resident workers. Kerr et al. (2015) find that hiring
young skilled immigrants increases firms’ skill intensity but their evidence regarding firm
size is inconclusive. Similarly, Olney (2013) finds little impact of (low-skilled) immigration
on employment within existing establishments.
     7
       The relevant details of the reform were not public knowledge before 1998 and the
success of the negotiations was uncertain prior to a breakthrough achieved only in 1998.
In fact, even in 1997 and early 1998, several members of the Swiss parliament expressed
their concerns that the negotiations could fail.
     8
       One reason is that the federal government, not the cantons, negotiated over the
AFMP. Another reason is that introducing the free movement of persons was not cham-
pioned by the Swiss government but a political concession to the EU. At the beginning of
the negotiations in 1993 that led to these agreements, the Swiss government tried to avoid
a full-fledged version of free worker mobility. As the EU insisted on full labor mobility, a
breakthrough in the negotiations was only reached when both parties agreed that the free
labor mobility would be implemented step-wise and included further safety measures.

       ers: permanent resident immigrants (or immigrants for short) and CBW.
       The shading of the table highlights the restrictiveness of the regulations for
       the respective worker category. The table shows that permanent resident
       immigrants from EU countries had been subject to yearly national quotas
       set by the federal government before the reform and to an admission process
       very similar to the one for CBW detailed below. These restrictions were
       removed starting in 2002. EU immigrants gained free and full access to the
       Swiss labor market with the abolition of annual quotas in 2007. Legally,
       these changes affected all regions in Switzerland equally.
            The table also shows the timing for lifting the barriers on hiring and
       employment of CBW. These changes only affected municipalities in the bor-
       der region (BR) in the years between 1999 and 2004. The reason is that
       employment of CBW remained restricted to BR until 2007, as it was be-
       fore the reform. Figure 1 illustrates the geographical split of Switzerland
       into the BR (in grey) and the rest of Switzerland, the non-border region
       (NBR, in white). The BR had been defined in bilateral agreements between
       Switzerland and its neighboring countries signed between 1928 and 1973.
       The frontier between BR and NBR remained unchanged in the course of the
       reform and it does not follow cultural or religious border, nor cantonal or

    The liberalizations for CBW within the BR occurred in two steps. In the
transition phase that started in 1999, cantonal offices, which were respon-
sible for handling applications for CBW, gained more discretion for doing
so. Anecdotally, they exploited this to handle CBW applications in a less
stringent manner.9 Several former restrictions were lifted in 2002. First, the
recruitment area for CBW was expanded to the entire neighboring countries
of Switzerland. Prior to 2002, Swiss firms could only hire CBW who had
lived for at least six months in specific municipalities close to the border to
Switzerland. Hence, the change effectively allowed workers from the interior
of a neighboring country to migrate to the Swiss border to take advantage
of the labor market access. Second, new cross-border permits were now gen-
erally valid for five years and no longer linked to a specific job. Before 2002,
cross-border permits were formally limited to one year and ended with the
    9
     Conversations with representatives from cantonal immigration offices revealed that
there was a more relaxed handling of new CBW applications after 1999, and particularly
after the national referendum on May 21, 2000, as it was clear that eventually CBW would
be the first to gain unrestricted access to the BR.

termination of a work contract, restricting the geographical and occupational
mobility of CBW. Third, CBW were only required to commute to their place
of residence weekly rather than daily. They were also granted the right to
search for housing in Switzerland.
    The free movement phase began in mid-2004 when firms in the BR gained
full and free access to CBW. Switzerland dropped any bureaucratic admis-
sion process for CBW that had been in place before. In particular, Swiss
firms had to provide evidence that they had not found, “within an appropri-
ate period of time,” resident workers who were willing and capable of filling
their vacancies. This regulation called the “priority requirement” imposed
a direct recruitment costs for firms hiring CBW, by requiring them to go
through a relatively lengthy admission process.10 In June 2004, hiring CBW
in the BR became as easy as hiring Swiss workers.
    The number of CBW employed in the BR increased substantially in the
years of the liberalization. Importantly, this increase in CBW was strongly
concentrated in labor markets close to the border. Figure 2 uses data from
the Swiss Earnings Structure Surveys to plot the share of CBW in total
employment separately for the BR and the NBR. Municipalities are grouped
into bins of 5 minutes travel-time by car to the nearest border crossing. The
figure shows that CBW were almost exclusively employed in municipalities in
the BR between 0 and 30 minutes from the border, both before and after the
reform. The figure also reveals the change in the employment share of CBW
over time. The change was very small and sometimes even negative in the
pre-liberalization period (i.e. between 1994 and 1998). During the transition
  10
     When hiring a CBW, firms had to prepare an application detailing the job require-
ments of their vacancy and the working and contract conditions offered. Moreover, firms
had to provide proof that they had searched unsuccessfully for a worker within Switzer-
land for a certain number of weeks. The application had to be sent to the cantonal and
federal migration offices. The processing of the application lasted about one to three
months. The migration offices evaluated each application individually, notably by com-
paring the job requirements with information on the qualifications of residents registered
as unemployed. Today, the direct costs for Swiss firms to recruit workers from outside
the EU are estimated to be about ten to twenty times larger than those for recruiting EU
workers (B,S,S. Volkswirtschaftliche Beratung, 2013). This is relevant, as hiring non-EU
workers is regulated similarly today as hiring CBW before the reform.

                                           10
period (1999–2003), the share increased slightly, but only in municipalities
close to the border. The increase in the share is largest in the free movement
phase (i.e. between 2004 and 2010), and it is larger closer to the border. It
is essentially zero in municipalities that are more than 30 minutes away from
the border. We also show the increase in the employment share of CBW in
the NBR (panel B of Figure 2) between 2004 and 2010, but this increase is
quantitatively very small.
    We thus focus on firms and municipalities close to the border within the
BR. Due to the limited employment of CBW in the NBR, we do not exploit
the switch from no to free access for CBW in the NBR in 2007. To allow
for transparent empirical analyses, we analyze the reform by partitioning
Switzerland into four regions.11 Based on the evidence in Figure 2, munici-
palities and firms located 0–15 minutes away from the border are considered
as strongly treated; those between 15 and 30 minutes as weakly treated; and
firms and municipalities over 30 minutes within the BR and those in the
NBR will form the two control groups NBR. Since both control areas are of-
ficially treated (one in 2004 and one in 2007), our estimates are, if anything,
biased downwards if the policy had effects on regions located more than 30
minutes away from the border. In general, we present the main results using
either of the two control groups because there are no strong a priori reasons
to prefer one control group over the other.
    Three features of the AFMP have important implications for our research
design and the interpretation of our results. First, the AFMP was part of a
package of seven agreements negotiated at the same time. In general, these
other bilateral agreements pertained to harmonizations in specialized fields
(e.g. air and land traffic, agriculture, or research cooperation) that likely had
very limited effects on the outcomes that we study in this paper.12 However,

   11
      In Beerli and Peri (2018) and Ruffner and Siegenthaler (2017), we show that the
results are similar if we use finer intervals and differently defined regions, or if we exploit
the continuous nature of the travel distance.
   12
      This also holds for the agreement pertaining to research cooperation, which laid the
foundation for Switzerland’s full participation in the research framework programs of the

Notes: The figure plots the number of cross-border workers relative to total employment in
1994, 1998, 2004 and 2010 separately for the border region (panel A) and the non-border
region (panel B). Municipalities are grouped into bins of 5 minutes according to their travel
time by car to the next border crossing. Bins with very a small number of total workers
are omitted, i.e. those with travel time above 50 minutes in the border region and those
between 13 and 30 minutes in the non-border region. SESS data.
one agreement reduced non-tariff barriers to trade between Switzerland and
the EU. It is conceivable that these trade liberalizations affected regions
close to the border more than the regions further away. A central goal of
our robustness checks is to demonstrate that the effects identified with our
strategy are not driven by this simultaneous policy change.
                                        Second, the AFMP also lifted all restrictions for Swiss residents to work
in neighboring countries. Yet, the change in employment of CBW in Switzer-
land was about nine times larger than the change of CBW from Switzerland
working in neighboring countries. This reflects the much higher nominal
wages and cost of living in Switzerland that make it very unattractive to live
in Switzerland while working abroad.13 Our analyses thus abstract from the

EU. The programs are targeted to scientific institutions. Moreover, the agreement merely
formalized Switzerland’s former affiliation within the program, and thus had limited im-
pact on research contributions to Swiss institutions. The impacts of the agreement on
private-sector innovation outcomes in our sample period are thus likely very limited.
   13
      See Table A.2 in the appendix. Data from the Eurostat/OECD purchasing power
parities (PPP) program suggest that consumer prices were between 23% (France) to 34%
(Germany) lower in neighboring countries compared with Switzerland in 2009. Eurostat’s
labor cost survey in 2012 suggests that nominal wage costs per hour are between 33%
(France) to 46% (Italy) lower in neighboring countries.

                                                                                               12
fact that the reform lifted restrictions on Swiss CBW.
    Third, we interpret the reform as increasing the availability of CBW in
regions close to the border. This is not equivalent to interpreting the reform
as an increase in the supply of CBW. The reform also plausibly affected the
CBW already working in Switzerland prior to the reform, as these CBW
enjoyed increased geographical and occupational mobility. Moreover, as any
reform that reduces restrictions on labor mobility, the reform plausibly in-
creased the ease with which firms could find skilled workers and reduced
the probability that firms perceived to be limited by labor market regula-
tion in hiring foreign workers, as shown below. Therefore, the reform likely
had a direct impact on firms’ incentives to create jobs (see section 6). An-
other implication is that we focus on the reduced-form effects of the reform
throughout—the extent to which permanently opening the labor market for
CBW affected resident workers and firms—and abstain from presenting IV
estimates that scale the reduced-form effects with the effect on the employ-
ment share of CBW. Such IV estimates would entail an interpretation of the
coefficients as impact of labor supply changes.

3     Data and empirical strategy
3.1    Data
Our empirical analyses are based on three data sets (Table A.1 in the ap-
pendix provides an overview). The main data sources for the labor market
analysis are the Swiss Earnings Structure Surveys (SESS). The Swiss Fed-
eral Statistical Office (FSO) has conducted these surveys every two years
since 1994. They are a stratified random sample of private and public firms
with at least three full-time equivalent (FTE) workers from the manufac-
turing and service sectors, covering between 16.6% (1996) and 50% (2010)
of total employment in Switzerland. The data include detailed informa-
tion about workers, their wages and full-time equivalents, their demographic
characteristics, and their place of work. We focus on individuals aged 18–65,


                                     13
working in the private sector, with non-missing information for nationality,
place of work, education, wages, full-time equivalents, and some other basic
demographics.14 Based on information about workers’ residency permits,
we distinguish between native workers—those with Swiss nationality either
born in Switzerland or naturalized—, foreign-born workers with a residency
permit which we call resident immigrants I, and CBW. Using the SSES,
we analyze the reform effects on the number of cross-border and foreign-
born workers as a share of total employment, and the effects on full-time
equivalents and real hourly wages of natives. We define workers with ter-
tiary education as being highly educated. Workers with completed secondary
education (such an apprenticeship) and those with primary education are
combined in a group of lower educated.15
    Our second data source consist of seven waves of the Swiss Business
Censuses (BC) conducted in 1991, 1995, 1998, 2001, 2005, 2008, and 2011 by
the FSO in October. The BC constitute a panel dataset covering the universe
of private and public establishments in Switzerland. Approximately 4 million
employed persons in 389,000 workplaces are included in the census of 2008.
The data provide us with information on the size (FTE employment) and the
exact geographical location (geographic coordinates) of all establishments in
Switzerland. Until 2008, the censuses were based on mandatory surveys. In
2011, the census was constructed from register data.
    The third data source is the innovation surveys (IS) of the KOF Swiss
Economic Institute. These surveys were conducted among Swiss companies
between 1996 and 2013 in seven waves. All surveys are based on a repre-
sentative sample of private-sector firms with at least five FTE employees.
The surveys are stratified with respect to firm size and two-digit industry

   14
      Appendix B.1 contains a detailed discussion of the sample construction for the labor
market analysis.
   15
      There are some a priori reasons to show separate results for these two subgroups.
This is the approach followed in Beerli and Peri (2018). For brevity and because of the
similarity of the labor market results, we decided to pool the two subgroups in this version.
Indeed, previous research suggests that these two subgroups are closely substitutable
(Gerfin and Kaiser, 2010; Müller and Graf, 2015).

                                             14
affiliation. The IS provide very detailed information on the characteristics
of the surveyed firms and a rich set of outcomes such as value added and
the number of patent applications filed. However, the data cover only a rel-
atively small sample of firms per wave, and have the some of the limitations
of voluntary surveys such as reporting errors, attrition and non-response.
The average response rate across all surveys is 35%. In addition, the unit
of observation is the firm, not the establishment. We thus have to assign
multi-establishment firms to the location of the headquarter.16 As a result,
our estimates with the IS are not very precise.

3.2    Descriptive statistics
Panel A of Table 2 compares the pre-reform characteristics of workers and
firms of the four regions that we compare in our DiD estimations: highly-
treated regions and weakly treated regions (within 15 and 15–30 minutes to
the border in the BR, respectively), and the two control regions (in the BR
with more than 30 minutes to the border and the NBR). The table suggests
that the four groups are quite comparable in terms of labor market size, im-
portant worker characteristics, and workers’ mean log hourly wages. While
the employment of CBW was much larger in the treated regions before the
reform, the employment share of resident immigrants was similar. The panel
also suggests that neither of the two control groups is clearly more compara-
ble to the highly treated region. Similar comments apply if we compare the
characteristics of establishments (BC) and firms (IS) across regions (Panels
B and C of Table 2). However, we also observe some important differences
such as the fact that highly treated establishments are somewhat larger and
more likely to be exporters than establishments in the two control groups.
   In the appendix, we also describe the characteristics of the CBW working
in the BR after 1998. Three features are noteworthy (see Table A.3). First,
while CBW were on average less educated than natives before the reform,

  16
    Appendix B.2 provides detailed discussions on how we constructed our estimation
sample for the two datasets and how we assign firms to BR and NBR.

Notes: The table shows descriptive statistics in the border and non-border region. The border region is
split into three groups depending on the travel duration to the nearest border crossing. Panel A shows
average worker characteristics for the sample of all workers aged 18-64 employed in the private sector
from the Swiss Earnings Structure Survey (SESS). Panel B shows establishments characteristics from the
Business Census (BC) in 1998 (or 1995, if indicated). Panel C shows average firm characteristics using
data from the KOF innovation surveys 1996 and 1999, focusing on characteristics unavailable in the BC.
In this panel, entries represent averages per region of all firm-year observations in the two surveys.

we observe a large increase in the share of highly educated CBW in the
1998–2010 period (+12.6%). Consistent with such high education levels, the
employment of CBW grew most in occupations with high and intermediate
wage levels.17 Second, the increase in CBW was largest in IT, R&D, business
services, real estate and, to a lesser extent, in the health sector, suggesting
that many new CBW and resident immigrants were professionals in science
and technology. Third, using a Mincer regression, we find that wages of CBW
are similar to those of natives, after controlling for observable characteristics,
suggesting that CBW have comparable labor market skills as observationally
similar natives.
   17
     Beerli et al. (2017) show that the increase in tertiary education among new immi-
grants in Switzerland between 1990–2010 was a response to long-term, technology-driven
increase in the demand for skills.

3.3     Empirical specification and identification
Our basic empirical specification estimates the effects of the greater avail-
ability of CBW on Swiss firms and workers by exploiting that the reform
interacted with the proximity to the border. We differentiate the effects
of the transition and the free movement phase of the reform by defining
the dummies T ransitiont and F reet that are equal to one in the years
1999 ≤ t < 2004 and t ≥ 2004, respectively, and zero otherwise. We interact
these reform variables with two indicators, I(di ≤ 15) and I(15 < di ≤ 30),
which are equal to one if unit i is located within 15 minutes or at 15 to 30
minutes travel time di to the nearest border crossing.18 Using these vari-
ables, we estimate the following DiD model for an outcome yi,t relative to
unit i (a municipality, an establishment, or a firm) in year t:

        T                                 T
yi,t = βd1 [T ransitiont × I(di ≤ 15)] + βd2 [T ransitiont × I(15 < di ≤ 30)]
           F                           F
         +βd1 [F reet × I(di ≤ 15)] + βd2 [F reet × I(15 < di ≤ 30)]

         +αi + αt + γControlsi,t + i,t                                              (1)

                phase      phase
In this model, βd1    and βd2    capture the impact of a specific phase of the
reform on highly and lightly treated units, respectively, i.e. the differential
evolution in the outcome yi,t in these groups during the transition phase and
free movement phase relative to the control group. We use two different
control groups: units in the BR located more than 30 minutes from the
border and units in the NBR.19 The term αt represents year fixed effects,


  18
      The travel distance to the border is computed using information on the location of
establishments (BC) and firms (IS). di is time-invariant because a time varying measure
could be endogenous (e.g. represent a relocation of firms in response to the commuting
scheme). In the firm regressions, we assign firms to their location in 1998 throughout
the estimation period. For the municipality-level specifications, we use the BC 1995
and 1998 to compute the employment-weighted average travel time to the border of the
establishments in a municipality. See section B.2 in the appendix for further details.
   19
      If we use the NBR as the control group, we exclude the very few establishments and
municipalities located in the NBR within less than 30 minutes to the border. The reason
is that these units may be affected by the switch from no to free access to CBW that
occurred in 2007 (see Table 1).

                                          17
which absorb the time variation common to all units such as common changes
in aggregate prices and demand and the dummies T ransitiont and F reet . αi
represent unit fixed effects that control for pre-existing differences between
regions. Such differences could have been a direct consequence of the long-
established cross-border policy that restricted the hiring of CBW to the BR.
   The central identifying assumption of our approach is that we would have
observed a common average change in outcomes within units, conditional on
controls, in the three regions absent the reform. We will test the plausibility
of this assumption in several ways. Most importantly, we check how the
outcomes in the three relevant regions evolved before the reform. To this
end, we generalize equation (1) to an event study model. In the case of the
data from the SESS, the model takes the following form:

                          2010
                          X
  yi,t = αi + αt +               γd1,t I(year = t) × [I(di ≤ 15)]               (2)
                         t=1994
               2010
               X
           +          γd2,t I(year = t) × [I(15 < di ≤ 30)] + δControlsi,t + i,t
             t=1994


The estimates of the coefficients γd1,t for t ≥ 1999 reveal the reform effects on
the highly treated units. γd2,t reveal the effects on lightly treated units. As
the impact of the policy should be zero before its announcement, we should
find that γd1t = γd2,t = 0, for t < 1998. We standardize the effects to 0 in
1998 by dropping the indicator for that year from the regression.
   Arguably, the main threat to a causal interpretation of our estimates is
unobserved factors that are correlated with the timing of the reform and that
affect regions differently depending on the distance to the border. Candidate
confounding factors are simultaneous other reforms (e.g. due to changes
in cantonal policies) and unobserved region-specific shocks to prices, de-
mand, or productivity. We partially account for such factors by including
linear time trends for each NUTS-II region in our vector of control vari-
ables, Controlsi,t . In sections 5.2 and 7.5, we also provide several checks



                                            18
that suggest that our results are not confounded by unobserved region- or
industry-specific shocks and by the simultaneous changes in trade policies.
     Another remark concerns inference. We cluster standard errors at the
level of commuting zones (CZ), both in the municipality- and firm-level re-
gressions. We thus allow for arbitrary dependence, cross-sectional and over
time, between units within the same CZ. In tables A.8 and A.15, we compare
the standard errors based on this strategy with standard errors clustered at
the unit (firm/municipality), two-digit industry, and cantonal level, and with
standard errors based on the Spatial Heteroskedasticity and Autocorrelation
Consistent (SHAC) variance estimator proposed by Conley (1999), also used
by Dustmann et al. (2017). This estimator allows for correlation between
areas that are geographically close but belong to different regional units.
These alternative standard errors are often substantially smaller than our
preferred ones. Our inference is thus conservative.

4        Effects of the policy on immigration
Our empirical strategy depends on the idea that the immigration reform
affected regions close to the border more. Figure 2 provides descriptive ev-
idence that supports this idea. Using the SESS from 1994 to 2010, we now
analyze the exact dynamics of the change in total immigrant exposure in
municipalities located close to the Swiss border compared to those farther
away. Panel A of Figure 3 plots the coefficients γd1,t and γd2,t and their
95% confidence intervals in a regression as specified in equation (2) when
either the BR 30+ or the NBR constitutes the control group. The depen-
dent variable is the number of total immigrant workers (CBW plus resident
immigrants) in municipality i and year t standardized by total employment

     Panel A reveals several important features in the evolution of immigrant

    20
      We standardize the number of immigrants by total local employment (native and for-
eign workers) in the last year prior to the reform, 1998, rather than contemporaneous total
employment, as immigration may affect contemporaneous total employment (Dustmann
et al., 2017).

Notes: The figure shows the effect of the free movement policy on immigration. It plots the estimated
reform effects and associated 95% confidence intervals for highly treated municipalities (Panel A: and
weakly treated municipalities) based on the event study model (equation (2)). In Panel A, the dependent
variable is the number of immigrants relative to total employment in 1998. We present separate estimates
for the two control groups (BR 30+ and NBR). In Panel B, the dependent variable is the number of
highly or lower educated immigrants (or CBW only) relative to the total number of workers in the same
group in 1998. In this panel, the control group is the BR 30+. Regressions are weighted using the total
workforce in 1998 in a cell. All regressions account for municipality and period fixed effects, and linear
trends per NUTS-II region. Standard errors are clustered on the CZ level. SESS data.

exposure by region. First, in the pre-1999 period, none of the estimates
for any of the interactions is significantly different from zero at the 95%
confidence level. There are thus no differences in the trends of the number
of immigrants between municipalities close to the border and either control
group before the reform. Second, there is a mild upward trend in the num-
ber of immigrants as a share of 1998 employment between 2000 and 2002 in
highly treated municipalities. The estimated increase is between 1.5 and 3
percentage points in 2002 depending on the control group, suggesting a small
reform effect on immigrant employment in the highly treated regions during
the transition phase. Third and most importantly, the number of immigrants
as a share of 1998 employment grows consistently in highly treated munic-
ipalities after 2004, and to a lesser extent in weakly treated municipalities.
By 2010, the reform led to an increase in the share by about 10 percentage
points in the highly treated regions. As expected, the estimates indicate
that the reform effect was smaller—about a third—in the weakly treated
regions. Fourth, the estimates based on the NBR control group are slightly
lower but not statistically different from those based on the BR 30+ con-


                                                                                            20
trol. If we compare the average outcome in the free movement period with
the entire pre-reform period, as we do in our baseline DiD model (equation
(1)), we estimate an increase in the number of immigrants as a share of 1998
employment by 5.6 (using the BR 30+ as control) and 3.7 (using the NBR)
percentage points, respectively (see columns 1 and 2 of Table 3).
   The regressions in columns 3–6 of Table 3 show how different immigrant
subgroups contributed to this aggregate inflow of immigrants. Columns 3
and 4 of Table 3 show that two-thirds (3.8 of 5.6 percentage points) of the
total increase in immigrants in the free movement phase in highly treated
regions can be attributed to inflows of CBW. In turn, part of the excess
increase in the highly treated regions is attributable to resident immigrants,
Ii,t . Considering the legal circumstances and the fact that the pre-reform
share of resident immigrants was similar in the relevant regions (see panel A
of Table 2), we would expect that the liberalizations for resident immigrants
affected treated and control regions similarly. We thus interpret these find-
ings as evidence that the greater availability of CBW attracted (crowded in)
resident immigrants—an effect that is statistically significant, as shown in
column 4 of Table 3. This interpretation is consistent with the timing of the
effect on resident immigrants, which follows the surge in CBW.21
   Columns 5 and 6 of Table 3 show that most of the increase in CBW
is attributable to inflows of highly educated CBW (3.8 of 5.6 percentage
points). Indeed, Panel B of Figure 3 shows that the inflow of highly educated
immigrants was very substantial relative to the pre-existing pool of highly
educated native workers in 1998: by 2010, the policy increased the number
of highly educated immigrants as a share of total employment of highly edu-
cated workers in 1998 by roughly 30 percentage points in the highly treated
region. In contrast, the growth of immigrants within the group of lower ed-
ucated workers was much lower (6 percentage points). Complementing this
  21
      The excess increase in the number of resident immigrants close the border—
illustrated in Panel B of Figure 3 by the divergence in the effects on total immigrants
and CBW—starts in 2006 and thus 2–4 years after the start of the increase in the number
of CBW.

                                          21
picture, Table A.4 shows that the largest contribution to the overall growth
in the number of immigrants came from occupations with high pay, such as
R&D workers, IT specialists, analysts and consultants, and to a lesser extent
from those with middle pay.

equation (1). In columns 1 and 2, the dependent variable is the number of immigrants standardized
with total employment in 1998. In columns 3 and 4, the dependent variable is the number of CBW or
resident immigrants, respectively, standardized with total employment in 1998. In column 5 and 6, the
dependent variable is the total number highly or lower educated immigrants, respectively, standardized
by total employment in 1998. T ransitiont is one for the period between 2000 and 2003, whereas F reet
is one from year 2004 onward. (di ≤ x) and (y < di ≤ z) indicate whether a municipality is located
less than x travel minutes or between y and z travel minutes from the next border crossing, respectively.
Regressions are weighted using the total workforce in 1998 in a cell. Robust standard errors, clustered by
commuting zone, are shown in parentheses. ∗∗∗ , ∗∗ , ∗ , denote statistical significance at the 1%, 5% and
10% level, respectively. SESS data.



    In sum, the free movement policy increased the supply of CBW and of
other resident immigrants by about 10 percentage points by 2010 in munic-
ipalities within 0–15 minutes from the border. Two thirds of the new CBW
were highly educated. As expected, the increase in immigrants’ supply was
smaller 15–30 minutes from the border and was most pronounced after 2004,
when the labor market in the BR was fully opened to CBW.

5     Labor market effects
5.1    Main results
In this section, we investigate whether the greater availability of (mainly
highly educated) CBW depressed wages or employment opportunities of
(highly educated) natives. We analyze wage and employment outcomes of
natives jointly as they represent different margins of adjustment to the shock,
potentially heterogeneous across groups due to group-specific labor supply
elasticities or wage rigidities (see Dustmann et al., 2016, for a discussion).
    Part I of Figure 4 provides evidence on the wage and employment effects
of the free movement policy on natives. It plots the event study estimates
(equation 2) for the highly treated regions (0–15 minutes) using average log
real hourly native wages (panel A) and log total native workers (panel B) as
dependent variables, respectively. We present the results using both control
groups separately. Table A.5 in the appendix presents the corresponding
point estimates from our baseline DiD model (equation 1).
    Panels A and B of Figure 4 show that natives’ wages and employment
evolved similarly in the treatment group and in both control groups prior
to 1999. This remains true in the reform period: the estimated reform
effects are never significant for both outcomes. In terms of employment
of native workers, the point estimates are close to zero based on the BR
30+ control group and slightly negative but non-significant based on the
NBR control group. Hence, we neither find statistically significant evidence
of a negative effect on average native wages nor a clear effect on native
employment despite the substantial increase in immigrant employment in
highly treated regions. Our establishment-level regressions based on data
from the business censuses presented below strengthen this view: we find no
evidence that the substantial increase in employment of foreigners reduced
FTE employment of Swiss nationals within establishments (see Figure 5).
    In panels C and D of Figure 4, we look at the impacts on highly and
lower educated native workers separately. The estimates represent the “to-

Notes: The figure shows the effects of the free movement policy on real wages and employment of native
workers. It plots the event study coefficients and associated 95% confidence intervals for the highly
treated municipalities based on equation (2). The dependent variables are natives’ average log hourly
real wage (panel A and C) and log total workers (panel B and D) per education group. We present
separate estimates for the two control groups (BR 30+ and NBR). The regressions are weighted using the
number of natives in a cell. Control variables are municipality and year fixed effects and linear NUTS-II

tal” effect of immigrants on wages and employment of each education group
of natives. They capture the impact on natives both from competition with
immigrants with similar skills and from complementarity to those with dif-
ferent skills.22 As the free movement policy produced a larger inflow of
CBW with tertiary education relative to those with lower qualifications, the
canonical “partial effects” model would imply downward pressure on wages
and employment of highly educated natives and possibly positive effects on

a total effect of immigrants aggregating all the direct competition and indirect comple-
mentarity effects from different skill groups.

lower-educated natives through complementarity.
   This is not what we find. Rather, panel C of Figure 4 suggests a positive
effect on real wages of highly educated natives that starts in the transition
phase and grows to +4.5% in the free movement period. This positive wage
effect is evident using either control group (cf. panels A and B of Table A.5),
it is robust, and economically significant: real wages of highly educated na-
tives grew by only 3%, on average, in the BR between 1998 and 2010. The
effects on employment for highly educated workers are imprecisely estimated
but rule out strong negative employment effects. If anything, they are consis-
tent with increased employment of highly educated native workers. On the
other side, we find negative point estimates on some of the outcomes of low
educated natives. None of the estimates, however, is consistently statistically
significant, and we cannot rule out zero effects on this group. Nevertheless,
these heterogeneous point estimates by education group explain why we find
a zero effect in the aggregate that averages those effects.
   Overall, we find that highly educated natives gained from the increased
availability of mostly highly educated CBW. This evidence is difficult to
explain in a competitive labor market framework where immigration repre-
sents an increase in labor supply with a fixed labor demand. We develop
this point below.

5.2    Robustness of labor market results
First, however, we discuss a series of important robustness checks for these
labor market results. As in every DiD estimation, it is a first-order con-
cern that the effects may be caused by a failure of common trends in out-
comes across regions or by unobserved confounders. Potential confounders
are changes in regional policies, unobserved demand, and productivity shocks
that have a regionally unequal impact e.g. due to differences in the industrial
composition of regions. We address these concerns in several ways. In panel
B of Table A.6, we show that the estimated labor market effects are very
close to the baseline estimates across the different outcomes if we include a

                                      25
Bartik (1991) variable, which controls for region-specific, sector-driven de-
mand trends or shocks.23 Similarly, the results are similar when we control
for unobserved region-specific shocks using NUTS-II regions times year fixed
effects (panel C of Table A.6), if we exclude the linear time trends contained
in our baseline regression model (Panel D of Table A.6), and if we drop the
most important large cities one by one (Table A.7).24 In section 7.5, we
also present several pieces of evidence suggesting that our results are indeed
attributable to increased labor mobility rather than caused by one of the
other bilateral agreements which were signed at the same time.
    Another concern with our labor market results is that they are driven by
effects on the composition of native workers rather than by effects on “in-
cumbent” workers in the regions of interest. The main concern in our case
differs from the concern about native outflows in the existing literature, i.e.
the fact that native workers may respond to immigrant inflows by leaving the
labor market or the region (Borjas, 2006; Dustmann et al., 2017). Our main
result—an increase in wages of highly educated native workers while their
employment is stable—could only be rationalized with inflows of high-wage
natives from the control to the treatment regions. Unfortunately, we cannot
examine flows of workers with the SSES data because it does not allow fol-
lowing individual workers over time. We thus investigate the question using
data from the Swiss Labor Force Surveys. Overall, the analysis, presented in
in Appendix C, provides no evidence that the greater availability of CBW af-
fected the flow of natives between treated and control regions. In particular,
we find no evidence of an increase in job-to-job transitions from the control
to the treatment region—both for all workers and highly educated workers.
Consistently, we find no influence of the reform on regional population size


   23
      The basic intuition is to control for regional changes in employment or wages (by skill
group) which are due to national-level changes in industries that are strongly represented
in a particular region. See Appendix B.3 on the construction of this variable.
   24
      Omitting the linear time trends reduces the point estimate of the effect on wages
highly educated natives and its precision. This point estimate, however, is not statistically
different from the baseline estimate.

                                             26
(column 6 of Table A.11).
    Beerli and Peri (2018) provide several further robustness checks. Most
importantly, the paper shows that the results are similar if we only compare
changes in outcomes in municipalities in the highly affected area (0-15 min)
with outcomes in matched control municipalities that are similar in terms
of predetermined characteristics (an approach also followed by Dustmann
et al., 2017). The labor market results are also similar if skills are mea-
sured using occupation (high-, middle- and low-paying occupations) instead
of educational groups.

6     Theoretical framework
Our empirical findings in the previous sections show that opening the labor
market for CBW in the municipalities close to the border produced an in-
crease in the employment of these workers, especially the highly educated
ones. Nevertheless, the reform led to an increase in the wages of highly
educated native workers. These findings run counter to an interpretation
of the reform as an increase in the local supply of high-skilled workers in a
classic supply and demand framework within a perfectly competitive labor
market (as used in Borjas, 2014, Chapter 3). In such a framework, an in-
crease in high skilled foreign workers would decrease wages for high skilled
native workers, at least in the short run. Moreover, such a framework is not
well suited to describe how the removal of mobility restrictions affects job
creation by facilitating firms’ access to a pool of highly skilled and initially
scarce workers.
    We thus prefer to conceptualize our findings in an imperfect labor market
framework with firm-employee matching, frictional search, and job posting
(e.g., Pissarides, 2000; Chassambouli and Palivos, 2014; Chassambouli and
Peri, 2018). In such a model, firms post vacancies while workers with differ-
ent skills search for jobs. The presence of search frictions leads to unemploy-
ment in equilibrium, and the labor market for each skill type is characterized



                                      27
by a specific ratio of vacancies to unemployment, called labor market tight-
ness. The tighter the labor market for a particular skill type, the harder is it
for firms to fill their vacancies. It is natural to assume that the labor market
for certain specialized workers such as R&D workers is tighter.25 Conse-
quently, firms that depend more heavily on these workers will on average
face a tighter labor market. These firms will experience “skill shortage.”
    In such a framework, the reform reduces the tightness of the labor mar-
kets for skilled workers by gradually increasing the availability of skilled
CBW, i.e. more job seekers start to search for jobs in the Swiss labor mar-
ket close to the border. The reform thus leads to a higher matching and
vacancy-filling rate for skilled jobs with CBW. This, in turn, leads to an
increase in employment of those workers and a decrease of unfilled vacancies
of the firm. Given the heterogeneity between firms in the use of specialized
workers, we expect that these effects are particularly pronounced in firms
that were more dependent on workers that were scarce before the reform.
Over time, firms will expand in response to the greater availability of CBW
and the number of vacancies will increase.
    Such a model, however, cannot explain the observed increase in wages of
high-skilled native workers: if the production function of the firm has con-
stant or decreasing labor productivity, as in the standard Pissarides (2000)
model, then the increase in employment of skilled CBW and the decrease
in unfilled vacancies in the short run would lower wages of native skilled
workers both through marginal productivity effects and through reducing
skill-specific labor market tightness, which worsens workers’ outside options
when bargaining over wages. The observed positive wage effect on skilled
natives, instead, requires that the production function of the firm exhibits in-
creasing returns to high-skilled workers. This is true if highly educated CBW
have positive effects on firms’ total or skill-specific productivity and/or phys-
  25
     As skilled workers have higher productivity and thus generate a higher surplus for
the firm, firms will create a large number of job postings for them. At the same time,
unemployment rates for skilled workers are lower due to long tenure in jobs (low break-up
rates) and high specificity of matching.

                                           28
ical capital. In this case, a greater availability of skilled workers can increase
firms’ surplus of a match, stimulate job creation, and thus lead to higher
wages for high-skilled workers.
    The literature suggests several channels through which a greater avail-
ability of high-skilled CBW may positively affect firms’ productivity and
capital accumulation. First, there may be static and dynamic productivity
effects from increasing the number skilled workers in a firm due to labor pool-
ing, knowledge spillovers, and diffusion of ideas.26 Similarly, an increase in
R&D specialized workers could stimulate productivity because it is a direct
input in the innovation process of firms and in the creation of new knowl-
edge, either through increased patenting (Kerr, 2013; Kerr et al., 2014) or
the exchange of ideas (see Hunt, 2011; Hunt and Gauthier-Loiselle, 2010).
    Second, an increase in specialized workers may trigger firms to adopt
technologies that are better suited for using the skills supplied by CBW,
increasing the specific productivity of that group (e.g., Peri, 2012; Hornung,
2014; Lewis, 2011). If skilled CBW and natives specialize in different jobs,
this would attenuate possible negative effects on the marginal productivity
of skilled native workers and enhance the positive wage effects on them from
productivity changes. Third, an increase in high skilled workers may attract
physical capital and induce firm-creation and investment (Kerr et al., 2015;
Olney, 2013).27 If capital and skilled workers are complements (Krusell et al.,
2000), the resulting increase in physical capital in the area would contribute
to increase wages of skilled native workers.
    Overall, the combination of search frictions in the (skilled) labor market,
heterogeneous firm-level dependence on these workers, and positive produc-

  26
      Moretti (2004) and Diamond (2016), among others, show that a larger share of college
educated workers increases labor productivity in US cities. Glaeser and Mare (2001) show
that this may be in part due to dynamic local learning. Iranzo and Peri (2009) argue that
it may be the consequence of faster technology adoption.
   27
      Theoretically, we expect that firms’ entry and location choices under nonzero profits
depend upon the same quantities as those that affect firms’ sales and profits (Combes
and Gobillon, 2015). The prospect of hiring the right type of workers can be a strong
attractor for firms and a key driver of agglomeration economies (as in Moretti, 2004).

                                            29
tivity effects of high-skilled CBW are the key ingredients to understand our
empirical findings. These theoretical considerations lead to a series of predic-
tions regarding the effect of the policy that we test in the following sections
mainly using firm-level data from the BC and the IS.

7      Mechanisms
A couple of remarks on the firm-level regressions are warranted before turn-
ing to these analyses.28 First, the unit of observation in the regressions is an
establishment (in the Business Census, BC) or a firm (in the Innovation Sur-
veys, IS). Second, we focus on incumbent firms because the free movement
policy changed the composition of firms by affecting establishment creation
in the heavily affected regions (as shown in section 7.4). In the BC, we thus
restrict the sample to a fully balanced panel by focusing on establishments
that existed in all sample periods. In the IS, balancing the panel would lead
to a very small sample (n ≈ 100), so we focus on incumbents by restricting
the sample to firms that existed before 1999. As can be seen in Table A.14
in the appendix, alternatives to account for firm entry lead to very similar
results.29 Third, to ensure that the sample is comparable to what we used
in the labor market analysis (based on the SSES), we focus on private-sector
establishments and drop those with less than three FTE workers in the first
census. For the same reason, we weight regressions based on the BC by
establishment’s average size over the sample. In the IS, however, our pre-
ferred regressions are not weighted by firm size.30 Fourth, in both datasets,

   28
      Section B.2 in the appendix contains a detailed discussion on the construction of
our firm-/establishment level estimation samples. For ease of exposition and brevity, we
mainly focus on the preferred specifications of Ruffner and Siegenthaler (2017). We refer
the reader to this working paper for a full discussion how the specification choices influence
the main results.
   29
      One is to include all firms that fulfil the other sample restrictions (i.e. to allow firm
entry and exit) and to account for entry using the firm/establishment fixed effects only
(panel G). Another is follow a single cross-section of firms (such as those existing in 1998,
panel H).
   30
      Weighting by firm size is unattractive in the IS because it gives a large weight to the
few, large multi-establishment firms in the survey. In the IS, we assign multi-establishment
firms to the location of the headquarter, which leads to mismeasurement (see section 3.1).
Table A.16 compares the weighted and the unweighted regression results. The effects have

                                              30
we drop a very small number of extreme outliers which significantly affect
the precision, but not the estimate of the coefficient of interest (as shown in
Table A.14). Finally, for brevity, the control group will mainly be firms in
the BR 30+ minutes away from the border. Both control groups lead to sim-
ilar results with few exceptions that we discuss (Figures A.1 and Table A.14
provide a direct comparison).

7.1     Effects by skill-intensity of industries
This section assesses a first set of predictions from our theoretical consid-
erations: the greater availability of workers should lead to additional hiring
of CBW and stimulate the creation of additional jobs within firms. Since
most new CBW are skilled, these effects should be most prevalent in firms
whose production is more intensive in skilled workers. To test these pre-
dictions, we examine how the reform affected employment in establishments
separately for low- and high-tech manufacturers, and knowledge-intensive (fi-
nance, business, human resource management) and more traditional service
sector establishments.
    The results, based on the balanced panel of establishment from the BC,
are presented in Figure 5. The dependent variable in panel A is log FTE
employment (panel A). In panels B and C, the outcome is FTE employment
of foreign workers (i.e., resident immigrants plus CBW) and Swiss workers,
respectively. For consistency with the results in section 4 , we express these
outcomes as shares of total FTE employment in 1998, but the results are
comparable if we use an approximate log outcome (see Figure A.3 in the
appendix). Because the BC in 1991 and 2011 do not contain information
on workers’ nationality, panels B and C are restricted to the census waves
1995–2008.
    Figure 5, first, suggests that highly treated establishments and control
establishments displayed a similar within-establishment change in all these
outcomes in the pre-reform period. According to panel B, high-treatment
the same sign, but the former are larger and more sensitive to the choice of specification.

                                            31
incumbent establishments began to hire more foreign workers than the con-
trol group starting in the 1998–2001 period. Consistent with our theoretical
considerations, the hiring mainly happens in high-tech manufacturing and
the knowledge-intensive service sector. As shown by panel C, the increased
employment of foreigners in skill-intensive sectors did not lead to a reduction
in employment of Swiss nationals in the firms. Instead, highly treated in-
cumbent establishments seem to have created additional jobs for the newly
hired foreigners. This happened as early as in the transition phase, simul-
taneously to the increase in employment of CBW. By 2011, highly treated
establishments in the two skill-intensive sectors are substantially larger than
control establishments in the same sector.
   Overall, we find strong evidence that the greater availability of CBW led
to the creation of additional jobs for the newly available foreign workers.
Averaged across all sectors, the free movement policy increased foreign em-
ployment as a share of 1998 employment in highly treated establishments
by 8.5% and total FTE employment by 6.2%, as shown in columns 1 and 2
of Table 4. The estimated reform effect on the size of incumbent firms in
the IS are even slightly larger (column 3 of Table 4). Moreover, we generally
find similar results if we use firms in the NBR as control group except that
the effects on establishment size in the BC are almost exclusively driven by
high-tech manufacturers (see Figures A.1 and A.2 in the appendix).
   Table 5 tests another implication of our theoretical considerations: if the
reform’s positive wage effects are due to increased productivity or capital
accumulation in firms, the sectors that have the largest increase in employ-
ment of CBW should also account for natives’ wage gains. The table shows
that the wage increase of natives are indeed concentrated in high-tech man-
ufacturing and the knowledge-intensive service sector. Interestingly, if we
estimate the sector-specific effects separately by natives’ educational attain-
ment, we find that the wage gains in the knowledge-intensive service sector
accrue to highly educated natives only. The evidence is more mixed in high-

 Notes: The figures show the effect of the free movement policy on FTE employment of incumbent estab-
 lishments using private-sector establishment-level data from the BC. They plot event study coefficients
 and associated 95% confidence intervals for highly treated establishments based on equation (2), estimated
 separately by establishments’ broad sector of economic activity. The regressions control for establishment
 fixed effects, year fixed effects, and linear NUTS-II trends. The control group is establishments in the
 BR with more than 30 minutes travel distance to the border (results using the other control group are
 presented in Figure A.2). In panel A, the dependent variable is log FTE employment. In panel B, it is
 FTE employment of foreigners as a share of total employment in 1998. In panel C, it is FTE employment
 of Swiss nationals as a share of total employment in 1998. (Figure A.3 provides the same regressions for
 an approximate log outcome.) The samples in panels B and C cover the 1995–2008 period because the
 BC in 1991 and 2011 do not contain information on workers’ nationality. All regressions are weighted
 using average establishment size (in FTE). Standard errors are clustered by commuting zone.

 Notes: The table presents results of establishment- and firm-level DiD regressions using the BC (columns
 1–2) and the IS (columns 3–7). The control group are firms in the BR with more than 30 minutes to the
 border (results using the other control group are presented in Panel B of Table A.14). The dependent variable
 in column 1 is full-time equivalent (FTE) employment of foreigners as a share of total employment in 1998.
 The dependent variable in column 2 is log FTE employment. The dependent variables in columns 3–5 are
 firms’ log FTE employment, log total sales, and log value added per FTE worker. The dependent variable in
 column 6 is a dummy equal to 1 if a firm filed at least one patent application in the year of the survey and
 the two years before the survey. Column 7 uses the Inverse Hyperbolic Sine (IHS) of the number of patent
 applications. T ransitiont is a dummy equal to one between 1999 and 2003, whereas F reet is one from year
 2004 onward. I(di ≤ x) and I(y < di ≤ z) indicate whether a firm is located less than x travel minutes
 or between y and z travel minutes from the next border crossing, respectively. All regressions account for
 establishment (BC) or firm (IS) fixed effects, period fixed effects, and linear trends per NUTS-II region. The
 regressions in columns 1 and 2 are weighted using average establishment size (in FTE) as weight. ∗∗∗ , ∗∗ ,

tech manufacturing along this dimension: the wage gains accrue to lower
educated natives in the highly treated region but to highly educated natives
in the weakly treated region.31 In contrast, we consistently find no wage ef-
fects on natives in the two sectors that are not skill-intensive. In fact, Table 5
provides evidence for non-negligible wage declines among the lower educated
natives in non-knowledge intensive service industries. Those sectors are po-
tentially those where capital and productivity effects were less pronounced,
as technology is more traditional. Therefore, the increased labor market

  31
      The results are similar if we use municipalities in the NBR as control group (see
Table A.9 in the appendix). Why may lower educated natives have benefited from the
reform in high-tech manufacturing but not in knowledge-intensive services? Differences
in immigrant inflows by skills cannot explain this pattern—Table A.10 shows that the
skill-ratios of immigrants are roughly similar in both sectors. One plausible answer is
thus differences in complementarities in production across sectors.

competition, especially from less-educated CBW, might have prevailed in
the short run.

7.2       Firm productivity
Can we explain the wage increases of natives in the skill-intensive sectors
established in the previous section with productivity gains in incumbent
firms in these sectors, as hypothesized in section 6? As a first step to answer
this question, columns 4 and 5 of Table 4 present the results of firm-level
regressions of equation (1) using the log of firms’ sales and value added per


                                                     35
FTE worker as dependent variables.32 The data stem from the IS 1996–
2013 but refer to the year before the survey. Column 4 suggests that the
free movement policy increased sales of highly treated incumbent firms by
almost 12%. Despite of this sizable positive effect on sales, the liberalizations
did not have a statistically significant impact on labor productivity of the
average firm (column 5).
    However, this average effect masks an increased productivity in the skill-
intensive sectors that account for the positive wage effect on natives. Panel
A of Figure 6 presents the results of an augmented version of our base-
line regression (column 5 of Table 4) that contains interactions between the
treatment variables and dummy variables equal to one if a firm belongs to
the two skill-intensive sectors. The regression controls for detailed industry-
period fixed effects so that we only compare firms in the same industry across
regions. The figure suggests that the reform had a substantial positive ef-
fect on labor productivity of incumbent high-tech manufacturers in the free
movement period. We also find a positive reform effect on the knowledge-
intensive business service firms, but it is only statistically significant at the
10% level.
    Another central prediction of our theoretical framework is that the pro-
ductivity effects of the reform should be more pronounced in firms that faced
particularly tight labor markets for skilled workers before the reform. We
test this prediction leveraging the fact that firms in the IS were asked directly
whether their innovation efforts were negatively affected by a “shortage of
specialized personnel.” We average the original, 5-point Likert scale sur-
vey item over the two survey waves prior to the reform for each firm and
group firms into three categories, from “no shortage” to “high shortage.”33
As shown in Table 2, 17% of all highly treated firms and similar shares in
the control regions experienced high skill shortages before the reform. In-
  32
     The associated event study results are shown in Figure A.1.
  33
     In particular, firms that have “no shortage” are firms with a less than 2, “moderate
shortage” firms have a value between 2 and 4, and “high shortage” firms have a value
greater than or equal to 4.

                                           36
terestingly, skill shortages appear to be broadly distributed across different
segments of the economy: no single firm characteristic correlates strongly
with firms’ pre-reform problems to find skilled workers.34 If we interact the
reform variables with the indicators of skill shortages—as is done in panel
B of Figure 6 to test our theoretical prediction—we find strong evidence
that the reform led to productivity gains in highly treated firms with skill
shortages prior to the reform.
   Panel C of Figure 6 leverages a similar subjective survey question to
differentiate between firms that differed in the extent to which they reported
that their innovation activities were hampered by “labor market regulation
for foreigners” prior to the policy changes. Table A.22 in the appendix
provides suggestive evidence that the reform reduced the probability that
firms perceive to be hampered by this type of regulation. More importantly,
Panel C of Figure 6 suggests that relaxing this obstacle spurred productivity
growth in firms that were constrained initially.
   Overall, the findings presented in this section provide support to the view
that the wage gains of natives were the consequence of increased productivity
in firms with high demand of skilled workers. They are also consistent with
results from studies on the H-1B program in the US, which typically find
that changes in the number of H-1B visas nationally affect productivity in
firms and regions that rely strongly on H-1B workers (Ghosh et al., 2014;
Kerr and Lincoln, 2010; Peri et al., 2015a).

7.3     Innovation
As discussed in section 6, another possible explanation for the positive wage
effects of the open border policy is that the highly skilled CBW supported
firms’ innovation activities. To study this channel, we first analyze whether
the newly hired CBW indeed play an important role in the growth of research
and development (R&D) departments of firms close to the border. Using

  34
     See Table A.12 in the appendix. Firms that reported moderate or high shortages are
slightly more likely to be manufacturers and to have R&D expenditures.

 Notes: The figure examines whether the effects of the free movement policy on firms’ sales, productivity
 and innovation depend on the skill-intensity of the sector and firms’ perceptions to be constrained by labor
 shortages prior to the reform. All regressions are based on firm-level data from the IS 1996–2013, focus on
 the effects on highly treated firms in the free movement phase, and use firms in the BR located more than
 30 minutes to the border as control group. The coefficients are derived from our baseline regression model
 (equation (1)) augmented with interactions between all reform variables and certain indicators. In panel
 A, the indicators refer to knowledge-intensive service industries and high-tech manufacturers. In panels
 B, C and D, the indicators refer to firms that differed in the extent to which their innovation efforts
 were negatively affected by a “shortage of specialized personnel” (panel B), “labor market regulation
 for foreigners” (panel C), and “shortage of R&D personnel” (panel D) in the IS 1996 and/or 1999. The
 dependent variables in panels A–C are log total sales and log value added per FTE worker. The dependent
 variables in panel D are the Inverse Hyperbolic Sine (IHS) of the number of R&D workers, and dummies
 equal to 1 if a firm filed at least one patent application, reports to have introduced at least one process,
 or at least one product innovation in the three years preceding the survey. All regressions control for firm
 fixed effects, year fixed effects, and NUTS-II trends. Panel A also controls for industry-period effects.
 The vertical bars represent 95% confidence intervals constructed based on standard errors clustered by

data from the SSES, panel A of Figure 7 plots the share of researchers in total
employment depending on the travel distance to the border in 1996, 2000,
and 2010. It illustrates that cross-border researchers represented almost one
third of all R&D workers in firms located within 15 minutes to the border
in 2010. As for CBW in general, the presence of cross-border researchers
declines strongly with distance from the border. The figure also documents
an increase in the share of cross-border researchers between 2000 and 2010
that is concentrated close to the border, suggesting that the free movement
policy increased the total R&D employment share.
    The regression analysis supports a causal interpretation of this effect. At
the municipal level, we find that the free movement policy increased the share
of immigrant researchers in total employment by about 0.6 percentage points
(see Table A.4). We study the effect of the policy on total R&D employment
at the firm-level in panel D of Figure 6 using data from the IS 1996–2013.
The dependent variable is the inverse hyperbolic sine (IHS) of the number
of R&D workers.35 The estimates thus reflect an approximate percentage
increase. Guided by our theoretical considerations, we estimate separate
effects for firms that were more or less affected by the tightness of the labor
market for R&D workers prior to the reform. We distinguish firms that
differed in the extent to which their innovation efforts were “hampered by
lack of R&D workers” in the IS 1996 and/or 1999.36 The latter represent 1/6
of all firms (see Table 2). The results in in panel D of Figure 6 suggest that
the policy increased R&D employment in incumbent firms. As expected, the
effect is driven by firms with more severe shortages of R&D workers before
the reform.
    Did the increase in R&D employment translate into more inventions?

   35
       The inverse hyperbolic sine (IHS) of the number of patents accounts for the substan-
tial amount of firms without patents   p and the long right tail of the distribution. The IHS
of outcome y is IHS(y) = ln(y + 1 + y 2 ). As argued by Doran et al. (2015), using the
IHS is attractive for innovation outcomes because it approximates the log of an outcome
but has the advantage that it is defined at 0.
    36
       Empirically, the effects for firms with no or moderate pre-reform R&D shortage differ
little, so we pool the two groups in the graph.

controls for firm fixed effects, year fixed effects, and NUTS-II trends. Standard errors are clustered by
commuting zone.

The event study depicted in panel B of Figure 7 examines whether the reform
affected the probability that highly treated firms filed at least one patent ap-
plication in the three years before the IS. The figure provides robust evidence
that the reform increased this probability. The estimated reform effect is ap-
proximately 6 percentage points relative to both control groups. The effect
on the IHS of the count of patent applications is around 12 percent (see
column 7 of Table 4).37 The difference in patent applications between firms
in the highly treated and the control regions arises mainly between 2002
and 2005. Prior to the reform and from 2005 onward, the trends in patent
applications are comparable. As shown in panel D of Figure 6, the effect on
patenting is larger for firms that reported shortages of R&D workers prior to
the reform, consistent with the larger growth of R&D employment in these
firms.
         Finally, panel D of Figure 6 also shows that the reform affected the actual
output of the innovation process. In particular, we find that the reform had

a positive impact on the probability that firms report a product innovation
in the IS. Product innovations are defined as the introduction of a good or
service that is either new or a substantially improved version of a prior good
or service. By contrast, we find no measurable impact on the probability
to report process innovations, even among firms that lacked R&D workers
before the reform.
    Overall, greater access to CBW seems to have increased employment of
R&D workers, patenting, and product innovations. These effects are concen-
trated among incumbent firms that declared shortages of R&D workers be-
fore the policy implementation. Additional results reported in Ruffner and
Siegenthaler (2017) show that the increase in employment of cross-border
researchers had no measurable effect on employment and wages of native
researchers and may have crowded in other resident immigrant researchers.
These results add to an unsettled debate on whether inflows of skilled im-
migrants benefit high-skilled residents. Different studies on the impacts of
H-1B workers or foreign-born scientists reach conflicting conclusions.38 In
the private sector context analyzed here, firms seem to have reacted to the
greater availability of R&D workers by creating additional R&D jobs, which
helped to absorb the increased supply of CBW.

7.4      Capital adjustments
Our theoretical considerations suggest that the increased availability of CBW
could lead to higher capital formation and firm creation. If capital is com-
plementary to high skilled workers, capital deepening could also have con-
   38
     The results in Ghosh et al. (2014) and Kerr and Lincoln (2010) suggest that greater
access to H-1B workers generally increases the size, productivity, and innovation perfor-
mance of firms that rely heavily on H-1B visas. Doran et al. (2015), on the other hand,
find that winning an additional H-1B worker in the H-1B lotteries of 2006 and 2007 in-
creased firms’ profits, had no effect on patenting and firm size and crowded out resident
workers. Similarly, Kerr et al. (2015) find that hiring young skilled immigrants increases
firms’ skill intensity, but their evidence regarding firm size is inconclusive. Finally, Borjas
and Doran (2012) find that the strong influx of Russian mathematicians after the collapse
of the Soviet Union had negative effects on the academic positions of US mathematicians.
As pointed out by Card and Peri (2016), immigrant and resident mathematicians likely
compete for a fixed number of positions in academia even in the medium run, which
increases the scope for displacement.

tributed to wage growth of highly educated workers.
    We study the impacts on capital formation mainly by looking at entry
and exit of establishments as observed in the BC data. In every census, an es-
tablishment is considered an entrant (an exiter) if its establishment identifier
is new (disappears). The estimations are run at the municipal level and cover
the period 1991–2008 in the case of firm entry and the period 1991–2011 in
the case of firm exit.39 Figure 8 presents separate event study regressions for
the two control groups based on these information. The outcome variable
in panel A is the number of establishments entering a municipality between
BC waves t − 1 and t relative to the number of establishments in 1998. The
outcome variable panel B is the number of establishment exits per munici-
pality relative to the number of establishments in 1998. The regressions are
weighted by the number of establishments in a municipality in 1998.
    The figure provides evidence that the reform had a positive impact on
establishment entry. By 2008, the policy seems to have increased the share
of new establishments in the highly treated region by roughly 4 percentage
points relative to 1998. Importantly, this firm entry appears to have oc-
curred early during the reform. It starts in the 2001–2005 period if we use
municipalities in the NBR as the control group, and even in the 1998–2001
period if we use firms in the BR located far away from the border. In line
with our previous results, the increase in firm-creation was most pronounced
in high-tech manufacturing and in knowledge-intensive services, as shown in
columns 2–5 of Table A.19. We find no evidence that the reform affected
establishment exit (panel B of Figure 8). This finding also limits the danger
that our firm-level regressions are affected by survivorship bias.40
    Two further results suggest that the greater availability of CBW affected


  39
      The reason for the difference in sample coverage is given in Appendix B.2.
  40
      This bias could mean that we attribute too much—or not enough—of the reform
effect to occur within firms rather than to the change in firms’ composition. Ruffner and
Siegenthaler (2017) present additional robustness checks to address this concern, e.g., by
constructing lower bounds on the reform effects using a trimming procedure proposed by
Lee (2009).

 Notes: The figures plot the sequence of effects, and associated 95% confidence intervals, of the free
 movement policy on highly treated municipalities. The two event studies per panel are based on separate
 regressions of equation (2) with the two control groups (municipalities in the BR located more than 30
 travel minutes to the border and municipalities in the NBR). In panel A, the dependent variable is the
 number of new establishments in t as a fraction of the number of establishments in 1998. The estimation
 sample is based on municipality-level data from the BC 1991–2008. In panel B, the dependent variable is
 the number of establishments exiting between t − 1 and t as a fraction of the number of establishments in
 1998. The estimation sample is based on the BC 1991–2011. Regressions are weighted using the number
 of establishments in 1998 per municipality as weight. All regressions include municipality and year fixed
 effects and NUTS-II trends. Standard errors are clustered by commuting zone.

firms’ capital investment. First, Ruffner and Siegenthaler (2017) present
suggestive evidence that the reform led to a decrease in firms’ propensity
to outsource production and service tasks in the BR. Second, Table A.20
in the appendix shows that the reform influenced the staffing decisions of
multi-establishment firms. The table presents DiD estimates that focus on
multi-establishment firms with branches in different regions. We find that
the reform increased the growth of establishments located close to the border
relative to establishments within the same firm in the two control regions.
This suggests that the firms responded to the policy by increasing the size
of establishments where CBW became more easily available.
        Overall, the results indicate that the greater access to CBW encouraged
capital formation. The resulting increase in labor demand appears to have
taken place simultaneously with the increase in the supply of CBW, possi-
bly because of the early announcement and permanent nature of the reform.
These results are consistent with those of Olney (2013) who finds a quick
response of establishment formation in low-skill intensive industries to an
immigration-induced shock in low-skill labor supply. They are inconsistent,


                                                                  43
however, with evidence suggesting that spatial adjustments to immigration
may take a long time to occur (see Jaeger et al., 2019, p. 10 f.). The re-
sults also raise the possibility that the effects identified in this study may
partly represent relative rather than absolute causal effects. Without the
reform, some firms that located close to the border may have located further
away from it. Similarly, the growth in establishments close to the border
within multi-establishment firms may have occurred at the expense of es-
tablishments further away. However, such a reallocation would likely lead
to systematic flows of native workers to the highly treated and away from
the control regions. Yet, we find no evidence that this happens (see Ap-
pendix C). Such a reallocation would also likely lead to a relative reduction
in employment of natives in control compared to highly treated incumbent
establishments. Panel C of Figure 5 suggests that this did not happen, ei-
ther. Relative reallocation of workers and firms, therefore, if present at all,
was likely quite small.

7.5     Robustness of firm results
We perform a similar set of robustness checks for our firm results as done
for the labor market results. These checks reveal that our estimates are
robust to the exclusion of the most important large cities (Table A.17) and
the exclusion of the linear time trends contained in our baseline regression
model (panel C of Table A.14). The estimated reform effects are also similar
if we add industry-period, NUTS-II-period, and canton-period fixed effects
(panels D–F of Table A.14)—controls that absorb many unobserved region-
and industry-specific shocks that could confound the main results.
   We paid particular attention to ensure that the estimated effects are
not driven by changes in trade and market access, and, more generally, by
the other bilateral agreements signed at the same time as the AFMP.41 As
mentioned above, one of these agreements aimed at facilitating trade with
  41
     In Ruffner and Siegenthaler (2017), we also check that the results are not driven
by movements in the exchange rate. In general, the exchange rate remained relatively
constant in the period of interest in this paper.

                                         44
the EU by reducing non-tariff barriers to trade. Moreover, Table 2 shows
that the share of exporters and importers is slightly larger in regions close
to the border. If the agreement affected firm and productivity growth in
Switzerland, the effects are plausibly larger in regions close to the border.
    Several pieces of evidence suggest that neither trade flows nor any of
the other bilateral agreements drive our results. First, we find very limited
evidence that the reform effects on firms were larger for firms that export
more (see Figure A.4 and panel C of Table A.13 in the appendix). Second,
we find no evidence that the reform affected firms’ export status and export
intensity. Rather, the results suggest that exports grew in parallel to do-
mestic sales of treated firms (Table A.21). Third, our firm and labor market
results are similar—if anything even stronger—if we exclude all two-digit
industries that were directly affected by the other bilateral agreements (see
panel D of Table A.6 and panel F of Table A.14).42 Fourth, using a set
of qualitative questions in the IS about which policy-related factors ham-
pered firms’ innovation efforts, we show that there were no other changes
in firms’ political and regulatory environment (such as the access to the EU
market) that changed differently between treated and control firms in the
period of interest. Only one factor correlates systematically with the vari-
ables of interest (see Table A.22): the probability that firms perceive their
innovation activities hampered by “labor market regulation for foreigners.”
This is likely a direct consequence of the labor market liberalizations.
    Overall, these results suggest that factors such as the other bilateral
agreements are unlikely to be a main driving force behind our results. Nev-
ertheless, we cannot rule out that there are some other factors that may have
contributed to differences in the growth of certain outcomes between the re-


  42
     We proxy exposure to these agreements using a classification by Bühler et al. (2011)
who study how the trade liberalization caused by the bilateral agreements affected plant
growth in Switzerland. The authors carefully assess the extent to which a specific two-
digit industry was affected by the six other bilateral agreements next to the free movement
agreement. The authors assign industries into three categories: not affected, affected, and
strongly affected. In the table, we only keep non-affected industries.

                                            45
gions of interest, especially given the relatively gradual implementation of
the policy and the focus on longer-term outcomes. Arguably, however, sev-
eral of our heterogeneity analyses—such as the results in Figure 6—lend
credibility to our empirical strategy: in the cross-section of firms, the reform
effects are generally largest among firms that we may expect to profit most
from a better access to skilled foreign workers.

7.6     Moving up the management ladder
Finally, we test a last adjustment channel consistent with our theoretical
framework: the absorption of CBW with no adverse wage effects may be
explained by a reallocation of natives across tasks, enhancing their comple-
mentarity to CBW. As highly educated CBW were primarily employed in
technical, scientific, and engineering jobs, native workers had an incentive
to move towards the higher end of managerial jobs (similar as in Peri and
Sparber, 2011; Peri et al., 2015b). Our previous evidence on increased firm
entry suggest that there may well be an increased demand for managers. As
management positions require knowledge of local culture, laws and norms,
and possibly a local network of contacts, these positions are typically more
accessible to natives than to foreigners.
   To analyze whether the reform affected natives’ probability to pursue a
management position, we use the Swiss Labor Force Surveys (SLFS) 1996–
2009.43 The SLFS identifies workers that are in the top executive level
(“Direktion/Geschäftsleitung”) of a firm. In Table A.23 in the appendix, we
estimate whether the free movement policy affected the number of native
workers in executive boards. The results suggest that the reform increased
the share and number of highly educated native workers in these positions.
The estimated effect is sizeable: the likelihood that a native holds a top-tier
position increases by 18 percent relative to the pre-reform average. We do
not find evidence of an effect on the share of lower educated natives working
  43
    We impose similar sample restrictions and use similar definitions regarding skill
groups, worker characteristics, and geography as in the labor market analysis with the
SSES data (see Appendix B.1).

                                         46
in top management positions. These findings suggest that high-qualified
native workers were more likely to become top-tier managers, possibly as a
consequence of the imperfect substitutability with CBW. Using a different
identification strategy, Basten and Siegenthaler (2019) also find that the
immigrant inflows in Switzerland in the 2002–2011 period caused natives to
move towards jobs with higher managerial content.

Notes: This table shows the effect of the free movement policy on mean log hourly real wages of highly
educated natives in different management levels based on equation (1). Municipalities in the BR 30+

in a cell. Robust standard errors, clustered by commuting zone, are given in parentheses. ∗∗∗ , ∗∗ , ∗ ,

    How much of the positive reform effect on wages of high-qualified natives
can be attributed to the increase in the share of better-paying management
positions among them? We analyze this question in Table 6 using the SSES,
which also contains information about the management rank associated to
individuals’ jobs. The first column reproduces our baseline effect on the wage
of highly educated native workers in the free movement period. The next two
columns show that this baseline effect is concentrated in higher management
positions (column 2) in contrast to low/no management positions (column
3), corroborating the evidence that the reform increased the demand for


                                                    47
workers in executive positions. In column 4, we calculate wages for highly
educated natives holding the share of workers in management positions at its
1998 level. In this case, the estimated wage effect only amounts to 70% of the
actual wage effect (cf. columns 1 and 4). This simple calculation indicates
that roughly 30% of the wage growth of high-qualified natives arises because
they moved to higher management positions.

8     Conclusion
This study sheds light on the effects of fully opening the Swiss labor market
to CBW on the number and types of cross-border workers hired in Switzer-
land, on wages and employment of native workers, and on the number,
employment, sales, productivity, and innovation activities of Swiss firms.
Empirically, we exploit the sequential introduction of the free movement of
persons and the fact that CBW mobility affected Swiss regions close to the
border earlier and more strongly.
    We show that the greater availability of CBW produced a progressive
and significant increase in their employment in municipalities close to the
border, while it had virtually no effect beyond 30 minutes driving distance
from the border. Nevertheless, natives working in municipalities close to the
border did not experience a statistically significant reduction in average log
hourly wages, log employment, or log number of full-time equivalents after
the liberalization, relative to municipalities further away from the border.
Instead, we find evidence that wages of highly educated natives increased
as a consequence of the reform, despite the fact that two thirds of the new
CBW were also highly educated. We show that the positive wage effect
resulted from pushing some of the natives to managerial and high-paying
occupations, from stimulating productivity and job growth in incumbent
firms, from attracting new firms, and from promoting firms’ innovation ac-
tivities. Most of these effects are most prominent in skill-intensive sectors
and in firms that revealed shortages of skilled workers before the reform.



                                     48
Overall, our evidence is consistent with growth in number of jobs sufficient
to absorb the CBW inflow without native displacement or wage decline.
   Our results have at least three important insights that future research
could extend. First, they highlight the important role of firms in determining
the labor market effects of immigration. The policy changes affected the dy-
namics of capital investment, firm growth and productivity, indicating that
firms recognized the opportunities created from a better access to highly
skilled CBW. Second, our findings corroborate claims of business leaders
that opening the border for foreign workers can benefit firms’ performance.
There has been little systematic research whether and which firms profit from
increased access to foreign workers. Third, our results suggest that the grad-
ual and predictable implementation of the reform may have played a central
role in enabling adjustments by firms that allowed absorbing the increased
supply of CBW. We encourage further studies that focus on changes in im-
migration policies to gain insights how immigration policy can foster firms’
success without harming the labor market opportunities of native workers.

A     The Swiss labor market around the time of the reform
During the first half of the 1990s, Switzerland experienced a prolonged phase of economic
stagnation. Employment fell by 3% between 1991 and 1996 and registered unemployment
increased to 5% in the mid-1990s. This unemployment rate was high in a historical perspective.
Switzerland had official unemployment rates of almost 0% during many years of the post-war era.
Consequences of the restructuring process associated with the economic stagnation in the early
1990s were an increasingly human capital-intensive economy and changes in the occupational
and industrial structure, leading to an increase in the relative demand for skills (Puhani, 2005).
    The macroeconomic situation improved in the late 1990s, with GDP picking up and the
official unemployment rate falling below 2% in 1998. In this recovery, Swiss firms increasingly
reported that they struggle to find suitable skilled workers. At the same time, the skill mix
of new immigrants improved substantially relative to earlier periods (Beerli et al., 2017). The
macroeconomic situation worsened when the dot-com bubble burst. Switzerland entered a phase
of economic stagnation between 2001 and mid-2003. Unemployment increased to 3.5%.
    The stagnation phase ended towards the end of 2003. Switzerland entered a relatively
extended boom phase with high GDP growth rates, falling unemployment, and very high em-
ployment growth relative to previous years. Even the Great Recession of 2007/2008 left only
small marks in Switzerland. After a drop in 2009, the Swiss economy recovered fast and strongly.
GDP grew at 3% in 2010, more than offsetting the fall in the year before. Employment growth
also picked up substantially in 2010 after a stagnation in 2009.
    Overall, the number of employees increased by 15.2% between 2003 and 2013, from 4.2 to
4.8 million persons. A large part of this increase in employment was attributable to increased
employment of EU workers. Switzerland’s growth in hours worked in this period was remarkable
even in international perspective. For instance, Germany, for which the recent surge in employ-
ment has been the subject of several studies, had lower employment growth than Switzerland
from 2002 to 2013. Remarkably, Switzerland had high employment growth despite solid real
wage increases. Siegenthaler et al. (2016) dubbed this phenomenon the Swiss “job miracle”.

B     Data construction
Table A.1 provides an overview of the data sets, their samples, variables, and unit of analysis,
as used in the labor market and the firm-level analysis, respectively.

B.1    Sample construction and variables used for labor market analysis
Swiss Earnings Structure Survey The analysis of the reform effects on immigration
and on wages and employment of native workers is based on data from the Swiss Earnings
Structure Survey (SESS). The SESS is a stratified random sample of private and public firms
with at least 3 full-time equivalents from the manufacturing and service sectors. It is available
in even years between 1994 and 2010 and covers between 16.6% (1996) and 50% (2010) of total
employment in Switzerland. We restrict the sample and define the key variables as follows:

    • Sample restriction in the SESS : The sample includes individuals with age between 18 and
      65 years working in the private sector with non-missing information on nationality, place
      of work, education, wages, full-time equivalents, and other basic demographics. We only
      keep workers employed in private-sector firms, as the coverage of the public sector is not
      complete throughout our analysis period.

    • Definition of immigrants and natives: The group we call resident immigrants hold either
      an L permit (4 to 12 months) or a B permit (1 to 6 years). Cross-border workers hold a
      G permit. Natives are individuals with Swiss nationality, either born in Switzerland or
      naturalized. The foreign-born individuals with a permanent residence permit (C permit)
      can be considered as long-time immigrants. This group excluded in our analysis, although
      they could reasonably be considered as native residents. We exclude them because some
      immigrants are likely to switch from an L or B permit to a C permit within our sample
      period. As we do not observe these changes in our data, we would have individuals
      that switch between immigrants and natives within the sample if we included long-time
      immigrants. Reassuringly, however, our labor market results are very similar if we count
      long-time immigrants as natives.

    • Construction of real hourly wages and full-time equivalent employment: The dataset con-
      tains the gross monthly wage for each individual worker (in the month of October) in
      Swiss Francs. This measure includes social transfers, bonuses, and one-twelfth of ad-
      ditional yearly payments. We divide this measure by the number of hours worked in
      October, and use the consumer price index to deflate it into the real hourly wage of
      an individual worker at 2010 constant prices. When analyzing wage outcomes we trim
      our sample by excluding individuals with wages above the 99th percentile of real hourly
      wages in each year. We express full-time equivalent (FTE) employment as a fraction of
      the number of hours worked by a full-time worker, so that one unit is FTE.

    • Assignment to border region and driving time to border : We use an official crosswalk
      from the Federal Statistical Office (FSO) to link zip codes of work places of workers in
      the SESS to municipalities. As the number of municipalities (and zip codes) changed over


                                               55
       time due to mergers, we use the municipality definition in year 2000 as a time-invariant
       unit. Observations with outdated zip codes that could not be linked (less than 0.3%)
       were dropped. We allocate municipalities to the border region and the non-border region
       as defined below for the firm-level analysis. Similarly, we use driving time to the nearest
       border crossing calculated for establishments di in the business census (BC) averaged at
       the municipality level as dm using establishment employment in 1998 as weights.

    • Firm tenure: Firms were asked to indicate each employee’s affiliation with the firm in
       number of years. In the raw data, workers with less than one year of firm tenure are coded
       with a missing value between 1994 and 2002. Hence, we cannot distinguish workers with
       zero and missing values of firm tenure in these years.44 To adopt a consistent, albeit
       imperfect, definition of firm tenure, we recoded all missing and zero values to one in all
       years.


Swiss Labor Force Survey Since we cannot track individuals across years in the SESS, we
use the Swiss Labor Force Survey (SLFS) as a complementary data set to investigate to which
degree the effects on local employment can be decomposed into effects on in- and outflows
of regional employment and their net effect (see Table A.11 discussed in Appendix C). The
SLFS is the equivalent of the US Current Population Survey and was conducted in the second
quarter of the year in our period of interest. It covers roughly 17’000 individuals (or 0.5% of
households) prior to 2002 and about 50’000 (1.5%) from 2002 onward. As information on their
municipality of work is available from 1996, we use yearly data between 1996 and 2009. In this
period, most individuals were interviewed up to five consecutive years. We consider, however,
only individuals’ information in two consecutive years as only this sample is of meaningful size.
Using information on the labor force status, place of work and other individual characteristics
in two consecutive years, we can decompose the change in total private sector employment of
natives in education group e in municipality i into its net-flows (in- minus outflow):

                       Lei,t+1 − Lei,t = N etf lowi,t+1,t
                                                  e
                                                          = Inei,t+1,t − Outei,t+1,t           (BA.1)

Individuals are considered as inflows to local employment in municipality m in year t + 1,
(1) if they were employed in another municipality in the same distance bin in t, (2) if they
were employed in a municipality located in another distance bin in the border region (0-15,
15-30, > 30 minutes) or in the non-border region in t, (3) if they were not employed (ei-
ther unemployed or out of the labor force) in t, or (4) if they were not in the sample. The
latter group includes all individuals who were not covered in the SLFS or who were in the
SLFS but did not belong to group e, e.g. they had another nationality status than native,
they were not employed in the private sector, they were not in the relevant age range (18-64),
they had a different education level, or they had a missing value in any of these variables.
Outflows of local employment between year t and t + 1 are coded analogously. Using indi-
  44
    From year 2002 onward, the survey instructed employers to indicate ”zero years” in case a worker
was employed less than one full year. No such instruction was given in the years 2000 and 1998. In 1994
and 1996, they were instructed to round to full years.

tween 1998 (the base year) and T is then just the cumulative of the total yearly net-flows to
this municipality which can be disaggregated into net-flows from components (1) to (4) i.e.
                  P −1                            P −1              e,c

                           N etf lowi,t+1,t                N etf lowi,t+1,t .
    In the difference-in-difference regression framework with outcomes in levels, we can approx-
imate the change in the log employment of a municipality by with its employment growth, i.e.
the change in employment in between 1998 and year T standardized with its employment in

from (1)-(4) as follows:
                                          P −1               e,c
              Lei,T      Lei,1998   [ 4c=1 Tt=1998                  ] + Lei,1998 Lei,1998

                                                   N etf lowi,t+1,t
                        − e       =                                             − e                     (BA.2)

out of the sample (column 5), [ t=1998 N etf lowi,t+1,t +Lei,1998 ]/Lei,1998 .


    In subsection 7.6, we exploit the rich information in the SLFS to construct the share of
workers by education group e working in top executive boards (“Direktion/Geschäftsleitung”)
of a firm. Similarly as for the analysis of in- and outflows, we only use the years 1996-2009 in
which we have information on the municipality of work of individuals.

B.2       Sample construction and variables used for firm-level analysis
Our firm-level estimation are based on the innovation surveys (IS) and the Swiss business
censuses (BC). In the IS, the raw data contains answers for 1989, 2172, 2586, 2555, 2141,
2363, and 2034 firms for the seven years of the survey, representing an average response rate of
35%.45 Moreover, the following comments on the construction of our analyses samples should
be mentioned. Ruffner and Siegenthaler (2017) provide extensive sensitivity checks that show
that our main results are not sensitive to imposing these sample restrictions:

    • Sample restrictions in the BC : Our analyses with the BC are based on all firms that
         participated in the censuses 1991–2011. We exclude establishments from the agricultural
         sector as well as public sector firms, as these sectors are not covered in the other datasets
         used in the analysis. Since the censuses do no provide information on the split between
         foreign and Swiss workers in 1991 and 2011, the results on the foreign employment share
   45
        The questionnaires can be downloaded from www.kof.ethz.ch/en/surveys.

                                                              57
  are restricted to the 1995–2008 period. Moreover, the BC in 2011 is based on register
  data. Many variables available for the earlier waves are no longer available because of
  this change. Consequently, we update certain firm characteristics in 2011 using data from
  the same establishments in 2008.

• Deletion of microfirms in the BC : In the BC, we discard firms with less than 3 FTE in
  1998 in order to conform with the sample restrictions in the SSES. The population of
  firms sampled in the IS is firms with 5 or more FTE workers.

• Outliers: In both datasets, we discard a very small number of extreme outliers that have
  a strong leverage on the precision (not the point estimate) of the estimates. In the IS,
  we delete a small number of observations that report to have relocated from one year to
  another and at the same time report large changes in sales. Closer inspection of these
  cases revealed that most of them have implausibly large changes in sales and employment
  in one year. It is likely that some of these cases are due to changes in the reporting unit
  (e.g. from firm to establishment or vice versa). In the BC, we compute deviations from
  within-firm means in log FTE employment and discard all firms with observations that lie
  above the 99.9% quantile or below the 0.1% quantile of the distribution of this variable.

• Assignment of municipalities to border and non-border region: The border region is clas-
  sified based on official documents of the Swiss Federal Statistical Office. In cases where no
  official documents were available, the classification is based on direct information gathered
  at cantonal statistical offices. The border region is slightly differently classified compared
  to previous studies (Losa et al., 2014) in the canton of Valais, based on information pro-
  vided by the statistical office of the canton of Valais. All municipalities in the region
  Upper Valais and Lower Valais until Saint-Maurice (St-Gingolph, Port-Valais, Vouvry,
  Vionnaz, Collombey-Muraz, Monthey, Troistorrents, Val-d’Illiez, Champéry, Massongex,
  St-Maurice, Mex, Evionnaz, Salvan, Finhaut, Martigny-Combe, Orsières) are classified as
  border region. The other municipalities in the canton are classified as non-border region.
  The results are, however, not sensitive to the differential treatment of these municipalities.

• Computation of distance to nearest border crossing
  For each unit (establishment or firm), we construct the distance (travel duration) to the
  nearest border crossing (di ) in minutes. In the BC, these computations are based on the
  exact geographic coordinates of each establishment. In the IS, we use the zip code the
  questionnaire was sent to. We assign each establishment/firm to the location observed in
  1998. The data on the location of border crossings in Switzerland necessary to construct
  di come from Henneberger and Ziegler (2011) and refer to the year 2010. We also use the
  BC 1995 and 1998 to compute an employment-weighted distance to the border for each
  municipality.

• Assignment of units to border and non-border region: In the BC, we assign establishments
  to the border and non-border region based on the municipality code of each establishment.
  In the KOF innovation data, we assign firms to the BR and CR depending upon the

                                            58
  address the survey was sent to. Because the unit of observation is a firm and not an
  establishment in the IS, multi-establishment firms are assigned to a treatment or control
  group based on the location of their headquarters. In both datasets, we exclude a very
  small number of firms located in municipalities where we could not establish whether they
  belonged to the BR or CR.

• Measurement of establishment entry and exit: In every wave of the BC, an establishment
  is considered a new entrant if its establishment identifier is new. Exiting establishments
  are those whose identifiers disappears in the next BC wave. There are two reasons why we
  observe establishments with new establishment identifiers in the BC. The first is the actual
  creation of a new firm. The second is that a firm is created by a merger of incumbent
  firms. The former represents the large majority of cases. We count the number of entering
  and exiting establishments per municipality and BC wave to construct their share relative
  to the total number of establishments in a municipality in 1998. We analyze the effect on
  entrants using the years 1991–2008. For exiting establishments we use the years 1991–
  2011. We cannot use the census in 2011 in the firm entry analysis because this census
  uses a more encompassing definition of what counts as an establishment compared to the
  previous censuses. Therefore, many establishment entries between 2008 and 2011 result
  from the change in the definition, and we cannot identify those.

B.3      Construction of Bartik control
The Bartik control is a proxy for industry-driven local demand shocks. It absorbs local vari-
ation in employment or wages (by education group) resulting from national level changes of
sectors which are strongly represented in a particular region. In other words, if, for instance,
employment in a given industry increased (decreased) nationally, areas in which that industry
represented a significant share of employment must have experienced a positive (negative) rel-
ative change in the demand for workers relative to those where that industry is not present.
The Bartik control is defined at the level of the “commuting zone”, which is an aggregation
of municipalities often used to represent local labor markets. There are 106 commuting zones
in the whole of Switzerland. We define the sector-driven employment growth for group e in a
commuting zone cz in year t as:
                                                                                         !
                            e             X                                e

1994 and year t for the industry nationally, excluding the commuting zone cz.46
     When we consider the wage as outcome, we use a Bartik measure also based on national
wage growth:                                                                         !

growth for that group on the national level (excluding commuting zone cz). Wage growth is
aggregated using each industry’s employment share in 1990 scz,i,1990 taken from the national
Census.

C        Analysis of worker flows
To interpret the estimates of the reform effects on wages and employment by natives as causal,
workers in the control group must not be affected by the inflow of CBW due to the reform.
This condition would be violated if native workers responded to the inflow of CBW by moving
from treated to the control municipalities or vice versa, hence questioning our assumption that
the latter constitute a valid control group.47

    46
      From the list of industries, we dropped the industry ‘Recycling’ which was not available in all years.
    47
      In the case of flows from the treatment to the control region, employment would increase in the
control region and wages would fall, attenuating (overstating) the effects on wage (employment) that
the regional comparison in the DiD may detect (see discussion in Dustmann et al. (2017)). The absence
of strong negative employment effects on any group of native workers in our case make this particular
concern less plausible. However, flows of highly skilled natives in the reverse direction, from the control
region to the treatment region as a response to the inflow of CBW, could be consistent with the positive
wage and employment effects we find, if effects from human capital externalities outweigh competition
effects among highly skilled (see e.g. Moretti, 2004).

                                                         61
   To investigate the importance of such worker flows, we use the Swiss Labor Force Survey, a
complementary data set available yearly between 1996 and 2009. Most individuals in the SLFS
were interviewed for two consecutive years. We exploit information on each worker’s place of
work and employment status in the previous year (next year) to total calculate the number of
workers flowing in or out of local employment. This allows decomposing a municipality’s change
in local employment between 1998 and any other year T into the sum of yearly net-flows (1)
from employment in other municipalities in the same distance bin, (2) or from other distance
bins (including the control group, the BR 30+ or the NBR), (3) from non-employment or (4)
from out of the sample between 1998 and T .48
   The estimates presented in Appendix Table A.11 show no differential changes in total net-
flows in both treatment regions compared to both control groups (BR 30+ in panel I.A and NBR
in panel II.D). For highly educated natives, the increase we observe in their employment when
the BR 30+ constitutes the control group is consistent with an increased net-inflow from non-
employment. When municipalities in the NBR constitute the control group, however, estimates
do not allow a clear conclusion. For lower educated workers changes in employment are generally
lower and the estimates effects on their net-flows are not very robust across different control
groups. These results are consistent estimates in column 6, which shows that the reform did
not lead to significant changes in population size of municipalities in the treated regions.




  48
     The last category, for instance, includes workers that move to public sector employment, drop out
of our age range 18-64, etc. See Appendix B.1 for details on construction of these variables.

Notes: The panel plot the sequence of effects, and associated 95% confidence intervals, of the free movement policy on
highly treated private-sector firms. The event studies are based on separate regressions of equation (2) using either of
the two control groups (municipalities in the BR located more than 30 travel minutes to the border and municipalities
in the NBR), as indicated in the legend. The regressions in panel A are based on establishment-level data from the BC
1991–2011. The dependent variable is log total FTE employment. The dependent variable in panel B is log total sales
earned in year before the innovation surveys (IS) 1996–2013. The dependent variable in panel C is log value added per
FTE worker in the year before the IS 1996–2013. The dependent variable in panel D is the IHS of the number of patent

 Notes: The figure estimates the effect of the free movement policy on FTE employment of incumbent establishments
 using private-sector establishment-level data from the BC. It plots event study coefficients and associated 95% confidence
 intervals for highly treated establishments based on equation (2), estimated separately by establishments’ broad sector of
 economic activity. The regressions control for establishment fixed effects, year fixed effects, and linear NUTS-II trends.
 The control group is establishments in the NBR. In panel A, the dependent variable is log FTE employment. In panel B,
 it is FTE employment of foreigners as a share of total employment in 1998. In panel C, it is FTE employment of Swiss
 nationals as a share of total employment in 1998. The samples cover the 1995–2008 period because the BC in 1991 and
 2011 do not contain information on workers’ nationality. All regressions are weighted using average establishment size (in
 FTE). Standard errors are clustered by commuting zone. Figure A.3 provides the same regressions for an approximate log
 outcome.

Notes: The figure plots the sequence of effects, and associated 95% confidence intervals, of the free movement policy on
FTE employment of highly treated private-sector firms. The event studies are based on separate regressions of our main
regression model using one of the two control groups (municipalities in the BR located more than 30 travel minutes to
the border and municipalities in the NBR). The regressions are based on establishment-level data from the BC 1991–2011.
The dependent variables are log total FTE employment and the inverse hyperbolic sine     p (IHS) of establishments’ FTE
employment of Swiss and foreign nationals. The IHS of outcome y is IHS(y) = ln(y + 1 + y 2 ). The IHS approximates
the log of an outcome but has the advantage that it is defined at 0. All regressions control for establishment fixed effects,
year fixed effects, and NUTS-II trends. The regressions are weighted using average establishment size (in FTE) as weight.
Standard errors are clustered by commuting zone.

Notes: The figure studies whether the effects of the free movement policy depend on firms’ export status. The coefficients
are estimated using a version of our baseline regression model (equation (1)) augmented with interactions between our main
treatment indicators (i.e. F reet × I(di < 15)) and indicator variables for the respective export shares. The regressions are
based on firm-level data from the IS 1996–2013. We control for firm fixed effects, year fixed effects, and NUTS-II trends.
The sample is restricted to the BR. The dependent variables are firms’ log total sales, log value added per FTE worker, and
the probability to file a patent application in the three years before the survey. Panel A uses our baseline firm sample in the
IS. Panel B is restricted to manufacturing. Standard errors are clustered by commuting zone. The two subfigures show that
the estimated reform effects are similar between firms with different initial export share. The exception is the patenting
effect that is driven by firms with intermediate export share. This, however, results from the fact that the patenting effect
is concentrated in manufacturing firms, which in Switzerland are more likely to export than the rest of the firms. If we
focus on the manufacturing sector only, the patenting effect has no obvious relationship to firms’ export status (panel B).

Notes: This table shows descriptive statistics of native workers, cross-border workers and resident immigrants in 1998
and their change between 1998 and 2010. In Panel A, occupations are categorized into high-, middle- and low-paying
occupations according the mean wage in 1998 (see Table A.4). Panel B reports the main coefficient of individual-level
(Mincer) regressions of the log hourly wage on a dummy for cross-border workers. The sample includes natives and CBW
only and is based on the years 2004–2010. All regressions control for age, age squared, marital status, sex and three
education groups (tertiary, secondary, primary or less). Row (i) additionally includes municipality and year fixed effects.
Row (ii) further adds year-specific establishment fixed effects interacted with fixed effects for 24 occupations in the SESS.
Row (iii) also adds interactions with tenure. The table is based on sample restrictions outlined in 3.1. This is the reason
why the number of CBW reported in this table deviates from the numbers on CBW reported in section 2. SESS data.

 Nuts-II trends
Notes: This table shows the effect of the free movement policy on the number of immigrants in an occupation standardized
by total local employment in 1998 based on regression specification (1). Municipalities in the BR 30+ constitute the
control group. The total number of immigrants is split into 24 mutually exclusive and exhaustive occupations categories
available in the SESS. Workers with missing occupation information are allocated to the category “other occupations”.
Occupations are categorized into the high-, middle- and low-paying according the mean wage in 1998. The last row in each
panel indicates the change in the number of immigrants in an occupation relative to the total number of workers in that
occupation in 1998, δeo . To this end, the coefficient δ o ≡ F reet · (di ≤ 15) is scaled with δeo = δ o × (Empi,1998 /Empoi,1998 )
where Empi,1998 is the average total employment and Empoi,1998 is the average occupation group specific employment,
both in municipalities in the border region in 1998. F reet is one from year 2004 onward. The coefficients for the transition
phase are included but not shown for brevity. (di ≤ x) and (y < di ≤ z) indicate whether a municipality is located less than
x travel minutes or between y and z travel minutes from the next border crossing, respectively. Regressions are weighted
using the total number of workers in 1998. Robust standard errors, clustered by commuting zone, are given in parentheses.
∗∗∗ , ∗∗ , ∗ , denote statistical significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% level, respectively. SESS data.

       Nuts-II trends
Notes: This table shows the baseline effect of the free movement policy on wages and employment of natives by education
group based on regression specification (1). In column 1–3, the dependent variable is the mean log hourly real wage
by education group. The dependent variable in column 4-6 is the log number of native full-time equivalents worked by
natives by education group. In panel A (panel B), municipalities in the BR 30+ (the NBR) constitute the control group.
T ransitiont is one for the period between 2000 and 2003, whereas F reet is one from year 2004 onward. (di ≤ x) and
(y < di ≤ z) indicate whether a municipality is located less than x travel minutes or between y and z travel minutes
from the next border crossing, respectively. Regressions are weighted using the total number of natives in a cell. Robust
standard errors, clustered by commuting zone, are given in parentheses. ∗∗∗ , ∗∗ , ∗ , denote statistical significance at the
1%, 5% and 10% level, respectively. SESS data.

   Year/Area fixed effects
Notes: This table documents the robustness the reform effect on wages and employment of natives by education group
based on regression specification (1). In column 1, the dependent variable is the total number of immigrants standardized
by total employment in 1998. In column 2–4, the dependent variable is the mean log hourly real wage by education group.
The dependent variable in column 5–7 is the log number of native full-time equivalents worked by natives by education
group. Panel A repeats estimates from the baseline specification as in Table A.5 including Nuts-II regional trends. Panel
B adds the Bartik measure, computed separately for wages (Column 2–4) and full-time equivalents (Column 1, 5–7) by
education group, as control for sector-driven trends as specified in Appendix B.3. Panel C instead includes full interactions
of fixed effects at the level of Nuts-II regions and years instead of regional trends. In Panel D NUTS-II trends are omitted.
Panel E uses the baseline specification and the sample includes only two-digit industries that are unaffected by the bilateral
agreements according to a classification by Bühler et al. (2011). F reet is one for municipalities in the border region after
2004. (di ≤ x) and (y < di ≤ z) indicate whether a municipality is located less than x travel minutes or between y
and z travel minutes from the next border crossing, respectively. Distance interactions with the transition phase are
omitted for brevity. Regressions are weighted using the total number of natives in a cell. Robust standard errors, clustered
by commuting zone, are given in parentheses. ∗∗∗ , ∗∗ , ∗ , denote statistical significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% level,

Notes: This table shows the robustness of the reform effect on wages and employment of natives by education group based
on regression specification (1). In column 1, the dependent variable is the total number of immigrants standardized by total
employment in 1998. In column 2–4, the dependent variable is the mean log hourly real wage by education group. The
dependent variable in column 5–7 is the log number of native full-time equivalents worked by natives by education group.
Panel A repeats estimates from the baseline specification as in Table A.5 with the BR 30+ as control group. In Panel B-E,
Geneva, Basel, Lugano, and Zurich, respectively, are omitted from the sample (using the BR 30+ as control group). F reet
is one for municipalities in the border region after 2004. (di ≤ x) and (y < di ≤ z) indicate whether a municipality is
located less than x travel minutes or between y and z travel minutes from the next border crossing, respectively. Distance
interactions with the transition phase are omitted for brevity. Regressions are weighted using the total number of natives
in a cell. Robust standard errors, clustered by commuting zone, are given in parentheses. ∗∗∗ , ∗∗ , ∗ , denote statistical
significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% level, respectively. SESS data.

Notes: This table shows the robustness of the reform effect on wages and employment of natives by
education group based on regression specification (1). In column 1, the dependent variable is the total
number of immigrants standardized by total employment in 1998. In column 2–4, the dependent variable
is the mean log hourly real wage by education group. The dependent variable in column 5–7 is the log
number of native full-time equivalents worked by natives by education group. Panel A repeats estimates
from the baseline specification as in Table A.5 with standard errors, clustered by commuting zone. In
panel B and C standard errors are clustered at the level of municipalities and Cantons, respectively. In
panel D, we report standard errors based on the Spatial Heteroscedasticity and Autocorrelation Consistent
(SHAC) variance estimator initially proposed by Conley (1999) and recently advanced by Colella et al.
(2018). This estimator allows for correlation between areas that are geographically close but belong to
different regional units. Following Dustmann et al. (2017), we use a uniform kernel and a bandwidth of
100 kilometers. F reet is one for municipalities in the border region after 2004. (di ≤ x) and (y < di ≤ z)
indicate whether a municipality is located less than x travel minutes or between y and z travel minutes
from the next border crossing, respectively. Distance interactions with the transition phase are omitted
for brevity. Regressions are weighted using the total number of natives in a cell. ∗∗∗ , ∗∗ , ∗ , denote

Notes: This table shows the effect of the free movement policy on native employment, their cumulative net-flows into from
local employment and on native population based on regression specification (1). In column 1, the dependent variable is
native employment in municipality m in year t divided by native employment in 1998 in the same municipality. Changes
in total employment can be decomposed into four cumulative net-flows components (column 2–5). See Appendix B.1 for
details on the construction of these variables. In column 2, the dependent variable is the cumulative net-flow (inflow minus
outflow) from other municipalities in the same distance bin (0-15, 15-30, 30+ or NBR) standardized by total employment
in 1998. In column 3, the dependent variable is the cumulative net-flow from municipalities in other bins. Column 4 shows
cumulative net-flows from non-employment (unemployment or out of the labor force). Column 5 shows cumulative net-flows
from a residual category other (out of the sample, age range, missing values, etc.). In column 6, the dependent variable is
the population in municipality m in year t standardized by its population in 1998. In Panel I.A to I.C municipalities in
the border region farther away than 30 minutes constitute the control group. In Panel II.D to II.F municipalities in the
non-border region are the control group. F reet is one from year 2004 onward. (di ≤ x) and (y < di ≤ z) indicate whether
a municipality is located less than x travel minutes or between y and z travel minutes from the next border crossing,
respectively. Distance interactions with the transition phase are omitted for brevity. Regressions are weighted using the
total number of natives 1998. Robust standard errors, clustered by commuting zone, are given in parentheses. ∗∗∗ , ∗∗ , ∗ ,

Notes: The table shows average firm characteristics using data from the KOF innovation surveys 1996 and 1999. Entries
represent averages per region of all firm-year observations in the surveys. We differentiate firms that differed in the extent
to which they reported that their innovation efforts were negatively affected by a “shortage of specialized personnel”.
The original variable has a 5-point Likert scale. Firms that have “no shortage” are firms with a less than 2, “moderate
shortage” firms have a value between 2 and 4, and “high shortage” firms have a value greater than or equal to 4. High-tech
manufacturing is NACE rev. 1.1 industries 24 and 29–35 excluding 35.1. “Highly hampered by LMRF” are firms that
reported that their innovation efforts were strongly negatively affected by labor market regulation for foreigners in 1996
and/or 1999.

Notes: Each panel contains separate regressions of our baseline firm-level DiD model (specification 1) using the IS 1996–
2013, augmented with one or several interactions between indicators for subgroups of firms and T ransitiont ∗ I(di ≤ 15),
T ransitiont ∗ I(15 < di ≤ 30), F reet ∗ I(di ≤ 15), and F reet ∗ I(15 < di ≤ 30). In the table, we focus on the effects on
highly treated firms in the free movement phase. The indicators refer to firm size (in terms of FTE employment, panel A),
whether the firm operates in an industry with a cross-border worker share exceeding 10 % in 1998 in the BR (panel B), and
firms’ export share in sales (panel C). All regressions account for firm fixed effects, period fixed effects, and linear trends
per Nuts-II region. The dependent variable in column 1 is firms’ log total sales. The dependent variable in column 2 is
firms’ log value added per FTE worker. The dependent variable in column 3 is the inverse hyperbolic sine of the number of
patent application filed by the firm in the three years preceding the survey. F reet is a dummy equal to one from year 2004
onward. I(di ≤ x) indicate whether a firm is located less than x travel minutes from the next border crossing. Standard
errors are clustered by commuting zone.

     Notes: This table shows the robustness of the effect of the free movement policy with separate regressions, based
on the baseline firm/establishment-level specification 1 using the BC (columns 1 and 2) and the IS (columns 3–6).
All regressions account for establishment (BC) or firm (IS) fixed effects and period fixed effects, and all include linear
trends per NUTS-II region (except panel C). The dependent variables are equivalent to those in Table 4 of the paper.
The estimations in columns 1 and 2 are weighted using establishments’ average size (in FTE). Panel A repeats our
baseline results. In panel B, highly and slightly treated firms are compared to establishments/firms in the non-border
region (NBR). Panel C excludes the linear trends by region that are part of our baseline specification. In panels D,
E, and F, we control for industry-period fixed effects (FE), NUTS-II-period FE, and canton-period FE, respectively.
The regressions in panel G is not restricted to private-sector firms present throughout 1991–2011. Instead, we include
firms that enter and exit in the sample period. Panel H focuses on the cross-section of firms/establishments existing
in 1998. Panel I includes the few outliers dropped from the main samples. The regressions in panel J are restricted
to two-digit industries that are unaffected by the bilateral agreements according to the classification by Bühler et
al. (2011). F reet is a dummy variable equal to one from year 2004 onward. I(di ≤ x) and I(y < di ≤ z) indicate
whether a firm is located less than x travel minutes or between y and z travel minutes from the next border crossing,
respectively. The variables capturing the transition effects are included in the regression but omitted for brevity. Standard
errors are clustered by commuting zone. ∗∗∗ , ∗∗ , ∗ , denote statistical

Notes: This table shows the robustness of effect of the free movement policy on firm outcomes with alternative standard
errors. All panels contain separate regressions of our baseline models specification (1) based on the IS data (see Table 4 for
information). In panel A, standard errors are clustered on the level of commuting zone (our baseline strategy). In panels
B, C, and D standard errors are clustered on the firm, cantonal and two-digit industry (NACE rev. 2) level, respectively.
In panel E, we report standard errors based on the Spatial Heteroscedasticity and Autocorrelation Consistent (SHAC)
variance estimator proposed by Conley (1999). This estimator allows for correlation between areas that are geographically
close but belong to different regional units. Following Dustmann et al. (2017), we use a uniform kernel and a bandwidth of
100 kilometers. Transition interactions are included in the regression but omitted for brevity. All regressions account for
establishment/firm fixed effects, period fixed effects, and linear trends per NUTS-II region. ∗∗∗ , ∗∗ , ∗ , denote statistical
significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% level, respectively.

Weights
Notes: The table presents robustness of the results of firm-level regressions specification (1) using the IS 1996–2013 and
different weighting schemes. The dependent variables are firms’ log FTE employment (columns 1 and 2), log total sales
(columns 3 and 4), log value added per FTE worker (columns 5 and 6), and a dummy equal to 1 if a firm filed at least
one patent application in the three years preceding the survey (columns 7 and 8). The regressions in odd columns are
unweighted, those in even columns are weighted using average firm size (in FTE) as weight. All regressions account for firm
fixed effects, period fixed effects, and linear trends per NUTS-II region. T ransitiont is a dummy equal to one between 1999
and 2003, whereas F reet is one from year 2004 onward. I(di ≤ x) and I(y < di ≤ z) indicate whether a firm is located

Notes: This table shows the robustness of effect of the free movement policy on firm/establishment outcomes using alter-
native sample restrictions. Each panel contains separate regressions of our baseline firm/establishment-level specification
1 using the BC (columns 1 and 2) and the IS (columns 3–6). All regressions account for establishment (BC) or firm (IS)
fixed effects, period fixed effects, and linear trends per NUTS-II region. The dependent variable in column 1 is full-time
equivalent (FTE) employment of foreigners as a share of total employment in 1998. The dependent variable in column 2 is
establishments’ log FTE employment. The dependent variable in column 3 is firms’ log FTE employment. The dependent
variable in column 4 is firms’ log total sales. The dependent variable in column 5 is firms’ log value added per FTE worker.
The dependent variable in column 6 is a dummy equal to 1 if a firm filed at least one patent application in the three years
preceding the survey. In each panel, we drop observations from a particular city case by case. Standard errors are clustered
by commuting zone. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

   Nuts-II trends
 Notes: The table presents results of firm-level regressions specification (1) using the IS 1996–2013 and exploiting hetero-
 geneity with respect to pre-reform shortage of R&D workers. The dependent variable in column 1 is a dummy equal to one
 if a firm reports to have R&D activity. The dependent variables in columns 2 and 3 are the Inverse Hyperbolic Sines (IHS)
 of the number of R&D workers and R&D expenditures, respectively. The dependent variable in column 4 is a dummy
 equal to 1 if a firm filed at least one patent application in the three years preceding the survey. The dependent variables in
 columns 5 and 6 are dummies equal to one if a firm reports to have introduced at least one process or product innovation
 in the three years preceding the survey. Process innovation refers to the implementation of a new or significantly improved
 production or delivery method. A product innovation is defined as the introduction of a good or service that is either new
 or a substantially improved version of a prior good or service. The dependent variable in column 7 is the firms’ sales share
 of new or significantly improved products. All regressions account for firm fixed effects, period fixed effects, and linear

Notes: The table studies whether the immigration reform affected establishment entry and exit. All estimations are run at
the municipality level using BC data and are restricted to the BR. The dependent variable in columns 1–5 is the number
of new establishments in t as a fraction of the number of establishments in 1998 in the sector. The estimation sample is
based on the BC 1991–2008. The dependent variable in columns 6 is the number of establishments exiting between t − 1
and t as a fraction of the number of establishments in 1998 in the sector. The sample is based on the BC 1991–2011 in
this case. All regressions account for municipality fixed effects, period fixed effects, and linear trends per NUTS-II region.
T ransitiont is a dummy equal to one between 1999 and 2003, whereas F reet is one from year 2004 onward. I(di ≤ x)
and I(y < di ≤ z) indicate whether a firm is located less than x travel minutes or between y and z travel minutes from
the next border crossing, respectively. Regressions are weighted using the municipality-specific number of establishments
in the sector in 1998 as the weight. Standard errors are clustered by commuting zone. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

Notes: This table studies whether multi-establishment firms grow disproportionately in establishments closer to the border
by including a full set of firm-period effects into the otherwise standard DiD model, specification 1. The effects are
thus identified only from the comparison of establishments within the same firm. The estimation sample is private-sector
establishments in the BC 1995–2008 (columns 1 and 2) and 1991–2011 (columns 3 and 4). The dependent variable in
columns 1 and 2 is full-time equivalent (FTE) employment of foreigners as a share of total employment in 1998. Columns
3 and 4 show the corresponding results using log FTE employment as dependent variable. The regressions do not contain
establishment fixed effects. Instead, we control for region fixed effects, i. e. a dummy equal to one for each of the
four relevant regions (border region 0–15, 15–30, and 30+ minutes from the border, non-border region). We also relax
the restriction that an establishment needs to be present 1991–2011 somewhat (since the number of firms with several
establishments present throughout the 20-year period is very small). Instead, we focus on all establishments existing at
least in 1995–2005. We observe larger increase the foreign employment share and FTE employment in highly treated
establishments relative to establishments further away from the border even within the same firms. Standard errors are
clustered by commuting zone. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

Notes: The table studies the effect of the free movement policy an firm’s export status based on firm-level specification 1
and the IS 1996–2013 using both control groups. The dependent variable in columns 1 and 2 is a dummy equal to one if
a firm exported in the year before the survey. The dependent variable in columns 3 and 4 is firms’ export share in sales
in the year before the survey. T ransitiont is a dummy equal to one between 1999 and 2003, whereas F reet is one from
year 2004 onward. I(di ≤ x) and I(y < di ≤ z) indicate whether a firm is located less than x travel minutes or between
y and z travel minutes from the next border crossing, respectively. All regressions account for firm fixed effects, period
fixed effects, and linear trends per NUTS-II region. Standard errors are clustered by commuting zone. ∗∗∗ , ∗∗ , ∗ , denote
statistical significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% level, respectively.

     Notes: The studies the effect of the free movement policy on firms’ perception of policy related obstacles to innovation based on our baseline specification (1). In the IS 1996–2011, firms
     were asked whether different policy-related factors had a negative effect on their innovation efforts. We built 9 dummy variables from the original Likert-scale survey items. The dependent
     variables are dummies equal to 1 if a firm gave a value of 4 or 5 to a specific innovation obstacle. Panel A is based on firms in the BR only. Panel B includes firms in the NBR into the
     control group. All regressions control for firm fixed effects, year fixed effects, and NUTS-II trends. T ransitiont is a dummy equal to one between 1999 and 2003, whereas F reet is one from
     year 2004 onward. I(di ≤ x) and I(y < di ≤ z) indicate whether a firm is located less than x travel minutes or between y and z travel minutes from the next border crossing, respectively.
     Standard errors are clustered by commuting zone. Cluster-robust standard errors in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1

Notes: This table shows the effect of the free movement policy on the share and the number of natives who are board
members of firms based on regression specification (1). The dependent variable in column 1–2 is the share of native workers
who are board members within an education group. In column 3 and 4, the dependent variable is log number of native
board members or their full-time equivalents, respectively, by education group. F reet is one for municipalities in the
border region after 2004. (di ≤ x) and (y < di ≤ z) indicate whether a municipality is located less than x travel minutes or
between y and z travel minutes from the next border crossing, respectively. Distance interactions with the transition phase
are omitted for brevity. Regressions are weighted using the total number of natives in a cell. The share of board members
in each panel is computed using the pre-1999 average in each panel. Robust standard errors, clustered by commuting zone,
are given in parentheses. ∗∗∗ , ∗∗ , ∗ , denote statistical significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% level, respectively. SLFS data
