                                         ABSTRACT

To gauge the amount of portfolio inflows a country can expect to receive, we create a benchmark,
a longer-term baseline path around which actual flows fluctuate. The relationship between our
benchmark and actual flows is quite strong for emerging market economies (EMEs). For our
sample of 28 EMEs, there is a significant long-run relationship between actual portfolio flows
and our benchmark, flows adjust strongly toward the benchmark, and our benchmark helps
predict one-year-ahead changes in inflows. For advanced economies (AEs), results are less
impressive, but again the benchmark performs well in directional forecasting exercises. In
practical terms, it is informative to distinguish between movements toward the benchmark as
opposed to movements away from the benchmark. An example: While portfolio inflows to both
Asian EMEs and Latin America plummeted in 2015, our benchmark analysis correctly predicted
that inflows should rebound in Asia (because flows had fallen far below the benchmark) but stay
near the new, low level in Latin America (where the sharp decline in inflows was back to
benchmark levels). We provide similar analysis for 45 countries, both advanced and emerging,
for the 2000 to 2017 period.

1. Introduction

        In late 2016 many wondered whether the 2015/16 slowdown in capital flows represented a

post-crisis retreat from financial globalization or simply a temporary decline in cross-border flows.

Globally, annual portfolio inflows averaged only US$785 billion per year in 2015/16 (Table 1), well

below the average of the preceding five years and even below the amounts during the Global

Financial Crisis (GFC). For EMEs, 2015/16 inflows resembled the amounts received during the

GFC and were sharply lower than in the 2010-14 period (Figures 1 and 2).

        But how does one judge, in real time, if a slowdown in flows is abnormal (suggesting it

might be temporary) or if the preceding period of elevated flows was abnormal (suggesting the

slowdown is actually the “new normal”)?

        The analysis of international capital flows often compares flows in a recent period to flows

in some past period. For example, the entire sudden stops and surges literature (see Calvo (1998)

and Forbes and Warnock (2012) among many others) is built on a comparison of recent flows

against historical levels. Milesi-Ferretti and Tille (2011), in documenting the Great Retrenchment of

capital flows, compare a pre-crisis period with the collapse and recovery periods, while IMF (2016)

focuses on the slowdown in flows during the 2010-15 period and the Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2017)

analysis of cross-border positions compares pre-crisis (2007) to their latest data point (2015). And

both Bussière, Schmidt and Valla (2016) and McQuade and Schmitz (2016) compare a pre-crisis

period with the more recent “new normal”.

        The existing literature is rich in insights, but leaves readers wondering what level of capital

flows should be characterized as “normal”. Bussière et al. (2016, page 16), for example, concludes

that “it is hard to gauge if the pre-crisis properties and specificities of the various types of

flows…will prevail in the ‘new normal’….The changes that have taken place since the global




                                                     1
financial crisis may correspond to a simple normalization, as suggested…by Coeuré (2015), after

rather ‘exuberant’ times in the pre-crisis period.”

        Temporal comparisons of capital flows would be enhanced if there was a benchmark that in

some sense defined “normal”. Conceptually, there can be many possible benchmarks, and no

obvious way to choose among them, but we would like our benchmark to be simple and intuitive

while providing a time-series reference to pin down low-frequency “normal” movements around

which actual flows will deviate. We prefer to stay clear of benchmarks that are purely statistical; we

are not interested in a benchmark that is derived from a statistical trend, nor in one that is overly

complicated and may perform well on the forecasting margin but is wholly unintuitive. Rather, we

would like a benchmark that builds upon a fundamental framework or stylized narrative and enables

some rationalization and explanation of why deviations from the benchmark are likely to be

transitory. Ideally, deviations from our benchmark should help forecast the medium-term path of

international capital flows.

        An example of a benchmark in another strand of the international finance literature helps set

the stage. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is an accepted benchmark for exchange rates, at least

between advanced economies (AEs). PPP (and its building block, the law of one price) captures an

intuitive long-term arbitrage in product markets and enables a narrative based on a potential

mechanism of adjustment, rather than just an empirical trend. There is empirical evidence

supporting reversion to PPP (although deviations have a sizable half-life). And PPP is not unique

among exchange rate benchmarks; others include Balassa-Samuelson and FEER, and each

"benchmark" will produce a specific quantification of an exchange rate gap or misalignment.

Examples from the real side of the economy include benchmarks for economic activity (potential

GDP), unemployment (natural rate or NAIRU), and interest rates (the natural rate of interest, r*).

Each has origins in economic theory, each is an estimate subject to discussion and debate, and when


                                                      2
considering their pros and cons it can be said that each serves as a benchmark to which measured

data can be compared. PPP, potential GDP, NAIRU, and r* are worthy examples. What is an

appropriate benchmark for capital flows?

         In this paper we create a benchmark. Our measure of benchmark portfolio flows is intuitive:

It is the amount of new money available for international capital flows (that is, rest-of-the-world

savings) allocated according to past portfolio weights. Our benchmark is also consistent with theory;

in particular, our benchmark is analogous to the Tille and van Wincoop (2010, henceforth TvW)

“portfolio growth” component of capital flows in which new savings is invested at steady state

portfolio shares. 1 The TvW portfolio growth component maps into a long-run benchmark

calculated as the amount of new funds available for investing—for portfolio investments, the

amount of new funds available to commit to investments (whether domestic or foreign) is this year’s

new savings—allocated according to some pre-determined rule analogous to TvW’s zero-order

portfolio weights. We create benchmark portfolio inflows for a wide range of countries (17 AEs and

28 EMEs) for the 2000-2017 period. We focus on portfolio flows—bond flows, equity flows, and

the sum of the two—because it is for portfolio flows that this notion of a benchmark is most

appropriate. 2

         Thus, the amount of new funds available to invest (whether at home or abroad) is given by

the flow of new savings and benchmark flows are those new savings allocated using zero-order




1
  Kraay and Ventura (2000, 2003) first proposed “portfolio growth” flows in an analysis of current account balances
(i.e., net capital flows). The Kraay and Ventura (2000, 2003) contributions to this literature are fundamental, but our
benchmark is more closely related to Tille and van Wincoop (2010) and their focus on gross flows.
2
  Two things to note. One, while we have more than 17 AEs in our dataset, we collapse the Eurozone into one unit
and so have only 17 AE “countries”. Two, we hope that future work might create benchmark flows for other
components of international capital flows. For direct investment (DI), there is a natural analogy to our construction
of benchmark portfolio flows; we provide some thoughts on this in the conclusion. For banking flows, it is less clear
how to think about a benchmark (or even what BOP-based banking flows represent), but a step might be found in
McCauley et al. (2017).

portfolio weights. There are undoubtedly other plausible benchmarks. But, as we show graphically

and empirically, our benchmark has many desirable features.

        As a preview, we show actual flows and our benchmark for two regions (Figure A).

Benchmark flows should not be mistaken as trend lines, as they are derived from investor countries’

macroeconomic conditions. They do appear to be a “natural line” or long-run anchor around which

actual flows oscillate. And what is apparent in the figure is also evident in empirical analysis, as we

will show that inflows—especially EME portfolio inflows—adjust to the benchmark both in sample

(as shown in error correction models) and out of sample (in year-by-year directional forecasts and in

model-based forecasts of recent flows).

            Figure A. Benchmark and Actual Portfolio Inflows for EME Asia and Latin America
                                     (annual, in billions of US$)




        Having a benchmark provides context when investigating sharp movements in capital flows.

For example, EME Asia’s portfolio inflows plummeted from US$155 billion in 2014 to US$20

billion in 2015 (Figure A). Was the sharp decline in inflows surprising? Without a benchmark, one
                                                    4
can only state (and analyze) the extent of the slowdown compared with some previous period. But

Figure A reveals that the slowdown pushed EME Asia’s portfolio inflows below our benchmark,

suggesting that the 2015 slowdown would likely be reversed (which indeed occurred in 2016/17). In

contrast, the sharp 2015 decline in Latin America’s portfolio inflows was a return to benchmark

levels, so our analysis suggests that 2016 and 2017 flows should be similar to those in 2015, which

they were. The recent dynamics of portfolio inflows into Latin America and EME Asia highlight an

important feature of our analysis: Having a benchmark enables the differentiation of sharp

movements away from benchmark levels from sharp movements toward the benchmark. The former

(movements away from the benchmark) are likely temporary, whereas the latter (movements toward

the benchmark) are likely to be sustained.

       The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses how we create benchmark flows, Section

3 compares actual and benchmark inflows through a series of graphs and descriptive analysis,

Section 4 presents statistical evidence on both the long-run relationship between actual and

benchmark inflows as well as the benchmark’s value in out-of-sample forecasting exercises, Section

5 presents some illustrative regressions of country-level deviations from the benchmark (i.e., the

difference between actual flows and benchmark flows), and Section 6 concludes.



2. Forming Benchmark Portfolio Flows

2.1 The Framework

   In our opinion a benchmark should have the following features:

   •   It should be simple and intuitive while providing a time-series reference to pin down low-

       frequency “normal” movements around which actual flows will deviate.




                                                  5
    •   It should build upon a fundamental framework or stylized narrative that enables some

        rationalization and explanation of why deviations from the benchmark are likely to be

        transitory.

    •   Ideally, deviations from the benchmark should help forecast the medium-term path of flows.



The first two desirable characteristics push us toward a benchmark that is at least roughly consistent

with the Tille and van Wincoop (2010, TvW) notion of portfolio growth flows. TvW develop a two-

country dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model in which gross capital flows are

endogenous. For our purposes, an important feature of the TvW model is the notion of portfolio

growth flows: “The portfolio growth component captures capital flows that result when saving is

invested in line with the zero-order portfolio shares.” 3

        This notion is intuitively appealing, as the flow of new savings is precisely the amount of new

funds available for foreign (or home) investment. Portfolio growth flows are simply the gross flows

that would occur if those new funds are allocated according to zero-order portfolio weights. Other

flows occur. In the language of TvW, actual gross flows are the sum of zero-order, first-order and

second-order flows. The zero-order flows, essentially the flows that would occur absent any shock

to expected returns and risk, are our benchmark. Shocks occur—in TvW first- and second-order

portfolio weights (and, hence, the related flows) are reallocations due to shocks in expected returns

and risk—and thus actual flows deviate from benchmark flows. But a plausible benchmark is one in

which new funds are allocated according to zero-order portfolio weights.




3
 The quote is from page 163 of TvW. Two things to note. One, the portfolio allocation model of Devereux and
Sutherland (2011) has a similar zero-order steady-state notion. Two, the model in TvW is a two-country model and
hence says nothing directly about allocations across foreign markets, so our benchmark concept can best be
described as “in line with” TvW. Finally, see also Ahmed et al (2018) for a practical application that decomposes
gross portfolio outflows using the insights of TvW.

In (1) and (2) 𝜔𝜔𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜,𝑡𝑡 , the bilateral portfolio weight between o and d (specifically, the weight of d in o’s

portfolio), can be formed using holdings data from the IMF’s CPIS dataset, which reports the

bilateral portfolio (bond and equity) holdings of about 60-80 origin countries starting in 2001.

          Another way of forming country d’s total benchmark inflows is to use aggregate ROW (“rest

of the world”) data, where the weights are ωROW,d,t, or the weight of destination country d in ROW

portfolios:



                  𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏_𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝

Portfolio weights in (3) can be formed using Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2017) data on the stock of

portfolio equity and portfolio debt liabilities, available annually for a wide range of countries starting

in roughly 1995. 4

         Portfolio weights, whether using the bilateral approach (eq. 2) or the ROW approach (eq. 3),

also require data on savings and a scale factor for portfolios. For origin countries’ savings (in billions

of US$) we use data in IMF WEO; specifically, we multiply national savings rates by country-level

data on GDP in billions of current US$. To scale origin countries’ portfolios, we take a broad view

and consider each country’s stock of total financial assets (TFA), which is available from McKinsey

Global Institute (MGI). 5 Specifically, to create the size of a country’s portfolio, we add its net

foreign assets to its TFA, effectively subtracting out foreigners’ claims on the country’s TFA and

adding the country’s claims on other countries’ TFA. For the ROW version of our benchmark, we

simply subtract the destination country from global TFA and global savings. For example, the ROW

weight on Thailand’s equities equals the stock of Thailand’s portfolio equity liabilities (that is, ROW

holdings of Thai equities) divided by ROW total financial assets (global financial assets less the sum

of Thai financial assets and Thai net foreign assets).



2.2 The Details: Practical Choices when Forming a Benchmark

         Equations (2) and (3) look simple enough but have a number of practical challenges that we

discuss in this subsection: how to create zero-order portfolio weights and whether to use the

bilateral or ROW approach (which in turn raises a question about how to deal with China).




4
  The Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2017) data start earlier than 1995, but prior to 1995 there is dramatically reduced
country coverage.
5
  Pulling primarily from publicly available sources, MGI calculates for a wide range of countries total financial
assets as the sum of a country’s equities, bonds and loans.

                                                           8
       2.2.1 Zero-order Portfolio Weights

       What exactly are the zero-order portfolio weights as of time t? In Devereux and Sutherland

(2011, pg. 350), zero-order portfolio holdings are “the equilibrium for portfolio holdings in a world

with an arbitrarily small amount of stochastic noise”. Similarly, in TvW the zero-order component is

the value when the volatility of shocks becomes arbitrarily small.

       We want our benchmark to be useful in real time—it should provide information on the

amount of flows a destination country d should expect to receive this year—and we are also

constrained by data (as described below, we only have about two decades of annual data). Given

those considerations, a 5-year lagged moving average of portfolio weights seems in line with the

TvW and Devereux and Sutherland (2011) notion of zero-order weights.

       In Figure B we illustrate, using the ROW approach, benchmarks a 5-year lagged moving

average of portfolio weights and two other weighting schemes: a simple one-period lagged weight

and a 3-year lagged moving average. The simple one-period lagged weight produces the most volatile

benchmark (the most volatile thin solid lines in Fig. B), but all three weighting schemes produce

broadly similar benchmark flows. We choose to calculate zero-order flows using a trailing 5-year

average of portfolio weights.

                                                    9
        2.2.2 ROW or Bilateral Approach

        The above is straightforward enough: Define zero-order portfolio weights and apply them to

savings. Different researchers might make slightly different choices on those aspects when creating

their own preferred benchmark, but the resulting benchmarks will likely be quite similar.

        The next decision is a bit more substantive: whether to use the ROW or bilateral approach.

There are pros and cons associated with both approaches. A strength of the bilateral approach is

that it attributes savings to origin countries according to each country’s exposure to the destination

country, which can be important if origin countries’ weights differ substantially for a particular

destination country. Weaknesses of the bilateral approach are that CPIS data exclude official

holdings (important for a reserve currency country like the US, but not for EMEs), have a

geographic bias due to the use of international financial centers, and do not include all of the world’s

origin countries. The omissions in the CPIS data are, in aggregate, substantial; as of end-2015 world

cross-border portfolio liabilities were $13.8 trillion greater in the LMF (2017) dataset than in the

CPIS data (Table A).

                                                                          LMF       CPIS

                Portfolio Equity Liabilities                              27.0       22.5
                Portfolio Debt Liabilities                                32.2       22.9

    Much of difference is due to reserves, which as noted are excluded from the CPIS; the rest must

be due to the omission of some origin countries. Thus, one strength of the ROW approach is that it

doesn’t rely on bilateral data (which isn’t complete). In addition, the ROW approach is consistent

with BOP capital flows data (which are also ROW). In practice, the ROW approach (equation 3)

                                                     10
creates larger benchmark flows; see Figure C for EME Asia and Latin America. Note that for EMEs

the much lower CPIS-based benchmark cannot be due to the exclusion of reserves in the CPIS as

these countries do not typically receive reserve flows. Perhaps the low CPIS-based series is because

some source countries are not included in the CPIS dataset. Whatever the reason, after considering

the pros and cons of both approaches, we employ the ROW (LMF) approach and use equation (3)

to create benchmark flows. 6

          2.2.3 The ROW Approach and China as a Source Country

          Once the decision to use the ROW approach is made, China as a source country presents an

additional complication. The ROW approach assumes that all ROW savings are allocated in the

same way—specifically, according to ROW portfolio weights. One particular country for which this

individual countries.
7
  Note that in Figure C, for an apples-to-apples comparison and so we can start the figure in 2002 (the year after the
first broad CPIS dataset), we use a single lag of portfolio weights to form benchmark flows.

simplification can be problematic is China, which creates a large portion of world savings (27% in

2015) while having comparatively little outbound international portfolio investment. As of end-2015,

according to LMF (2017) data, China’s portfolio equity assets and portfolio debt assets were each

less than 1% of the global aggregates. And even if one adds its $3 trillion in reserves to its stock of

portfolio debt assets, China’s bond holdings are still only 10% of the global aggregate, quite small

for a country that generates a quarter of global savings.

        To adjust for the disconnect between the importance of China in world savings and its

(limited) propensity to invest internationally we proceed in three steps:

             •   Construct an “exChina” benchmark that excludes China from ROW savings, which

                 greatly reduces the amount of ROW funds available for cross-border investment.

             •   Adjust flows for comparability of flows and the benchmark. Because China’s reserve

                 flows are included in recipient countries’ inbound portfolio flows BOP data, we also

                 need to reduce destination country actual bond inflows by an amount implied by

                 China’s overall reserve flows and COFER (Currency Composition of Official

                 Foreign Exchange Reserves) reserve currency weights. 8 This portion of our China

                 adjustment affects only seven ‘reserve currency’ countries—US, UK, Switzerland,

                 euro area, Japan, Australia and Canada—and in most years subtracts annual flows

                 ranging from to $11 billion in 2000 (across the entire group) to $480 billion in 2008.

                 In 2015 and 2016, when China’s reserves declined, this adjustment adds (across the

                 group of seven) $343 billion and $444 billion, respectively.




8
  That is, we allocate China’s reserve flows according to the weight of reserve currencies in overall “allocated”
reserves; see the IMF’s COFER site for details. In addition, we assume the reserve flows are into bonds, although
some (presumably small) portion is also in equities, and we are identifying “country” with “currency”, although
clearly China could (for example) purchase USD-denominated bonds issued by entities in other countries.

                                                        12
            •   Adjust ROW portfolio weights. For the seven reserve currency countries, we must

                reduce the ROW’s weight on their bonds by China’s implied bilateral official

                holdings.



        The above three points constitute our “exChina” adjustment to benchmark and actual flows.

For all countries, removing China from ROW savings will reduce benchmark inflows. For reserve

currency countries, further adjustments are made to both benchmark and actual bond flows; actual

bond flows are reduced every year except 2015 and 2016.

        Figure D shows benchmark and actual bond flows for the US, the country most affected by

China’s flows, using “exChina” series and raw series. With the exChina adjustment (Fig. D, left

graph), benchmark flows are less (because China’s savings are omitted and ROW’s weight on US

bonds are reduced) and actual flows are usually less (as we omit China’s implied reserve flows to the

US). For other countries the China adjustment is less pronounced.

        with the exChina adjustment                       without the exChina adjustment




        Our China adjustment seems the best that can be done given limited information on China’s

bilateral official and private holdings, but is not perfect in that on a bilateral basis we can only

                                                    13
compute implied China official flows and positions and we cannot remove private China flows from

recipient countries’ BOP flows and, hence, our actual flows. 9 All things considered, our baseline

benchmark will use the exChina adjustment. 10



2.3 The Benchmark: Connection to Global GDP and a Decomposition

         We note that regardless of practical choices that must be made when forming a benchmark,

our benchmark flows are directly connected to ROW economic conditions, arising (by construction)

from the flow of new ROW savings. The amount of new savings is of course closely related to

income—savings rates can vary year to year, but to a first approximation the level of savings is

driven by the level of income—so savings is highly correlated with GDP whether in levels (both are

flow concepts) or first differences (Figure 3). Thus, benchmark portfolio inflows for each country

will be closely related to ROW GDP, providing a baseline path that is connected to ROW

macroeconomic conditions.

         A reasonable question is which component—changes in ROW portfolio weights or the

evolution of new ROW savings—drives changes in our benchmark. The answer, shown in the last

graph of Figure 3, is both. From 2000 to 2017, benchmark inflows, summed across all countries in

our sample, increased by $2726 billion from $790 billion to $3516 billion. Fixing portfolio weights at

2000 levels (actually, the average of 1995-1999, as our benchmark uses a 5-year trailing average)

allows us to compute the amount of that increase that comes from the evolution of ROW savings



9
  China started reporting to the CPIS dataset in 2015, so there is no obvious way to strip out China’s private
portfolio flows back to 2000. We do not believe the inability to exclude China’s private flows impacts our analysis
much, as the entire stock of China’s outbound private portfolio investment—the type of positions picked up by the
CPIS—amounted to only $261 billion as of 2015, with much of that being invested in the US, Europe and Japan.
Compared to its over $3 trillion in official reserves, China’s reported private portfolio holdings are quite small.
10
   As we note in the conclusion, while the adjustment certainly affects analysis of flows into at least one country (the
US), none of our empirical results (presented in Sections 4 and 5) is materially affected by the exChina adjustment;
that is, the discussion of our empirical results does not hinge on using data with the exChina adjustment as opposed
to raw unadjusted data.

                                                          14
(depicted as the “fixed weight” dashed line in the last panel of Fig. 3). The “fixed weight”

benchmark increased $1181 billion over the 2000-2017 period, meaning that increased ROW

portfolio weights (from 10.6% in 2000 to 18.8% in 2017, which is one manifestation of the erosion

of the long-standing home bias) accounted for $1545 billion (or 57%) of the increase. Both

increased ROW portfolio weights and increased global savings have increased our benchmark flows.



3. Comparing Actual and Benchmark Portfolio Flows

       Figure 4 shows, for total portfolio (i.e., bond and equity combined) and, separately, for

equity and bond flows, actual (the thin line) inflows and benchmark inflows (the thicker line).

Benchmarks are based on a 5-year lagged moving average of portfolio weights and for both actual

and benchmark we use the “exChina” adjustment. Graphs are presented for EME Asia, Latin

America, US, Eurozone, EME Other and AE Other (see Table 1 for the composition of groups) for

the period from 2000 to 2017.

       The various graphs in Figure 4 indicate a few regularities of benchmark inflows. One, they

are positive; for benchmark flows to any country to be negative, annual ROW savings would have to

be negative. Two, while benchmark portfolio inflows declined during the global financial crisis

(because ROW savings fell), over time they tend to increase; absent a surge in home bias, an

expanding global economy and increasing global savings increase benchmark flows.



       EME Asia

       Actual portfolio flows to EME Asia were running higher than the benchmark in the years

prior to the GFC—the thin line (actual flows) line in Figure 4 was above the thick line (benchmark

flows) line through 2007—consistent with the elevated number of sudden surges (Forbes and

Warnock 2012) during that period. Actual portfolio flows to EME Asia decreased sharply during the


                                                  15
GFC, the Great Retrenchment documented in Milesi-Ferretti and Tille (2011). Following the GFC

portfolio inflows were again elevated, until they fell sharply in 2015 to below-benchmark levels. If

our benchmark is a reasonable long-run measure, we would expect portfolio inflows to EME Asia to

rebound from the very low 2015 levels, and in subsequent years they have.

       Turning to the components, we note that EME Asia’s bond inflows have been elevated

almost every year since 2003, with the only exceptions being during the GFC and in the 2015

slowdown. The 2015 slowdown in EME Asia’s bond inflows was a return to benchmark following

much higher than benchmark inflows during the 2010 to 2014 period; here we would have expected

EME Asia bond inflows to remain near the 2015 levels, but in the event they increased sharply (due

to large inflows into Chinese and Indonesian bonds). In sharp contrast are EME Asia’s equity

inflows which, while elevated pre-GFC, then oscillated around the benchmark before falling sharply

to below benchmark levels in 2015.

       In sum, the 2015 sharp slowdown in EME Asia portfolio inflows appears to have been a

temporary deviation from longer-term benchmark levels, largely because equity inflows fell far

below the benchmark, and thus our analysis suggests inflows should rebound. Flows did rebound

somewhat in 2016 and dramatically in 2017 due to a surge in bond inflows. Going forward, based on

our benchmark analysis, we expect equity flows into EME Asia to increase, bond inflows to

decrease, and overall portfolio inflows to decrease.



       Latin America

       Latin American portfolio inflows fell sharply in 2015/16, but for this region we expect

inflows to remain near current levels as recent Latin American portfolio inflows are in line with the

benchmark. The decline in Latin American inflows is solely due to a sharp drop in bond inflows

from the elevated level of 2010-14 to near benchmark levels, while equity inflows are slightly below

                                                  16
benchmark. Overall, with actual flows close to benchmark levels, we expect LatAm inflows to

remain near current levels.



        US and Eurozone

        Since the beginning of the Eurozone debt crisis and QE programs, inflows in both the US

and Eurozone have tended to stay below benchmark levels. For the Eurozone, the low level of

inflows is due to bond flows—Eurozone bond inflows were negative US$200 billion in 2017 when

the benchmark suggested US$200 billion in inflows—while equity inflows have recently rebounded.

For the US, bond inflows were quite low starting in the GFC and rebounded in 2012, whereas equity

inflows stayed near benchmark levels following the crisis but then fell substantially in 2013. Overall,

in 2017 the US received the benchmark amount of portfolio inflows, so while we expect bond

inflows to decrease and equity inflows to increase, the overall level of US portfolio inflows seems to

be a return to normal.



        Other EMEs and Other AEs

        Both of our “other” groups, which contain a number of important countries not elsewhere

classified, are experiencing near benchmark portfolio inflows, with below benchmark equity inflows

roughly offsetting above benchmark bond inflows. As such, we expect overall portfolio inflows to

both sets of countries to maintain current levels with equity inflows increasing and bond inflows

decreasing. More details on selected countries are provided next.



        Selected Individual Countries

        Country groupings can mask heterogeneity across countries, so in the appendix we present

benchmark and actual flows for selected countries (grouped by regions). Some countries (Australia,


                                                  17
UK, Mexico, and Poland) are at about benchmark levels for portfolio inflows and both components

(bonds and equities). Countries below benchmark for portfolio inflows and both components

include Brazil and Philippines, while countries at or above all their benchmarks are Canada,

Argentina, China, South Africa and Turkey. Some countries (India, Indonesia, Thailand) are

currently receiving large bond inflows that more than offset decreased equity inflows (and hence, in

sum, they are receiving sizeable portfolio inflows). Finally, Japan and Russia are currently receiving

benchmark-level portfolio inflows as strong bond inflows offset weaker equity inflows, while

portfolio inflows into South Korea and New Zealand are below benchmark levels.


4. Empirical Evidence on the Relationship between Actual and Benchmark Portfolio Flows

        The descriptive comparison of actual and benchmark flows provided in Section 3 suggests

that benchmark flows can be thought of as a longer-term baseline path around which actual flows

fluctuate. In this section we empirically evaluate the benchmark in two ways. First, we provide

formal tests of our benchmark’s long-run relationship with actual portfolio flows by conducting

panel cointegration tests and estimating error correction models (with particular interest in their

long-run coefficients and speed of adjustment parameters). Second, we assess the benchmark’s

performance in generating two types of out-of-sample forecasts, one model based (based on the

error correction model) and another directional.



4.1 Long-run Relationship between Actual and Benchmark Portfolio Flows

        Analogous to the PPP literature, we begin by evaluating whether actual and benchmark

flows are cointegrated. Table 2 provides results from two panel cointegration tests: Kao (1999) tests

that assume a common cointegrating vector and AR parameter across panels (top panel) and

Pedroni (1999, 2004) tests that allow for panel specific cointegrating vectors and AR parameters


                                                     18
(bottom panel). Each test has a null hypothesis of no cointegration, and we include panel fixed

effects while demeaning across panels to control for cross-sectional dependence. These tests have

relatively low power for samples of our size (in particular the limited time dimension) but provide a

useful starting point to evaluate the proposed benchmark.

        The Kao and Pedroni panel cointegration tests each provide evidence that total portfolio

flows are cointegrated with the benchmark. Splitting by asset class provides mixed results as the Kao

tests provide stronger evidence of cointegration for bond flows, while Pedroni tests suggest equity

rather than bond flows are cointegrated with the benchmark. Looking at the AE/EME splits, the

Pedroni tests provide stronger evidence of cointegration for the EME sub-sample.

        While Table 2 results provide evidence that there is a long-run equilibrium relationship

between actual and benchmark portfolio flows, one could argue that cointegration is a necessary but

not a sufficient condition for a suitable benchmark. More compelling evidence requires the use of

error correction models to estimate the long-run relationship and the degree to which actual flows

revert to the benchmark. Given the cointegration results in Table 2—in particular, the mixed results

for the components but strong results for total portfolio flows—we focus on total portfolio flows

and estimate pooled mean group models of the form:



          ∆𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 ∆𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + λ𝑖𝑖 �𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 − 𝜃𝜃𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 � + 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖   (4)



The pooled mean group estimator of Pesaran, Shin, and Smith (1999) constrains the long-run

coefficient θ to be constant across panels but allows for country-specific error correction terms (λi).

Table 3 provides estimates for the long-run coefficient θ on benchmark portfolio flows where the

coefficient on actual portfolio flows has been normalized to 1 (as in equation 4). A strong form test



                                                                 19
of the benchmark, analogous to absolute PPP, would require θ = 1 and imply stationarity of the

absolute difference between actual and benchmark flows.

         The strongest evidence in Table 3 is for EMEs, which perhaps is to be expected given the

visual descriptive evidence and statistical cointegration tests. For the EME sub-sample (column 3),

we estimate θ = 0.976, and a chi-square test fails to reject the null of θ=1, providing strong evidence

of a long-run relationship between the benchmark and actual portfolio flows. The speed of

adjustment parameter is negative and highly significant (λ=-0.751), suggesting that portfolio flows

rapidly revert toward the benchmark. 11 The error correction coefficient reported in column (3),

suggests, for example, that an EME experiencing portfolio inflows that exceed benchmark flows by

$10 billion should expect, ceteris paribus, a decline in flows of $7.51 billion in the following year. To

gauge whether the benchmark adjusts to flows, in column (4) we re-estimate the error correction

model for the EME sub-sample but with the change in benchmark flows as the dependent variable.

The positive and significant coefficient on the error correction term (λ=0.034) indicates that the

benchmark responds positively to close the gap with actual flows, but the size of the coefficient is

much smaller than in column (3), suggesting that the bulk of the adjustment is actual flows moving

toward the benchmark.

         Results for the full sample (column 1) and the AE sub-sample (column 2) are weaker. For

the full sample, we estimate θ=0.283 and strongly reject a null hypothesis of θ=1. In the AE sub-

sample (column 2) θ is insignificantly different from zero. Error correction terms are still large,

negative and statistically significant, but the fact that θ is quite small (full sample) or insignificantly

different from zero (AE sample) calls into question the error correction model for these samples. In

contrast, for the EME sub-sample we find strong evidence of a significant long-term relationship



11
  In Table 3, for ease of presentation we report the cross-panel average of λi. The panel specific estimates for λ is
negative and statistically significant (at the 5% level) for 22 of the 28 EMEs in our sample.

                                                          20
between flows and our benchmark. In particular, for EMEs portfolio flows adjust to close the

previous period’s gap between flows and the benchmark.



4.2 Using the Benchmark to Forecast Portfolio Flows

        In the descriptive comparison of actual and benchmark flows conducted in Section 3, we

suggest that the deviation between actual flows and the benchmark helps predict future flows. In

Section 4.1 we provide econometric evidence for that predictive power in the EME sample, based

on a statistically and economically significant cointegrating relationship between our benchmark and

actual portfolio flows. A natural next step is to test the out-of-sample forecasting ability of the

benchmark. We do this in two ways. First, we create model-based out-of-sample forecasts by

estimating the error correction model through 2014 and then forecasting flows for 2015, 2016 and

2017. Second, we evaluate the benchmark’s performance in a directional forecasting exercise; that is,

we test if the benchmark by itself is valuable in predicting whether inflows in the subsequent year

will increase or decrease.



        4.2.1 Model-based Out-of-Sample Forecasts for EME Portfolio Flows

        Our short sample of just 18 annual data points hinders our ability to evaluate model-based

out-of-sample forecasts. But we do so. Specifically, we re-estimate the pooled mean group error

correction model from column (3) of Table 3 using part of the sample (2000-2014) to capture the

average speed of adjustment parameter (λ) and then apply that estimated λ to predict flows for the

remaining years of data (2015, 2016, and 2017). Although the out-of-sample portion of this exercise

is quite limited, it does include the 2015-2016 slowdown and the 2017 bounce back, periods that

might be considered difficult to predict.

        We calculate the one-period-ahead forecast for the change in portfolio flows as follows:


                                                      21
                      ∆𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 𝑒𝑒 𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 = −0.694�𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 − 𝑏𝑏𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 �   (5)



where λ=-0.694 is from the model in Table 3 (column 3) estimated over the 2000-2014 period. Note

that (5) is not truly out of sample as we use the actual lagged deviation of flows from the

benchmark; that is, to predict 2016 flows we use the 2015 deviation of flows from the benchmark

(times the adjustment parameter).

        Figure 5a presents a scatterplot of the actual v. predicted change in portfolio flows for

EMEs during the years 2015, 2016 and 2017 (that is, 3 years for 28 EMEs or 84 observations in all).

The scatter plot reveals an impressive performance of the error correction forecasting model; the

correlation between actual and forecasted change in flows is 0.57 and most (59 of 84) observations

lie in the first and third quadrants (in which the forecasted and actual changes have the same sign).

We also do the same exercise for 2017 using λ=-0.744, the estimate using data from 2000 to 2016.

While the fit is less impressive (Figure 5b, correlation between actual and forecast is 0.13) because of

two outliers in the fourth quadrant—the model predicted that portfolio inflows received by both

China and Argentina would decrease in 2017 but they did not—in 20 of the 28 cases the model-

based forecast got the sign correct.



        4.2.2 Directional Forecasts

        In many cases directional forecasts—forecasts of the direction of a change in an economic

variable—can add considerable value, regardless of the statistical precision of the forecast. For

example, Leitch and Tanner (1991) argue that the value of forecasts to firms hinges on whether they

can increase profits, not whether the forecast’s root-mean-squared error is small. Similarly, Merton

(1981) notes that for evaluating market-timing performance, what matters is if the forecast correctly

predicts which will outperform, stocks or bonds, rather than the magnitude of the outperformance.

                                                             22
Schnader and Stekler (1990) extend Merton (1981) to assess the value of forecasts of whether

economic growth will slow or accelerate. In our context policy makers and market participants might

value the ability to forecast whether portfolio flows received by a particular country are likely to

increase or decrease from current levels.

        We next evaluate our benchmark’s performance in a directional forecasting exercise. We can

construct a simple benchmark-based forecast of the direction of the change in portfolio flows by

assuming that flows will adjust toward the benchmark. Specifically, the benchmark-based forecast of

next period’s change in flows is given by:



                      ∆𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 𝑒𝑒 𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 = −�𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 − 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 �   (6)



Forecast equation (6), a simplified version of equation (5) in which we no longer rely on the

estimated value of the error correction term, uses only predetermined variables and does not require

any estimated coefficients, so we are free from the constraints of a typical out-of-sample forecast

and can make a full set of forecasts for our entire sample period. To evaluate the ability of the

benchmark to correctly predict the direction of the change in portfolio inflows, we employ the

Pesaran and Timmermann (1992) non-parametric test of predictive failure, which in our case is also

a test of whether actual and forecasted changes are independently distributed. If our benchmark

predicts the direction of change in portfolio inflows in significantly more than 50 percent of the

cases, where significance is assessed using the Pesaran-Timmermann (P-T) statistic, we can reject

predictive failure (and the independence of actual and predicted changes) and conclude that the

benchmark is useful in predicting flows.

        The benchmark performs quite well. For 64% of the 474 EME observations the benchmark

correctly forecasts the direction of the change in portfolio inflows (top half of Table 4). This

                                                             23
performance is statistically significant, as the P-T test statistic of 6.35 strongly rejects the null

hypothesis of predictive failure (and the independence of actual and forecasted changes). For AEs

and in the full sample the benchmark also performs well, correctly forecasting the direction of the

change in portfolio flows for 67% of the AE 289 observations of 65% of all observations.

        The benchmark performs well in these one-period-ahead forecasts of directional change, but

one must wonder if a simple alternative forecast of reversion—a prediction that the change in flows

this period will be the opposite sign of the change in flows last period—also performs well. The

reversion forecast (bottom half of Table 4) has directional predictive power, correct 57%, 65% and

61%, respectively, for EMEs, AE, and the full sample. That said, all of the percent correct and P-T

statistics are higher for the benchmark forecast. 12



5. The Determinants of Deviations from the Benchmark

        Our benchmark flows are analogous to the TvW zero-order flows, but in the language of

TvW first-order and second-order shocks push actual flows away from the zero-order flows. In

TvW these shocks are associated with factors that would lead to changes in expectations of returns

and risk. We next provide a cursory empirical investigation into deviations from our benchmark,

including a standard set of explanatory variables that are at least loosely related to TvW’s first- and

second-order shocks.

        Specifically, to ascertain which factors are associated with short-term deviations in capital

inflows from the benchmark—that is, the gap between actual and benchmark inflows—we estimate

fixed effects panel regressions in an annual panel dataset that spans 2000 to 2015 and includes 19

EMEs (Table 5). The dependent variable, defined as the deviation (i.e., actual minus benchmark)



12
  Table 4 shows only total portfolio flows, but in untabulated results we note that the benchmark also performs well
(at the 1% significance level) for the bond and equity components.

                                                        24
divided by GDP, is for portfolio inflows, bond inflows, or equity inflows as indicated in column

headings. Independent variables include a parsimonious set of local variables—economic growth,

the IMF’s inflation forecast, MSCI equity returns, and capital controls—and some global variables

(U.S. 10-year Treasury yield, BBB-AAA risk spread, and the VIX). 13 While we view these regressions

as illustrative and not definitive, the results suggest that higher than normal EME portfolio inflows

occur when growth is strong, equity returns are high, and US Treasury yields and risk measures

(BBB-AAA spread or VIX) are low. Splitting by asset class we find that high equity returns are

associated with stronger than normal equity inflows while US Treasury yields and risk measures are

more closely linked to bond flows. 14



6. Conclusion

         In this paper we frame portfolio flows as fluctuating around some benchmark level. While

various notions of benchmark flows are reasonable, our preferred benchmark is simply the amount

of flows created if new ROW funds available for investments of any sort (i.e., new ROW savings)

are allocated according to lagged portfolio weights, analogous to the Tille and van Wincoop (2010)

notion of portfolio growth flows. 15

         Our benchmark flows, which arise from ROW macroeconomic conditions, represent the

flows that recipient countries should expect regardless of what occurs in the local economy. Of


13
   Capital controls, from Fernandez et al (2016) and specific to the type of inflow (portfolio, bond or equity), are
only available through 2015 and thus dictate the end date in the Table 5 regressions. Inflation forecast is a
component of the IMF (2016) real policy rate variable.
14
   The sample in Table 4 is limited to 19 EMEs based on the availability of equity returns. Excluding equity returns
allows the addition of other EMEs like Panama and Uruguay to bring the sample to 26 EMEs; this larger sample
generates a qualitatively similar set of results for the other explanatory variables, although we fail to find a
significant impact of risk measures on total portfolio flows.
15
   The reader will note that our preferred benchmark involves an adjustment for China. While we think that
adjustment is reasonable and it certainly changes the analysis for at least one country (the US, as shown in Fig. D),
none of our empirical results are materially affected by the adjustment. That is, if we conduct all empirical tests
using unadjusted data, results for Tables 2-5 and for the model-based out-of-sample forecasts (Fig. 5) are quite
similar to the exChina results shown in the paper.

course, actual inflows often deviate from benchmark flows—perhaps because of changes in local or

global conditions—but benchmark flows appear to be a longer-term baseline path around which

actual flows oscillate. The relationship between our benchmark and actual flows seems strongest in

EMEs. For our sample of 28 EMEs, error correction models suggest that actual portfolio flows

adjust strongly toward the benchmark and the benchmark performs well in out-of-sample forecasts

of flows.

       Overall, both our graphical and empirical results indicate that a comparison of actual and

benchmark flows provides a way to ascertain whether sharp slowdowns in capital flows are likely

temporary or long-lasting. For example, EME Asia’s portfolio inflows plummeted from US$155

billion in 2014 to US$20 billion in 2015, far below our benchmark, suggesting that the 2015

slowdown would likely be reversed (which indeed occurred in 2016/17). In contrast, the sharp 2015

decline in Latin America’s portfolio inflows was a return to benchmark levels, so our analysis

suggests that 2016 and 2017 flows should be similar to those in 2015 (which they were). In general,

our analysis enables the differentiation of sharp movements away from benchmark levels from sharp

movements toward the benchmark. The former (movements away from the benchmark) are likely

temporary, whereas the latter (movements toward the benchmark) are likely to be sustained.

       Our analysis is also relevant for the current debate on the existence of a global financial cycle

(see, for example, Rey (2013) and Cerutti, Claessens and Rose (2017) for two views). Our

benchmark flows are tightly connected to ROW GDP, suggesting they are also related to the global

business cycle; see Lumsdaine and Prasad (2003), Kose, Otrok and Whiteman (2003), Kose, Otrok,

and Prasad (2012), and Ductor and Leiva-Leon (2016), among many others, on comovements in

GDP across large economies. By extension, to the extent there is something that can be called a

global business cycle, our benchmark suggests there is, at least for benchmark flows, a global capital

flow cycle. Actual flows deviate from the benchmark and these deviations may well explain the


                                                  26
variation in flows (in an R2 sense), but the level of flows appears to be very much driven by

benchmark flows (which are tied to ROW global macro conditions).

       We close by urging others to conduct similar analysis of other types of capital flows. For

direct investment, applying our basic notion seems feasible. New funds available for DI are

corporate earnings—yes, companies can borrow to fund M&A activity, but new funds come from

the flow of corporate earnings—and thus to create benchmark DI flows one just needs to decide on

a pre-determined allocation rule. Similarly, we urge experts on banking flows to create benchmarks.

The top portion of the table presents results for Kao (1999) tests, which assume a common cointegrating
vector and AR parameter across panels. The bottom panel presents results for Pedroni (1999, 2004) tests,
which allow for panel specific cointegrating vectors and AR parameters. For all tests we include a panel fixed
effect and demean across panels to control for cross-sectional dependence. For Kao tests we report the
Modified Dickey-Fuller t-stat and for Pedroni tests we report the Modified Phillips-Perron t-stat, in each case
with p-values in parentheses. Sample is 2000-2017.

The table presents results from the Pesaran-Timmermann (1992) non-parametric test for the accuracy of a
directional forecast for the period from 2001 through 2017. The benchmark (BM) gap forecast is formed by

period will be the opposite of the change in flows last period: ∆𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 𝑒𝑒 𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 = −�∆𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 �. In each case
we present the fraction of observations for which the forecast correctly predicts the sign of ∆flows (% correct)
and the Pesaran-Timmermann (P-T) statistic, which is distributed normally and has a null hypothesis of no
directional predictive power. The 1% critical value for the P-T test is 2.33. The EME sample has two
observations fewer than 17 times 28 because we do not have 2000 benchmark amounts for Kuwait and
Romania.

Table 5. Determinants of Deviations: EMEs
Fixed effects panel regressions use an annual panel dataset that spans 2000 to 2015 and includes 19 EMEs.
The dependent variable, defined as the deviation (i.e., actual minus benchmark) divided by GDP, is for
portfolio inflows, bond inflows, or equity inflows as indicated in column headings. Independent variables
include local variables (economic growth, IMF inflation forecast, MSCI equity returns, and capital controls)
and global variables (U.S. 10-year Treasury yield, BBB-AAA risk spread, and the VIX). Constants are included
but not reported. Robust standard errors, clustered at the country level, are reported in parentheses. ***, **
and * denote significance levels at 1%, 5% and 10%, respectively.

Benchmark flows in this figure use the ROW approach with the exChina adjustment and a trailing 5-year
average for portfolio weights. “Global” is the set of countries in our full sample. The final chart depicts
benchmark flows along with its amount if portfolio weights were held constant at 2000 levels.
