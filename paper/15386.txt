                                             ABSTRACT

By providing feedback to customers on home electricity and natural gas usage with a focus on peer
comparisons, utilities can reduce energy consumption at a low cost. We analyze data from two large-scale,
random-assignment field experiments conducted by utility companies providing electricity (the Sacramento
Municipal Utility District (SMUD)) and electricity and natural gas (Puget Sound Energy (PSE)), in
partnership with a private company, Positive Energy/oPower, which provides monthly or quarterly
mailed peer feedback reports to customers. We find reductions in energy consumption of 1.2% (PSE)
to 2.1% percent (SMUD), with the decrease sustained over time (seven months (PSE) and twelve months
(SMUD)).

           Evidence from Two Large Field Experiments that Peer
       Comparison Feedback Can Reduce Residential Energy Usage

       I.      Introduction


       In this paper we analyze two field experiments conducted on a total of approximately
75,000 household customers of two utilities, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD)
and Puget Sound Energy (PSE). These utilities, in partnership with a private company, Positive
Energy/oPower, randomly assigned a subset of these households to periodically receive mailed
reports comparing their energy usage to that of nearby neighbors in similarly sized houses. We
find that households receiving Positive Energy/oPower’s reports make significant and lasting
reductions in their energy consumption.
       Studies that have tested the impact of peer comparisons on conservation have had mixed
results. For example, Goldstein, Cialdini, and Griksevicius (2008) have found that social norms
can increase towel reuse by hotel guests. Yet, in a literature review of the effect of feedback on
home energy consumption, Fischer (2008) notes that of the dozen studies that she reviews that
test the impact of comparisons to others, none had shown an effect. She attributes the failure to
the ―boomerang‖ problem, where informing individuals of typical peer behavior inadvertently
inspires those who have been under-estimating the prevalence of an activity to increase the
unwanted behavior. Cialdini, Kallgren, and Reno (1991) argue that combining injunctive norms
(norms that express social values rather than actual behavior) with descriptive norms can
neutralize the boomerang effect. Schultz, Nolan, Cialdini, Goldstein, and Griskevicius (2007)
conducted a randomized field study in San Marcos, California, of the effectiveness of social
norms messaging (alongside energy-saving tips) to reduce home energy consumption. They
found that combining the descriptive and injunctive messages (in this case, the emoticons  and
) lowered energy consumption and reduced the undesirable boomerang effect.
       The Positive Energy/oPower experiments build on the findings of the San Marcos study.
As in the San Marcos study, the Positive Energy/oPower reports use descriptive norms as well as
injunctive norms, such as  emoticons, to reduce consumption and in order to counteract the
boomerang effect. The Positive Energy/oPower experiments reported here, however, go beyond
the San Marcos experiment in a number of ways. First, the Positive Energy/oPower experiments
have a significantly larger sample size than in San Marcos, which included 290 households vs.
35,000 in the SMUD study and 40,000 in the PSE study. Second, the Positive Energy/oPower
studies also allow us to test multiple new aspects of the dynamics of energy use feedback:
 Measuring longer term impacts. Whereas the San Marcos study’s observation period was
    only one month, the SMUD and PSE experiments have twelve and seven months of data,
    respectively.
 Measuring daily impacts. Unlike the San Marcos study, the PSE experiment gives access to
    daily energy readings.
 Measuring impacts on both electricity and natural gas. The PSE experiment tested the
    effect of feedback on both electricity and natural gas usage, allowing a fuller picture of
    household energy use.
 Measuring impacts of different message frequencies (quarterly vs. monthly), different
    report content, and different envelope sizes.
Moreover, the Positive Energy/oPower experiments were conducted using a more realistically
scalable intervention. Instead of mailed reports, the San Marcos study used hanging
doorknockers with hand-drawn emoticons. Together, the SMUD and PSE experiments provide
compelling evidence that properly framed peer comparisons can predictably lower energy
consumption, particularly of the highest energy using households.


        II. SMUD Experiment


        Experimental design. The SMUD messaging experiment began in April 2008 and is
still ongoing; the results presented in this paper cover the period from April 2008 through April
2009.1 The sample includes 85,000 households who are customers of SMUD. To select
participants, Positive Energy/oPower filtered by census tract within SMUD’s footprint to
maximize the number of single family homes with more than twelve months of billing history,

 All the data in this paper, including data originally obtained from the utilities themselves as well as from third
parties, was generously provided to the authors by Positive Energy/oPower. SMUD has contracted with ADM &
Associates to independently assess the success of the program. In addition, Positive Energy/oPower engaged
Summit Blue to do its own evaluation of the SMUD result in May 2009. PSE plans to select a third party in October
2009 to conduct program measurement and verification services.
that were on standard rate plans (non-medical rate, non-photovoltaic), and that had a matching
parcel record with details about the home, such as house size and value.
       Once participants were selected, the randomization process used ―batch‖ assignment:
homes were randomly assigned to the treatment and control groups in 959 batches of census
blocks. These ―batch blocks‖ consist of 50 to 100 homes. 35,000 households were assigned to
the treatment group, and 50,000 were assigned to the control. Positive Energy/oPower used this
assignment methodology to increase the likelihood that neighbors would receive reports and
have the opportunity to discuss the reports with each other, thereby increasing the motivation for
taking actions to reduce home electricity consumption. The batch approach did have a drawback,
however, in that treatment and control groups differed on some pre-treatment attributes.
       All members of the treatment group received home energy reports on a periodic basis.
Each home energy report contains four key personalized components: 1) Current period neighbor
comparison: A bar chart comparing the household’s recent electricity use to a group of
comparable neighbors and ―efficient neighbors,‖ with both normative and injunctive messages
designed to motivate action; 2) Twelve-month neighbor comparison: A chart comparing the
household’s electricity usage to its comparable neighbors and ―efficient neighbors‖ over the last
twelve months; 3) Personal historical comparison: A section comparing the household’s usage in
the current year by month with the same months from the previous year; 4) Targeted energy
efficiency advice: tips selected based on the household’s energy use pattern, housing
characteristics, and household demographics. All reports were printed in color on a single 8½" x
11" sheet of paper. Examples of the elements of the front page of this report are included in
Appendix A3a and Appendix A3b.
       The 35,000 treatment households were then assigned to different sub-treatment groups
that varied the intervention. Some of the assignments were random, while others depended on
household characteristics. All households (test and control) were randomly assigned to one of
two different report template groups and one of two different envelope groups. The two report
template groups were ―graphical‖ and ―narrative.‖ Both templates included the same core
elements, including graphs with feedback information, but the narrative version (shown in
Appendix A3a and A3b) included a blurb of text explaining the charts, reinforcing the normative
messages, and highlighting tips on how to save energy (including both mentioning tips in the
blurbs and pointing the reader toward the personalized tips section on the back of the report).
The two envelope types tested included a standard business ―#10‖ envelope (similar to the
envelope used to deliver SMUD customer bills) and a larger 6" x 9" envelope. Envelope size did
not affect the envelope content, which was always printed on 8½" x 11" paper; but folded
differently to accommodate the different envelope sizes.
        Some elements of the treatment varied based on household characteristics. Households
were assigned to receive the reports either monthly or quarterly based on historical usage levels:
the 25,000 households with higher consumption levels were assigned to the monthly frequency
group, while the 10,000 households using less energy (< 21.85 kWh/day) were assigned to
receive the report quarterly. Households were also assigned to various tip segments based on
home characteristics (i.e. presence of a pool), which allowed for characteristic-contingent
targeting of energy efficiency messages.
        SMUD provided the basic data on energy consumption, including historical billing
information dating back to January 1, 2006 (over two years before the beginning of the treatment
in April 2008). Data on household parcel characteristics (such as square footage and home
values) comes from the Sacramento County Assessor’s Office.2 Household demographic data
(such as income level and length of residence) came from private direct marketing and data
aggregation service databases.


        SMUD Results. Appendix A1 investigates whether the sample is well-balanced between
the control and treatment groups. Since the randomization occurred at the census level, there
were statistically significant differences in some pre-treatment variables. For example, the
households in the treatment group on average were 16 square feet smaller and used .3 kWh per
day more in 2006 than the average control group households. A parallel analysis (also reported in
Appendix A1) of the sub-randomization of envelope size and the graphical/narrative template
shows that the data was well-balanced between these groups.
        Households in the treatment group that complained about receiving the Positive
Energy/oPower reports or who asked to stop receiving the report were allowed to opt out of the
treatment. Only 2% of the treatment group opted out of the experiment. The following
regressions, which retain these observations and which only control for pretreatment variables,

electric heat.
should be interpreted as ―intent to treat‖ effects. Unreported treatment on the treated (IV)
estimates were of similar in size and significance. In addition, similar proportions of treatment
and control households (8% and 7%, respectively (p. = .10)) closed their SMUD accounts due to
moving after the experiment began.
        Figure 1 reports the results from monthly regressions on approximately 83,500 household
observations where the log of monthly average kWh/day was regressed on a treatment group
indicator and a constant. As shown in Figure 1, the treatment group’s energy consumption
(relative to the control group) moved erratically before the start of the experiment (indicated by a
vertical line marking April, 2008). For example, the treatment group used more electricity than
the control group in February 2007 and less in June 2007, and these differences were statistically
significant. Still, even before other factors are controlled for, there was a significant drop in
energy usage for the treatment group relative to the control for all the months following the
initial report mailing.
        To account for factors besides the reports that may be driving the change in energy usage,
we control for house characteristics (square feet, age of house, presence of pool or spa, house
value, gas user, census tracts), household demographics (energy usage in 2006, length of
residence at particular house, number of residents, income, age, affluence), and the number of
cooling degree days and heating degree days 3. Figure 2 shows that after controlling for these
characteristics there was no systematic difference in energy usage between the treatment and
control groups. With the exception of one month in the pretreatment stage, the difference
between the energy usage of the control and treatment groups is statistically insignificant,
straddling 0%. After the first reports are arrived around April 15, 2008, we observe a significant
drop in the electricity consumption of treatment households relative to control households, on the
order of 1% in May 2008. The rapidity of this decline suggests that the reductions may be driven
by more ―behavioral‖ changes (such as turning off lights in empty rooms) rather than ―durable‖
changes (such as caulking or replacing inefficient appliances). There is a steady decline until
August 2008, where the treatment group saw a reduction in electricity usage by more than 2.5%.
The gap between the usage levels of the control and treatment groups then narrows in the fall

  Cooling degree days and heating degree days are based on a base temperature of 65 degrees. For example, a day
with an average temperature of 68 degrees will count as 3 cooling degree days. Similarly a day with an average
temperature of 62 degrees will count as 3 heating degree days.
months (Sept. 2008 – Nov. 2008), though the reductions made by the treatment group are still
significantly negative. After November 2008 the effect of the treatment grows in all months
except April 2009, with the greatest reduction in electricity consumption since the beginning of
the experiment (greater than 2.5%) occurring in March 2009, almost a year after the study first
began.
         To simultaneously investigate the impact of treatment across different months, we
―stacked‖ the house-month data and again regressed the log of average monthly kWh/day for
individual households on the controls reported in Table 1 (calculating standard errors by
clustering on household IDs). The interaction between treatment and the variable named ―After
first mailing (April ’08)‖ captures the effect of being in the treatment group after the start of the
experiment. The average effect of the treatment on energy reduction is significant and robustly
estimated in Table 1 at about 2.1%, with or without ancillary controls.
         To understand the impact of template styles and envelope size combinations, we
interacted these four variables with the treatment effect (Treatment x After first mailing) in a
regression with the full controls from Table 1. As shown in Figure 3, the graphic template sent in
a #10 business envelope reduced energy usage significantly more (nearly 3% relative to the
control group) than the other three combinations (each less than 2%). More exploration is needed
to determine why this combination of envelope size and template type had a stronger effect. One
possible factor is that the #10 business envelopes resemble the envelopes in which SMUD sends
its monthly bills, which may have inspired more individuals to open and read the
communication. Figure 4 reports the treatment effects separately for households who received
the reports monthly or quarterly from a parallel regression with full controls and interacting the
treatment effect with monthly and quarterly indicators. Because lower (higher) energy using
households were non-randomly assigned to receive reports quarterly (monthly), it is not
surprising that monthly recipients reduce their energy consumption by 2.35% while quarterly
recipients reduced their energy consumption by about 1.5%. As quarterly recipients had lower
energy use to begin with, they likely had fewer opportunities to easily reduce kWh.
         We also investigated whether the treatment effect varied for households with differing
demographics. To capture the effects of wealth, we used house value as a proxy. Figure 5 reports
the results of interacting the treatment effect with house value quintile indicators in a regression
with full controls. Every house-value quintile of the treatment group used statistically less
electricity than the control group; however the three lower-value quintiles had a reduction greater
than the average of 2.1%, while the two higher quintiles saw a decrease less than the average.
       We also investigated whether there were different treatment effects for households with
different levels of pretreatment energy usage adjusted by house size. We created deciles of
pretreatment energy usage per house square foot which was calculated using the usage fifteen
months prior to experiment, and again interacted these indicators with the treatment effect in a
regression with full controls. Figure 6 shows that households with larger pre-treatment usage
generally experienced larger percentage reductions from receiving the reports. Reductions
reported are relative to households from the same decile in the control group. In fact, the treated
households in the two lowest deciles of pretreatment energy users increased their energy usage.
It is possible that some of this phenomenon was driven by the fact that the households learned
that their peers were consuming more electricity, in what Cialdini, Kallgren, and Reno (1991)
have called the ―boomerang‖ effect. The presence of a boomerang effect contradicts the findings
Schultz, Nolan, Cialdini, Goldstein, and Griskevicius (2007) in the San Marcos study, where
lower-consuming households did not increase their energy usage. This boomerang effect is not a
necessary drawback of the treatment, however, as any program using peer feedback reports can
always omit sending reports to the lowest-consuming households. In this case, the boomerang
effect was overwhelmed by enhanced energy conservation in the other eight deciles. The highest
energy users reduced their energy consumption by nearly 7% relative to high energy users who
did not receive the report. It is not surprising that the households with higher historic usage per
square foot should see a larger impact from the reports, since they were more likely to receive a
message that they used more energy than their neighbors and were more likely to have
discretionary energy use that was easy to reduce.
       Table 2 estimates the potential yearly impact of the reports on both dollars saved and
energy conservation if SMUD were to send the reports to all of the households in its customer
base. At an average reduction of 2.35% for monthly recipients, the reports would reduce
consumption 211 kWh per year per household for a total savings of about $31 a year per
household (figures are based on SMUD system-wide average usage, which is about 2,000 kWh
per year lower than the average for households in the experiment). Quarterly recipients would
decrease their energy use by 130 kWh per year for a total annual savings of $13. If the nearly
593,000 households in SMUD’s customer base received reports using the same formula by
which SMUD treatment households were assigned to monthly or quarterly reports, we could
expect to see a reduction of over 110 million kWh in a year—the energy equivalent of saving
over 9 million gallons of gas. SMUD customers would save over $15.2 million on their energy
bills under the current SMUD rate plan. For every mailing in SMUD’s customer base, $2.57
would be saved for monthly recipients, and $3.29 for quarterly. Since, as shown in Figure 6,
higher energy users made significantly larger reductions in energy, it is likely that that targeting
reports at only higher energy consumers would be particularly cost effective. By our analysis,
SMUD could achieve a significant environmental impact by sending reports to all of its
customers. The reports would save the equivalent of nearly 80,000 metric tons of carbon
emissions. Quarterly reports produce a bigger energy saving per mailing (the equivalent of 1.43
and 2.64 gallons of gasoline per mailing for monthly and quarterly reports respectively).
       Including report information with the regular bill may make the feedback even more cost
effective. However, more research is needed into this question. It remains an open question
whether including the reports in the bill would in fact reduce production costs, as such
integration may require significant investments to change current legacy billing systems, which
are typically in black and white and do not allow for extensive customization and graphics.
Secondly, more research is needed to determine whether reports integrated into bills have the
same level of impact on conservation. Similarly, researchers should investigate the effectiveness
of electronic forms of delivery (such as email), which can further increase cost savings. Although
such forms of delivery are likely to impact fewer households than direct mail for the time being,
they promise significant production cost savings. Another approach to increasing the cost
effectiveness of feedback reports would be to only send reports to households where there was
not a danger of a ―boomerang effect‖ (here, the lowest two deciles of pretreatment energy users).


       III. PSE Experiment


       Experimental design.       In October 2008 Puget Sound Energy (PSE) and Positive
Energy/oPower launched another energy feedback report experiment in King County,
Washington. There were three major differences in program design between the SMUD and PSE
studies: first, the reports encompassed both electricity and natural gas, allowing for a fuller
picture of what is happening to households’ energy use; second, the study included a randomized
test of report frequency (monthly or quarterly), and did not test envelope size or template type;
and third, the study used household-level randomization, which was more robust than the batch-
level randomization used in the SMUD study.
         The PSE experiment consisted of approximately 84,000 homes randomly assigned to
control and treatment groups. These homes were chosen from PSE’s 1.3 million residential
customers who met the following criteria:
   Single family homes located in King County, WA
   Exactly one active electric account and one active gas account with PSE
   History for both gas and electric accounts dating to January, 2007
   Matched parcel record available from the King County Assessor’s data
   Not identified by the King County Department of Assessments as having solar heat
This filter created a pool of approximately 100,000 households that were eligible to participate in
the program. Additional exclusions were made to eliminate homes with distant neighbors or with
unusual home sizes (so that neighbor comparisons would be more meaningful) and homes that
used relatively little energy (less than approximately 80 MBTU). In order to test the effect of
frequency of the reports on home energy consumption, households were also randomly assigned
to receive the report on a monthly or quarterly basis in the ratio of 3:1. Unlike in the SMUD
case, the PSE reports all used the same template and standard-business envelope size.
         The PSE reports were based on the more effective ―graphical‖ template deployed in the
SMUD study. Sample elements from the front page of this report are included in Appendix A4a
and A4b. However, the PSE report included energy information regarding both electricity and
natural gas consumption. In addition to two charts tracking the last twelve months of households
kWh and therm consumption relative to nearby neighbors in similar size homes, the template
began with a combined energy cost (CEC) comparison to neighbors.4




4
 The combined energy cost is an estimate of the cost of electricity and gas used by the household. On the reports the
combined energy cost was reported in terms of a price-weighted index (PWI), where PWI =12.51*therms + kWh.
The factor 12.51 represents the kilowatt-equivalent price of one additional therm for a PSE customer. An estimate
of the combined energy cost (CEC) can then be found by multiplying the PWI by the approximate price of one kWh,
8 cents. The combined energy cost does not exactly reflect the relative costs to the households because the actual
pricing formula took into account other factors (e.g., fixed costs).
       PSE Results. Appendix A2 shows that the randomization was successful in producing
treatment and control households with similar pre-treatment attributes. The table does reveal
some statistically significant differences between the randomly assigned monthly or quarterly
groups, but the raw differences in levels was not substantial (for example, in 2007 the average
kWh per day was 30.2 and 30.5 for the monthly and quarterly households respectively). Only 1%
of the treatment group opted out of receiving the reports, which, as in the SMUD experiment,
suggests that the following intent to treat estimates will be nearly identical to treatment on the
treated effects. About 2% of both the control and treatment households closed their accounts
during the experiment because they moved.
       Figures 7a and 7b report the results of regressions of the log of monthly average kWh per
day and therms per day usage on a treatment indicator and a constant. Unlike SMUD, where
census-tract level randomization created some substantial pre-experiment differences between
treatment and control households, the PSE data show no substantial differences in pre-
experiment usage. All differences between the control and treatment groups for pre-experiment
usage, as expected, were statistically insignificant and close to 0%. As Figures 7a and 7b show,
however, the treatment households reduced their use of both electrical and natural gas energy
relative to the control households in November 2008, after the reports were sent out first on
October 20, 2008. As in SMUD, the rapidity of the decrease in electricity use may indicate that
the reductions in energy may flow largely from behavioral rather than durable changes.
       Table 3 displays the results of stacked monthly regressions (analogous to the SMUD
regressions in Table 1) on approximately 1.4 million household-month observations. The
regressions are run on the log of three measures of energy use: average monthly kWh per day,
average monthly therms per day, and the combined energy cost (CEC). As in the SMUD Table 1,
we report the results of parallel regressions with and without controls for house demographics
(such as square footage, age of house, house value), household demographics (such as past
energy usage), month, and cooling degree days and heating degree days. As with the SMUD
data, the estimated treatment effects are quite robust to the inclusion of ancillary controls. On
average, households in the treatment group reduced kWh usage by 1.2%, therm usage by 1.2%,
and a combined price-weighted usage by 1.1% compared to the control group. One potential
explanation for why this figure is lower than the SMUD average is that the experiment has been
running for a shorter time. There is evidence, as shown in Figures 7a and 7b (discussed below),
that the effect may continue to increase.
       One advantage of this experiment is that PSE collects daily data on energy usage, with
the aid of an automated meter read system called CellNet. Figure 8 reports the results of a
regression (with the Table 3 controls) of household-day energy usage where the treatment
variable from Table 3 (Treatment x After first mailing) was interacted with day of week
indicators. The figure shows that the lion’s share of treatment impact, 38%, comes from Sunday
and Monday (12:00 AM Sunday morning to 11:59 PM Monday night). It may be that the energy
savings is even more tightly concentrated in the weekend, with the bulk of the ―Monday‖ savings
occurring during the night between Sunday and Monday. For example, if a person decides to turn
her thermostat down on Sunday, she may leave whatever setting she has chosen on all night. The
evidence that the bulk of the savings is happening on two contiguous days roughly overlapping
with the weekend suggests that the primary impact of the energy reports may not be driven by
durable conservation efforts, but is instead from increased mindfulness of energy consumption
on the weekends. On the other hand, it may be that increased savings on the weekends could be
the result of durable, one-time actions as well. For example, if an individual buys a new energy-
efficient washing machine, and she does the bulk of her laundry on the weekends, she would
show the greatest percentage drop in energy on the weekends.
       As already discussed, in the SMUD experiment, as shown in Figure 4, those who
received the report monthly saved more electricity than those who received it quarterly.
However, in SMUD only the lower (pre-treatment) energy-using households were assigned to
the quarterly treatment group, leading to the possibility that the smaller estimated quarterly
treatment effect was driven by lower pre-treatment energy usage. In the PSE experiment,
however, with randomized monthly and quarterly recipients, we are better able to gauge the
causal impact of report frequency. Figure 9 shows the results of a regression interacting the
treatment effect (Treatment x After first mailing) with report frequency indicators. For kWh,
monthly recipients reduce their usage by about 1.25% and quarterly recipients reduce their usage
of about 1.05% However, for therms, both quarterly recipients reduce their usage about1.2%,
with the quarterly households reducing slightly more than the monthly. In terms of the combined
energy cost, the monthly group shows a slight improvement over the quarterly group, with the
monthly group reducing 1.2% and quarterly group reducing 1.05%. On net, quarterly treatment
effects are statistically indistinguishable from monthly effects. Given that quarterly reports are
just as effective, and cost less to produce and mail, they appear to be the more efficient
intervention.
       The PSE data also allows us to investigate how the reductions in energy use change
across the month, and observe how effects may vary based on proximity to the time the most
recent report was sent out. Figures 10a and 10b report the results of a series of regressions (using
full Table 3 controls) calculating the treatment effect in terms of kWh and therms for particular
weeks before and after the experiment began. Figure 10a reports the week by week treatment
effects on kWh and therms for recipients of monthly reports. The vertical lines denote the
approximate delivery dates of the reports. All 6 mailings after the first mailing had treatment
effects that were statistically lower than zero for both kWh and therms. Figure 10b analogously
reports the weekly treatment effects for quarterly report recipients on kWh and therms. After the
first mailing, 52% of the treatment effects observed on therms were statistically lower than zero
for therms, and 77% of the treatment effects for kWh were statistically significant (p. < .05)
reductions. Somewhat contrary to our expectations, there is no consistent or pronounced
retrenchment for either monthly or quarterly recipients as the time from last report increases—
although the reductions for the smaller quarterly recipients sample are less precisely measured.
The lack of retrenchment suggests that the energy reductions may in large part be driven by
durable behaviors, the effects of which would not wane with time; yet, as there is some
retrenchment (such as in the electricity usage of quarterly recipients after the second report was
received), some of the effect appears to be driven by non-durable behavior.
       As in the SMUD experiment, we again see larger treatment effects for lower house value
quintiles. Figure 11 shows that the lower three quintiles perform at or below the average
reduction of 1.1%. Again, all quintiles saw a reduction, but in the two highest quintiles, the
treatment reduction was not as pronounced.
       Figure 12 reports the results of a regression (with the full set of controls) interacting the
treatment effect with pretreatment energy usage deciles (based on household energy usage for
the twelve months prior to the beginning of the experiment, adjusted for house size), with the
reductions reported relative to control households in the same usage deciles. We see that in the
PSE data the treatment effect is even more strongly correlated with the pretreatment energy
usage. As in SMUD, we observe that the lower half of pretreatment energy users reduce usage
less than the average reduction of 1.1% (in fact, for the 3 smallest deciles we estimate
statistically significant increases in energy usage) while the higher half of pretreatment energy
users reduce more than the average. Here the range of effects is wider than in the SMUD
experiment, with the lowest pretreatment decile increasing usage by 3.4% (suggesting a more
pronounced ―boomerang‖ effect) and the highest pretreatment decile decreasing use by 6.0%. As
mentioned earlier, these findings contradict Schultz, Nolan, Cialdini, Goldstein, and Griskevicius
(2007), but do not give significant cause for concern as programs based on the treatment can be
controlled so that the lowest energy users do not receive reports.
       Finally, Table 4 assesses the potential economic and environmental impact if reports
were sent to all households in PSE’s customer base. Per household, monthly recipients save
nearly $14 a year from kWh reduction and $11 a year from therms reduction for a total of nearly
$25 saving a year. Quarterly recipients are only slightly behind, with total yearly savings of
$22.28 ($11.19 from kWh and $11.09 from therms). With over 930,000 households receiving
electric service and over 681,000 households receiving gas service from PSE, PSE customers
would stand to save annually $23 million from monthly reports and $20.7 million from quarterly
reports per year. In environmental terms this projected customer-base-wide savings from
quarterly reports is the equivalent to saving the carbon emissions of 14.3 million gallons of gas.
PSE households save $2.06 per mailing for the monthly reports and $5.57 per mailing for the
quarterly reports. As we mentioned in the SMUD cost and impact analysis above, more research
is needed into alternative delivery mechanisms for the reports, such as integration into the bill
and electronic mail, in order to determine the most efficient and effective channels of
communication. Selectively mailing reports only to households where we did not expect a
―boomerang‖ effect would also increase the efficiency of the treatment.


       IV. Conclusion


       Both the PSE and SMUD experiments reveal that Positive Energy/oPower peer
comparison reports cause significant reductions in home energy use, confirming the direction of
the reductions found by Schultz, Wesley, Nolan, Cialdini, Goldstein, and Griskevicius (2007) in
their earlier study in San Marcos. The PSE and SMUD experiments show that the effects of the
report continue to be strong, up to seven and twelve months after the households begin to receive
reports, respectively. The experiments analyzed here do contradict the findings of the San
Marcos study to the extent we found a ―boomerang‖ effect for both SMUD and PSE. The
boomerang effects are not problematic, however, as reports can be targeted only at households
where a boomerang effect is not expected. The experiments also teach us more about the most
effective and efficient methods of designing the reporting system. In the SMUD experiment, out
of four possible types of envelope size and report type combinations, the most effective was a
graphical version of the report sent in a number 10 standard business size envelope. In the PSE
experiment, perhaps surprisingly, sending the reports monthly did not have a significantly greater
effect than sending them quarterly.
       The experiments also reveal interesting dynamics about how different demographics were
affected. In both experiments, households in the treatment group with lower house values saved
more, on average, than households with higher house values. Also in both experiments,
households with higher pre-treatment energy use saved more than households with lower pre-
treatment energy use. The experiments also provide some evidence about the types of behavior
that may be driving energy reductions, although more research is needed in this area. In both the
SMUD and PSE studies, the significant reductions achieved in the period immediately after the
first reports are sent out may suggest that changes may be behavioral rather than durable. Further
supporting the idea that changes are behavioral is the fact that in the PSE experiment, the
treatment group reduces its energy use more in a two day period roughly overlapping with the
weekend, suggesting that reductions are caused by increased mindfulness, although the results
are not conclusive. However, we also learn that the treatment effect does not wane as the time
from the report increases, but instead is relatively smooth over the entire month or quarter, which
may indicate that energy reductions are caused by more durable changes.
       The Positive Energy/oPower experiments suggest that governmental entities should
consider mandating or incentivizing peer comparison reporting. As we have shown in our simple
calculations above, peer comparison reports can create significant net cost and carbon savings,
benefiting both individual households and the environment. The efficiency of savings would be
even more pronounced—and possible ―boomerang effects‖ averted—if comparative information
were only mandated for those who consume the most energy. Although some utilities, such as
those that are publically owned (like SMUD), or private but regulated (like PSE), are beginning
to provide such feedback, often utilities do not have adequate incentives to reduce energy
consumption on their own. Government officials should also consider investing in scientifically
designed studies that could increase knowledge in this area, such as determining the cost
effectiveness of sending peer feedback inside the regular utility bill.
       Finally, the Positive Energy/oPower experiments suggest that privately-delivered peer
comparison feedback, such as direct mailings, might prove an effective tool in a range of other
situations. There are endless ways public or private entities might employ such feedback to drive
desired behavior. Schools might mail parents reports of how many absences or times late their
children had compared to peers. Dentists might send mailings to their infrequent visitors
indicating how often typical patients come in for cleanings. A gym might inform its lazier
patrons of how often typical members work out. Government might even step in to require
private entities conduct this type of reporting where it believes there are significant welfare
gains. To take one example, the federal government might require that employers inform low-
saving employees how much more their peers are saving in the company 401(k) plan. As these
preliminary examples show, the area of peer comparison feedback is ripe for innovation and
experimentation.
