                                            ABSTRACT

This paper examines the distributional implications of introducing additional means testing of Social
Security benefits where proceeds are used to help balance Social Security’s finances. Benefits of the
top quarter of households ranked according to the relevant measure of means are reduced using a modified
version of the Social Security Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP). The replacement rate in the
first bracket of the benefit formula, determining the Primary Insurance Amount (PIA), would be reduced
from 90 percent to 40 percent of Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME). Four measures of means
are considered: total wealth; an annualized measure of AIME; the wealth value of pensions; and a
measure of average indexed lifetime W2 earnings. The empirical analysis is based on data from the
Health and Retirement Study. These means tests would reduce total lifetime household benefits by
7 to 9 percentage points. We find that the basis for means testing Social Security makes a substantial
difference as to which households have their benefits reduced, and that different means tests may have
different effects on the benefits of families in similar circumstance. We also find that the measure
of means used to evaluate the effects of a means test makes a considerable difference as to how one
would view the effects of the means test on the distribution of benefits.

        Policy makers are again focusing on the question of how best to strengthen the

finances of the Social Security system. Some are considering introducing new means

tests as at least a partial solution to its long term financial imbalance.1

        To provide some perspective on new approaches to means testing, we develop a

menu of options involving different definitions of means. We then use data from the

Health and Retirement Study to investigate the consequences of the various

possible choices for the level and redistribution of Social Security benefits fostered by

each approach.

        The elements of a means test include: the unit being subject to the means test

(individual or household); the Social Security benefits that are being adjusted (own

benefits for one or both spouses; spouse or survivor benefits); the measure of means

(current earnings; lifetime covered earnings; total wealth; the value of pensions; and total

income earned over the lifetime in all work, whether covered or not); once means are

measured, the definition of “high means”; and the formula that is used to reduce the

benefits of those unit’s that are judged to have “high means”.

        It seems logical that any scheme to redistribute “old age” Social Security benefits

based on means should consider the total benefits paid to the household, where

throughout this paper households may be composed of either one person or a married

couple. In contrast, as explained below, under the current system redistribution of

benefits is determined at the level of the individual, and is modified by a “top up” for

spouse and survivor benefits. Attempting to accomplish redistribution at the level of the

individual weakens the relation between benefits paid to a household and the total

covered earnings of the two spouses in the household. The effect is to reduce the amount

of redistribution among households with different levels of earnings.2

         While the current system bases redistribution of benefits on a measure of lifetime

covered earnings (Average Indexed Monthly Earnings, or AIME), current proposals

would also consider other measures of means. In this paper, we consider means tests

based on lifetime earnings (covered or total), total wealth and pension wealth3.

         To limit the number of possible combinations of elements for designing a means

test, in this paper we restrict the form of the means test. We employ a method for

reducing benefits that Social Security already uses to reduce the benefits of individuals

who worked in and earned a pension from uncovered employment. To be more specific,

we use a version of the Social Security Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) to reduce

benefits of households with high means.4 We also clearly delineate the population

affected by the means test we analyze. In particular, we reduce the generosity coefficient

of the Social Security benefit formula only for the top quarter of households, as ranked by

one of the four measures of means.5

  See Gustman and Steinmeier (2001); Liebman (2002); Coronado, Fullerton and Glass (2011); Coe,
Karamcheva, Kopcke and Munnell (2011); and Gustman, Steinmeier and Tabatabai (2013). These studies
show that although the Social Security benefit formula is designed to redistribute benefits toward
individuals with low lifetime earnings, there is much less redistribution of benefits at the household level
than at the individual level, i.e., from households with high lifetime covered earnings to households with
low covered earnings.
3
  It has been argued that pensions are unduly favored by the tax law, and recent proposals, e.g., by
Representative Camp, would apply a means test to pension benefits. Any effort to use pensions as a
measure of means would, of course, have an adverse effect on saving through pension plans.
4
  To mitigate what Congress considered to be an unwarranted redistribution in favor of double dippers,
WEP reduces the very high replacement rate up to the first bend point in the Social Security benefit
formula from 90 percent to as low as 40 percent. This adjustment essentially reduces Social Security
benefits of a fully affected worker by roughly $5,000. Applied at the household level, it would lead to a
reduction of annual Social Security benefits of up to $10,000 for a household judged as having high means.
(For further discussion of WEP, see Gustman, Steinmeier and Tabatabai, 2014.)
5
  We realize that by focusing on the top quarter group we will be introducing a notch. The advantage of our
approach is that it highlights the relationship between the definition of means and the households affected
by the means test. The next step in our research will be to introduce a gradual adjustment in the tax rate,

                                                                                                           2
         By its very definition, means testing reinforces the redistributive goal of Social

Security at the expense of the system’s ability to provide fair insurance.6 In addition, if

means testing is meant to solve some of Social Security’s financial problems, and as a

consequence it reduces the pool of benefits available to all covered workers, means

testing may reduce the ability of Social Security to meet either of its goals, to provide fair

insurance or to support older retirees with low lifetime incomes.7

         Data are readily available to the Social Security Administration to support some

versions of means testing, but are not available for others. Social Security does not

aggregate individuals into households until after retirement, and even then does not do so

for all households.8 Nor does the Social Security Administration currently solicit data

either on wealth or, with the exception of public employees who were employed in

uncovered jobs, on pensions. That is not to say that these data could not be collected. For

example, wealth data are collected in determining student loans, and pension data could

be made available by I.R.S. Other data would be more difficult to obtain. For example, it

would be very difficult to measure and adjudicate a policy based on potential household

earnings if husbands and wives worked full-time, a measure of means that some view as



bridging households falling on the border of the top quartile of households and reducing benefits more
sharply for those with a higher level of means.
6
  There has always been tension between two goals of Social Security. The first is to insure that covered
workers will have adequate or minimum incomes after retirement. The second goal is to redistribute
benefits progressively (Myers, 1993), providing a disproportionately higher replacement rate the lower an
individual’s covered earnings, as well as to provide benefits to spouses or survivors. On the one hand, if
Social Security is an insurance program, there should be a close relation between the expected value of
benefits and the history of taxes paid by individual units. On the other hand, redistribution requires that
benefits exceed taxes paid for households designated as having lower means (that is, lower covered
incomes), while benefits will then necessarily fall short of taxes paid for others with greater means.
Provisions supporting both goals continue to operate, which means the system does not perfectly meet
either goal.
7
  Because Social Security is a tax and transfer program, and early generations of participants received
benefits well in excess of the taxes they paid, for current generations of participants, on average, the value
of taxes paid exceeds expected benefits.

                                                                                                                 3
the fairest basis for redistributing benefits, one that does not penalize households based

on their work.

         Before proceeding with our analysis, we should say something about approaches

to means testing that we do not analyze in this paper. We do not consider basing a means

test on current income, although that might seem to be a natural approach, and one that

has been suggested by some policy makers. A major part of the current income of those

in the population who have already claimed Social Security benefits is their current

earnings (See Social Security Administration, 2014). Many forms of current income are

easy to measure. But reducing benefits of those with highest current earnings would fly in

the face of decades of policy initiatives that were designed to encourage older persons to

delay the age of retirement.

         More specifically, in the face of the wave of baby boomer retirements, Congress

adopted policies to reverse the adverse effects of earnings tests and other disincentives to

postponing retirement. Yet any earnings test, even one applied only to high earners, is

likely to encourage earlier retirement. Among a range of Social Security policies

Congress has adopted, they have abolished the Social Security earnings test for those

between the full retirement age and age 70; they have raised the full retirement age from

65 to 67; and they have increased to 8 percent the delayed retirement credit, the actuarial

adjustment for delayed claiming of benefits.9




9
  Other legislation and/or court decisions encouraged delayed retirement by abolishing various forms of age
discrimination. Thus together with the courts, Congress abolished mandatory retirement; required defined
benefit pensions to adopt actuarially fair adjustments in benefits for those who delay retiring after age 65;
and similarly required employers to continue to contribute to the defined contribution pension plans of
those workers who were beyond the full retirement age specified by their plan. These policies have been
shown to be effective in delaying retirement. See, for example, Anderson, Gustman and Steinmeier (1999)
and Gustman and Steinmeier (2009).

                                                                                                           4
         If one wishes to analyze the disincentives that would be created by instituting a

means test based on current earnings, there is a large literature to rely on. All that is

required is to modify the literature examining the effects on retirement of what previously

were inadequate actuarial adjustments to the Social Security earnings test and other

features of Social Security and pensions that penalized delayed claiming of benefits.

         We also do not consider proposals that would tax unearned income. That would

seem to be inferior approach to basing a means test on total wealth, which we do

consider. A test based on unearned income may create distortions as wealth holders

choose assets with returns that are not included in the means test (e.g., implicit returns to

owner occupied housing; Piggott, 2014), adjust or time asset returns, or choose assets

where the return takes the form of a capital gain that can be delayed until the asset is

needed or bequeathed.

         Nor do we consider the potential of modifying the income tax to further means

test Social Security benefits. Under current law, Social Security is subject to income tax

if AGI is over $25,000. For married couples filing jointly, the threshold is $44,000.

Income taxes are paid on up to 85 percent of Social Security benefits.10 The vast majority

of Social Security benefits of high income individuals are already subject to the income

tax. This leaves very little room for using the income tax per se as a basis for means

testing Social Security benefits.

         To be sure, there still will be adverse effects on incentives from the means tests

we do consider. For example, a wealth test will affect the incentive to save; and a test


10
  For couples filing jointly with incomes exceeding $44,000, the amount of benefits counted in income is
the lesser of 85 percent of Social Security or the sum of $6,000 plus 85 percent of income over $44,000.
For singles, it is the lesser of 85 percent of Social Security or the sum of $4,500 plus 85percent of income
over $34,000. Social Security Bulletin, Annual Statistical Supplement, 2012, Table 2A31.

                                                                                                               5
based on lifetime earnings will favor those who choose to remain out of the labor force

over those who commit to full-time work over their lifetime.

       Section II briefly describes how Social Security benefits are determined under the

current system. Section III discusses the HRS data used in our analysis, and how those

data can be used to measure the various concepts of means considered here. Section IV

analyzes the distributional effects of the current system. In Section V we examine means

tests based on total wealth, AIME and pension wealth. Section VI explores heterogeneity

among households affected by different means tests. Section VII concludes.

                                     II. The Current System

       Consider briefly the basics of Social Security benefit determination. Social

Security benefits are based on a person’s highest 35 years of covered earnings. Covered

earnings are measured by Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME). Earnings are

indexed up to the year the individual turns age 60. Earnings after age 60 are not indexed

and are counted on a nominal basis. The basic benefit paid at full retirement age is called

the Primary Insurance Amount (PIA).

       Five key features of Social Security affect the distribution of benefits and taxes.

       1. The benefit formula is progressive. It replaces a decreasing share of earnings

           as earnings increase. In 2014, the PIA replaced 90 percent of the first $9,792

           of indexed annual earnings; 32 percent of indexed earnings between $9,792

           and $59,004, and 15 percent of indexed earnings over that amount. (To

           facilitate later analysis, we specify earnings on an annual basis, although

           Social Security calculations are on a monthly basis.)




                                                                                             6
       2. Annual Social Security benefits also depend on when benefits are initially

           claimed. If the benefit is claimed before the full retirement age, it is reduced

           below the PIA. If claimed after the full retirement age, the annual benefit

           payment is increased above the PIA by the delayed retirement credit.

       3. If benefits are claimed before the full retirement age, and the individual earns

           income beyond an earnings disregard, benefits are reduced through an

           earnings test. (However, benefits lost to the earnings test are replaced in the

           form of higher benefit payments in the future.)

       4. Under dual entitlement, the total benefit paid to a spouse who is entitled both

           to benefits based on own covered work and to spouse benefits will be the

           higher of the two. Where spouse benefits (roughly half the benefit of the

           primary earner) are greater than benefits from own work, the spouse benefit

           “tops up” the benefit from own work and the recipient is called a dual

           beneficiary. Similarly, the total paid to a survivor is the greater of the benefit

           to be received as a survivor (the benefit of the primary earner) or the benefit

           based on the survivor’s own covered work. Again the survivor benefit is paid

           as a “top up” over own benefits.

       5. There is a cap on covered earnings. This cap determines maximum earnings

           subject to the Social Security payroll tax, and provides a maximum on the

           covered earnings in any one year that are counted in the calculation of AIME.

                             III. The Data and Measures of Means

       Our analysis focuses on what the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) calls the

Early Boomer cohort. Households are included in this cohort if they have at least one



                                                                                                7
member who was age 51 to 56 in 2004. It is the latest cohort available to us that has

matched Social Security earnings data.

       Among the advantages of HRS data: earnings histories are reported in both

covered and uncovered jobs; data are collected at the household level and not just at the

individual level; it is possible to estimate own, spouse and survivor benefits; information

is collected on various forms of wealth, including detailed information on pensions; and

the data indicate when an individual retires and claims benefits.

       Employment history, coverage by Social Security and pension coverage by job,

plan type and benefits are reported in the respondent interview. During the baseline

survey in 2004, respondents are asked about their current job, last job if not currently

employed, most recent previous job lasting five or more years, and two additional

previous jobs lasting at least five years that offered a pension. Matched administrative

records provided by The Social Security Administration report covered earnings in each

year of work.

       For respondents who have not yet retired, we calculate own Social Security

benefits from working on a covered job by applying the Social Security Administration’s

ANYPIA program to the covered earning records for the respondent. When earnings or

benefit records are not available from the Social Security Administration, we impute

them based on individual and job characteristics, including self-reported earnings.

       Once the values of own benefits are calculated, the respondents are merged into

households. Own, spouse and survivor benefits are calculated at the household level and

are summed to generate total household Social Security benefits. AIME, our measure of

lifetime covered earnings, is also calculated at the household level. Benefits are



                                                                                            8
discounted over the lifetime using expected interest rates and life tables from the Social

Security Administration.

         Social Security is designed to be actuarially fair, paying a roughly similar benefit

over the lifetime no matter what age an individual claims benefits.11 Depending on when

an individual retires, annual benefits may vary by up to 75 percent, e.g., between two

individuals with identical covered earnings histories, one who claims benefits at age 62

and another with identical lifetime covered earnings who claims benefits at age 70.12

         Respondents also report the balances from live defined contribution plans held on

current or previous jobs. In the case of defined benefit pensions, respondents report

expected or actual benefits and expected or actual ages of benefit claiming.

         In evaluating Social Security and pension benefits from reports of expected

benefits, we use three different key dates: zero earnings are projected for all years after

the date an individual leaves the labor force; for this date we use either the actual

retirement date or the date when respondents in the self-reported retirement sequence say

they expect to stop working (or 62 if that was missing, or 70 if the expectation was

working past 70). For the expected date of claiming Social Security benefits, we use the

respondent’s self-report of when (s)he expects to receive Social Security benefits; again

using 62 if missing and 70 for 70 and over. In evaluating pensions, we use the date when

the individual reports expecting to begin claiming those benefits. Comparisons are then

made on a present value basis.

11
   With the sharp decline the in the interest rate resulting from aggressive monetary policy aimed at
inducing recovery from the Great Recession, there is a modest reward to delaying claiming after reaching
the early entitlement age. (Shoven and Slavov, 2012).
12
   When conducting means tests based on wealth, we evaluate Social Security benefits as a stock. We do
not consider a means test that is based on annual income and includes Social Security as part of annual
income. A means test that is based partially on annual Social Security benefits would create a difference in
lifetime benefits received, even when there is no difference in lifetime covered earnings (AIME), and thus
no difference in the value of benefits that these covered workers are entitled to over their lifetimes.

                                                                                                           9
       Covariation Among Different Measures of Means

       We would like to know whether it makes much difference which measure of

means is used as the basis for the means test. A first question, then, is how closely related

the different measures of means are to one another. We focus in Table 1 on the

correlations among three measures of means, household total wealth, household AIME

and household pension wealth. Below we consider the fourth, household W2 earnings.

       Before turning to the correlation coefficients, note that we expect them to be

positive and relatively large. AIME determines Social Security benefits, and Social

Security wealth is a major part of total wealth. Similarly, pension wealth is included in

total wealth, and with a common component, a positive correlation is expected. But our

interest is in determining whether these positive correlations are so large that it makes

little difference which is chosen as the basis for a means test.



 Table 1: Correlation Coefficients Among Household Total Wealth, AIME, and Pension
                                       Wealth

                                                Correlation Coefficients

         AIME and Total Wealth                  0.795

         Total Wealth and Pension Wealth        0.701

         AIME and Pension Wealth                0.631



       Household AIME and total wealth are correlated .795, which suggests a number

of households will be affected differently if the means test is based on AIME than if it is

based on total wealth. This imperfect correlation is consistent with Venti and Wise (1999,

2001) and Gustman and Steinmeier (1999), who found wide distributions of wealth when

                                                                                            10
the population was divided into deciles according to lifetime incomes. More detail is

provided in Appendix Table 1, which reports the counts of observations in each cell when

wealth deciles are shown in the column heads and AIME deciles appear as row heads.

Only 797 out of 2,439 observations fall along the main diagonal where they are in the

same decile in both the wealth and AIME distribution.13

         Total household wealth and pension wealth are correlated .701. This imperfect

relationship is consistent with Gustman and Steinmeier (1999), who examined the

substitution of pensions for other forms of saving and found the substitution between

pension and other forms of total wealth was much less than perfect. Those with a pension

exhibited higher overall wealth, income constant. But the difference in wealth between

those with and without a pension was less than the value of the pension. These findings

revealed considerable heterogeneity in the degree of substitution. Further detail is

provided in Appendix Table 2, where total wealth and pension wealth are divided into

deciles. Nine hundred and forty four of 2439 observations fall along the main diagonal.

         Analogously, the relation between household AIME and pension wealth is

imperfect, with a correlation of 0.631. Appendix Table 3 shows the relation when AIME

and pension wealth are divided by decile.

         As would be expected, there is an imperfect correspondence among households

falling within the top three deciles when ranked by total wealth, AIME or pension wealth.

Consequently, some households whose Social Security benefits are reduced under one

measure of means will not have their benefits affected should another measure be used as

the standard for high means. The bottom line is that we can expect means tests based on


13
   Including one cell to the right and left of each diagonal element, 1,633 observations are captured, which
still leaves 806, or one third of the observations, falling well outside the diagonal.

                                                                                                          11
AIME, total wealth and pension wealth to affect many families differently. This will be

apparent in our later findings.

         In addition to records on covered earnings, W2 records are also available. They

provide information on covered and uncovered earnings dating back to 1980. Box 1 of

the W2 record reports total earnings, while box 3 reports earnings covered by Social

Security. Earnings from self-employment and earnings from employment not covered by

Social Security (non-FICA earnings) are also reported.14 We eliminate from our samples

all households with earnings from uncovered work. The W2 records are still useful,

however, in that they include earnings above maximum taxable earnings subject to the

payroll tax. Because the W2 earnings are available only for later years of work, they will

overstate average earnings over the lifecycle. Thus the W2 earnings are not meant to be a

substitute for covered earnings, but a supplement to them providing an alternative way to

rank households as to their means.

         Unfortunately, the W2 data are only available for a limited sample. More

specifically, the W2 data are only reliably available from 1982 through 2008 depending

on the years when permission was given for a match.15 The oldest member of the Early

Boomers would have been age 34 in 1982. The youngest member of the Early Boomer

cohort was age 50 in 2003. Therefore, after indexing, we will average W2 earnings from

14
  Self-employment earnings are not consistently reported over the full period. Before 1993, if a person had
earnings as an employee, where the earning were subject to the payroll tax, while also having self-
employment income, self-employment income was only reported until the sum of total earnings reached
maximum covered earnings for determining Social Security payroll tax payments. Thus a person with a
relatively well paid job in covered employment who also worked in self-employment might not have the
full self-employment income reported. Since employee earnings took precedence, for those with taxable
earnings at the maximum, earnings from self-employment would vary inversely with the level of employee
earnings. This problem was remedied in 1993 when the cap on earnings subject to the Medicare tax was
abolished so that all self-employment earnings were reported.
15
  The W2 data reported in the first years of the Earnings Records are subject to error. Viable records begin
in 1982.

                                                                                                         12
ages 34 to 50 and use that average as a measure of lifetime earnings. The index we use is

the measure of average wages used by the Social Security Administration to index

earnings when calculating AIME.16

         For out of age range individuals with earnings above maximum covered earnings,

the missing W2 information will be important. Consequently, we calculate average W2

earnings only for those households where both spouses were 34 to 50 in 2004, and where

W2 earnings records are available for both spouses. We then compare findings using W2

data for this smaller sample with the outcomes obtained for the reduced sample when we

measure means by AIME, total wealth or pension wealth.

         Correlation coefficients are reported in Table 2 for the reduced sample where the

households have a matched W2 record, and W2 earnings are observable between ages 34

and 50. With 655 households in the sample, AIME is correlated with total wealth 0.857.17

Wealth is correlated with W2 earnings .812. From Appendix Table 4, we see that when

W2 earnings and total wealth are arrayed by decile, 213 of 655 observations fall along the

main diagonal.




16
  Given the limited number of years of W2 data available, many households do not have W2 earnings
reported for all ages from ages 34 to 50. Many spouses who fall outside the Early Boomer age range are too
old to have their earnings at age 34 included in the W2 records. Analogously, much younger spouses will
not have observed W2 earnings at age 50. As a partial remedy, it is possible to use AIME records for those
out of age range individuals whose earnings never exceed the cap.
17
  Within this restricted sample, when wealth and AIME are arrayed by decile, 224 of 655 observations, or
34 percent of observations fall along the main diagonal. This 0.857 correlation between AIME and total
wealth in restricted sample compares with a correlation of .795 within the full sample of 2,439, with 797, or
32.7 percent of the observations falling along the main diagonal.

                                                                                                          13

       Table 2 provides an important piece of encouraging news. AIME on an

annualized basis appears to be quite closely related to W2 earnings, at least within the

limited sample for which W2 earnings are available. The correlation is .948. In Appendix

Table 5, where AIME and W2 deciles are arrayed, 338 of 655 observations fall along the

main diagonal, while 592 of 655 observations fall within one cell of the diagonal. This

suggests that AIME will provide a useful indicator of lifetime earnings, even though

earnings are only counted up to the cap. Note, however, that we have excluded anyone

who had earnings from uncovered work, which has the effect of bringing these two

measures closer together.

       Tables 3 through 5 illustrate the very different asset compositions within deciles

when households are ranked by AIME, total wealth and pension wealth. These tables

report the values of the various components of wealth and the share of total wealth

represented by those components within each specified decile. Next we would like to

illustrate the differences in heterogeneity among households when different definitions of

means are used.




                                                                                           14
       Table 3 divides households according to AIME decile. The positive relation

between AIME and total wealth is apparent from the values for wealth reported in row 1.

As AIME increases, the average value of total wealth rises from $83,000 in AIME decile

1 to $1,442,000 for those households falling in the highest AIME decile.

       From the first column of Table 3, 42.9 percent ($36,000) of the total wealth of

households in the lowest AIME decile is in the form of Social Security wealth. Nineteen

thousand dollars, representing 22.6 percent of their total wealth, is in the form of

pensions. Housing represents another 22.6 percent of their total wealth. Altogether,

Social Security, pensions and housing represent 89 percent of the total wealth of

households in the lowest AIME decile, with other forms of financial and other wealth

representing only 11 percent of total wealth.

       Looking over to the next to last column, those in the top AIME decile, with total

wealth of $1,442,000, had $476,000, or 33 percent of their total wealth in the form of

Social Security. From row 3 of the next to last column, $431,000, or 29.9 percent of their

total wealth was in the form of pensions. Housing, worth $230,000, represented 16

percent of their total wealth. Altogether, Social Security, pensions and housing

represented 79 percent of the total wealth of households in the top AIME decile, with

slightly over one fifth of total wealth represented by financial and other assets.

       Looking across row 2, although total wealth increases with household AIME, the

share of total wealth represented by Social Security begins to decline, but only once the

sixth AIME decile is reached. Moreover, that decline is not very steep. By the highest

AIME decile, one third of total wealth is still represented by Social Security.

       In contrast, we see from Table 4 that when household wealth is used as the

measure of means, the share of total wealth due to Social Security falls from 95.2 percent

of total wealth for members of the lowest wealth decile ($40,000, row 2, column 1) to

19.2 percent of total wealth for those in the highest wealth decile ($414,000, row 2,

column 10). To be sure, when total wealth is used as a measure of means, the present

value of Social Security benefits received by households in the top wealth decile are ten

times more valuable than Social Security wealth received by those in the bottom wealth

decile. But total wealth in the top decile at $2,156,000 is 53 times as valuable as total

wealth held by those in the lowest decile, at $41,000.

       If pension wealth were used to measure means as in Table 5, the bottom three

deciles of pension holding households would have no pension wealth at all. Within the

bottom three deciles, the present value of Social Security benefits represents 53.9 percent

of total household wealth. Among the households falling within the highest decile of

pension wealth, pensions represent 48.2 percent of total wealth, with Social Security

accounting for 23.3 percent of total wealth.

              IV. Distribution of Benefits and Taxes Under Current Law

       To understand the redistribution of Social Security benefits that would be fostered

by means testing, one must first understand how the current system redistributes benefits.

We begin by ordering individuals, and then households, by the annualized value of their

AIME (average indexed monthly earnings).

       Table 6 reports the distributions of the present values of benefits and taxes for

individual respondents in the 2004 cohort of the Health and Retirement Study. Benefits

reported in Table 6 include own benefits, and top ups for spouse and survivor benefits



                                                                                            19
associated with the individual’s work. That is, top ups for spouse and survivor benefits

are attributed to the individual who earned them, not to the spouses who are receiving

them.

        In row 3, we define the present value of benefits redistributed to members of each

AIME decile as the difference between (1) the benefits currently paid to members of the

indicated decile, and (2) the benefits that would be paid to members of that decile if their

benefits represented the same proportion of the taxes they paid over their worklife as

found for the average individual in the entire sample. Note that those from the same

household may fall in different AIME deciles when AIME is calculated at the level of the

individual.

        As seen in row 3, with the exception of the first AIME decile, members of lower

deciles have their benefits increased, while members of higher AIME deciles have their

benefits reduced through the redistributive effect of the formula. For example, members

of the fourth AIME decile have their benefits increased by 40 percent by the current

redistribution scheme. Members of the tenth AIME decile have their benefits reduced by

27 percent from what they would have been had they received the same benefit/tax ratio

as the cohort as a whole, multiplied by the payroll taxes they paid.

        Row 4 divides the benefits redistributed to or from the members of the indicated

decile by the total amount of benefits paid to members of this cohort. Looking at the last

column, row 4, altogether individuals in the top three deciles arrayed by AIME have their

benefits reduced by 10.53 percent of total Social Security benefits paid to members of

this cohort. The benefits lost by those in the top AIME decile are redistributed to those

with lower AIME levels.



                                                                                            20
       The bottom part of Table 6 indicates the real rate of return to taxes paid. The

overall distribution of returns is shown in the last column of the table. Those falling in the

ninetieth percentile of returns enjoy a 4.1 percent real return on their taxes. Those with

the median rate of return enjoy a 1.7 percent real rate of return. No rate of return is

reported for those in the tenth rate of return percentile. Those individuals will have paid

taxes but not received any benefits. For the median respondents, those in the middle row

of the bottom half of the table, the real rate of return to taxes paid falls from 4.1 percent

for those in the second AIME decile to 0.1 percent for those in the top AIME decile.

       Table 7 does this same analysis just completed for individuals, but it does so at

the level of the household. That is, the data in Table 7 reports the distribution of benefits

and taxes when the lifetime covered earnings of individuals in the same household are

aggregated, and the households are arrayed by AIME deciles. As can be seen from row 4,

last column, when households are arrayed by AIME decile, the redistribution across

deciles from high to low earning households amounts to 6.23 percent of total benefits.

Compared to the baseline, under the current system households falling in the top three

deciles of the AIME (lifetime covered earnings) distribution have 11.6 percent of their

benefits redistributed to members of lower deciles. Households falling in the top three

deciles when ranked by total wealth or pension wealth have their benefits reduced by 7.6

and 10.7 percent respectively, representing 3.7 and 5.4 percent of total Social Security

benefits paid respectively.




                                                                                             21

       ** We define the amount of benefits redistributed to members of each AIME decile as the difference between (1) the benefits currently paid to members of the
       indicated decile, and (2) the benefits that would be paid to members of that decile if their benefits represented the same proportion of the taxes they paid over
       their worklife as found for the average individual (or household) in the sample.




                                                                                                                                                                           23
         Again for those at the fiftieth percentile one sees a decline in the real rate of return as

AIME increases. The real rate of return declines from 3.3 percent for households in the second

AIME decile to 0.6 percent for those in the top AIME decile. Thus the fall in the real rate of

return for the median household involves a decline of 2.7 percentage points from the second to

tenth decile, while for the median individual it fell by 4 percentage points over a similar range.

Clearly although there is a progressive benefit formula at the individual level, it is less successful

in redistributing benefits among households than among individuals.18

         It is most meaningful to conduct the analysis of benefit redistribution at the level of the

household rather than at the level of the individual. At the individual level, benefits are

redistributed toward low earning spouses from households where the primary earner has high

covered earnings. Conducting the analysis at the household level is also useful because wealth,

one of the criteria we will use to categorize household means, is measured at the household level

and is difficult to attribute to each spouse in married households.

         Table 8 summarizes the redistribution among households fostered by the current system

under three different definitions of means: annualized AIME, representing lifetime covered

earnings; total wealth; and pension wealth.

         If lifetime covered earnings is the relevant criterion, then the current system redistributes

6.23 percent of total discounted Social Security benefits from households with high AIME

(falling in the top three deciles) to households with low AIME. When households are ranked by

total wealth, the current system redistributes 3.66 percent of total Social Security benefits from

18
   In 1992, for respondents age 51 to 61, 10.6 percent of discounted benefits were redistributed among individuals,
while 5.0 percent of benefits were redistributed among households (Gustman and Steinmeier, 2001). As noted
above, for those ages 51 to 56 in 2004, 10.5 percent of benefits are redistributed at the individual level, while 6.2
percent of benefits are redistributed at the household level. In addition to the age differences between the samples,
two other differences between the samples underlying these results should be noted. In the present paper, members
of households falling within the top 1 percent of wealth holding households have been eliminated from the sample.
In addition, households where at least one respondent has worked in a job not covered by Social Security have been
eliminated.

                                                                                                                   24
those falling in the highest wealth deciles to those falling in the lower wealth deciles. If pension

wealth is the relevant criterion, the current system redistributes 5.36 percent of total Social

Security benefits from those falling in the highest pension wealth deciles to those falling in the

lowest deciles.

             V. Means Tests Based on AIME, Total Wealth, and Pension Wealth

       The means test we use reduces the generosity coefficient up to the first bend point of the

PIA formula from .9 to .4 for those falling in the top quarter of households ranked by whatever

measure of means is being used. This approach allows us to greatly simplify our analysis by

imposing the same penalty on a given household whether it is declared to fall in the top quarter

of households because of its AIME, because of its total wealth, or because of pension wealth. As

we will see, some households will be subject to the means test under one criterion but not others,

some under two criteria, and some under three criteria. Given our specification of the means test,

we will not have to further complicate the analysis by allowing the penalty for a given household

to vary depending on the criteria used to determine who is subject to the means test.



                                                                                                     25
        If the household is in the upper 25 percent by whatever measure, the reduction of the first

bracket from 90 percent to 40 percent applies to the PIA calculations for both spouses. Spouse

and survivor benefits are similarly adjusted. Because households include both single individuals

and couples, and households in the top 25 percent include a disproportionate share of couples,

couple households will be disproportionately subject to a means test that targets the top quarter

of households. Moreover, the result of any means test at the household level will be affected not

only by the number of one person vs. two person households, but also by the relative number of

one earner vs. two earner households. Within two earner households, it will further depend on

whether or not the low earner in a two earner household is receiving only a spouse benefit, in

which case the benefit reduction for the household will be $5,000 + $2,500 dollars, or both

spouses have earnings above the first AIME bend point, in which case the benefit reduction will

be $5,000 + $5,000. In later work, it will be of interest to analyze the effects of separate means

tests for one and two person households. Below we note that our findings are similar when we

restrict the analysis to couple households.

        We now consider the reduction in the present value of benefits for those falling in the top

three deciles relative to what they would have received in baseline. In the baseline, each

household’s benefit is equal to the taxes they paid multiplied by the ratio of benefits to taxes for

all households in the cohort. We subtract that figure from the benefit that is paid after the means

test is introduced. We then express the benefit reduction relative to total benefits that are paid to

members of the cohort in baseline.

        That is, benefit reductions as a share of total benefits paid are computed as:


   1. Si =             -           *           /            /

Where

                                                                                                     26
Si = the share of total benefits paid to all members of the cohort that is taken from members of
the top three deciles
i= indicator for the n households in a decile
j = indicator for the N households in the complete cohort
B = Benefits
T = Taxes


        The benefit reductions are the result of two factors: the redistribution away from families

under the current system as a result of the progressive benefit formula; and the particular means

test that is applied.

        To put these means tests into perspective, when a means test based on AIME is imposed,

average present values of benefits fall from 268 thousand to 245 thousand, an 8.6 percent

decrease in total benefits paid. Roughly this amounts to over one third of the benefit decline that

would be required to keep the Social Security system solvent given the current tax structure.

        Tables 9 and 10 report the effects of alternative means tests. The percentage decline in

benefits reported in Table 9 is the sum of redistribution under the current system from the

baseline benefit plus the effect of the indicated means test. Table 10 nets out the redistribution

under the current system and reports the additional redistribution from the indicated means test.

        In the row heads of Table 9, we list the alternative types of means that are used in the

means tests. In the column heads we list the criteria for measuring the change in benefits for

members of the top three deciles. Thus, for example, if a policy maker thought that wealth was

the appropriate way to judge means, then looking down column 2, this policy maker could judge

the effects of adopting means tests based on AIME, wealth or pensions using a consistent

criterion based on total wealth. Along the diagonal of Table 9 the basis of the means test and the

criteria for ordering households and judging the reduction in benefits of those in the top three

deciles of households coincide.



                                                                                                     27
       The largest total reduction in benefits, relative to the baseline, occurs as a result of

implementing a means test when means are defined as AIME and the means test is based on

AIME. As seen in row 1, column 1, those in the top three deciles of households ranked by AIME

have their benefits reduced from baseline by an amount equal to 14.84 percent of total benefits

paid to members of the cohort. This reduction is due to the combined effects of redistribution

under the current system plus the reduction in the Social Security benefits of those falling in the

top three deciles when ranked by AIME. From row 2, column 2, when the means test and the

criteria for measuring redistribution are both based on total wealth, the decline in Social Security

benefits for the top three deciles of households ranked by total wealth amounts to 11.01 percent

of total benefits. When pensions are the basis for defining means and the means test is based on

pension wealth, the present value of Social Security benefits of those falling in the top quarter of

households ranked by pension wealth are reduced by 12.59 percent of total benefits.

       Remember, however, that these numbers refer to the present value of benefits taken from

different sets of households, those with the highest AIME, the highest total wealth and the

highest pension wealth.

       When the evaluation is based on AIME, but the means test is based on wealth, as in row

2, column 1, the top 30 percent of households judged by AIME have their benefits reduced by a

smaller amount (11.93% of total benefits paid to the cohort) than if the means test is based on

AIME and the criterion is AIME (row 1, column 1) when benefits are reduced by 14.84%. For

those policy makers who think that means testing should be based on lifetime covered earnings,

basing the means test on wealth or pension wealth creates a means test that is less target efficient.

       Looking down columns 2 where the means test is evaluated based on total wealth, more

benefits will be taken from the top 30 percent of wealth holding households when the means test



                                                                                                  28
is based on AIME (11.52 percent of total benefits paid to the cohort) than when it is based on

total wealth (11.01 percent). When the means test is evaluated based on pension wealth (column

3), there is little difference in the benefits lost by members of the top three deciles no matter

what measure of means is used to implement the means test.

       Looking across the rows, one can ask how a particular means test will be evaluated when

it is judged based on alternative criteria. For example, looking across row 1, the combined effects

of redistribution under the current system plus a means test based on AIME is judged to reduce

benefits of the top 30 percent of households when ordered based on AIME (14.84%) by more

than when households are ordered based on total wealth (11.52%) or pension wealth (12.51%).

       To report the effects of means testing alone, the numbers reported in Table 10 subtract

the effects of redistribution under the current system from the total effect of redistribution and

the means test combined, as reported in Table 9. Once again, the funds raised by the means test

alone are used to pay off the Social Security deficit, rather than to raise the benefits of those

lower down in the means distribution.

       From Table 10, we see that if one feels that AIME is the proper basis for a means test,

designing the means test based on AIME will raise about three percentage points more revenue

from those in the top three deciles (8.61%) than will tests based on total wealth (5.70%) or

pension wealth (5.40%). If one believes that total wealth or pension wealth is the appropriate

basis for a means test, then whatever basis is chosen for the means test, the reduction in benefits

from those in the top three deciles will be similar.

         Further insight into the interactions between redistribution and type of means test can be

found in Appendix Tables 6, 7 and 8. In those tables the effects of means tests are reported by

decile for households ranked by AIME, total wealth and pension wealth. We also report the

reduction in benefits compared to the baseline experienced by members of each decile group. For

example, households falling within the highest decile ranked by AIME have their benefits

reduced by 20 percent due to redistribution under the current system. With the addition of the

means test, the benefits received by those in the top AIME decile would be reduced by 35

percent, or an additional 15 percent.

         There are two issues related to robustness of the findings. While we have investigated the

effects of basing the means test on AIME, total wealth and pensions wealth, we also would like

to know whether the results are very different when a means test is based on average, indexed,

W2 earnings. Only 655 households are available for this analysis.19 To save space, we do not go

through a full range of comparisons, by type of means test, by basis for measuring redistribution,

by sample. We simply note that when households are ranked by W2 earnings, in the baseline,

5.90 percent of benefits are redistributed. Adding a means test based on W2 earnings would

reduce the benefits of those in the top three W2 earnings deciles by an amount equal to 14.51

percent of total benefits paid in baseline. See Appendix Table 9 for additional results based on

W2 earnings.

         Second, to this point we have examined the effects of alternative means tests for all

households, whatever their composition. As we have noted, redistribution of Social Security

benefits among couple households is more difficult to analyze than is redistribution among single


19
  Reliable W2 data are only available for respondents with matched records beginning in 1982, with W2
observation available to us at the latest in 2007. As a result of the availability of W2 earnings over the limited time
span, members of each of these households who were ages 51 to 56 in 2004 have W2 earnings reported only from
ages 34 through 50. This rules out households with an older or younger spouse.

                                                                                                                      31
person households. Thus it is useful to know that findings are similar when they are restricted to

couple households to those we found using the full sample. It is also useful to know that the

correspondence in results between single and couple households is not because the couple

households totally dominate the sample. Out of a total sample of 2,439 households, 1,472 of the

households are married couples, while 967 are single member households.

           VI. Differences Among Households Affected by Different Means Tests

       In Table 11, we distinguish households according to which of the means tests, and how

many of the means tests affect them. In our sample from the Early Boomer cohort, 437

households would be affected by only one means test; 287 by two means tests and 273 by three

means tests.

       The way we have structured the means test, the benefit reduction facing a particular

family is independent of the criteria used to rank families. Once they fall in the top quarter, based

on lifetime income, wealth or pension wealth, they are subject to the same penalty. But

households that are judged to have high means based on the same criterion will be subject to

different reductions in their Social Security benefits depending on the earnings history of the

husband and wife. For example, when two households have the same level of wealth, they may

nevertheless be subject to different reductions in their Social Security benefits.

       We also see from Table 11 that households that are judged to have high means based on

different criteria are often very dissimilar. Among those affected by only one means test, from

column 2, row 2, those affected by a means test based on AIME have the highest benefits under

current law with Social Security wealth of $396,000. They would lose $87,000 to the means test,

or 22 percent of their current benefits. Those affected by only a means test based on total wealth

are entitled to $315,000 in benefits (column 2, row 3). They would lose $65,000 in benefits, or



                                                                                                  32
21 percent of their current benefits. Those subject to a means test based on pensions but not on

other criteria (column 2, row 4) have $223,000 in current benefits. They would lose 28 percent of

their total benefits.

        Moving down the rows, consider households affected by two means tests. Again there are

wide differences among the benefits of the households affected by the different types of means

tests. Those affected by a means test based AIME and a means test based on total wealth

(column 2, row 6) have the highest benefits, averaging $453,000 in Social Security wealth. They

would lose 15 percent of their benefits to a means test. Those who would be subject to means

tests based on AIME and pensions have lower Social Security benefits, $372,000, but would lose

28 percent of their benefits to means tests. Those who would have their benefits reduced by

means tests based on wealth and pension value, but not AIME, have the lowest Social Security

wealth at $289,000. Their benefits would be reduced by 21 percent.

        The households that would be subject to a means test whether the criteria was AIME,

total wealth or pension wealth, have Social Security wealth averaging $448,000. A means test

would reduce the present value of their Social Security benefits by 18 percent.

        The importance of selecting the appropriate basis for a means test can be seen by

scanning down the last three columns of Table 11. For example, consider column 6. If one

believes that wealth is the appropriate criterion for a means test, households in rows 2, 6, 8 and 9

would be subject to a means test. But if AIME were chosen as the basis for the test, the included

households from rows 2 and 7 would have much lower wealth ($609,000 and $721,000) than

households that would be selected based on a total wealth criterion (e.g., column 6, rows 3, 6, 8

and 10).

                                             VII. Conclusions

        Deciding on a basis for means testing would be easy if households with high lifetime

covered earnings also had high total wealth and high pension wealth. But as we have seen, that is

not the case for many households. As a result, different households are affected as the basis for

the means test is changed. It will make a great deal of difference, at least to some households,

which definition of means is chosen.

        Which measure of means is chosen will also make a great deal of difference to policy

makers holding specific views as to how best to define means.20 We have shown, for example,

that if a policy maker believes that wealth is the appropriate basis for a means test, but another

basis for means testing is in fact selected, households that are held by the policy maker to have

low means will nevertheless suffer a reduction of benefits. At the heart of the problem are the

imperfect correlations among total wealth, covered earnings and pension wealth.

        There also is some question about internal consistency of the effects of means test even

when a single criterion is used. Households falling in the top quarter when ranked by a particular

criteria, whether it is lifetime covered earnings, wealth or pension wealth, will not have their

benefits reduced by the same amount. Within a top quarter group, the decrease in the present

value of benefits is going to depend on the covered earnings of each spouse, that is, on the mix

between own and spouse or survivor benefits within the household. It is not clear that the

differences in realized penalties will accord with the sense of a proper basis for means testing

among those who advocate expanding means tests.

        Our hope is that policy makers will be aware of the differences that alternative

approaches to means testing may make, giving them a better understanding of the strengths and


20

benefits and financial aid for college education.

                                                                                                             35
weaknesses of alternative definitions of means. The ultimate choice of policy, as always,

depends on the preferences of the policy maker. But it is important that the complexities

associated with the different choices are fully understood.

       Implementing these means tests would require the Social Security Administration to

collect more data than is currently available. Husbands and wives are linked in Social Security

data only when they reach retirement age, and the linkages are maintained only when spouse or

survivor benefits are paid. The extensive measures in the analysis, and in particular measures of

wealth including pensions, would be administratively costly and require extensive data new

collection on applicants. The SSI program requires this type of information of applicants and

processing costs are much higher. Nevertheless, for reasons we have discussed, there are good

reasons for basing means test at the household rather than at the individual level. Moreover,

basing means tests on the covered earnings uses much too restrictive a measure of means.

Clearly then, if what many policy makers consider to be a fair means test is to be implemented,

one cost will be a very expensive and burdensome collection of new data by SSA. That cost

should clearly be recognized.

       In concluding, it is worth repeating a caveat with regard to disincentives created by each

approach. This paper does not consider the incentive effects of means tests. As we noted at the

outset, using current income as a basis for redistribution would discourage the population from

delaying retirement even though that has been the goal of policies adopted in recent decades.

Basing a means test on potential income assuming a full-time commitment to the labor market, is

the most difficult to implement on practical and legal grounds. The other approaches examined

here all create disincentives of one type or another – reducing incentive to work, save, choose a




                                                                                                  36
pension, or affecting particular choice of assets to hold. These disincentives will play a major

role in shaping the benefits and costs of any proposal to means test Social Security.

       *Age eligible families in 2004 include all families with at least one member being 51 to 56 years of age in 2004. Households with at least one member being
       identified as a non-covered employee are excluded. Households with top and bottom 1% of wealth are excluded.
       ** We define the amount of benefits redistributed to members of each decile as the difference between (1) the benefits currently paid to members of the indicated
       decile, and (2) the benefits that would be paid to members of that decile if their benefits represented the same proportion of the taxes they paid over their worklife
       as found for the average individual (or household) in the sample.
