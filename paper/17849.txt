                                              ABSTRACT

In this paper I provide a theory for brand-protection strategies to reduce counterfeiting under weak
intellectual property rights. My theoretical framework has general implications for endogenous sunk
cost investments as a means of deterring counterfeiters. My model incorporates two layers of asymmetric
information that counterfeits can incur: counterfeiters fooling consumers, and buyers of counterfeits
fooling other consumers. Brands have a number of tools at their disposal to maintain a separating
equilibriumin the face of counterfeits. One of the theoretical predictions of this study is that counterfeit
entry induces incumbent brands to introduce new products. This helps to explain the innovation strategies
that authentic firms employ in response to entry by counterfeiters in practice. Authentic prices rise if
and only if the counterfeit quality is lower than a threshold level. In addition, the model demonstrates
how authentic producers could invest in self-enforcement to increase counterfeiters’ incentives to
separate themselves from brands. Better channel management through company stores and other costly
devices are forms of non-price signals and complement a company’s own enforcements against
counterfeits. These predictions are validated using unique panel data collected from Chinese shoe
companies covering the years 1993-2004. Data further reveal that companies with worse relationships
with the government invest more in various self-enforcement strategies, which are effective in reducing
counterfeit sales, and that the set of strategies are complements rather than substitutes for each other.

1     Introduction

    Brand names have significant economic value and offer a guarantee of quality that generic

products often do not match. The inherent value that brand names carry generates incentives for

imitation and counterfeiting. The World Customs Organization (WCO) estimates that 512 billion

euro’s worth of traded world merchandise in 2004 may have been counterfeits (WCO, 2004). Be-

sides the business stealing effect that industries have blamed counterfeits for, counterfeiting can also

bring ethical costs (Gino et al., 2010). Therefore, it is pertinent to study and propose marketing

strategies that original producers could employ to appropriately countervail counterfeits.

       Demand for counterfeits has been explored to some extent in the marketing literature (Bloch

et al., 1993; Cordell et al., 1996; Wee et al., 1995; Tom et al., 1998; Kwong et al., 2003; Wilcox et al.,

2009; Han et al., 2010), with price, attitudes toward big branded companies, and the need for status

signaling being cited as main factors driving counterfeit demand. On the supply side, a few studies

have examined the piracy network effects (Conner and Rumelt, 1991), the legal responsibilities of

firms and government (Olsen and Granzin, 1992), and the way firms’ internal organizations comple-

ment weak IPR enforcement (Zhao, 2006). Enlightening as these studies are, the economic impacts

of counterfeits and the corresponding marketing strategies are still not fully understood. Grossman

and Shapiro (1988) discuss counterfeit impacts primarily in the international trade setting and their

theoretical predictions cannot fully explain recent empirical findings. In particular, counterfeiters

attempt to infringe upon brands and may generate asymmetric information complexities to fool

consumers. The findings in Qian (2008) that authentic companies strive to upgrade quality and

build company stores after counterfeiters enter demonstrate the value of disentangling asymmetric

information for consumers. These strategies can also broadly be considered as endogenous sunk

costs (ESC), a term introduced by Sutton (1991).

       I build upon a vertical differentiation model (Gabszewicz and Thisse, 1979 and 1980) with

endogenous quality and other ESC to analyze brand-protection strategies to counter counterfeit

entry. I introduce quality options for the authentic producer who chooses quality according to its

potential to yield higher profits. I first analyze price competition with a given quality (one per

firm) under the entry game, and then look at the ex ante choice of quality. This endogenization of


                                                    2
quality setting helps to resolve the counterintuitive observations in practice that authentic prices

often rise after entry by counterfeiters (Barnett, 2005). This study derives conditions under which

quality can be used as one of the key strategic decision variables to combat counterfeits.

       In addition, I model two layers of asymmetric information that counterfeits frequently gen-

erate. First, and perhaps more important, asymmetric information lies between the counterfeiter

and buyers. I model this through a fraction of consumers who cannot distinguish counterfeits from

authentic goods when they are sold at the same price. National surveys indicate that the majority

of consumers who purchased counterfeits (98% for cigars and 70% for footwear) thought they were

authentic. Second, some buyers may show off counterfeits to signal their fake status. I model such

asymmetric information among consumers by a positive probability that a consumer who wears

counterfeits cannot be discerned by others and hence this consumer derives the full utility on brand

premium.

       I take into account asymmetric information by building on the literature of quality un-

certainty. Price is the conventional signal for product quality, but Nelson (1974) points out the

importance of advertising as a non-price signal for quality. Milgrom and Roberts (1986) argue

that prices are better signals for quality than non-price signals (notably advertisements) unless re-

peated purchases are assumed. Moorthy and Srinivasan (1995) propose money-back guarantees as

another effective signal for quality. Despite the sophistication of the previous literature, the models

considered only a monopolistic market and assumed exogenous quality levels. Since counterfeiters

attempt to copy authentic products and usually produce inferior quality, the competition is more

vertical in nature. Metrick and Zeckhauser (1999) use a simplified vertical differentiation framework

to model competition under asymmetric information. However, their models are still confined to

exogenous quality, and they derive equilibrium market shares in a price-pooling equilibrium, which

is helpful for explaining certain sector equilibria but not applicable to most counterfeit markets.

       In sum, my model captures the defining characteristic of counterfeits, i.e., the intent to

deceive, by incorporating both layers of asymmetric information pertaining to counterfeits. The

framework enriches the analysis of a broad set of instruments that authentic producers can use to

combat counterfeits: prices, quality, signaling, and enforcement devices. I argue that these strategic

instruments can play important roles in the context of price rivalry and asymmetric information.
                                                  3
The model contributes to the IO theory literature by endogenizing quality, price, and a plethora

of enforcement and non-price signaling instruments in a vertical differentiation framework. The

analysis in this paper conceptualizes many insights of interest to marketing academics and practi-

tioners alike.

        First, I highlight the strategic nature of quality differentiation and analytically reveal the

two functionalities of quality upgrades in the face of counterfeiting: 1. a widening quality gap to al-

leviate competition and 2. a reduction in asymmetric information brought about by counterfeiting.

Such practices are observed among various companies, ranging from Microsoft’s software encryp-

tions to shoe companies’ quality upgrades in China in the mid-1990s (Qian, 2008). Competition

with counterfeits brings unique pressure to vertically differentiate in a market where brand enjoys

monopolitic power in its own niche. This study provides one of the first analyses of the conditions

under which counterfeit entry would lead to innovation. In particular, I show that brand seeks to

innovate only when the counterfeit quality is within a certain range. If the counterfeit quality is too

low, it does not pose sufficient threat to induce innovation. If the quality is too high, innovation

may not alleviate competition. The predictions shed new light on the debates in the economics

literature on the relationship between competition and innovation.

        Second, I analytically parse out the price increase due to entry into its two parts: that due

to the actual quality increase and that due to the price signaling effect. Specifically, I show that

price increases are greater than would be seen if they reflected only actual quality increases. I show

that price signaling can be a separating strategy for the authentic company to self-differentiate from

the counterfeits. The higher price in essence results from the authentic producer’s constrained opti-

mization to force counterfeiters out of the pooling equilibrium. This is a viable strategy when there

are enough consumers in the market who can perfectly tell counterfeits apart, and will therefore

purchase counterfeits only at a sufficiently low price.

        Third, the analysis here offers many new strategic insights for brand management. I show

that non-price signals such as holograms can also enlarge the parameter range for a separating

equilibrium to be obtained. Authentic companies’ investments in self-enforcement and in vertical

integration of downstream retail stores could also effectively combat counterfeits. These measures

can be broadly considered as ESC, and add to the stream of literature on this topic (Sutton, 1991;
                                                  4
Athey and Schmutzler, 2001). The effects of establishing company stores complement efficiency

arguments of downstream vertical integration in McGuire and Staelin (1983) and provide new in-

sights for the channel-management literature (Desai et al., 2004; Coughlan, et al., 2006).

       Last but not least, the main theoretical predictions are buttressed by empirical analysis of

a new panel dataset that I collected from the Chinese footwear industry. These panel data include

detailed prices, production costs, quality dimensions, and financial statements of a representative

sample of branded companies and their corresponding counterfeits. The empirical analyses address

a set of questions that were not touched upon in Qian (2008). Stratified analysis on different

clusters of products with counterfeit entry of different quality levels reveals that authentic price

increases post-entry are observed mainly in products that were infringed by relatively low-quality

counterfeits. In addition, companies’ self-enforcement investments are shown to significantly dis-

courage counterfeit entry or sales, and these strategies complement each other. All these findings

align with the theoretical predictions, and support the intuition that supply-side initiatives may

be best for countering counterfeits (Bian and Moutinho, 2009; Penz and Stottinger, 2008). This

research enriches a Teecean perspective: a substantial portion of the rents from innovation arise

not from technological novelty but from embedding innovation in brands and distribution systems

insulated from fringe competition.

       The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 develops the model used in our

analysis. Section 3 analyzes the various endogenous sunk costs and their implications for brand

protections. Section 4 empirically validates theoretical predictions. Finally, Section 5 summarizes

the managerial insights and concludes with suggestions for future research.


2     Model

    Following the tradition of vertical differentiation models, I characterize a good with a quality

index si , where i indexes company i. There is at first one original producer with the option of

producing two qualities: sL = s, sH = M s, where M > 1. The additional unit costs of producing

the M s quality versus the s quality is c. She chooses the quality level that yields the most profits.

Each consumer consumes one unit of a product or none, and derives utility U = V si − Pi if one unit

with quality si is consumed at price Pi , and U = 0 otherwise. All consumers prefer high quality,
                                                  5
given the same price. However, consumer heterogeneity in taste is captured by V : the distribution

of V in the economy, f (V ), is uniform on [0, 1].

          When a counterfeiter enters with a product of quality sc = ms, m ≤ 1,1 the counterfeiter

and the brand play a duopoly game. Let Pa , Pc be the prices for the brand and counterfeit goods,

respectively. I assume counterfeit quality is exogenously given because counterfeiters have limited

technology available relative to the brand.2 I assume the marginal costs of producing the low-quality

authentic and counterfeit products are zero to simplify the model. Robustness checks without this

assumption are available upon request. The sequence of events is:

   1. Authentic producer chooses quality and sets the corresponding optimal price;

   2. Counterfeiter decides whether to enter, depending on potential profits and costs of pun-

         ishment under the law. If he enters, he picks his price, recognizing that he relies on the

         resemblance to sell his product due to limitations in matching the authentic quality;

   3. Each consumer purchases one unit from the brand or counterfeiter, or nothing.

With the intention of fooling some consumers, counterfeiters like to wait until authentic qualities and

prices are set before setting theirs. Therefore, this leader-follower game setting is more reasonable

than a Bertrand one. The results under simultaneous Bertrand moves are qualitatively similar, and

are available upon request.


2.1        Branded Monopoly Without Counterfeiting

       I solve the game backwards to find the equilibrium level of prices, quality, and purchase deci-

sions. If the government perfectly implements and enforces intellectual property rights, there is no

counterfeiter. The brand-name producer is the monopoly. Given quality sa of the authentic prod-
                                                                                                      Pa
uct, the lowest valuation among consumers who purchase is V sa − Pa = 0, implying that V =            sa .

This yields the demand

                                       1                            Pa

     Both news articles and my own data reveal that counterfeiters offer inferior quality most times. The
rare scenario of equal quality by counterfeiters and authentic producers is captured in the case of m = 1.

     Furthermore, in some countries counterfeiters cannot import fancy materials and equipment because
they are not legitimately registered companies and have no permits for imports (Qian, 2008).

                                          a = (Pa − ca )D(Pa ) w.r.t. Pa , resulting in the equi-

        In deciding which quality level to offer, the producer substitutes the two quality values (s

or M s) in the optimized profit function above and chooses the one that yields a higher profit. In

Appendix A, I establish the proof for

                                                                  c

Lemma 1 Without counterfeits, s is offered instead of M s iff     s   ≥M−            M.


When higher quality would raise costs more than it would yield profits, the monopoly offers lower

quality.




2.2        Market with Counterfeits

   We next consider a market with weak trademark enforcement so that authentic and counterfeit

producers coexist. The price, quality, quantity, and other marketing dynamics are more compli-

cated. I first consider a case in which consumers have perfect information on quality. In some

circumstances, counterfeits are sold in very different markets from the authentic products (Canal

Street in New York City, for instance), or are made of very inferior materials that one can detect

instantly. However, these are certainly not the exclusive channels for counterfeit transactions. For

instance, when interviewing branded shoe companies and shopping malls in China, 40% of con-

sumers told me that they or their friends had purchased counterfeits unintentionally. I will relax

the perfect information assumption in the next sections and compare the equilibrium with this

benchmark case.

2.2.1      Nondeceptive Counterfeits: a Benchmark

   For any quality level sa (a = H, L) that the authentic producer chooses, she is the leader and sets

her price first, taking into account that the counterfeiter will set his price according to hers. Note

that the consumer who is completely indifferent between purchasing the authentic and counterfeit
                                                                       Pa −Pc
products has a valuation: V sa −Pa = V ms−Pc , which implies V =       sa −ms .      Similarly, the consumer
                                                                                                        Pc
who is indifferent between purchasing counterfeits and purchasing nothing has the valuation of          ms .



                                                  7
It then follows that the players’ profit functions are:

                                      ΠD
                                       a = (Pa − ca )(1 − sPaa−ms
                                                              −Pc
                                                                  );
                                       D        Pa −Pc   Pc
                                      Πc = Pc ( sa −ms − ms ).

It is easy to derive that, given any brand price Pa , the profit-maximizing price for the counterfeit
           msPa
is Pc =     2sa .   The brand therefore sets her price by maximizing
                                                                  msPa

                                      a = (Pa − ca )(1 −                 ),

                                                  sa (sa −ms)   ca
                                        PaD =       2sa −ms + 2
                                                  ms(sa −ms)     msca

                                        DaD =     2 − 4M (M −m)s .

          To determine which quality level to pick in the first place, the brand compares the maximum

profits attainable with optimized prices under each quality level (high or low) and chooses the

quality that yields the larger profit. Proposition 1 gives the condition under which the brand

chooses the lower quality in the monopoly setting, and the following proposition suggests conditions

under which she chooses the higher quality when faced with competition.

                                                                                                 q
                                                                         c       2M (M −m)           (1−m)4M (M −m)
Lemma 2 With counterfeiting, M s is offered by the brand iff             s   ≤    2M −m      −        (2−m)(2M −m) .


The brand upgrades quality in the hope of alleviating competition by widening the quality gap,

provided that the additional costs are not too high, as outlined in the above Lemma. It is easily

verified using the derived equilibrium prices that, should the authentic firm produce the same

quality as without counterfeits, its price will drop with competition, similar to predictions from

prior entry models with exogenously given quality (e.g., Fudenberg and Tirole, 2000). However,

this study more importantly pinpoints the previously unexplored interplay of quality and price

dynamics when both can be endogenously chosen by the brand, as in the following proposition.

Proposition 1 Under the conditions specified in Lemmas 1 and 2, the brand upgrades quality in

the face of counterfeiting. Her price rises if the counterfeit quality sc is below a certain cutoff value,

which is an increasing function of M and s.

   It is worth noting the conditions on the incremental cost of introducing the higher quality

(including R&D costs and production costs) in order to have the innovation and price rise. The
                                                     8
cost has to be large enough to dissuade the brand from investing in higher quality as a monopoly

(Lemma 1), yet still be surmountable (Lemma 2) so that she is willing to produce higher quality

when faced with counterfeiters’ competition.

        The theoretical result that the threshold value for the entry quality is increasing in M and

s is again very intuitive. In particular, higher M s implies a larger gap between the low counterfeit

quality and the high authentic quality. It therefore allows for a wider range of counterfeit quality

where the brand finds it profitable to raise the price of its new product.

        The key propositions hold with wider parameter ranges in the variant case where consumers

signal their social status through a low-cost counterfeit purchase, as in the next subsection.

2.2.2    When Buyers Fool Others through Counterfeit Status Signaling

   One type of market exists in practice where consumers often knowingly purchase counterfeits to

signal their status to friends at a low cost. For instance, the fact that the fake Coach bags, Chanel

perfume, and Nike shoes sold for a small fraction of the cost of the legitimate products in street

corners are quite evident to the consumers that they are not authentic products to begin with.

Counterfeits serve to unbundle the prestige and quality attributes of branded products (Grossman

and Shapiro, 1988). In this case, the asymmetric information lies between the purchaser of coun-

terfeits and other consumers.

        I model this asymmetric information by recognizing a feature of counterfeits that allows

buyers to enjoy an imperfect fraction of the brand premium without having to pay for the authen-

tic quality. So the consumer utility derived from purchasing one unit of the authentic product is

Ua = V ∗sa +r −pa , and from purchasing one unit of the counterfeit is Uc = V ∗sc +λ∗r −pc , where

0 ≤ λ ≤ 1. If the buyer of the counterfeit cannot be discerned by others as wearing a counterfeit,

then s/he acquire the full status signaling (λ = 1).

        Propositions 2 and 3 can be rederived with new threshold values for c and sc , as in Appendix

A.1.1. The intuitions remain similar that quality and price increases if the cost of innovation is not

too high and the counterfeit quality is low as compared to the innovated quality. In addition, the

more status signaling a consumer are able to fake from utilizing the counterfeit, the more urgency

that authentic company has to self-differentiate through quality and price.

                                                  9
          One special case of the model is interesting to consider. Some customers may attach zero

status signaling on the counterfeits, i.e. λ = 0. These customers can be considered the “moral ex-

perts”, as they have no intention to fool their friends and other consumers. Based on the equilibrium

conditions (Appendix 1.1.1), the equilibrium prices will be lower and demand for authentic prod-

ucts will be higher when consumers are “moral experts”. The equilibrium demand for counterfeits

is lower in this scenario too.

2.2.3      Deceptive Counterfeits: When Counterfeiters Fool Buyers

       Asymmetric information is important in the context of counterfeiting, as many articles and

news stories reveal how consumers are conned into buying counterfeits.3 I assume that there is a

fraction, γ, of consumers who can distinguish between authentic qualities s and M s, but may not

be able to tell counterfeits from their authentic counterparts at the same price, at least not until

after the purchase. This setup is not unfounded. In particular, authentic producers tend to pro-

vide detailed information about their products in order to build reputation and brand recognition.

Notably, brands list product attributes and materials in their product catalogs. They also have

“customer service hot-lines” to address questions. Counterfeiters, on the other hand, mostly try

to mimic the appearance of authentic products and misrepresent attributes to extract short-term

windfalls.

          Lichtenstein et al.(1993) report, “Price is unquestionably one of the most important market-

place cues”. The model here allows confused consumers to infer quality information when different

prices are charged. This fraction, γ, of consumers hold a prior belief in the probability a good is

authentic or counterfeit: µ(θa ) = b and µ(θc ) = 1 − b. These consumers (henceforth called novices)

are drawn uniformly from all the consumers in the taste V distribution.4 They update their beliefs

about a seller’s type after observing prices. Let µ(φi |p) = 1 denote consumers’ updated posterior

beliefs about seller i’s type being exactly φ = φi . The other 1 − γ fraction of consumers are experts

in the product (henceforth called experts) and know exactly the quality of the product they are

     Chinese media reported a few years ago that a lady bought a pair of Nike shoes on sale, only to have
them fall apart one month later. Her happiness in catching the sale turned into indignation, and she sued
the NIKE branch in Shanghai. She then found out that the pair she had was a counterfeit.

     Relaxing this assumption and drawing more heavily from low-valuation consumers would not qualita-
tively change the results.

purchasing. They may purchase counterfeits at a lower price, depending on their willingness to

trade off quality for price (similar to the case with complete information).

          I handle the technical issue of out-of-equilibrium beliefs using an existing refinement (e.g.,

Simester 1995, Feltovich et al 2001, Harbaugh and To 2008). In particular, I apply the popular

Divinity Criterion (D1) (Banks and Sobel, 1987), which is a variant to the intuitive criterion (Cho

and Kreps, 1987) to refine the set of perfect Bayesian equilibria. Suppose that the counterfeiter type

benefits from deviations under a set of best responses associated with possible out-of-equilibrium

beliefs. D1 then requires that the consumer does not believe that the deviating type is an authentic

producer. More generally, suppose that in deviation p 6= P ∗ , the counterfeiter is more likely to

yield higher profit than in equilibrium under a bigger set of best responses from the consumer than

an authentic product does. D1 then requires that the consumer does not believe that the product

could be authentic. I detail the D1 criterion and its applications in this setting (both separating

and pooling equilibria) in Appendix A.3.

          The counterfeiter ideally wants to pretend that his products are authentic and to charge

the same authentic price so as to split the original monopoly profit. However, he soon realizes

that expert consumers will not buy counterfeits at the same price as the authentic price. Un-

der such pricing strategies, the perception of the novices on the quality of any product will drop:

spe = bsa + (1 − b)sc < sa , and they will decide whether to purchase any product based on the

utility function of this expected quality. The counterfeiter reconsiders his pricing strategy accord-
                                                                            Pa −Pc   Pc        pe

reaction function, this inequality implies that

where P is then a cutoff value of the authentic price, above which the counterfeiter prefers to sepa-

rate and below which the counterfeiter prefers to pool with the authentic producer. I assume that

at the cutoff value, the counterfeiter chooses to separate (reveal as generic) for fear of the potential

legal consequences of cheating. I will explicitly model such legal consequences and enforcement in

Section 2.3.2.

       Bearing in mind the counterfeiter’s strategy, the authentic producer attempts to maximize

her profits subject to condition (1) when setting her price as a leader. Mathematically, she solves:
                                               P − mP
                 max Πsea   =   (P − ca )(1 − (M −m)s

 a , Πa , or Πa , respectively. In particular, I denote the constrained separating profits (profits

obtained at P ) as Π¯se
                     a . I assume that whenever profits are equivalent, the authentic producer

chooses to separate from the counterfeiters. Several results follow from here, with detailed proofs

in the Appendix.


Lemma 3 The brand may raise the price (above the monopoly price level associated with a given

quality) after the counterfeiter’s entry to distinguish herself from the counterfeiter, who has no

incentive to pool with such a high price level. This is the price signaling effect.


   Theoretically, this signaling effect occurs when the optimal authentic price is the corner solution

at the constrained equilibrium. Intuitively, charging higher price is a viable separating strategy for

the brand, largely due to the presence of the experts, who will purchase counterfeits only at a low

price. Therefore, at a sufficiently high price, a counterfeiter does not have enough incentive to pool

with the brand. Given a sufficiently large proportion of novices (γ) and sufficient quality gap (m), it

is worthwhile for the brand to price higher in order to signal her quality. The benefits of capturing

the “novices” outweigh the costs of losing some low-valuation consumers who may not purchase at

the constrained high price. Such a signaling effect could prevail with or without authentic quality

change, in theory, as long as it is the solution for the constrained optimization.

       After working out the equilibrium prices for the same quality of the brand, it is natural to
                                                     12
consider how the conditions differ if authentic quality changes due to counterfeiting. The alternative

quality strategies can be best divided into two cases, both starting from quality s: 1. “striving

for the better”: she improves quality to M s; 2. “racing to the bottom”: she degradates quality

to ms. For each case, I derive the pooling and separating equilibria in the appendices. For

notational convenience, I also denote the strategy with no quality change as Strategy 3. With

a few supplemental lemmas and proofs as detailed in the appendices, I arrive at the following

result:

Proposition 2 Counterfeiting can induce the brand price to rise under a wide range of parameter

values: First, the brand charges a higher price on the upgraded quality if the counterfeit quality sc

is below a certain cutoff value, which is an increasing function of M and s. Second, even if the

brand retains the quality, she may charge a higher price to signal superior quality and to distinguish

herself from the counterfeiter.

The finding here that asymmetric information enlarges the parameter range for price increases

helps to explain why we observe authentic price hikes more often in response to counterfeit entry

than to entry by other branded or generic producers. The manager of Pfizer in the Shanghai

office commented that once counterfeits were gone as a result of the government’s strengthened

enforcement (“yan da”), Pfizer would have to lower prices because consumers would no longer be

willing to pay extra for Pfizer brand authenticity.

          When extending the model to monopolist competition with multiple brands, the intuition

is very similar to the benchmark model here. Relevant competition occurs mainly among firms

that are adjacent in the quality hierarchy, and counterfeit entry affects the infringed brands most

(Appendix A.4.3). Key predictions hold when extending the model to a brand with multiple

products (Qian 2011).

2.3       Brand Protection Strategies

The previous section suggests quality differentiation and price signaling as strategies against coun-

terfeits. In this section, I explore another set of brand-protection strategies. The analyses shed

light on a plethora of strategic decision variables and enrich the competition model under exami-

nation. They further complement the ESC literature. ESC are fixed costs that firms can choose to
                                                 13
invest in and that affect the price-cost margin of a firm. Sutton (1991) argues that the incentive

for firms to invest in ESC increases as the market expands, thereby limiting the number of firms

that can profitably remain in the market. I examine and propose the set of ESC in the context of

counterfeiting.

2.3.1    Further Implications of Quality

   Besides quality differentiation, the model here illuminates another strategic function of quality

upgrades in the face of counterfeiting. From the threshold value of the fraction of expert consumers

to ensure separating equilibrium, γ̄, that satisfies the binding condition in formula (1), I plot the
                                                                             ∂γ̄
comparative static of γ̄ as the authentic quality improvements M increases ( ∂M  ) in Figure 1, given

a set of other parameter values. Here the set of ceteras parabis values are: c = 0.5, m = 0.5, b =

0.5, s = 1. The negative relationship between γ̄ and M holds under alternative specifications of

parameter values as long as the γ̄ values are kept in the meaningful positive range.

        Intuitively, the higher the authentic quality is compared to the counterfeit, the lower is

the upper bound for the fraction of novices to induce a separating equilibrium in prices. In other

words, consumer expertise in detecting counterfeits and authentic quality improvements, M, are

substitutes γM
             ¯ s < γ¯s . When the authentic producer adopts higher-quality, notably better materials

(e.g., crocodile skins instead of cow skins) to produce its shoes, it naturally charges a higher price

that counterfeiters would not pool with. In sum, this drop in γ̄ indicates that the authentic

producer, by increasing his quality, is less affected by counterfeits in two dimensions: first, she

faces less competition from counterfeits with a more different product, and second, the widened

quality gap helps to disentangle information friction so that counterfeits can fool fewer consumers.

         As we see in Section 2.2.2 and the Appendix A.1, the drop in γ̄ is also important for

providing incentives for the counterfeiter to choose a separating equilibrium price, because he

would enjoy a diminished fraction of consumers in the pooling equilibrium and might be better off

charging a lower price to increase market share. In this scenario, the brand is more likely to provide

a higher-quality product when a counterfeiter enters.

2.3.2    Enforcement

   Enforcement activities against counterfeiters (either publicly lobbying or privately funding spot-

checks) are taken by many authentic producers. Notably, luxury house LVMH assigned approxi-

mately 60 full-time employees to anti-counterfeiting in collaboration with a wide network of outside

investigators and a team of lawyers, and spent more than $16 million on investigations and legal

fees in 2004 alone. In the Chinese shoe market, authentic producers send their employees to walk

around the market as consumers and track down counterfeiters. They then report their discoveries

to the local government, the Quality and Technology Supervision Bureau (QTSB) in particular,

and have them close down these counterfeit sources and outlaw illegal companies. Intuitively, these

enforcement investments increase the odds that counterfeits will be confiscated and major coun-

terfeiters will be jailed. Most times, successful enforcement cases are announced in newspapers to

caution consumers and to deter future counterfeits. The effects of enforcement on counterfeit de-

terrences and on authentic prices are examined here. The risk of such penalties reduces incentives

for counterfeiting and favors the separating equilibrium. Hence, the brand’s relationship with the

government and the subsequent enforcement strength are important for the entry cost of counter-

feiters. I model the theoretical mechanism here and exactly exploit this mechanism in my empirical

approach to identify entry effects of counterfeits in the next section.

        To weave the above intuition into my model, suppose that with probability w(e), which is
                                                                              pe
an increasing function of e, counterfeiters are fined − γΠ2 . Note that branded companies that have

a better relationship with the government have a higher w given the same investment e. Now the


                                                                 15
                                                                     Πpe            Πpe
IC constraint for the counterfeiter IC(1) : Πse
                                             imitate ≥ (1 − w)γ       2    + w(−γ    2 )   implies that he

       2M γ(M −m)+       1−2w

For w ∈ (0, 1], P e < P , so this is a looser condition for a separating equilibrium – the counterfeiter

has less incentive to pool than to be revealed as a low-quality producer. In addition, as the winning

probability w increases, P e drops, favoring the separating equilibrium.

        The separating equilibrium incentive constraint also relaxes for the authentic producer, and
                            pe         e
is IC(2) : min[Πse   e
                a , Πa ] ≥ Πa & Pa ≥ P

If we define the authentic profit with enforcement investments Πea = wΠse + (1 − w)Πpe − e, then

we notice that it is no higher than the optimal separating equilibrium profit, if attainable, without

enforcement investments. If, however, the natural separating equilibrium is not attainable (because

the optimal separating equilibrium price is lower than P ), then the enforcement activities can be

profitable if Πea ≥ Πpe               se   pe                                     e    e
                     a . i.e., e ≤ w(Πa − Πa ). Together with the condition that Pa ≥ P , the

authentic producer has incentives to invest in enforcement. In addition, we see in the previous

section that separating equilibrium profit exceeds pooling equilibrium profit more when there are a

larger fraction of novices in the market. It then follows from the inequality conditions here that the

incentive to invest in self-enforcement increases as information asymmetry worsens. We therefore

have


Proposition 3 Enforcement activities add risks and costs to counterfeiters, thereby favoring a

separating equilibrium. The brand would upgrade quality iff the conditions for the R&D costs and

counterfeit quality were fulfilled as in Proposition 2.


Galloni (2006) reports another real-world example of self-enforcement. Luxury-goods companies

like LVMH lobbied governments to declare it illegal not only to manufacture and sell counterfeits,

but also to participate in leasing, shipping, and any other part of the supply chain that leads to

the sale of counterfeit wares. In my interviews and field studies in China, a few brands shared

stories of how their tight connection with the government helped deter counterfeits. For instance,

the brands that get faster government responses in tracking down their counterfeits experienced

less counterfeiting.

2.3.3      Non-price Signals

    While price is a typical signal of quality and authenticity, as derived in Section 2.2.2, are there

additional signaling devices besides price? Yes, these could include forms of either fixed-cost in-

vestment, such as licensed company stores in which authentic producers display exclusive licenses

obtained from the Bureau of Industrial Commerce (Qian, 2008), or marginal-cost investment, such

as costly holograms and packaging (Galloni, 2006).

          Intuitively, these signaling devices help establish a separating equilibrium where the au-

thentic products can be distinguished from the counterfeits. I denote the fixed-cost signals (e.g.,

company stores) l, and marginal cost signals (eg. holograms) T . I redefine the strategy space

σi = (Pi , li , Ti ), i = a, c.

          The IC constraints for a separating equilibrium now become:

IC(c) : Πc (σc , σa ) ≥ max[Πc (σa , σa ), 0]

IC(a) : Πa (σa , σc ) ≥ max[Πa (σc , σc ), 0], subject to IC(c)

As T increases, P T drops, and IC(c) becomes a looser condition to satisfy (it is easier for Pa to fall

in the range where the counterfeiter prefers to separate).

    The role of vertical integration of downward retail stores is best explained in managers’ own

words. During my interviews with some Chinese branded companies that suffered from counterfeit-

ing, one manager said, “Starting from 1996, our company products have reduced using the wholesale
                                                              17
market and we switched the channel to licensed retailing. We established a well-managed retail

distribution system nationwide. This is one of the most effective ways to combat counterfeits, and it

almost deterred counterfeiting. These guys have little incentive to mimic our strategy because hav-

ing company stores will only reveal themselves to be easily detected and tracked down.” Another

sales manager told me, “Counterfeits pushed us to establish our [licensed] stores. We have now

discovered a new channel [of retailing] and we are now trying to build our personality into it.” One

brand protection officer stated, “Once our licensed company stores were opened, we had an influx

of customers come and purchase even at much higher prices than the old wholesale prices. Why?

We later learned that many customers who bought counterfeit shoes felt very uncomfortable due

to the inferior shoe materials, and some [counterfeits] even fell apart in public, which caused em-

barrassment. These customers undoubtedly would rather pay more to secure authentic purchases.

In the end, we had higher mark-ups for our shoes and more resources to develop new models of

higher quality, which certainly would charge further higher prices and bring in more profits. As

the gap between our products and the counterfeits widens, customers like ours more. We call this

a virtuous cycle.”

   In the monopolistic market without counterfeits, the total demand DaM = 1 − sa2s+ca a and con-

and producer surpluses: SW M =         8sa       +      4sa     .   In a market with nondeceptive counterfeits,

                                                     > CS M . Competition increases consumer sur-

plus because the counterfeits capture the low-valuation consumers who could not have afforded the

authentic products. In addition, consumers derive more utility from the possible quality upgrade

of the brand. It is worth noting from the simulation plot Figure 2a that consumer surplus is high

when the counterfeit quality is close to the authentic quality (m ≈ 1 and M ≈ 1) because perfect

competition drives price down to the marginal cost level and consumers enjoy equal quality at a

much lower price than in the monopoly case. When authentic quality improves marginally in the

neighborhood of s (M slightly exceed 1), consumer surplus actually drops. Only when the authentic

                                                         18
quality upgrades to a significantly higher level (M > 1.5 in the figure) will the gain in consumer

surplus pick back up; The higher the product qualities (larger M and m), the more welfare gain

there is in the competitive market (Fig.2a). In these simulations, I normalize quality s to be unit

1 and cost c to be 0.5.

       The brand’s profit changes in the market with counterfeits as compared to the one without:

δΠa = ΠD    M
       a − Πa . Figure 2b shows that authentic producer surplus is a decreasing function in m.

That is, the more the counterfeiter could knock off the authentic quality, the lower the brand’s

profit. In the extreme case of a perfect knockoff, both firms price at zero and earn zero profit in

the equilibrium. As also shown in the figure, minor increases in quality (M slightly exceed 1) only

worsen profits when counterfeit quality is very high (m ≈ 1), because it is not sufficient to alleviate

competition while incurring additional cost. Outside this particular range of M and m, authentic

innovation leads to more authentic profits.

       The counterfeiter’s surplus is highest when it can very closely replicate the authentic qual-

ity s (e.g., m = 1, M = 1.1), as it can then split the market almost evenly with the brand (Fig.

2c). As counterfeit’s quality decreases, its profit decreases by stealing less share from the brand.

Counterfeiter profit also declines as the brand upgrades quality (M increases), although the mar-

ginal benefits of further quality upgrades are low when the quality gap between the counterfeit

and authentic products is already wide. Notably, when the counterfeit’s quality is very low (e.g.,

m = 0.1 in Fig 2c), counterfeiter profit is not sensitive to the change in M . On the other hand,

when the counterfeiter completely knocks off the original product quality (m = 1), then the brand’s

innovation (M > 1) can drastically drive down the counterfeiter’s profitability, although not likely

enough to drive it out of the market. This again confirms Propositions 1 and 2 that innovation can

be a viable strategy.

       In calculating social welfare, I used the traditional definition of including consumer surplus

and all producer surpluses. The comparative statics resemble those discussed for the consumer sur-

plus, as Figure 2d displays. Social welfare simulations without summing the counterfeiter surplus

result in similar (only more sharpened) comparative statics.

        The unconstrained separating equilibrium in a market with deceptive counterfeits resem-

bles the benchmark case. Consumers benefit from the increased product variety as well as lowered

CS se > CS M only for small m(m ≤ 47 ) and γ mainly because counterfeits impose two opposing

effects on consumer surplus in the constrained separating equilibrium. On the one hand, when the

brand separates herself from the counterfeiter, similar welfare improvement could occur as in the

benchmark case without deception. On the other hand, counterfeiting would lead to distortions in

authentic price (high price for signaling), where price is artificially high to satisfy the IC constraints.

A sufficiently low counterfeit quality and sufficiently small fraction of uninformed consumers ensure

the first effect dominates.

        When non-price signals and enforcement investments were applied to attain a separating
                                                    s(M −(M −m)A2 −mB 2 )
equilibrium, the social welfare became SW se =               2              − e − l − T ∗ (1 − A). Figure

3a plots the social welfare of the constrained separating equilibrium as a function of the extent

of authentic innovation (M ) and asymmetric information (γ). In general, social welfare increases

when the brand upgrades quality more (M increases) and when the fraction of confused consumers

in the market (the fraction of novice consumers in the market γ) is less. Figures 3b plots the

social welfare as a function of the extent of asymmetric information (γ) and the non-price signal

investment (t). Social welfare is a decreasing function of γ. When there are a lot of novices in the

market (γ close to 1), the brand’s investment in non-price signals and self-enforcement alike help

to alleviate asymmetric information and improve social welfare. When there is little asymmetric

information (γ close to 0), these investments are wasteful and decrease social welfare, as Figure 3b

demonstrates.

        Figures 3c and 3d graph how social welfare in the constrained separating equilibrium changes

with respect to a counterfeit’s quality as a fraction of original monopoly quality (m) and market

asymmetric information (γ) when the brand doesn’t (M = 1) or does (M > 1) innovate in re-

sponse, respectively. As shown in Figure 3c, social welfare improves as m increases when there

is little asymmetric information (γ close to zero). In the extreme where the counterfeiter could

perfectly knock off authentic quality s (m = 1), it does not matter how many confused consumers

there are in the market, as any product would have the same quality s. When counterfeit quality

is low, welfare drops as the proportion of novices increases. When nobody in the market could tell

counterfeits and authentic products apart at the same price, the intermediate level of m is worst for

social welfare because it forces up price to attain the constrained separating equilibrium without
                                                    21
offering high quality to compensate for the loss in consumer surplus. Figure 3d conveys a very

similar intuition to Figure 3c. A minor difference is that asymmetric information uniformly hurts

social welfare here with authentic innovation, since counterfeits are always inferior to the upgraded

authentic quality. Comparing Figures 3c and 3d, authentic innovation lifts up the social welfare

surface to a higher level, especially with low levels of counterfeit quality.

         The parameters here take on realistic values as reflected in the data I collected from the

representative companies in China, and the simulations cover the entire range of possible values

for some key parameters, such as m, γ, λ. The empirical analyses in the next section found sig-

nificant quality upgrades by brands after they were infringed by the counterfeits (M > 1). The

price increase was significant only for the authentic products whose counterfeit quality was below

                                                                           22
a threshold. Tying with the comparative statics in Figures 2 and 3, we can infer that consumer

surplus and social welfare were not likely to have diminished in the Chinese shoe market in the

period under examination.

       While the theory here considers the endogenous pricing, quality, and other marketing deci-

sions of a brand in the face of counterfeiting, it is worth noting that the model does not incorporate

dynamic learning. It is possible that the knockoff competition could affect the legitimate brand’s

future incentives to invest in R&D and affect social welfare differently than the results here. This

deserves future research.


3     Empirical Validation
3.1     Data and Identification Strategy

    I test the theory predictions using a natural experiment in the Chinese shoe industry, aris-

ing from an exogenous shift in government enforcement efforts away from monitoring footwear

trademarks. The Chinese copyright and trademark laws were restored after 1976. Since 1985,

the Chinese government has established the Quality and Technology Supervision Bureau (QTSB),

with a branch in each city and joint forces nationwide, to supervise product qualities and outlaw

counterfeits. The bureau has enlarged its personnel and funding since 1991 in joint efforts with

legislatures to protect IPR and to monitor product quality. Due to a series of accidents arising from

low-quality or counterfeit agricultural products, gas tanks, food, drugs, and alcohol, the Chinese

government issued notifications in late 1994 (Notification No. 52) and early 1996 (Notification

No. 10) to enhance quality supervision and combat counterfeits in seven main sectors prone to

hazardous materials. The majority of the bureau workforce and funding went into these sectors,

lessening enforcement in the footwear industry. In the early 1990s, approximately 12% of the bu-

reau’s resources were devoted to the footwear sector (5% to leather shoes). This number, however,

fell to 2% after 1995 (QTSB yearbooks). Data provided by the authentic producers reveal that

they experienced significant counterfeit entry after this loosening of governmental monitoring and

enforcement: most entries occurred in 1996. This exogenous policy shock provides a natural ex-

periment to study the effects of counterfeit entry in the Chinese shoe industry.

       Furthermore, this policy change increased the likelihood of entry by counterfeiters when
                                                 23
authentic producers had poor relationships with a local QTSB more than it did when authentic

producers had strong ties. This finding was revealed in both qualitative interviews with managers

and data analyses, as detailed in Section 3.2. The importance of relationships is not confined to

China. In an Imaging Supplies Coalition Anti-Counterfeiting conference in 2008, Andrew Gardner

from Lexmark International presented a case study on actual “sting” operations to bust counter-

feiting rings in developing countries. It showed how close collaboration between multiple vendors

and local governments were crucial to successfully executing such operations. I therefore use the in-

teraction between the policy change and the differential relationships between authentic producers

and the government to identify the entry effects by counterfeiters for different brands, as detailed

in the next subsection.

       The data I gathered consist of detailed information taken from annual financial statements

and other relevant company records from a random sample of 31 authentic producers from the

census of Chinese shoe firms and the producers’ corresponding counterfeits for the years 1993-2004.

The data here include the average prices and costs of two product-quality levels (high and low,

mapping to M s and s in the theoretical model) for each authentic brand and the corresponding

counterfeits, the number of personnel and amount of expenditure used for trademark enforcement,

advertisement expenditure, and total number of licensed company stores. All these data are taken

from each company’s financial statements. My dataset includes both domestic brands and multina-

tional brands operating in China, and is supplemented by the Chinese Industrial Census database,

product catalog information, and interviews. Data on counterfeit entry, prices, and costs for each

brand are obtained from each company’s “brand-protection” offices and the government (specifi-

cally, the QTSB). Qian (2008) and Appendix B provide further data details.

       In addition, I coded and compiled a dataset of the different characteristics for each type of

shoe listed in the companies’ and stores’ annual catalogs. These data consist of the shoe material,

comfort level, decorative patterns, support and cushioning features, ventilation, etc. Recognizing

the importance of validating the data from firm reports, I ran hedonic regressions of the unit pro-

duction costs, as provided by the sampled companies, on the corresponding material, machinery,

and other characteristics of the shoes, as recorded in the catalogs. I conducted the analyses on the

samples of leather shoes and sport shoes separately. These characteristics together account for 90%
                                                 24
of the cost variation. These results lend credibility to the company data.

       I also conducted mall interviews and street interviews with retailers (N=30) and consumers

(N=200) to learn about potential channels of counterfeits and consumer attitudes toward coun-

terfeits. Some retailers were fooled by counterfeiters who claimed to be sales representatives of a

branded company and who offered huge discounts to fulfill their year-end sales quota. A majority

of the consumers at the mall claimed that they could not recognize counterfeits, and they usually

relied on price or store signals to infer quality and authenticity. However, consumers who frequented

street corner merchants unanimously told me that they liked these boutiques for the cheap prices

and didn’t expect real branded products.




3.2    IV Validity

   The authentic producers that were infringed upon set up their own “brand-protection” offices to

make up for the lack of government monitoring of counterfeits. The company fixed-effects regression

of the log of company enforcement investment on a legislation dummy is positive and significant

at the 5% level (coefficient=3.2), implying a 20-fold increase in private enforcement investment to

compensate for the lack of public enforcement. However, the authentic producers still had to get

the government to outlaw the counterfeit sites detected by their enforcement employees. This is

where relationships with the government (the QTSB in particular) come into play.

       Before the enforcement change, the QTSB conducted regular inspections in the shoe mar-

kets and factories. It confiscated and shut down counterfeit localities on the spot. The monitoring

mechanism was therefore quite uniform across different brands. After the enforcement change,

however, companies that had a good relationship with the government received more attention

and faster responses when they reported counterfeit cases. All else being equal, this reduced the

incentives of counterfeiters to infringe on these brands. This company-level variation is helpful in

exploring variations in the effect of enforcement change on counterfeit entry and sales for different

brands and, in turn, the effect on different authentic prices. The challenge is to obtain a proxy for

such a relationship.

       Qian (2008) established that the ISO proxy is a plausibly exogenous measurement for such a

                                                 25
relationship based on a synthesis of interview evidence and empirical analyses. Since the late 1980s,

all registered companies in China have been required to meet the standards set by the International

Standards Organization (ISO).5 For the shoe industry, the ISO sets standards for the basic equip-

ment a company uses and basic environment and labor treatments. The QTSB is in charge of the

ISO certification. For some companies one month was sufficient for obtaining the ISO certificate,

but for others the application and grant dates were over 300 days apart. Among companies that

took a long time to fulfill the ISO requirements, some were small and some medium or large. I use

the number of work days it took each company to pass the ISO 1994 requirements as a proxy for its

relationship with the local government (or how fast it dealt with the bureaucracy). There are more

variations in this indicator across firms within the same local area than variations across regions.

There is also no significant correlation between this relationship proxy and the company’s market

share, sales, product quality or production cost in my data. The largest correlation amounts to

only .08.

         Because the enforcement change was due to a series of accidents that took place in other

industries, it is plausibly randomly assigned. The IV exclusion restrictions are also fulfilled because

tightened government enforcement elsewhere is not expected to affect shoe prices directly. The

relationship proxy does not correlate with counterfeit entry directly in the first step of IV regres-

sion. The first stage (Equation 2 below) regresses the counterfeit dummy on the indicator variable

(Loose) for the loosened attention to the footwear industry, which takes on a value 1 for years 1995

onwards and 0 otherwise, the interaction variable between the legislation change indicator and

relationship proxy, the relationship proxy, and year trend. I included only these most important

instruments because weaker instruments can reduce the effectiveness of IV.


Counterfeita,t = α0 + α1 ∗ (Loose*Relationship)a,t + α2 ∗ Loosea,t + α3 ∗ Relationshipa,t + α4 ∗ t + ea,t (2)


         This first stage of IV estimation shows clearly that the instruments are highly correlated

with the endogenous variables fake entry and fake sale quantities as a share of authentic sale

quantities (Table A2). As shown in Columns 2 and 4 in Table A2, the legislation dummy and

the interaction variable are highly correlated with the counterfeit entry or sales and statistically

      This differs from the U.S. practice, where companies adopt ISO voluntarily.

significant at the 1% level. The overall Wald Chi-square tests for the instruments are highly sig-

nificant. The relationship proxy itself, however, does not carry statistically significant coefficients.

This means that a company’s relationship with the local government correlates with its counterfeit

entry only after loosening of the governmental enforcement efforts in the footwear sector. This is

exactly as we expected, giving evidence that this relationship proxy fulfills both the relevance and

the exclusion restrictions.

                                                                             ∂P          ∂P          ∂P
    From the theoretical model in Section 2, the comparative statics are     ∂s   > 0;   ∂c   > 0;   ∂m   <0.

This guides my basic model:


log(Pa,t ) = β0 + β1 ∗ Counterfeita,t−k + β2 ∗ log(ca,t ) + β3 ∗ ma,t + β4T ∗ YearDt + β5T ∗ BrandDa + ǫa,t , (3)


where k stands for the number of lagged years for the entry of counterfeits to take full effect on

the price outcome. Based on the Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information

Criterion (BIC), a model with a two-year lag (k = 2) was selected. ca,t is the unit materials cost

that also serves as a quality proxy for the corresponding authentic product in the current year t.
         sc,t
ma,t =   sa,t   is the quality (as proxied by unit cost) of the counterfeit product as a fraction of the

authentic counterpart. To address the potential endogeneity of counterfeit entry, I simultaneously

estimate Equations (2) and (3) using 2SLS.

         Proposition 1 predicts that authentic price will rise post-entry if and only if the imitator’s

quality is below a threshold. I therefore stratify the authentic products into two subsamples ac-

cording to the threshold value and analyze them separately. I try to map this threshold value

( 2M ((M2M
        −1)s+c)−mc
           −1      ) empirically to the best approximation allowed by the data. Qualities are not

observed directly but approximated by the unit production (material) costs, and the additional

cost to upgrade quality is simply the unit cost difference between the high-quality and pre-entry

low-quality products. I calculate m as in Equation (3) and M as the ratio between the year t

product cost and the pre-entry product cost. I stratify the sampled brands according to whether
                                                    27
their counterfeit quality is less than the threshold at the entry year. I then estimate Equations (2)

and (3) on the panel data for each sample of brands.

       Regression outputs for these two strata are reported in Table 1. Please note that the set

of brands that were not infringed in the sampled period are included in both strata to serve as

the control group. Columns 1 and 2 report results using high-end product prices as the outcome

variable and Columns 3 and 4 report those using low-end product prices as the outcome. Both

the standard and clustered standard error regressions yield consistent empirical results with the

theoretical predictions: βˆ1 > 0, βˆ2 > 0, βˆ3 < 0. Results show that the log costs for authentic

products are strong predictors for log prices in both samples. The improved quality (proxied by

the log of authentic cost) explains most of the price change. The more competitive pressure the

counterfeit entry exerts, the less the authentic price rises. These results are highly consistent with

the theoretical model predictions.

       The counterfeit entry indicator bears a statistically significant positive coefficient in predict-

ing high-end authentic prices only for the subsample of products that are infringed by low-quality

counterfeits (Column 2 of Table 1), as predicted by Proposition 1. Since most counterfeit quality

is considerably inferior, the threshold condition is satisfied by majority of the sample. The part

of the price increase that remains significant after controlling for the costs is consistent with two

hypotheses: First, segmentation of customers into purchasing high-end brand and low-end counter-

feits could imply that the brand could reoptimize to a higher price for the high-valuation consumers

(Frank and Salkevers 1997); Second, the brand charges a higher price to signal quality so as to sep-

arate from the counterfeits. Both effects are modeled in Section 2. However, should segmentation

of customers be the sole driver of the price increases, such an increase would be manifested mostly

for the higher-end authentic products, as these tailor to the higher-valuation consumers. The fact

that the net counterfeit effect (controlling for cost) is also positive and significant for the low-end

authentic price (Column 3 of Table 1) reveals at least some price signaling effect in action, as

predicted by Proposition 2, although a more complete test among competing hypotheses would

require detailed consumer-level data that are not available here.

       Results are qualitatively robust when the sample is split in other ways. When I stratified

the sample with looser conditions on counterfeit quality (e.g., quartile values), the results for the
                                                  28
subsamples of low-quality entrants remained qualitatively similar. The positive coefficient on the

entry dummy takes on more significance (economically and statistically) in the subsamples of “high-

quality” counterfeits when the definition of “high-quality entrant” becomes looser. The inclusion

of observations with lower-quality entrants naturally alters the average-effect estimates.


4.2        Quality Differentiation

       Propositions 1, 2, and 3 all predict innovations as a combating strategy with appropriate costs.

To gain a deeper understanding of the authentic quality responses, I gathered data on shoe charac-

teristics from the product catalogs. I ranked the quality in each observable or meaningful dimension

according to the cost of the materials used for that dimension.6 For the less quantifiable attributes,

I mainly used dummy indicators. I constructed the variable for shoe appearance by summing up

three dummy variables–fine, elegant, and patterns–each taking on a value of 1 if a pair of shoes was

described in the catalog as possessing the characteristic and 0 otherwise. A simple sum is generated

instead of a weighted sum to avoid biasing results according to prior beliefs as to which attributes

are the more important quality components. I then constructed a variable for functionality by

summing up the following indicator variables: versatility, cushioning (whether a pair of shoes has

cushioning effects), absorption (whether it can absorb sweat), countering athlete’s foot, softness,

comfort, sturdiness, warmth, friction (for protection on slippery ground), and additional features

for sport shoes such as durability, flexibility, and support.

          I exhausted all the attributes mentioned in the product catalogs. I also constructed a

variable indicating the technology applied to make the shoes. Before counterfeit entry, all the com-

panies used domestic equipment. However, after entry, many imported Italian production lines,

pattern-pressing machines, and equipment to make shoe bottoms with cowskins. I first constructed

a dummy variable for each type of equipment, and then added them up to generate the “equipment”

variable. I generated the variable “workmanship” to indicate whether the shoes were made with

detailed and careful craftsmanship. Finally, I added up the values of these different-characteristic

variables to obtain the overall quality proxy.
   6
     For instance, the variable for surface material takes on a value of 1 if a product is made of plastic,...,4
for regular cowskin,..., and 14 for crocodile skin, in ascending order of material costs. Similar procedures are
carried out to generate the variables for measuring the quality of the shoe side and bottom materials.


                                                      29
       To examine the actual innovations after a product was infringed by counterfeits, I carried

out regressions for the continuous variable for overall quality on counterfeits of brands in the leather-

shoe sector (Panel A of Table 2) and sport-shoe sector (Panel B), following the same identification

strategy and controlling for year- and company-fixed effects. I found statistically significant coeffi-

cients on the quality measures (log deflated production costs and overall quality rank), significant

at the 1% level (Table 2). In particular, the coefficients on counterfeit entry in the regressions for

overall quality ranks indicate that the overall authentic quality shifted up by 15 percent after the

brand experienced counterfeits (the modes of the distributions for quality ranks were approximately

equal to 20). This set of empirical findings directly supports the theory predictions on innovations,

and could be welfare enhancing under a wide parameter ranges, as in the simulation exercises.


4.3     Effectiveness of Other Marketing Strategies

   Propositions 3 and 4 predict self-enforcement strategies as means of deterring counterfeiting.

In this section, I explore the the stigma of counterfeits by regressing the counterfeit measure on a

set of variables as detailed in the variables column of Table 3. The results provide some evidence

that the strategies companies use to fight counterfeits are quite effective. In particular, establishing

an additional licensed company store helps to reduce counterfeit sale quantities as a fraction of

authentic quantities in the following year by 2%, on average, statistically significant at the 5%

level. Each store also helps to deter entry by 0.1% on average, although significant only at the 10%

level. Lagged-year enforcement costs are also shown to be negatively correlated with counterfeit

entry, sale quantities, and log sales. An additional 10,000 yuan ($1,250) invested in enforcement

reduces counterfeit sales by 0.3% on average, which is significant at the 5% level. These results

help to put some figures to the predictions in Propositions 3 and 4.

       The coefficients on the other controls (Rows 5-8 in Table 3) give additional insights to the

questions “What attracts counterfeit entry?” and “What suppresses counterfeit sales?” The pos-

itive coefficients on Gini, a traditional proxy for income inequality, are significant at the 5% level

for predicting counterfeit entry and sales. This implies that higher income inequality may give rise

to more demand for counterfeits, possibly because a larger segment of consumers would like to own

luxury products but cannot afford the authentic ones, and/or because status goods play a more

                                                   30
important role in a more unequal society. The lagged-year authentic sales are positively correlated

with counterfeit sales (Columns 1 and 3 in Table 4). Although not statistically significant, the

lagged-year authentic product cost is negatively associated with counterfeit sales (Column 3), indi-

cating that products of higher quality may be less targeted by counterfeiters, possibly because they

are more costly to imitate and there is less asymmetric information available to deceive consumers.

       While the authentic companies try all measures to fight counterfeits, are there variations in

the aggressiveness among companies? I test whether a firm’s strategies are complements or sub-

stitutes for its relationship with the government. As reported in Table 4, I regress the mean levels

of advertisement and enforcement expenditures, number of licensed stores, and quality upgrading

costs (difference in the log unit production cost as compared to the previous year), respectively, on

the relationship proxy (ISO approval days, as explained in 3.2), controlling for year- and company-

fixed effects. All relevant nominal terms are deflated with CPI and transformed to log terms.

Companies with a worse relationship with the government are shown to have established more

licensed retail stores and spent more on quality improvements, statistically significant at the 5%

levels. The coefficient on the ISO variable in the private enforcement expenditure regression is not

significant, although positive. This may not be surprising if we recall that even the companies with

good relationships with the government had to invest in monitoring markets after the government

reallocated enforcement resources in 1995. The difference is that they may work better with the

government to outlaw their discovered counterfeiters.

       The fact that the infringed brands had to coexist with counterfeiters even after investing

handsomely in a plethora of self-enforcement strategies in the period of loosened public enforcement

speaks to the necessity for government enforcement. In the years of strong government monitoring,

counterfeiters were afraid to enter the footwear market, whereas after the natural policy change,

brands had to compensate for the lack of public enforcement. Their strategies were not sufficient

to fully deter counterfeit entry but only to counter the infringement effects, as in the theoretical

predictions of the constrained separating equilibrium. In this sense, private enforcement seem less

effective than public enforcement and can be suboptimal from the social welfare perspective.




                                                 31
5     Conclusion

    Economic impacts of counterfeits are urgent concerns for business managers and policy makers.

The main contribution of this paper is to uncover such impacts and to propose marketing strategies

against counterfeits. I develop a vertical differentiation model for imitative and counterfeit entry to

predict and explain the pricing and marketing responses of authentic incumbents to new entry. By

examining the equilibrium conditions and allowing the authentic producer to endogenously deter-

mine quality and a set of other strategies besides price, I am able to provide a more complete picture

of the (dis)incentive structures for counterfeiting and brand protection. This study attempts to

provide a tractable theoretical framework to unveil the entry effects of counterfeits on the various

marketing norms.

       My analyses show that counterfeit entry may exert downward pressure on prices by lowering

expected quality in any short-run pooling equilibrum. More important, however, counterfeit entry

with low quality also induces the original producer to offer a higher-quality product at a higher

price. This suggests a successful business strategy to mitigate copycat competition: innovation. It

is noteworthy in the empirical setting that brands did not innovate in the long period prior to entry

by counterfeiters, even though there were sufficient competition among the brands. The analytical

model conceptualizes and resolves this puzzle: due to the knockoff nature of counterfeits, it presents

vertical differentiation to the market. Such competition brings unique pressure for the brand to

move up the quality ladder in a market where brand enjoys monopolitic power in its own niche

(even when it may coexist with other brands that are horizontally differentiated).

       The brand’s innovations and the newly-available counterfeits that tailor to low-valuation

consumers could imply some positive welfare improvement in diversifying demand and increasing

consumer surplus. However, individual consumers who prefer the baseline authentic quality (s)

at the monopoly price (p), if any exist, would be worse off if this quality level (s) were replaced

by a higher quality (Ms) at a higher price after counterfeits entered the market. In that sense,

counterfeiting may not be Pareto improving even if the overall social welfare increases. There is

no lack of market frictions generated by the asymmetric information between counterfeiters and

non-expert consumers. The analysis reveals that authentic producers may use a high price to signal


                                                  32
authenticity and deter counterfeits from pooling. In addition, an authentic company’s non-price

signaling devices push up costs or reinforce its local monopoly position, thereby helping its products

to sustain a high price.

       Company-level enforcement activities and licensed stores are shown to deter counterfeit en-

try or reduce counterfeit sales. Finally, for companies conducting business in developing countries,

it is worth noting that relationships with local governments play important roles in brand manage-

ment. Taking in a positive light, this implies that public-private partnership in enforcement could

be effective, leveraging both the private firms’ insider knowledge and the government’s sanction

power. In a world with asymmetric information, the social planner’s optimization could often re-

sult in corner solutions. Discretizing the optimization problem by inviting collaboration with the

brands who have vest interests and incentives to combat illegal activities such as counterfeits could

lead to more efficiency.

       Although starting from a simple model, the propositions have general implications for imita-

tive or counterfeit entries. Honest imitative entry (e.g., generic drugs) is analyzed in the benchmark

model. Imitations that are not honest about their quality generate asymmetric information and

their effects are analyzed in the framework with asymmetric information. The key model predictions

are validated with a unique panel dataset on shoe counterfeits. The set of analytical predications

also helps to explain a rich set of the empirical findings and many real-world cases, as explained in

the main text.

       This paper is a first step in exploring the complex impacts of counterfeits and the effective

combating strategies. While the current analyses shed light on a diverse set of business strategies

against counterfeits, there can be other strategies and other dimensions of asymmetric information

and implications associated with counterfeiting. I am making further attempts to better under-

stand counterfeiters’ decisions about market entry and potential complementary effects counterfeits

could have on authentic products.

          Table 1. Stratified Estimations for log(Pt ) on Lagged Entry


This table reports the IV estimates on the counterfeit entry effect on the log of deflated authentic prices. All
models use company- and year-fixed effects. Each column represents a regression in a different stratum classified
by the counterfeit quality of the brand, as specified in the column header. Columns 1 and 3 refer to the stratum
of brands infringed by low-quality counterfeits. Production cost is used to proxy quality. Columns 2 and 4 refer to
the stratum consisting of companies whose counterfeit quality is above the threshold level. Counterfeitt−2 dummy
equals 1 if counterfeit of a brand entered in year t-2; logCost is the authentic materials costs of products; m is the
counterfeit production cost divided by the authentic one; Heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors that correct
for clustering at the company level appear in parentheses. Statistical significance levels: *-10%; **-5%; ***-1%.

IV estimation on the counterfeit entry effect on authentic quality, estimated by log deflated costs and the sum of
various shoe characteristics, with the interaction of government enforcement change and relationship proxy as the
main IV. Panel A reports results for the leather shoe sector, and Panel B reports those for the sport shoe sector.

        Table 3. Predicting Counterfeit Entry, Quantities, and Sales
The counterfeit entry dummy (equalling one if counterfeits are discovered for a brand), counterfeit sale quantity as a
fraction of the authentic sale quantity, and counterfeit sales are regressed on the set of covariates in Column 1, with
company fixed effects, in three separate regressions. Each column reports one regression specification. lag licensed
store, lag sales, lag enforce, and lag cost are the lagged-year number of licensed stores, sales, enforcement investments,
and production costs for an authentic company; Real GDP per capita PPP, growth rates, and household consumption
(HHC) are obtained from the World Bank World Development Indicators. Gini coefficients are extracted from the
UN Human Development Reports. Due to space limitations, this table does not include a few other control variables
in the regression model: Loose is a dummy for government enforcement change, which equals one from 1995 on;
Relation between a company and local government is proxied by the number of workdays between the application
and grant dates of the ISO certificate for an authentic company. These are not related to the message of this paper
and can be found in Qian (2006). Heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors that correct for clustering at the
company level appear in parentheses. Statistical significance levels: *-10%; **-5%; ***-1%.

    This table reports the OLS estimations. Post-1995 (loosened government enforcement) data are used. All models use year and company fixed effects. ISO is the
    number of workdays an authentic company took to obtain the ISO certificate and proxies for the relationship between the company and the government. Various
    authentic outcome variables are regressed on this proxy, in separate regressions. Each column reports one regression specification. Column 1 reports entry effects
    on log advertisement costs, 2 for log number of licensed stores, 3 for log enforcement investments, and 4 for the log of unit production cost of the high-end shoe,
    reflecting authentic quality. All nominal terms are deflated with CPI. Heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors that correct for clustering at the company level
    appear in parentheses.Statistical significance levels: *-10%; **-5%; ***-1%. R-squre values from the two alternative regression specifications are similar, and I report
    the first specification R-square in the last line.

 Table A1. Summary Statistics Before and After the Loosening of Government Efforts in
                     Monitoring Footwear Trademarks in 1995

This table presents the summary statistics of the dataset, slicing into two parts: data prior to the year 1995, when
Chinese government reallocated enforcement resources away from the footwear sector to fill in the needs of the safety
sectors, and data post year 1995. Each row reports the means and standard deviations (in parentheses) of a variable
in the two time-lines. All company level data are gathered through original interviews and surveys. The percentage of
government resources devoted to monitoring the shoe sector is obtained from the Quality and Technology Supervision
Bureau. Real GDP per capita PPP, growth rates, consumption over income, and household consumption are obtained
from the World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI). Prices and costs are deflated using the Consumer Price
Index published in the WDI. Gini coefficients are extracted from the UN Human Development Reports.

A.1       Derivation of Status Signaling

    In a market without counterfeits, the consumer who is just indifferent between purchasing the
                                                        Pa −r
authentic product and nothing has a valuation of V =     sa .   The equilibrium price and quantities
                                                                                 Pa −r
can be derived by maximizing profits ΠM
                                      a = (Pa − ca ) ∗ D(Pa ) = (Pa − ca ) ∗ (1 − sa ). This yields:


                                             sa + ca + r
                                     PaM   =                                                            (4)

Proposition 5 Without counterfeits, authentic producer with brand premium r offers product with
                                 √       √
quality s instead of Ms iff c ≥ ( M − 1)( M s − r).

                                                                      (s+r)       2    (M s+r−c)2
Proof:    Solve ΠM      M
                 M s ≤ Πs by substituting in the equilibrium profits,   4s  ≥             4M s    .   Rear-
                                                       √       √
ranging the terms immediately gives the condition c ≥ ( M − 1)( M s − r).                   Q.E.D.

The intuition is similar to those explained in the previous Section. Moreover, we could rearrange
                                          √
the terms in the condition to obtain r ≥ M s − √Mc −1 . The proposition is equivalent to stating

that authentic monopoly will offer a lower quality iff its brand premium is high enough. This

suggests that brand premium and quality can be considered substitutes to some extent. When

the brand premium is very high, then the authentic producer has less incentive to develop a high

quality product without competition in the market.

         With counterfeits in the market, the consumer who is just indifferent between purchasing
                                                             Pa −Pc −(1−λ)r
a counterfeit and an authentic product has valuation V =         sa −ms     ,   and the consumer who is
                                                            Pc −λ∗r
indifferent between counterfeit and nothing has valuation     ms .    Following the same derivation as




                                                37
in Section 2.2.1, the equilibrium conditions in the game is:

                           2M (M − m)s + (M λ − m)r ca
                Pa =                                +
                                  2(2M − m)           2
                           m(Pa − r) λ ∗ r
                Pc =                 +
                              2M        2
                           1   (2M − m)ca    (4M − m − 3M λ)r
               Da =          −             +
                           2 4M (M − m)s        4M (M − m)s
                            3M − 2m     (3M − 2m)ca   (4M 2 − 7M m + 2m2 + M 2 λ)r    λr
                Dc =                  +             −                              −     .
                           2(2M − m) 4M (M − m)s         4M (M − m)(2M − m)s         2ms
Again, competition from counterfeits could stimulate authentic innovation if the higher quality M s

yields a higher profit than the regular quality s.

Proposition 6 When consumers of counterfeits could derive utility from the infringed brand status,

authentic producer has incentive to upgrade quality iff the innovation cost is below a threshold level,

and the authentic price will increase iff the counterfeit quality sc < s¯c where the threshold value of

s¯c is increasing in s, λ.

Proof:          First, solve ΠD      D
                              M s > Πs . Substituting in the duopoly equilibrium profits and rearrange

                            2M −m      2                                           2M −m+1           (2M −m+1)(M λ−m)r
terms, we have            8M (M −m)s c     − c ∗ B + C > 0, where B =              4(2M −m)      +   8M (M −m)(2M −m)s          and

C = ( 2M2M
         (M −m) 1−m s      m(M −1)(2−λ)
           −m − 2−m ) 2 + 2(2M −m)(2−m) r+
                                           2M (M −m)s+(M λ−m)r (M λ−m)r
                                                 2(2M −m)     4M (M −m)s −
                                                                           2(1−m)s+(λ−m)r (λ−m)r
                                                                               2(2−m)     4(1−m)s .

Ruling out the negative root, the authentic profit derived from the high quality product exceeds
                                                    B+   B 2 − 2M2M −m
                                                                  (M −m)s
                                                                          C
that from the low quality one iff c <                      2M −m              .
                                                         4M (M −m)s

              In addition, price of the authentic high-quality product would increase as compared to
                                                               2M (M −m)s+(M λ−m)r        cM s        s+r+cs
the monopoly case with a regular quality iff                         2(2M −m)         +    2     >      2    .      This implies

2M ∗ sa − 2M ∗ sc + (cM s − cs )(2M − m) > 2sa − sc + M (2 − λ)r, where sa = M s, cM s − cs = c.
                                               2(M −1)sa +(2M −m)c−M (2−λ)r                             ∂ s¯c       2M (M −1)
This condition is satisified iff sc <                      2M −1                  ≡ s¯c . Note that     ∂s      =    2M −1      >0
      ∂ s¯c        Mr
and   ∂λ      =   2M −1   > 0.             Q.E.D.

              This is clearly a stepstone in modeling the status-signaling aspect of counterfeiting due to

the space constraint.




A.2            Proofs

Proof for Lemma 1:

When the incumbent is a monopoly in the market, she would choose s over M s iff ΠL > ΠH . That
                                                                38
      (s)2        (M s−c)2
is,    4s    >      4M s .
                                   √         c
                                                           √
This implies: M +                      M≥    s   ≥M−           M

However, we already know that c < P < M s to ensure positive producer markup and consumer

utility. Thus, the upper bound (first inequality) is trivially satisfied.                                       Q.E.D.



      Proof for Lemma 2:

With new entry, if the incumbent still produces s, I derive the equilibrium solutions. If s is offered,

then equilibrium
                   (1−m)s                               (1−m)s
PaDS (s) =          2−m        and ΠDS
                                    a (s) =             4−2m) ;

      Proof for Proposition 1:

Lemmas 1 and 2 outline the case where the incumbent produces a low-quality product without

counterfeit entry but is induced to produce a high-quality product after entry. Under this scenario,
                                                                                 s                                c       M (M −m)s

It is almost identical to the comparative statics for Bertrand games. The threshold values for sc

      Proof for Proposition 2:


                                                                         39
         Under the unconstrained separating equilibrium, the game reduces to one with complete

information. Demand is segmented according to the vertically differentiated product qualities.
                                                                                              msPa
Given any incumbent price Pa , the profit-maximizing price for the entrant is Pc =             2sa ,     because

Πc = Pc ( sPaa−ms

Hence, Pase =        2M −m      +    2,    using M ≥ 1 to generalize sa . Note that if quality is s, then

ca = 0, M = 1. Substituting into condition (1), we can solve out the cutoff value of γ for the

constraint Pase =      2M −m      +    2   ≥ P to bind. Hence,

         We are left to solve for Pape . Maximizing Πpe

Lemma 4 The authentic price of the same-quality product drops if a pooling equilibrium is reached

between the authentic and the counterfeit producers.

ever, by assumption, m < 1, M ≥ 1, a contradiction.                      Q.E.D.



    Proof for Lemma 3:              We first compare the optimal authentic price in a separating duopoly
                                                                                           sa (sa −ms)       ca

   2     =   4sa −2ms .   It is obvious that this is negative. It implies that PaDS ≤ PaM . The only

possibility in separating equilibrium where the authentic price increases even with the same quality

is that the constraint binds, that is, Pa = P . This binding price can be higher than the monopoly

optimization instead of deviating to the pooling equilibrium. This requires Π¯se
                                                                              a ≥ Πa :

With all the parameters, analytically solving this inequality is very cumbersome and the result is

not presentable with lengthy expressions. However, computational plots show that there is a lower

bound of m that ensures the inequality holds, where m is a complex function of γ, b, M, c.

                                                  m≤m                                                   (7)

In the special case that the market is evenly divided into experts and novices who expect each

product is equally likely be an authentic or counterfeit (γ = b = .5) and the authentic quality

remains s pre- and post-entry (M = 1, c = 0), then m = .45.

        (5) and (6) outline the conditions for the price-signaling effects of the authentic products.

The intuition of the conditions is that, given a sufficiently large proportion of confused consumers

(γ), it is worth the pain for the authentic producer to price higher in order to signal her quality

relative to the counterfeiter’s. The sufficiently low counterfeit quality as a fraction of authentic

quality (m) guarantees the authentic producer that enough consumers will purchase her products

even at a higher price. The benefits of capturing the “novices” outweigh the costs of losing some

low-valuation consumers who may not purchase at the high price in the separating equilibrium.

        Q.E.D.



        I next consider P se > P M . Since unconstrained optimization always yields larger profits

than constrained optimization, we are assured that Πse   ¯se
                                                    a ≥ Πa whenever the separating equilibrium

                                                                               pe

is that it will enlarge the parameter ranges to support the increase in authentic price post-entry.

(Note that the conditions in Lemma 2 are sufficient but not necessary for Pase ≥ PaM .)


                                                          41
Lemma 5 If the authentic producer improves quality to M s post-entry, for a sufficiently big quality
      M
gap   m   and a corresponding range of γ, even the pooling price could exceed the monopoly price for

the old quality s.


Proof:      For Pape (M s) ≥ PaM (s) = 2s , we solve the inequality and obtain:

                 M       (1 − b)(sγM s (M − 2) − 2s(M − 1) − 2c(1 − γM s ))
                   ≥                                                                                    (8)
                 m   c(2b(1 − γM s ) + γM s ) + 2bs(M − 1) + sγM s (b(2 − M ) − 1)

Together with γM s fulfilling the pooling equilibrium condition (2), this range of quality gap leads

to a price increase.                Q.E.D.

          If the authentic producer adopts quality strategy 1, the quality gap between authentic and

counterfeit products widens, and consumers are willing to pay more to get the higher-quality au-

thentic products. In addition, the widened quality gap reduces the fraction of confused consumers.
                                      ∂P
(Note also, analytically, that        ∂M   > 0.) These factors support the higher price even in the pooling

equilibrium, intuitively explaining Lemma 3. I have shown earlier that in any separating equilib-

rium authentic prices, optimal or constrained, are bounded below by the pooling price. It follows

that Lemma 3 outlines the sufficient, but not necessary, conditions that the separating authentic

prices, whenever attainable, are higher than the monopoly price for the obsolete quality s.



          If the authentic producer chooses quality strategy 2, then she can never set a positive price

(P ) that is profitable to her in this setting. To see this, consider first the case that the authentic

producer truthfully reveals her updated quality to the public. Then, all consumers know that there

is in fact only one quality available in the market, and they will purchase from the producer who

charges a lower price. Knowing this, the counterfeiter, as the price follower, has the incentive to

charge P − ǫ where ǫ is an infinitely small number, and seize the entire market. This will happen

unless P − ǫ is less than the counterfeiting cost, which is assumed to be zero in the model. Consider

next the case that the authentic producer also decides to “fool” consumers by announcing publicly

that she produces a high-quality M s. Then the counterfeiter may have an incentive to charge a

high price to mislead non-expert consumers into thinking his products are of high quality, as long

as this will yield more profits for him:

γPc (1 −    Pc −P
           M s−ms )   > γ2 P (1 −        P
                                    bM s+(1−b)ms )
                                                         42
If we denote Pc = λP , with λ > 1, then this incentive constraint for the counterfeiter, ICc , reduces
                 P 2λ(λ−1)            1
to 2λ − 1 >      s ( M −m    −   b(M −m)+m )
                        M −m
If 2λ(λ − 1) <       b(M −m)+m ,   then the inequality always holds. This happens when there is a suffi-

ciently large deceived quality gap M − m (I say deceived because there is no gap in reality if the

authentic producer adopts ms). Otherwise, the ICc becomes:

                                          P                2λ − 1
                                            <    2λ(λ−1)
                                                                                                     (9)
                                          s                −        1

The authentic producer calculates and compares the pooling and separating equilibria in this cir-

cumstance. Mathematically, she solves:
                                                   λP −P            P

Lemma 6 If the authentic producer decides to degrade quality, then she has only an incentive to

truthfully reveal the updated quality in public. Knowing this, quality strategy 2 is strictly dominated

by strategies 1 and 3.


Proof:        Suppose to the contrary that M > m, then the pooling equilibrium is attainable iff:
P pe              2λ−1
 s     ≥   2λ(λ−1)        1
                                 This requires that:
            M −m
                   − b(M −m)+m


                −m(m + b(M − m))λ2 + (m + b(M − m))(2M − m)λ − M (1 − b)(M − m)
           γ>                                                                                       (10)
                                       b(M − m)2 (2λ − 1)

Since 0 ≤ γ ≤ 1, for (7) to make sense, it is also needed that:
                                               p
                 2M − m + b(M − m) +            (2M + bM − m − bm)2 − 2(M − m)(m − bm + bM )
       λ ≥                                                                                   ;
                                                   2(m − bm + bM )
                                   p
                 M (m − M ) +       3(−m4 + 4m3 M − 6m2 M 2 + 4mM 3 − M 4 )
       b >                                                                                          (11)
                                           (M − m)2

It happens, however, that the expression under the square root is always non-positive, and equaling

0 when m = M . This leads to a contradiction with the supposition that M > m. Coupled with the

previous analyses that the authentic producer would earn zero profit with zero price if she chose to

produce ms and truthfully report to the public, I have proved that strategy 2 is strictly dominated
                                                            43
by strategy 1. That is, the authentic producer will not imitate the counterfeiter.                    Q.E.D.




Lemma 7 If the authentic producer decides to upgrade quality after the entry by counterfeiters,

then the authentic price will rise in the unconstrained separating equilibrium if the entrant’s quality

sc < cutoff. This cutoff value is increasing in M or s.


Proof:         In an unconstrained separating equilibrium with the higher-quality M s, the optimal au-

thentic price is the same as the one derived for the game with symmetric information: P D =
c       M (M −m)s
2   +    2M −m .    The original prices rise after entry if
          s                 2M ((M −1)s+c)−mc
PD ≥      2   ⇔ sc = ms ≤         2M −1         = cutoff

(⇔ s ≤        2M (1+m−M )−m )


                                               2(2M −1)s+2c
                                ∂cutof f
                                  ∂M       =      2M −1     − 4M (M −1)s+4M c
                                                                  (2M −1)2
                                                                                 ≥ 0;
                                ∂cutof f       2M (M −1)
                                   ∂s      =     2M −1   > 0;
The threshold values for sc increase as M or s rises.                  Q.E.D.

          It is worth noting that the existence of the unconstrained separating equilibrium relies on

two Incentive Constraints:
      pe
Πse
 c ≥ Πc (IC1)
          pe
and Πse
     a ≥ Πa (IC2)

IC1 implies that       c
                       s   > −2( M2M
                                   (M −m)
                                     −m +
                                                2(M −m)M (m−bm+bM )γ
                                               m(m−bm+bM )+2M γ(M −m) ),      which always holds because the

right-hand side is negative under the defined parameter values. IC2 for the authentic producer says

that:
(2M (M −m)s−(2M −m)c)2          (M (m−bm+bM )s(2−γ)−c(2(1−b)m(1−γ)+M (2b+γ−2bγ)))2
  8M (2M −m)(M −m)s         ≥       8M (m−bm+bM )s(M (2b(1−γ)+γ)+2m(1−b)(1−γ))
                                                        c       2M (M −m)
The calculation is messy, but it turns out that         s   ≤    2M −m ,    providing a sufficient condition for

the inequality to hold.



          The previous Lemmas trace out the wide set of necessary parameter ranges for a price in-

crease under asymmetric information. This finally completes the proof for Proposition 2.                    Q.E.D.

Proof for Proposition 4:                        The change in prices of the authentic producer is calculated to be:

A.3          Off-equilibrium Path and Game Refinement
                         S
Let B(φ, Φ̂, p) =            µ:µ(Φ̂|p)=1 {a   ∈ M BR(µ, p)|µ∗i (φ) < ui (p, a, φ)}. That is, B is the set of mixed

best responses (MBR). φ-type of producer is better off by sending message p than the equilibrium

message P ∗ . Note that µ(Φ̂|p) = 1 represents that the consumer believes that message p comes

only from types in the subset Φ̂ ∈ Φ.

       I specify the off-the-equilibrium beliefs as follows: if a non-expert consumer observes a uniform

price over the market, then he forms the belief that a product is authentic with probability b and

counterfeit with probability 1 − b. He watches TV and knows what the authentic quality should be,

although he cannot tell it in practice. He also can calculate the Pase , P , and Pape . If he observes

two prices on the market, the higher of which is equal to either Pase or P , he believes that the

higher-priced one is authentic and the other counterfeit. If, however, he observes any other two

prices on the market, he assumes both are counterfeits. This belief system helps to rule out the

unrealistic case that the counterfeiter may want to charge a price higher than the authentic price

in order to fool non-expert consumers into mismatching types.

                                                                   45
    We start by considering the separating equilibrium. If the authentic producer deviates to

p′ 6= Pa∗ , consumers believe that the product is a counterfeit with quality ms. The resulting profit
                                                                    p′ −Pc
for the authentic producer would then be (p′ − ca)[1 −            (M −m)∗s ].   This is less than the optimized

Π∗a (s∗a , Pa∗ ). Therefore, B(φa , Φ̂, p′ ) ⊂ B(φc , Φ̂, p′ ), where B(φa , Φ̂, p′ ) is the empty set, and hence

Φ(p′ ) = {φc }. Repeating this process for any off-the-equilibrium message, consumers’ beliefs are

restricted to Φ(p′ ) = {φc }; the counterfeiter is the seller, if any, who is most likely to deviate.

    Let us first consider the case that the counterfeiter deviates. Given Φ(p′ ) = {φc }, the minimal

profit level that the counterfeiter could achieve by sending the off-the-equilibrium message p′ over

the set of possible consumers demand response is:

                                                                              Pa − p′  p′
                     M INd∈D∗ (Φ(p∗ ,p∗ )    πc (p∗ , d, φc ) = (p′ − ca)[            − ]
                                                                             (sa − ms) sa
                                                             < πc∗ (Pc∗ )

                                             Pa − Pc Pc
    This follows because Pc∗ = argmaxPc Pc [         − ].
                                             sa − sc  sc
                                        |        {z      }
                                                       πc (Pc )


    Therefore, the counterfeiter does not have an incentive to deviate under the off-the-equilibrium

beliefs.

    Given this, the off-the-equilibrium belief as specified is stable under the D1 criterion. The

consistent out-of-equlibrium belief is as follows: If the consumer observes two prices on the market,

the higher of which is equal to Pase , he then believes that the higher-priced one is authentic (φi = φa )

and the other counterfeit (φi = φc ). If, however, he observes any other two prices on the market,

he assumes both are counterfeits.

    Next, we consider the pooling equilibrium analogously. Suppose the authentic producer deviates

to p′′ 6= P ∗ , then consumers believe that the product is a counterfeit. The resulting profit for the
                                                          Dpool
authentic producer would then be (p′′ − ca)[1 −            2 ].    This is less than the counterfeiter’s new
                 Dpool
profit p′′ [1−    2 ],   and less than the optimized pooling equilibrium profit. Therefore, B(φa , Φ̂, p′′ ) ⊂

B(φc , Φ̂, p′′ ), where B(φa , Φ̂, p′′ ) = {}, and hence Φ(p′′ ) = {φc }. Repeating this process for any

off-the-equilibrium message, consumers’ beliefs are restricted to Φ(p′′ ) = {φc }; the counterfeiter is

the seller, if any, who is most likely to deviate.

    Given Φ(p′′ ) = {φc }, the consumer utility U (p′′ ) = (1 − b)(V ∗ m ∗ s − p′′ ) + b ∗ (V ∗ M ∗ s − p′′ ).
                                                        46
Thus, the minimal profit level that the counterfeiter could achieve by sending the off-the-equilibrium

message p′′ is:

                                                                               Dpool
                         M INd∈D∗ (Φ(p∗ ,p∗ )    πc (p∗ , d, φc ) = p′′ [1 −         ]
                                                                                2
                                                                 < πcpool∗ (P ∗ )


This follows because P ∗ = argmaxP πcpool∗ (P ∗ ).



   Therefore, the counterfeiter does not have an incentive to deviate under the off-the-equilibrium

beliefs. Given this, the off-the-equilibrium belief as specified is stable under the D1 criterion.

                  <   CS M

The math confirms the intuition that authentic demand and consumer surplus decline in the pool-

ing equilibrium if a low-quality product enters.




A.5      Robustness to Alternative Specifications
A.5.1     Alternative Specification of Cost

   Instead of assuming away the production costs of the low-quality authentic product and the

counterfeit, let the corresponding costs be Ca , and Cc , respectively, where a = s, M s and CM s −

                                                  . Discarding the negative root, this solves out to
         √                √            √
be CM s − M Cs ≥ (M − M )s + (1 − M )r. This result is qualitatively similar to Proposition

1, with the intuition that the authentic monopoly will offer the low-quality product as long as the

additional cost for a high-quality product is higher than a threshold level to justify the gain from

the higher quality.

        When faced with counterfeit entry, the duopoly profits are as follows:

The reaction function of the counterfeiter is solved similar to the benchmark model Pc =                           2sa   + C2c .

The equilibrium prices and demand are:

where M ≥ 1 generalizes the two quality options of an authentic product.

        In this duopoly competition case, the authentic producer will opt to offer the higher quality

ducer is stimulated to upgrade quality to differentiate from counterfeits if and only if the additional

cost of doing so is not too high.

        Finally, the price increases in the duopoly case with a higher quality as compared to the
                                                  M (M −m)s         CM s        M Cc        (1−m)s       Cs        Cc

arranging terms gives sc = ms <                  2M −1          +   2 .    This echoes the intuition conveyed in

Proposition 3 that authentic price rises if and only if the counterfeit entrant’s quality is below a

threshold value.


                                                       48
A.5.2         Alternative Specification of Quality

     Instead of assuming that the quality of the counterfeit is a fraction of the quality of the authen-

tic product, I allow the counterfeit to choose a quality that is a constant less than the authentic

quality. That is, the brand can choose between quality s and s + A, and the counterfeiter produces

s − a. Similar to Section 2, we can derive the demand and profits for authentic and counterfeit

products accordingly.

           Without counterfeits in the market, the demand for authentic product is 1− Psa if the quality
                   Pa
is s and 1 −      s+A   if the quality is s + A. The optimal price for each quality can be obtained from

maximizing the authentic profit with respect to its price. The resulting optimized profits are equal
     s2                                  (s+A−c)2
to   4s   if quality s is produced and    4(s+A)    if quality s + A is produced. The authentic company

decides which quality to provide depending on which would yield a larger profit. Therefore, a lower
                         s2           2                       √
quality s is offered iff 4s ≥ (s+A−c)                           2
                               4(s+A) , implying c ≥ (A + s) + s + As. The prediction is similar to

Proposition 1 in that when higher quality would raise costs more than it would yield profits, the

monopoly incumbent offers a lower quality.

           With counterfeit infringements, we again have duopoly competition. Section 2.2.1 derives

out the equilibrium conditions for the general form of authentic quality sa . It is then straightfor-

ward to prove that the authentic company will upgrade quality from s to s + A iff the higher quality

yields larger profit in the duopoly condition. That is,
                   (s−a)a                           (s+A)(A+a)         (s−a)(A+a)       (s−a)c
               sa

                                                           A+a
                                                                        4(s+A)
                                                                               )
                                              q
                              2(s+A)(A+a)        a(s+A)(A+a)
This inequality holds iff c ≤ (s+A)+(A+a)  − 2 s(s+a)(s+2A+a)  . This is again consistent with Propo-

sition 2 that fake entry pushes the incumbent to upgrade quality in the hope of alleviating com-

petition by widening the quality gap, provided that the additional costs are not too high.

           Finally, under conditions outlined in the previous two paragraphs, the authentic price in-
                                                (s+A)(A+a)        c
creases with counterfeit infringements iff        s+2A+a     +    2   > 2s , which is equivalent to sc = s − a <
      (s−c)(s+2A)−2A(s+A)
s−           s+2A+c       .    This echos Proposition 3 that authentic price increases only when the

entrant quality is below a threshold level.

A.5.3      Baseline Results with Oligopolist Brands

    Consider a market with N brands, with product quality sa and brand premium N . Without

loss of generality, I denote that the ordering of qualities is in descending order as s1 , s2 , ..., sN and

that the ordering is strict. I keep the same set-up for consumers’ preferences. Analogous to the

leadership-follower logic, I consider that firms set prices sequentially in order of quality, with the

highest-quality firm’s moves first. The consumer who is just indifferent between buying a brand n

and not buying has utility V ∗sa +rn −Pn ≥ 0, and the consumer decides which brand to buy depend-

ing on which yields a higher utility: V ∗sa +rn −Pn ≥ V ∗sa +ro −Po ∀o = 1, ..., n−1andn+1, ..., N .
                                                                                             (PN −1 −PN

does not set a zero price, firm n + 1 could also have positive market share and profits. As a result,

no firm would ever set a degenerate price in equilibrium, and all firms would have positive market

shares.

with respect to PN , I derive the reaction function PN =       2sN −1 .   Substitute this reaction function

into the profit function of firm N − 1, which is then solved and can be substituted into the profit

function of firms N − 2, .... The general formula of the profit function for firm n, n = 2, ..., N − 1

is Πn = Pn ∗ ( Psn−1 −Pn

                                                                                                 s1 −s2 ),   and

the profit function of firm N is ΠN = PN ( sN −1   N

                                                     −      sN ).   Any innovation by a firm n above its

baseline quality level sn would incurr it extra marginal cost of cn .

          Computing the equilibrium involves little intellectual but tedious work. The results yield

similar intuition to the benchmark case in the maintext. In particular, the entry of a low-quality

counterfeiter would stimulate quality upgrades sequentially for brands of quality above the coun-

terfeiter’s under regularity conditions underlying the innovation cost. To give a simple example

with two branded producers with qualities s and M1 ∗ s (M1 > 1), respectively, the market without

a counterfeiter is a duopoly market with profits:

                                                          P1 − P2
                                     Π1 = P1 ∗ (1 −                )
                                                        M1 ∗ s − s
                                                      P1 − P2     P2
                                     Π2     = P2 ∗ (            −    )
                                                     M1 ∗ s − s    s
                                                     50
After a counterfeiter of quality m∗s(m ≤ 1) enters the market, the oligopolist market under perfect

information would be segmented into three segments of consumers who purchase from Brand 1,

Brand 2, and the counterfeiter, respectively. Their profit functions are:

                                                   P1 − P2
                               Π1 = P1 ∗ (1 −                )
                                                 M1 ∗ s − s2
                                               P1 − P2       P2 − Pc
                               Π2   = P2 ∗ (             −             )
                                             M1 ∗ s − s2 s2 − m ∗ s
                                              P2 − Pc
                               Π3   = Pc ∗ (            − f racPc m ∗ s)
                                             s2 − m ∗ s

It is not surprising that the counterfeiter now steals part of Brand 2’s market share, and Brand 2

would have an incentive to upgrade quality from s to M ∗ s iff Π2 (M ∗ s) > Π2 (s)(M > 1). Once

Brand 2 moves up the quality ladder, Brand 1 is also influenced as some of the original market

shares are now shifted to Brand 2. Brand 1 will also innovate if Π2 (M2 ∗s) > Π2 (M1 ∗s) (M2 > M1 ).

Therefore, both brands will innovate in the face of nondeceptive counterfeits iff

                              P1 − P2          P2 − Pc               P D − P2D     PD

                                                                                    )

These yield the cost conditions:

                     2M3 s − M s      2 2 4M3 s(M3 − M )     4M2 − 2

The intuition is similar to the benchmark case that the cost of innovations has to be large enough to

discourage the brands from investing in the higher qualities without counterfeiting, but surmount-

able so that the brands are willing to innovate and differentiate from the counterfeiter.


B      Data Appendix
B.1     Data Checks

    To check the survey data quality, especially firms’ cost estimates from their balance sheets, I

conducted a set of hedonic regressions, as mentioned in Section 3. The set of shoe characteristics

gathered from the printed product catalogs explains over 90% of the variation in reported costs

                                                  51
and over 80% of the price variation. Production costs are also highly correlated with features that

require high material and labor costs, such as using imported crocodile skin and Italian machinery,

as one would expect. In addition, a cross-validation of a random sample of these price and cost data

based on my calculations from the annual catalogs and companies’ responses from their databases

was performed to make sure that the cost estimates were in the right ballpark. For instance, know-

ing that a particular level of shoes is made of top-tier cow-skin implies that the material costs would

be around 448 yuan (approximately 56 USD). If the shoe bottom is also made of fine cow-skin,

that would cost an additional 17.4 USD.

       For the data on counterfeits, I cross-referenced the data from the companies with the avail-

able records from the Industrial and Commercial Bureau of China (ICBC) and the QTSB. In addi-

tion, the QTSB kindly shared with me the shoe characteristics from its testing reports for a set of

counterfeits, together with their product materials, costs, and prices as recorded in the confiscated

financial records. Most counterfeit shoes are made of inferior materials, ranging from second-tier

leather to imitative leather to plastic cement. The cost differentials reflect the use of different

materials, as evidenced by the statistically significant coefficients associated with imitative-leather

and plastic-cement variables. It is stunning to note that many materials are invariant across the

sample of counterfeits. For instance, the shoe bottoms are all made of TPU. The counterfeit sport

shoes are surfaced with PU and net-like materials, and are equipped with no inner-air cushions or

non-standard foam cushions to imitate the look of branded shoes. Interestingly still, the quality

level of the branded shoe whose appearance the counterfeit product is mimicking does not corre-

late with the counterfeit costs but correlates highly with the counterfeit product price. This again

indicates that counterfeiters use very similar inputs to produce shoes of all imitative levels, and

determine their prices largely based on the brand that they are imitating.

       Among the responsive companies, 80% were infringed upon at different levels. These compa-

nies ranged from top-tier household names to low-end producers of small brands. While interviewing

the companies, I learned that those infringed upon by counterfeits invest in enforcement activities

by sending their employees to monitor counterfeits, lobbying at the local government level to outlaw

counterfeit localities, and organizing anti-counterfeit conferences. The companies also uniformly

tell me that establishing company stores for their brands is a very good strategy to signal their
                                                  52
quality and to ward off counterfeits. One company’s manager said during the interview: “Starting

from 1996, our company products have exited the wholesale market and we switched the channel

to licensed retailing. We established a well-managed retail distribution system nationwide. This

is one of the most effective ways to combat counterfeits, and it almost deterred counterfeiting.”

In order to set up a licensed retail store, a company has to get approval from the ICBC. The

application requires legal documents about the brands. The formal approval certificate has to be

displayed in each licensed store. Therefore, the counterfeiters are not able to mimic this business

strategy. In fact, establishing a fake licensed store will only help the authentic company and the

local government track down the counterfeits and no counterfeiter has an incentive to do that. I

therefore obtained data on enforcement expenditures, personnel, and number of licensed stores to

test empirically the effectiveness of these strategies in deterring entry.

       I further gathered data on whether the sampled companies and their regional subsidiaries

were awarded import licenses to serve as an alternative measure of the relationship, or political

connectedness, of these brands. This was a difficult process and I was able to obtain the data for

only one year (I chose the first ISO year as my priority year in data requests). I identified which of

the sampled companies were approved with import licenses as of 1995, as those were likely to be

the companies with a better relationship with the government [Mobarak and Purbasari, 2006]. The

ISO data correlate with this alternative connectedness measure (correlation coefficient = -0.64).

I still used the ISO measure to interact with policy changes as the main instrument because the

ISO measures the relationship with the QTSB, which is the government agency that directly deals

with counterfeits. The Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Bureau (which used to be called

the Foreign Trade and Economics Delegation Committee) is in charge of awarding import licenses.

Companies that are not granted import and export rights have to go through intermediate agents,

such as the Import and Export Companies, to carry out import and export. These intermediate

agents are professional service companies analogous to law or accounting firms.


B.2     Sample Representativeness

   I acquired access to the Chinese Industrial Census database for the years 1995 and 1998-2001.

The data for 1995 and the dataset for 1998-2001 contain slightly different lists of variables and do

                                                  53
not match up fully. The database contains firm-level sales, profits, year of establishment, owner-

ship, and other financial information for all the registered companies in China. I compared the

common variables in my sample to those in the Industrial Census database. The mean and standard

deviations of sales, profits, and most other common variables are very similar across the two data

sources (Table A.2 in Qian 2008). The alignment in sales costs across data sources again confirms

the data reliability. However, my sample of small enterprises has a higher mean value for exports,

profits, and size (460 employees) than that of the census database (230 employees), which is to be

expected as branded companies are usually larger. There are many very small companies in the

census database that produce only generic shoes. Any draws of such companies were screened out

of the final sample for my research question. There are no shortage of small-scale family businesses

in the countryside. The census data also provide ample evidence that, while no shoe company qual-

ifies as large, there is a long tail of small companies. In the census data across 1998-2001, there are

only 23 medium-size companies (including first-class medium-size and second-class medium-size).

My sample covers 22 of the medium-size companies. It additionally includes some smaller-size

branded companies resulting from the random sampling method. Summing up the market share

data provided to me, the total market share of the companies in my sample approaches 90%. A

large number of the small companies can be considered competitive fringe firms. Thus, even though

my sample size is limited, the sample of companies highly represents the brand-active part of the

market, where the main interests of this paper lie.

       In addition, for the common variables of the companies that are found in both my sample

and the Industrial Census database, such as sales costs, sales, exports, and incorporation year (used

to calculate company age), I was able to directly see the one-to-one correspondence between the val-

ues provided by the sampled companies and the values recorded in the Industrial Census database.

This provides evidence that the sampled companies provided me with data out of their financial

records, as I requested specifically in my surveys. While I acknowledge potential limitations in the

paper, I am confident about the general quality of the data and responses.

       The industrial census does not contain price data, so I gathered price data for shoes of

the sampled brands from the eBay China Website, with help from researchers at the University of

Chicago. The mean price for the high-end shoes in the Ebay data is 460 yuan (57.5 USD), which
                                                  54
is very similar to the mean of 491.86 yuan (61.5 USD) in my dataset. The prices for medium- and

low-end shoes exhibit a very dispersed pattern in the eBay dataset, possibly due to the mixing in of

counterfeits. When I drop the extremely low prices (e.g., those under 10 USD), the mean prices for

medium- and low-end shoes are also similar to those in my sampled data. When taking the mean

price of all the non-high-end shoes from the Ebay data, the results are quite comparable to the

mean prices of medium-end, low-end, and counterfeit shoes in my dataset. All these corroborations

speak to the representativeness and reliability of my sample and data.




B.3        Additional Data Diagnostics to Preclude Confounding Expla-
           nations

       China entered an incredible boom in the late 1980s, which continued through the 1990s. Easy

credit conditions prevailed in China primarily in the 1980s.7 An unsustainable credit expansion

drove demand well beyond supply, and prices began to rise rapidly. At the peak, the CPI was grow-

ing at around 25% per year, and China was taking in a massive quantity of imports, and running a

substantial current-account deficit. China had to tighten credit conditions in the early 1990s in the

hope of slowing the acceleration of nonperforming loans.8 Zhu Rongji took strong steps to slow the

growth. Investments and growth dropped sharply, as did the rate of price increases. By the late

1990s, there was deflation in China. Given the negative macro trends in the mid- to late-1990s, the

positive coefficients on the instrumented counterfeit entry lagged by two to three years (controlling

for year and company dummies), providing rather convincing evidence that the higher authentic

prices and sales were due to strategies against counterfeits rather than macro factors.

          According to exchange rate data from the IMF International Financial Statistics and the

UPenn World Tables, China’s foreign exchange regime was reformed in 1993, and a multiple ex-

change rate system was eliminated and the real exchange rate substantially devalued. The major

devaluation occurred in 1994 (from 576.2 yuan equaling 100 USD in 1993 to 861.87 yuan equaling

100 USD in 1994). Those firms purchasing foreign inputs or materials saw the RMB(yuan) costs of

those purchases go up. These companies would then require a lot of incentive to import expensive

foreign machinery and materials, as seen in the data. This in fact reinforces my argument that the

effects of entry by counterfeiters are quite significant.

        I additionally gathered economic data at the regional level on income per capita, growth,

prices, and inequality. The data exhibit a drastic widening of inequality in the late 1980s and

early 1990s, instead of in the late 1990s, when the authentic quality upgrades and price hikes were

most pronounced. In addition, the shoe industry size stabilized after the late 1980s, and national

statistics show that the number of employees in the footwear and garment industry was around

1,750,000 throughout the 1990s (Tables 12-2 and 13-2 in each yearbook, Chinese National Bureau of

Statistics). According to the Basic Unit Census of China [The National Bureau of Statistics, 1996],

the massive entry of legal shoe companies took place in the late 1980s. The number of companies

increased from 348 in 1984 to 1,058 in 1985, with some further increases in the following years. The

1990s witnessed some declines in the number of shoe companies, but the industry size stabilized

at around 1,000 registered firms. Therefore, this study examines a period where the registered

companies coexisted relatively peacefully, and the effects of counterfeit entry can be teased out

relatively easily.

        To take into account potential ramifications arising from industry differentials in price lev-

els, I also gathered data on CPI specifically for the shoe and garment sector from the yearbooks,

and found this price index to follow the overall CPI quite closely (correlation coefficient = 0.89).

All these supplemental data diagnostics and research into macro or regional market conditions in

the sampled years yield additional support for the findings and conclusions in this study.
