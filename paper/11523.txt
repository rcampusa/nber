We use a micro-founded macroeconometric modeling framework to investigate the design of

monetary policy when the central bank faces uncertainty about the true structure of the economy. We

apply Bayesian methods to estimate the parameters of the baseline specification using postwar U.S.

data, and then determine the policy under commitment that maximizes household welfare. We find

that the performance of the optimal policy is closely matched by a simple operational rule that

focuses solely on stabilizing nominal wage inflation. Furthermore, this simple wage stabilization rule

is remarkably robust to uncertainty about the model parameters and to various assumptions regarding

the nature and incidence of the innovations. However, the characteristics of optimal policy are very

sensitive to the specification of the wage contracting mechanism, thereby highlighting the

importance of additional research regarding the structure of labor markets and wage determination.

1         Introduction

Eight years ago, two Macroeconomics Annual papers–Goodfriend and King (1997) and
Rotemberg and Woodford (1997)–played a central role in stimulating a burgeoning research

program regarding the monetary policy implications of macroeconomic models with explicit
microeconomic foundations.1 This research program incorporates two crucial elements com-

pared with more traditional monetary policy analysis. First, reflecting the influence of the
Lucas (1976) critique, the emphasis on explicit microeconomic foundations is intended to en-

sure that the resulting structural equations are reasonably invariant to the choice of monetary

policy. Second, this research follows the standard public finance approach of determining
the policy regime that maximizes household welfare and then evaluating the performance of
alternative policies relative to this benchmark.

        After initially focusing on small stylized models, this line of research has subsequently
proceeded to analyze micro-founded macroeconometric models that incorporate an expanded

set of nominal and real rigidities and hence can be matched more closely to observed ag-

gregate data. For example, Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005) (henceforth CEE)

specified a dynamic general equilibrium model with a number of distinct structural features:

staggered wage and price setting with partial indexation; habit persistence in consumption;

endogenous capital accumulation with higher-order adjustment costs; and variable capac-
ity utilization.2 Smets and Wouters (2003a) (henceforth SW) later applied full-information
    1
     Other early examples include Levin (1989), King and Wolman (1999), McCallum and Nelson (1999), and
Rotemberg and Woodford (1999). For a thorough presentation of this approach as well as a comprehensive
bibliography, see Woodford (2003).
   2
     Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005) also documented the importance of these structural features
in generating a model-implied response to a monetary policy shock consistent with that of an identified
vector autoregression (VAR). More recently, Altig, Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Linde (2004) have extended


                                                   1
Bayesian methods to estimate essentially the same specification (augmented by a larger set

of structural disturbances), and found that the model is competitive with an unrestricted
Bayesian VAR in terms of goodness-of-fit and out-of-sample forecasting performance.3

   In this paper, we investigate the design of monetary policy when the central bank faces
uncertainty regarding the true structure of the economy. Of course, a long-established litera-

ture has considered this topic using traditional structural macroeconomic models, building on

the seminal work of Brainard (1967).4 Nevertheless, recent analysis of small stylized micro-

founded models has demonstrated that the implications of uncertainty can be markedly
different when the policymaker’s goal is to maximize household welfare, because the welfare

function itself depends on the specification and parameter values of the model.5

   By using a micro-founded macroeconometric modeling framework, we can examine the

policy implications of several aspects of uncertainty that may be more difficult to consider
in a small stylized model. First, by applying Bayesian methods, we can use the posterior
distribution of the model parameters to determine whether simple rules that perform well in

the baseline economy are robust to parameter uncertainty, that is, to the range of parameter

values that are reasonably consistent with the observed data. Second, we can gauge the
degree of innovation uncertainty by evaluating the extent to which the policy conclusions

are sensitive to alternative assumptions regarding the nature and incidence of the structural

shocks to the model. Finally, we can explore the implications of specification uncertainty by

changing specific features of the model such as the role of money balances or the structure
the model to incorporate firm-specific capital accumulation and have analyzed its behavior in response to
productivity shocks, while Christiano, Motto, and Rostagno (2004) incorporate a banking system and capital
market frictions in their study of the Great Depression.

under uncertainty; see Hansen and Sargent (2003), Onatski and Stock (2002), Onatski (2000), Giannoni

of nominal contracts.6

       As the baseline specification for our analysis, we use a micro-founded macroeconometric
model similar to those studied by CEE and SW. Applying a Bayesian procedure to estimate

this model with postwar U.S. data, we set the baseline values of the model parameters using
the mean of the posterior distribution. We employ Lagrangian methods to determine the

optimal policy under commitment in the baseline economy. Finally, we use second-order

perturbation to solve the model and compute the level of welfare under the optimal policy

as well as for alternative simple rules.7
       We find that a simple interest rate rule that responds solely to nominal wage inflation and

the lagged interest rate yields a welfare outcome that nearly matches that under the fully

optimal policy.8 Because this rule only involves observable variables and does not require

a measure of the output gap, the natural rate of interest, or forecasts of variables, the rule
can be implemented without assuming that the policymaker knows the correct specification
of the model or the true values of the model parameters.

       The near-optimality of the simple wage stabilization rule is directly attributable to the

overriding importance of nominal wage inertia in determining the welfare costs of aggregate
fluctuations in the baseline economy. This inertia reflects the relatively long duration of

nominal wage contracts as well as the nearly-uniform degree of indexation to lagged inflation.

Furthermore, under our baseline specification of Calvo-style contracts with an exogenous

probability of reoptimization, many wage contracts remain in effect much longer than the

     We do not explicitly consider the policy implications of uncertainty about the current state of the
economy; for recent analysis of this issue, see Orphanides (2001), Croushore and Stark (2003), Svensson and
Woodford (2003), Aoki (2003), Orphanides and Williams (2002), and Orphanides and Williams (2005).

     The optimal policy regime and optimized simple rules have previously been studied in micro-founded
macroeconometric models by Onatski and N. Williams (2004), Levin and Lopez-Salido (2004), Laforte (2003),
and Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2004).
   8
     While we focus on simple interest rate rules in this paper, an alternative approach is to specify a simplified
objective function for the central bank, as in the literature on flexible inflation targeting; see Svensson and
Woodford (2004) and Giannoni and Woodford (2004). Although not reported here, our preliminary analysis
suggests that stabilizing a wage inflation objective may also perform well in terms of welfare.

one-year average duration. Thus, as emphasized by Erceg, Henderson, and Levin (2000),

stabilizing aggregate wage inflation helps alleviate the degree of cross-sectional dispersion in
real wages and thereby minimizes the associated inefficiencies in employment of differentiated

labor services and in the allocation of leisure across households.
   The simple wage stabilization rule is remarkably robust to parameter uncertainty and
innovation uncertainty and to some modifications of the baseline model specification. For

example, this rule yields near-optimal performance throughout the empirically relevant range

of values of the model parameters, a finding consistent with our earlier work regarding the
relatively minor importance of this type of uncertainty.9 The performance of the wage

stabilization rule is also relatively insensitive to various assumptions regarding the nature

and incidence of the innovations and to augmenting the model to incorporate monetary

frictions.
   Nevertheless, the policy implications can be quite sensitive to alternative specifications of
the wage contracting mechanism. In particular, the welfare costs of nominal wage variability

are much smaller when wages are determined by Taylor-style contracts with the same average

duration as in our baseline specification of Calvo-style contracts.10 Thus, the simple wage
stabilization rule is no longer nearly optimal, and better welfare outcomes are provided by

other simple rules that respond to price inflation and real economic variables. Of course,

as Hall (this volume) emphasizes, neither Calvo-style nor Taylor-style contracts provide the

ideal microeconomic foundations for the determination of nominal wages and employment.

Thus, our results should be interpreted as highlighting the extent to which additional research

regarding the structure of labor markets is likely to have substantial benefits for the design

of monetary stabilization policy.

posterior distribution of the model parameters. Section 4 characterizes the optimal policy in
the baseline economy and compares the performance of alternative simple rules. Sections 5

2     The Model

As in CEE and SW, our baseline model incorporates a number of mechanisms that can induce

intrinsic persistence in the propagation of shocks, including habit persistence in consumption,

costs of adjustment for investment and capacity utilization, and staggered nominal wage

and price contracts with partial indexation. The model also includes a number of exogenous
disturbances (assumed to be mutually uncorrelated) that account for the stochastic variation
in the observed data used in our estimation procedure.

2.1    Household Preferences

The economy has a continuum of infinitely lived households. The conditional welfare of a
given household h ∈ [0, 1] at a given time t is defined as the discounted sum of expected

period utility:
                                               ∞
                                               X      j
                                 Wt (h) = Et         βt+j Vt+j (h),                          (1)
                                               j=0
                                                                 j       Qj
where the subjective discount factor is βt = βZtb and we define βt+j =     s=0   βt+s . Thus, the

steady-state subjective discount factor is given by the parameter 0 < β < 1, while stochastic
variation in the rate of time preference is induced by the exogenous disturbance Ztb ; we

assume that the logarithm of this disturbance follows an AR(1) process.




                                                5
       The period utility function of a given household h at time t is specified as follows:

                         (Ct (h) − θCt−1 (h))1−σ  Z L (Lt (h))1+χ     Z m (Mt (h))1−κ
              Vt (h) =                           − t              + µ0 t              ,                    (2)
                                  1−σ                  1+χ                 1−κ

where Ct (h) denotes the household’s total consumption, Lt (h) denotes its labor hours, and

Mt (h) denotes its real cash balances.11 The preference parameters, σ, χ, κ, and µ0 , are

strictly positive, while θ lies in the unit interval. The exogenous disturbance ZtL induces

stochastic variation in household preferences for leisure relative to consumption, and Ztm is
an exogenous shock to money demand; the logarithm of each shock is assumed to follow an

AR(1) process.

       Habit persistence in consumption is an important but somewhat controversial feature of

this specification. In particular, for positive values of θ, the household’s lagged consumption

effectively serves as a reference value in determining the period utility generated by current

consumption.12 Recent empirical analysis of aggregate data has obtained substantial evi-
dence of habit persistence; for example, CEE emphasize its role explaining the hump-shaped

behavior of aggregate consumption in response to a monetary policy shock. Nevertheless,
it should be noted that micro-level studies have occasionally obtained results that directly

conflict with the macro evidence.13
       Of course, the curvature parameters of the utility function also remain quite controver-

sial. Some studies have argue that σ is around unity, while others find much larger values.14

Furthermore, microeconometric studies have typically obtained estimates of χ that are sig-

nificantly greater than unity, whereas some macroeconomists have argued that the aggregate
  11
     We interpret Mt as broad money and assume that households invest the remainder of their assets At −Mt
with a financial intermediary earning the nominal interest rate Rt .
  12
     Some authors have considered an alternative specification, referred to as “external habit persistence,” in
which the lagged value of aggregate consumption serves as the reference value for each individual household.
In the absence of offsetting taxes, this formulation poses an externality that distorts the steady state; thus,
given our emphasis on the stabilization role of monetary policy, in this paper we focus exclusively on the
“internal habit” specification given in the text.
  13
     For example, see the contrast between the conclusions of Fuhrer (2000) and Dynan (2000).

     See Guvenen (2005) for a recent survey of the literature and an attempt to reconcile the differences in
published estimates.

data are consistent with a near-zero value of χ, corresponding to a very high intertemporal

elasticity of leisure for the representative household.15
       Finally, while this specification allows real money balances to directly influence household

utility, most of our analysis will focus on the “cashless economy” emphasized by Woodford
(2003) and others; this economy corresponds to the limiting case in which µ0 becomes arbi-

trarily small. Later in the paper, however, we will revisit this issue and examine the policy

implications of incorporating a non-trivial role for money into the model.

2.2       Production and Prices

The final composite good–used for both consumption and investment–is obtained by bundling

together a continuum of differentiated intermediate goods using a Dixit-Stiglitz aggregator

function. As in SW, we allow the elasticity of substitution between different goods to exhibit
exogenous temporal variation; that is, λpt = Ztp λp . The parameter λp > 0 determines the

steady-state markup rate, while the exogenous disturbance Ztp (assumed to have an i.i.d.

log-normal distribution) shifts the desired markup at each point in time. A given firm,
indexed by i ∈ [0, 1], as the sole producer of intermediate good i, faces a downward-sloping

demand curve, and its elasticity of demand −(1 + λpt )/λpt is invariant to the firm’s level of
production.16

       Interestingly, the steady-state markup parameter λp does not influence the first-order

dynamics of the model economy and hence cannot be estimated using the methods employed
in this paper. Nevertheless, this parameter does affect the second-order properties of the

model, including the welfare performance of monetary policy rules. In light of the available
  15
     See Huang and Liu (2004) for a summary of recent evidence regarding the intertemporal elasticity of
labor supply at the intensive and extensive margins.
  16
     Kimball (1995) proposed a more general form of aggregator function that allows for quasi-kinked demand
curves, and several recent empirical studies have analyzed its first-order implications; cf. Eichenbaum and
Fisher (2004), Altig, Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Linde (2004), and Coenen and Levin (2004). However,
higher-order approximations of the Kimball specification have not yet been considered and remain well
beyond the scope of the present analysis.

evidence from disaggregated data, we set λp = 0.20 in the baseline version of the model, and

then consider alternative values from 0.1 to 0.5.17

       Every intermediate-goods producer has an identical production function that determines

the gross output of good i as a Cobb-Douglas function of the firm’s employment of labor ser-
vices Nt (i), its rental of capital services K̃t (i), and the exogenous economy-wide productivity

factor At :

                                   Yt (i) = At K̃t (i)α Nt (i)1−α − Φ,                               (3)

where the parameter α represents the share of capital in gross output, and we assume that

the logarithm of the productivity factor follows an AR(1) process. As in CEE and SW, every

firm hires its capital and labor services on competitive economy-wide markets and hence has

the same marginal cost of production.
       The firm’s net output Yt (i) reflects the presence of the fixed overhead cost Φ. This

fixed cost induces locally increasing returns to scale for each individual firm, and generates

procyclical total factor productivity at the aggregate level. Thus, inferences about the value
of Φ can be made using both micro-level and macro-level data.

       In the baseline version of the model, we assume that prices are determined by Calvo-

style nominal contracts with partial indexation.18 In particular, every firm faces a constant

probability 1 − ξp of reoptimizing its price contract in any given period, where ξp ∈ [0, 1];

thus, price contracts have an average duration 1/(1 − ξp ). Whenever the contract is not

reoptimized, the firm’s price is automatically adjusted by the lagged rate of inflation raised

to the power γp ∈ [0, 1].

       This specification of price-setting behavior provides formal underpinnings for the hybrid
New Keynesian Phillips curve.19 In particular, the indexation parameter γp determines the

relative weight on the “backward-looking” vs. “forward-looking” terms in the hybrid Phillips

curve. While the magnitude of these weights is subject to ongoing controversy, recent analysis
of aggregate data seems to be largely consistent with the available microeconomic evidence

indicating that indexation is not a typical characteristic of price adjustment.20
       Under the assumption that all firms have the same marginal cost, the responsiveness of
inflation to current marginal cost is determined solely by the parameter ξp . Typically, as

in SW, the estimated value of ξp tends to imply a relatively long average duration of price

contracts that is inconsistent with recent microeconomic evidence.21 Several recent studies
have shown that incorporating additional real rigidities–such as quasi-kinked demand and

firm-specific capital–yields more plausible estimates of the degree of nominal rigidity.22 Nev-

ertheless, analyzing the second-order implications of these mechanisms poses some technical

challenges that remain to be addressed in the literature.

2.3       Investment and Capacity Utilization

Households own the entire stock of physical capital Kt . Capital accumulation is subject to
adjustment costs that are assumed to be proportional to the squared growth rate of invest-

ment, rather than the more traditional formulation involving the squared level of investment.
As emphasized by CEE, this specification of adjustment costs can generate a hump-shaped

response of aggregate investment to a monetary policy shock, consistent with the implications

of an identified vector autoregression. While the formal microeconomic foundations of this
mechanism were initially opaque, Basu and Kimball (2003) have subsequently shown that

       Thus, the capital stock owned by a given household h ∈ [0, 1] evolves as follows:

where Kt (h) denotes the household’s beginning-of-period capital stock and It (h) denotes the

gross investment during period t. The depreciation rate is given by δ, and the parameter ζ
gauges the magnitude of investment adjustment costs.23 Finally, the exogenous disturbance

ZtI acts as an economy-wide shock to investment demand; its logarithm follows an AR(1)

process.

       In each period, the aggregate flow of capital services K̃t to the intermediate goods sector
is defined as the capacity utilization rate Ut multiplied by the predetermined level of the

physical capital stock, Kt−1 . The capacity utilization rate can vary from its steady-state
value of unity, but such variations are associated with a real resource cost. In particular,

we specify the resource cost Ψt (h) incurred by a given household h as a CES function of its
capacity utilization Ut (h):
                                                              −1
                                                  Ut (h)1+ψ − 1

where ψ ≥ 0 and µ > 0.24
       As emphasized by CEE, variable capacity utilization can effectively enhance the short-

term flexibility of the economy in response to aggregate shocks. Nevertheless, the magnitude

of the utilization cost parameter ψ is currently subject to a great deal of uncertainty, due

both to the scarcity of microeconomic evidence and to conflicting results from recent macroe-
conometric analysis. For example, CEE find that variations in capacity utilization play an
  23
     This adjustment cost specification incorporates the basic properties assumed by CEE and SW, who were
only concerned with characterizing the steady state and log-linear properties of the model. By using an
explicit definition of the adjustment cost function, we are able to analyze the second-order approximation of
the model economy.

     As with investment adjustment costs, this explicit specification incorporates the basic properties assumed
by CEE and SW, while enabling us to analyze the second-order approximation of the model economy.

important role in explaining the sluggish response of inflation to a monetary policy shock,

whereas the results of Altig, Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Linde (2004) suggest that the
aggregate effects of a technology shock are only consistent with relatively limited variations

in capacity utilization.
   Finally, following SW, we include an “external finance premium” shock Ztq (assumed
to have an i.i.d. log-normal distribution) which acts as a wedge between the risk-free real

interest rate and the required expected rate of return on physical capital. Recent analysis

of firm-level data has obtained precise estimates of the magnitude and cyclical behavior
of the external finance premium; cf. Levin, Natalucci, and Zakrajsek (2004). However,

further theoretical and empirical research is clearly needed to elucidate the underpinnings

and implications of this mechanism.

2.4    Employment and Wages

Households provide a continuum of differentiated labor services, which are bundled together

using a Dixit-Stiglitz aggregator function and then rented to the intermediate sector. As in
SW, we allow the elasticity of substitution between different types of labor services to ex-

hibit exogenous temporal variation; that is, λw    w w                  w
                                              t = Zt λ . The parameter λ > 0 determines

the steady-state markup of real wages over the marginal rate of substitution between con-

sumption and leisure. The exogenous disturbance Ztw (assumed to have an i.i.d. log-normal

distribution) shifts the desired wage markup at each point in time. Given this specification,

a given household h ∈ [0, 1], as the sole provider of the labor service of type h, faces a

downward-sloping labor demand curve with elasticity −(1 + λw    w
                                                           t )/λt .

   In the baseline version of the model, we assume that wages are determined by Calvo-style

nominal contracts with partial indexation. In particular, each household faces a constant

probability 1 − ξw of reoptimizing its wage contract in any given period, where ξw ∈ [0, 1].

Whenever the contract is not reoptimized, the household’s wage is automatically adjusted


                                             11
by the lagged rate of price inflation raised to the power γw ∈ [0, 1].

       The steady-state markup parameter λw and the contract wage parameter ξw cannot be
independently identified from the log-linear dynamics of the model. Given the scarcity of

disaggregated evidence on these two parameters, we proceed by calibrating λw = 0.20 (the

same baseline value as for λp ) and estimating the value of ξw .25 We will then gauge the policy
and welfare implications of alternative combinations of these two parameters that yield the

same first-order behavior of the model.

       Because the wage-setting mechanism has crucial implications for the design of optimal
monetary policy, we will also consider two modifications to the baseline specification, namely,

indexation of wages to lagged wage inflation instead of lagged price inflation and the use of

fixed-duration “Taylor-style” wage contracts instead of Calvo-style contracts. As we will see,

these alternative specifications yield significantly different implications for monetary policy
and welfare.

2.5       Fiscal and Monetary Policy

We assume that government spending is exogenously determined and exhibits persistent

variations; in particular, its logarithm follows an AR(1) process. As is evident from the
previous discussion, government spending has no direct effects on either utility (through

purchases of public goods) or production (perhaps via a stock of public capital); consideration

of these channels, as well as automatic fiscal stabilizers, is deferred to future research.

       Furthermore, we assume that the government offsets the steady-state effects of monop-

olistic distortions by enacting the appropriate magnitude of production and employment
subsidies, which are financed via a constant level of lump-sum taxes. Thus, the determin-

istic steady state is Pareto-optimal in the baseline model with a zero inflation rate. Under
  25
    Taylor (1999b) provides an overview of the evidence on nominal wage inertia. For analysis of the elasticity
of demand for differentiated labor services, see Griffin (1996a), Griffin (1996b).




                                                      12
these assumptions, we can focus our analysis on the stabilization task of monetary policy,

abstracting from the complications that would arise if the central bank also played a role in
trying to offset the effects of steady-state distortions.26

       In estimating the model, we use a fairly simple monetary policy rule in which the short-
term nominal interest rate responds to the lagged interest rate as well as to deviations of

aggregate price inflation from target and of actual output from the level that would prevail

in the absence of nominal inertia. This specification includes two additional exogenous

shocks, namely, persistent AR(1) shifts in the inflation objective and transitory white-noise
shocks to the current policy rate. In our normative analysis, of course, we consider the full

Ramsey policy as well as alternative specifications of simple policy rules, and we assume that

monetary policy does not exhibit any exogenous stochastic variation.


3        Model Estimation

We employ Bayesian methods to estimate the log-linearized version of the model, using

quarterly U.S. data over the period 1955:1 through 2001:4.27 In particular, we treat seven
aggregate variables as directly observed: real consumption, real investment, real GDP, real
wages, total hours, GDP price inflation, and the federal funds rate.28 Because the rest of the

model variables (such as the capital stock) are treated as unobserved, we use the Kalman
filter in computing the likelihood function of the model.

       As widely recognized in earlier work, certain structural parameters are not well-identified

from the cyclical dynamics of the data. Therefore, we use long-term historical averages to
  26
     For analysis of optimal policy in economies with steady-state distortions, see Benigno and Woodford
(2004) and Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (this volume).
  27
     A detailed description of the log-linearized model is provided in Appendix B.
  28
     We use the same dataset as in Altig, Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Linde (2004), obtained from Martin
Eichenbaum’s web page. The real wage is constructed as non-farm wage rate adjusted by the GDP price
deflator, while total hours are measured for the non-farm business sector. The inflation rate and interest
rate are demeaned and converted to quarterly rates; the other five variables are measured in logarithmic
deviations from linear trends, in percentage points.



                                                   13
specify the values of these parameters: the capital share parameter α = 0.36; the discount

factor β = 0.99 (corresponding to a steady-state real interest rate of about 4 percent); and
the depreciation parameter δ = 0.025 (corresponding to an annual rate of about 10 percent).

Similarly, we calibrate the output shares of consumption, investment, and government spend-
ing at cy = C̄/Ȳ = 0.56, iy = 0.24, and gy = 0.20, respectively.29 Finally, we set the wage

and price markup parameters λw = λp = 0.2; in the following section, we will consider the

implications of alternative values for these two parameters.

       We formulate independent prior densities for each of the other 31 parameters of the model,
namely, ten parameters related to preferences and technology, five coefficients of the empirical

interest rate reaction function, and sixteen parameters of the data-generating processes for

the disturbances. Overall, our prior is consistent with the previous literature and is relatively

uninformative for most of the parameters; details are given in the appendix.30 Given these
priors, we characterize the posterior distribution using a Metropolis-Hastings Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Our estimation methodology is broadly similar to that of

Lubik and Schorfheide (2005); further details are provided in the appendix.31

       In the remainder of this section, we focus on characterizing the posterior distribution of
the key structural parameters. Table 1 reports the posterior means and the 5% and 95%

bounds for each of these parameters, while corresponding results for the parameters of the

shock processes may be found in the appendix.

       As depicted in Figure 1, the macroeconomic data are quite informative regarding the
parameters related to price and wage determination. In light of recent micro-based evidence
  29
     The mean ratio of net exports to GDP was zero to two decimal points over our sample.
  30
     In specifying these priors, we have drawn heavily on Smets and Wouters (2003a), (Smets and Wouters
2003b), Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005), Altig, Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Linde (2004), and
Onatski and N. Williams (2004).
  31
     Since the work of Schorfheide (2000) and especially after the original Smets and Wouters (2003a) paper
there have been a number of papers using Bayesian methods for models similar to ours; examples include Del
Negro and Schorfheide (2004), Rabanal and Rubio-Ramirez (2003), Laforte (2003), Onatski and N. Williams
(2004), and del Negro, Schorfheide, Smets, and Wouters (2004).

obtained by Bils and Klenow (2004) and Golosov and Lucas (2003), we specify a prior mean of

0.38 for the Calvo price-setting parameter ξp , corresponding to an average contract duration

of about 1.5 quarters; we employed the same prior mean for the Calvo wage parameter ξw . In
contrast, the posterior mean estimates for these two parameters imply an average contract

duration of about five quarters, similar to the findings of CEE and SW.32 Furthermore, the
posterior probability intervals of these estimates are relatively narrow, suggesting a fairly

clear disconnect between the micro and macro evidence.

       We impose relatively uninformative priors on the degree of price and wage indexation.
The estimate of the degree of price indexation is near zero and relatively precisely estimated;

in contrast, the degree of wage indexation is found to be substantial, but very imprecisely
estimated. The lack of price indexation differs from SW but is consistent with the findings

of Ireland (2001) and Edge, Laubach, and J. Williams (2003).

       The macroeconomic data are somewhat less informative regarding other structural pa-

rameters. Figure 2 repeats the previous figure for the structural parameters not related to

price and wage determination. Overall, the resulting estimates are consistent with estimates
  32
    For comparison, Taylor (1993b), using a staggered wage model, estimates an average wage contract
duration of about 3-1/2 quarters.

from the literature. Except for the parameters determining capacity utilization costs and

habit persistence, the posteriors do not differ greatly from the respective priors. The finding
of a relatively tight posterior distribution for the capacity utilization cost parameter occurs

despite the imposition of a relatively loose prior and contrasts with the wide dispersion of
estimates of this parameter in the literature.

   One structural parameter that deserves further discussion is the returns to scale in pro-

duction, φ. We chose a relatively tight prior centered on 1.08 for this parameter, based on

the estimates of Basu (1996) and Basu and Fernald (1997), who find fixed costs of between

3 and 10 percent. Our resulting mean estimate is 1.09. By comparison, when we imposed

an uninformative prior, the mode estimate exceeded 2, a result consistent with the findings

of SW, but contrary to the micro evidence. Despite this difference in point estimates, in fact

the data were not terribly informative about this parameter, as seen in the figure. Interest-
ingly, imposing our prior on φ resulted in a small estimate of investment adjustment costs.
Our estimate of investment adjustment costs are noticeably lower than SW, but more in line

with those reported by ACEL.

   For the monetary policy reaction function, we obtain the following estimation results:

                                      ∗
 rt = 0.84 rt−1 + 0.16 [ 2.7 (πt−1 − πt−1 ) + 0.10 yt−1 ] + 0.26 ∆πt + 0.51 ∆yt + ηtr ,
       (0.03)              (0.3)                      (0.07)   (0.06)        (0.07)


where the estimated standard error of each coefficient is enclosed in parentheses. This

reaction function exhibits a high degree of inertia, a strong long-run response to inflation,

modest sensitivity to the level of the output gap, and a sizeable response to changes in the

output gap.

   As for the monetary policy shocks, we find that the inflation target πt∗ has significant

variation and exhibits very high persistence approaching that of a random walk, while the

transitory disturbance ηtr has negligible variance. It should be noted that our modeling
framework does not provide any rationale or potential benefits from a time-varying inflation

                                                 18
target or from idiosyncratic disturbances to the policy rule. Thus, given our focus on policies

that maximize social welfare, henceforth we eliminate these two shocks by setting their
variances to zero.


4       Optimal Monetary Policy

In this section, we characterize the monetary policy implications of the baseline model at the

posterior mean values of the estimated parameters, abstracting from uncertainty about the

true structure of the economy. We start by considering the optimal policy under commitment

that maximizes conditional expected welfare, and then compare the performance of simple

rules in which the short-term interest rate is adjusted in response to one or more observable

variables.

4.1      The Optimal Policy Problem

The optimal policy under commitment can be computed by formulating an infinite-horizon

Lagrangian problem, in which the central bank maximizes conditional expected social wel-
fare subject to the full set of non-linear constraints implied by the private sector’s behavioral

equations and the market-clearing conditions of the model economy.33 The first-order con-
ditions of this problem are obtained by differentiating the Lagrangian with respect to each

of the endogenous variables (including the policy instrument) and setting these derivatives
to zero. Of course, performing these derivations by hand would be extremely tedious; thus,
we utilize the symbolic Matlab procedures developed by Levin and Lopez-Salido (2004).34

      We then proceed to analyze the behavior of the economy under optimal policy by com-

bining the central bank’s first-order conditions together with the private sector’s behavioral
equations and the market-clearing conditions. Thus, the size of the model is much larger
 33

      These procedures are available on the Dynare website or on request from the authors.



                                                  19
under the optimal policy, because these first-order conditions take the place of a single inter-

est rate reaction function, while the set of Lagrange multipliers is added to the list of model
variables. Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that no new parameters have been added

to the model, because the central bank’s first-order conditions involve the same structural
parameters as in the behavioral equations and market-clearing conditions.

       Because this set of non-linear equations involves rational expectations, numerical meth-

ods are required to characterize the equilibrium properties of the stochastic economy.35 Fur-

thermore, while the first-order dynamics can be investigated by log-linearizing the model,

higher-order methods are needed to evaluate conditional expected welfare.36 Therefore, we

employ the DYNARE software package of Juillard (2001) to compute the second-order ap-

proximation of the model economy.37

       Finally, as in Levin and Lopez-Salido (2004), our analysis is focused on evaluating the
welfare cost of business cycles; that is, for each monetary policy regime, we measure how
conditional expected welfare changes in response to the stochastic variation of the model

economy.38 Throughout the paper, welfare costs are expressed in terms of the equivalent

percent decline in steady-state consumption.

4.2       Characteristics of Optimal Policy

The deterministic steady state of the baseline economy is characterized by a zero inflation

rate. In particular, as noted above, we assume that fiscal subsidies offset the steady-state
monopolistic distortions to production and employment, while money is essentially absent

from the baseline specification. Thus, in the absence of stochastic shocks, the central bank’s
  35
     Judd (1998) provides a general introduction and comparison of methods for solving non-linear rational
expectations models.
  36
     See Kim and Kim (2003), Kim, Kim, Schaumburg, and Sims (2003), and Woodford (2003).
  37
     Because perturbation methods provide a local approximation around the steady state, our analysis does
not consider the implications of the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates.
  38
     For this purpose, it is essential to utilize conditional mean-preserving spreads for the exogenous distur-
bances; see Levin and Lopez-Salido (2004) for further discussion.



                                                      20
sole task is to choose the constant inflation rate that minimizes the degree of cross-sectional

dispersion in prices and wages; indeed, by maintaining a zero inflation rate, monetary policy
succeeds in implementing the Pareto-optimal equilibrium in steady state.

      The first-order implications of the optimal policy are shown in Figure 3, which depicts
the response of selected macro variables to an exogenous rise in the productivity factor.39

The optimal policy (solid line) yields a path of short-term real interest rates that closely

resembles that of the “real business cycle” (RBC) economy with flexible wages and prices

(dot-dashed line); in contrast, real interest rates are nearly constant under the empirical
reaction function (dashed line). In the RBC economy, real wages initially rise about 3/4

percent; with a constant price level, this adjustment occurs solely through a surge in nominal

wage inflation. In contrast, the optimal policy for the baseline economy is mainly oriented

towards minimizing cross-sectional dispersion in wage rates, and hence permits a noticeable
decline in prices while nominal wage inflation remains close to zero.
      Under the optimal policy (as in the RBC economy), the positive shock to productivity

induces a substantial decline in aggregate labor hours that is gradually reversed over the

subsequent year. Under the empirical reaction function, labor hours only decline for a single
quarter and then rise above baseline. These findings relate to the debate regarding the

empirical evidence of the response of hours to productivity shocks and the sensitivity of

these results to monetary policy.

      We now compare the welfare implications of these policies for the baseline economy
with stochastic variation in all of the exogenous disturbances except the monetary policy

shocks. For each policy, Table 2 reports the welfare cost of business cycles in terms of the

equivalent percentage point change in steady-state consumption; this table also indicates
welfare outcomes for two simple rules that are discussed further below.

      Under the empirical reaction function, the welfare cost of business cycles in the baseline

model is equivalent to a permanent 2.6 percent reduction in household consumption. The

optimal policy is associated with a markedly lower cost of business cycles, equivalent to
about 2 percent of steady-state consumption. It should be noted that these welfare costs

are an order of magnitude larger than in the results emphasized by Lucas (2003), mainly
because staggered contracts induce substantial cross-sectional dispersion in relative prices

and wages.40

       To gauge these welfare results more concretely, we note that U.S. personal consumption
expenditures were about $28,000 per person in 2004; thus, switching from the empirical
reaction function to the optimal policy would permanently raise welfare by about $160 per

person, while eliminating all stochastic variation in the economy would generate a permanent
welfare gain exceeding $700 per person. As we will see below, however, the magnitude of

the welfare costs can be quite sensitive to the parameter values of the model as well as to

the specification of the innovations and the determination of wages and prices.

4.3       Simple Policy Rules

We now consider the performance of simple policy rules with coefficients chosen to maximize

welfare in the baseline model.41 In particular, we examine rules with the following form:


                                      rt = ri rt−1 + rπ πt + rω ωt ,                                   (6)
  40
     For related analysis and results, see Cho, Cooley, and Phaneuf (1997), Canzoneri, Cumby, and Diba
(2004), and Paustian (2004).
  41
     For analysis and discussion of the rationale for simple rules, see Taylor (1993a) and Williams (2003).




                                                    23
where the nominal interest rate rt responds to the price inflation rate πt and the nominal

wage inflation rate ωt as well as to the lagged nominal interest rate. This type of rule is
operational in the sense of McCallum (1999), in the sense that the policy instrument is

determined only by observable variables, and not by model-specific constructed data such as
the natural rates of interest and output, and forecasts of variables (which require knowledge

of the economy).42 Furthermore, it is equivalent to targeting a deterministic path for the

level of wages or prices; such policies have been shown to perform very well in the presence

of the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates.43
       Given the role of wage dispersion in determining the welfare cost of business cycles, it

is useful to consider policy rules that respond directly to nominal wage inflation, as sug-

gested by Erceg, Henderson, and Levin (2000).44 Therefore, we consider a hybrid rule that

responds differentially to both price and wage inflation, as well as rules that respond to
price inflation alone. Optimizing the coefficients of the hybrid rule to maximize welfare in
the baseline model, we find that rω = 3.2 while rπ = 0. Thus, given that the optimized

rule does not actually respond to price inflation, we simply refer to this rule as the bench-

mark wage inflation rule. We then compare its performance to an alternative rule that does
not respond to wages–henceforth referred to as the benchmark price inflation rule–for which

welfare optimization yields rπ = 2.1.

       As indicated in Table 2, the benchmark wage inflation rule yields a welfare outcome nearly

identical to the optimal policy; indeed, following this simple wage inflation rule rather than

the optimal policy would incur a welfare cost equivalent to less than $35 per person per year.

In contrast, the benchmark price inflation rule yields a welfare loss that is roughly the same

as under the empirical reaction function.
  42
     McCallum (1999) also highlights the role of information lags; thus, while our specification utilizes con-
temporaneous data, it will be useful to consider this issue further in subsequent research.

       The impulse responses to the technology shock under the benchmark wage inflation rule

mimics closely those of the optimal policy, as seen in Figure 4. One difference is that the
benchmark wage inflation rule initially tightens monetary policy, causing a slightly excessive

fall in labor hours and consumption at the onset of the shock. After a few quarters, how-
ever, the benchmark wage inflation rule gets back on track, and the paths of labor hours,

consumption, and price and wage inflation are virtually identical to those obtained under

the optimal policy. In contrast, the benchmark price inflation rule is overly stimulative at

the onset of the shock, keeping price inflation near baseline but generating excessive nominal
wage inflation.


5        Parameter Uncertainty

In this section, we explore the sensitivity of household welfare to variations in the parameters
under the wage inflation policy rule optimized to the baseline parameters discussed in Section
3. We evaluate the performance of this rule in comparison with that of the optimal policy

determined using the true values of the model parameters.

5.1       Estimated Parameters

We start by considering the effect of uncertainty as measured by our estimated posterior

distribution. We compute the welfare losses associated with joint parameter uncertainty of

the ten structural parameters together.45 For this purpose, we randomly select 5000 draws

of the parameter vector from the posterior distribution described above. For each draw,

we compute welfare under the optimal policy for the true set of parameters and under the

benchmark wage inflation policy. Note that this method incorporates the covariance between
the model parameters, allowing for the possibility that particular combinations of parameter
  45

ters.

realizations may have sizeable effects on outcomes. Figure 5 reports the results from this
exercise; the upper panel shows the resulting distributions of welfare losses under the two

policies and the lower panel shows the distribution of the relative welfare loss equal to the
difference in welfare between the optimal policy and the benchmark wage inflation rule.

   Uncertainty about the structural parameters implies a great deal of uncertainty regarding
the welfare loss associated with fluctuations, but far less uncertainty regarding the perfor-
mance of the benchmark wage inflation rule relative to the optimal policy. As seen in the

upper panel of the figure, the distribution of welfare losses under either policy is wide with


                                                              27
a relatively long left tail. Under the optimal policy, the median welfare loss is 2.1 percent,

just 0.1 percentage point larger than for the posterior mean estimates, but the 90 percent
confidence interval for the welfare loss ranges from 4.3 percent to 0.9 percent. The results

under the benchmark wage inflation rule are comparable. Thus, parameter uncertainty can
easily make the welfare costs of fluctuations more than double what we estimate, or, for

that matter, half as large. However, as the lower panel of the figure shows, the performance

of the benchmark wage inflation rule relative to the optimal policy is remarkably robust to

parameter uncertainty. Indeed, the mean relative welfare loss, evaluated over the posterior
distribution, is 0.14 percent, compared to 0.12 percent assuming no uncertainty, and the 90

percent probability interval for the relative welfare loss is fairly narrow, ranging from 0.06

to 0.35 percent.

   Because the benchmark rule performs so well across the posterior distribution, it is not
surprising that taking account of parameter uncertainty as measured by the posterior distri-
bution has virtually no effect on the parameters or expected performance of the optimized

wage inflation rule. We computed the coefficient of a wage inflation rule that maximizes ex-

pected welfare integrating over the posterior distribution as above. The optimal coefficient
equals 2.9, slightly lower than the value of 3.2 in the case of no uncertainty. But, this rule

yields an increase in expected welfare relative to the benchmark wage inflation rule of only
0.0004 percent. Thus, the existence of parameter uncertainty, as measured by the posterior

distribution, is nearly irrelevant for designing policy in this model. Of course, a significant

reduction in this uncertainty could have implications for the design of policy and welfare, as

we examine next.

   The degree of parameter uncertainty represented by the posterior distribution likely un-
derstates the true degree of uncertainty that policymakers face. As discussed in Onatski and

N. Williams (2003) and Lubik and Schorfheide (2005), the mean and spread of the posterior

distributions are highly sensitive to the assumed prior distributions. Point estimates and

                                              28
their standard errors are sensitive to estimation methodology, sample, and the values of cal-

ibrated parameters.46 This sensitivity is illustrated by the wide range of point estimates for
various model parameters found in what are nearly identical models studied in CEE, SW,

and this paper.
    Given this concern that the degree of parameter uncertainty may exceed that implied by
the posterior distribution, we now examine the robustness of the benchmark wage inflation

rule to a much wider set of parameter values. A second goal of this analysis is to uncover

which parameters entail costly consequences when an estimate is far from the true value. To
facilitate our analysis, we vary specific parameters one at a time, holding all other param-

eters at their respective mean estimates. We focus our analysis on the difference in welfare

between that found under the benchmark wage inflation rule and the optimal policy for the

specified parameter. Again, we measure the potential loss in switching from the optimal
policy (assuming the true parameter value is known) to the benchmark wage inflation rule
(optimized for the baseline parameters).

    We start with the parameters describing price and wage determination. Figure 6 plots

the differences in the consumption-equivalent welfare losses between the optimal policy and
the benchmark wage inflation rule as the four parameters related to price- and wage-setting

are varied. The results for the Calvo parameters are shown in the upper panels; the results

for the indexation parameters are shown in the lower panels. The vertical lines indicate the

5% and 95% posterior bounds for the parameters calculated from the MCMC simulations.

If the resulting plotted line is horizontal, estimation error for that parameter has no welfare

costs, while a steeply sloped line indicates that parameter estimation error carries high costs

and that better estimates could have a large social benefit.

    Although uncertainty regarding the wage and price parameters based on the estimated

     In addition, the welfare costs of fluctuations are very sensitive to the assumed degree of substitutability
across types of labor and of goods, parameters that we take as fixed in this analysis.

probability intervals has very modest implications for the performance of the benchmark

wage inflation rule, looked at from a broader, or an explicitly min-max, perspective, reducing
uncertainty about price- and wage-setting parameters could yield moderate benefits in terms

of monetary policy design and welfare. The relative performance of the benchmark wage
inflation rule is sensitive to very high values of the Calvo wage parameter. For the other

Calvo price and indexation parameters, the performance of the benchmark wage inflation

policy drops off if prices are reoptimized very frequently or if a high share of contracts is

indexed, neither of which is likely according to the posterior distribution. For example,
consider the case that the true Calvo price parameter, ξp , is as low as some of the micro

evidence suggests. According to the posterior distribution, such a low value is extremely

unlikely. But, if true, knowledge of this parameter could be used to design a monetary

policy that yields a moderate improvement in welfare. The same applies for the Calvo wage
and price indexation parameters. Although the degree of wage indexation is imprecisely
estimated, the relative welfare loss is nearly invariant to the value of this parameter.

   Figure 7 plots the results for the parameters related to preferences and technology. Given

the estimated precision of these parameter estimates, parameter uncertainty has trivial im-
plications for welfare and therefore for policy. For example, although χ, the parameter

measuring the disutility of labor, is imprecisely estimated, it has only a modest effect on

relative welfare.

   It should be noted that the parameter φ, which measures the degree of increasing returns,
does have a significant effect on relative welfare under the benchmark wage rule. With a

loose prior, we would estimate a value for this parameter near 2. Assuming that the results of

the literature indicating at most modest increasing returns are true, the resulting reduction
in uncertainty has a large effect on welfare in this model assuming policy is designed to be

optimal at the baseline estimates. Moreover our estimate of the habit persistence parameter

is on the low side of recent estimates, which tend to find values in the 0.5-0.7 range. Once

again, we find such values to be unlikely but we find a significant drop in the performance

of the benchmark wage inflation rule when the habit parameter increases past 0.5. Finally,
knowledge of the true magnitude of investment adjustment costs would be valuable for policy

design.

5.2       Steady-state Markups

As noted above, we cannot estimate the steady-state price and wage markups using the

first-order dynamics of the model, but instead calibrate both to be 20 percent. Given the

uncertainty regarding the values of these parameters, we briefly explore the implications of

alternative calibrations of the steady-state markups for monetary policy.

       The magnitude of welfare losses depends on the steady-state price markup, but the

performance of the benchmark wage inflation rule relative to the optimal policy is insensitive
to this parameter. We evaluate the welfare losses under four representative monetary policies

analyzed above as λp is varied from 0.1 to 0.5, holding all other parameters fixed. Recall

that the steady-state price markup does not affect the first-order properties of the system.47

The results are shown in the upper part of Table 3. Welfare losses are larger, the smaller

is the steady-state price markup, reflecting the effect of greater dispersion when goods are
more highly substitutable. The relative performance of the various policies is insensitive to

the value of the steady-state price markup.

       The welfare losses are highly sensitive to the value of the steady-state wage markup, and
for very high values of this parameter, the performance of the benchmark price inflation

policy rule approaches that of the benchmark wage inflation rule. In considering the effects
of variations in λw , we vary the value of Calvo wage parameter, ξw , so that the first-order

properties of the model are constant.48 We hold all other parameter values fixed at baseline
  47
     Note that we do not impose a relationship between the fixed cost parameter and the markup implied by
a zero-profit condition.
  48
     Thus, we isolate the effects of changing the substitutability of different types of labor on welfare from

values. Note that even with a high steady-state wage markup, the benchmark wage inflation

policy rule performs well, although the difference between it and the rules that respond to
price inflation is much smaller than in the baseline model.


6     Innovation Uncertainty

We now consider alternative assumptions regarding the set of shocks in the model. In

computing welfare, we have had to take a stand on each shock as to whether it reflects shifts
in fundamentals, the effects of distortions, or measurement error. In particular, we have

assumed that the wage and price shocks and the shocks to the external finance premium are
distortionary, while the remaining shocks reflect shifts in fundamentals. We now revisit these
assumptions and evaluate the performance of the various monetary policies under alternative

assumptions regarding the nature of innovations.

    The baseline model is admittedly profligate in specifying shocks. In particular, the ex-

ternal finance premium has a large estimated variance and may be important for welfare

according to the model, but arguably lacks microfoundations. Importantly, we have assumed
those on the sensitivity of wages to movements in the marginal rate of substitution.

that this shock does not affect fundamentals, but instead represents inefficient fluctuations
in an external finance premium or a type of “animal spirits” that monetary policy should

counteract. We therefore consider an alternative model specification in which these shocks
do not exist, that is, Tobin’s Q strictly follows fundamentals. We assume that these shocks
represent measurement error evident in estimating the model, but that they have no effects

on the actual allocation of resources. We do no re-estimate the model, but rather simply set

the variance of the external finance premium shocks to zero.49 The second line of Table 4
reports the results from this experiment. Interestingly, eliminating the external finance pre-

mium shocks has little effect on welfare or on the relative performance of the various policy

rules.

       We further examine how the policy rules perform under alternative assumptions regarding

the nature of shocks to price and wage markups. In the baseline model, these shocks are
  49
    In a previous version of this paper, we estimated an alternative model that included no external finance
premium shocks. Estimates of most model parameters were nearly identical to the baseline estimates.
Exceptions included the estimate of ζ, which fell, implying significantly higher costs of adjusting investment,
and the investment adjustment cost shock became more variable and less persistent. The effects on welfare
of this specification were modest.



                                                      35
viewed as being distortionary movements in markups. We now consider the possibility that

these disturbances simply reflect measurement error. Again, we do not re-estimate the
model, but instead simply zero out these residuals. We consider each shock in isolation and

the combined effect. The results are shown in the upper part of Table 4.
    Eliminating either markup shock reduces the welfare costs of fluctuations, but does not
alter the relative performance of the various policy rules. In either case, the welfare gap

between the optimal policy and the benchmark wage inflation rule is reduced relative to that

in the baseline specification. The price shocks have relatively little effect on welfare; the
wage shocks, however, are an important source of welfare loss under both the optimal and

the benchmark policies but, nevertheless, have little effect on the relative performance of the

benchmark wage inflation policy rule.

    Finally, we consider the nature of disturbances to preferences. In the baseline model, we
have assumed that shocks to time preference and the disutility of labor reflect fundamental
movements in the economy that monetary policy should accommodate. We consider two

alternative assumptions. First, we assume that the shocks merely reflect measurement error

and evaluate the four policies under the assumption that the preference shock does not exist.
As before, we consider each shock in isolation. Interestingly, eliminating either preference

shock increases welfare under the various policies by about 0.25 percentage point; that
is, stochastic shocks to preferences are welfare-enhancing in our baseline model.50 The

performance of the benchmark wage inflation rule relative to the optimal policy is virtually

unchanged. Second, we consider the assumption that the preference shocks reflect non-

fundamentals, such as changes in tax rates. The results are shown in the lower section of

Table 4. In this case, the welfare losses are significantly higher than in the baseline model,
but, again, the performance of the benchmark wage inflation rule relative to the optimal
  50
     Because a shock to preferences affects only welfare and not the production possibilities of the economy,
with flexible wages and prices, welfare is non-decreasing to a mean-preserving spread to preferences.

policy does not deteriorate.

       Regardless of the assumption about the nature of these shocks, the benchmark wage
inflation rule is nearly optimal and outperforms the estimated and benchmark price inflation

rules by a significant margin. In summary, although innovation uncertainty exacerbates the
already significant uncertainty about the magnitude of the welfare costs of fluctuations, the

benchmark wage inflation rule is remarkably robust to changes in assumptions regarding the

nature of shocks hitting the economy.


7        Specification Uncertainty

We now proceed to consider the broader problem of specification uncertainty in the sense

of Leamer (1978).51 In specifying the baseline model, we made numerous choices that affect

the parameter estimates, the structure of the model, and the determinants of welfare. In this
section, we analyze the sensitivity of optimal policies to alternate assumptions regarding the
model specification and evaluate the marginal benefit of reducing uncertainty of each of the

key specification issues in terms of social welfare. As in the preceding section, this analysis
provides information on the value, from the perspective of monetary policy, of improving
our knowledge of specification issues and suggests where the highest payoffs are for further

research in this area. While the list of specifications we consider is far from exhaustive, it

provides some examples of the type of specification uncertainty that may be important for

policy analysis.

7.1       Monetary Frictions and Working Capital

Our baseline model can be viewed as a “cashless economy” that completely abstracts from
monetary frictions. We now investigate the policy implications of incorporating household
  51
     For some early analysis of specification uncertainty in structural models, see Becker, Dwolatsky, Karak-
itsos, and Rustem (1986) and Frankel and Rockett (1988).



                                                     37
demand for money as well as working-capital considerations for firms. First, we permit

the scale parameter µ0 to have a non-trivial value, so that real money balances have direct
effects on household utility. Second, following CEE, we assume that firms must borrow from

financial intermediaries to cover their wage bill and then repay the loan at the end of the
period. Thus, assuming that these funds can be obtained at the gross risk-free nominal

interest rate, firms’ total labor costs are now given by Rt Wt Lt .

       Since we specify that policy is conducted via an interest rate rule, we do not need to

concern ourselves with market clearing in the loan market. This would only serve to pin

down the value of broad money. Instead, we simply append the portfolio allocation decision

to determine the household’s cash balances (which now affect welfare), and we incorporate

the effects of working capital on firms’ labor demand and marginal costs. We then re-estimate

the model, using data on cash balances in addition to the seven variables noted above.52 The
mode estimate of the preference parameter κ is 11.4, while the mode estimates of all other
model parameters are nearly the same as in the baseline specification.53

       The modified model has two key implications for policy. First, owing to the effects of

nominal interest rates on costs and money balances, the optimal inflation rate is no longer
zero, but instead slightly below zero. Second, there is a cost to highly variable nominal in-

terest rates that is absent in the baseline model and a resultant benefit to smoothing interest

rates. As a result, the optimal wage inflation policy rule responds less aggressively to wage

inflation, with a coefficient of 1.5, compared to 3.2 in the baseline model.54 The benchmark

wage inflation rule yields a welfare loss 0.07 percentage points in terms of permanent con-

sumption greater than a rule optimized for this alternative model with monetary frictions

and working capital.
  52
     The money data are available only from 1959 onward, so we shorten the sample by four years. Linearized
expressions are again given in the appendix.
  53
     Complete estimation results are reported in Appendix C.
  54
     It is still the case that the optimal coefficient on price inflation is zero.



                                                    38
7.2     Alternative Models of Wage Setting

A key result in our analysis is the importance of stabilizing wages owing to the distortions
associated with wage dispersion under Calvo-style contracts. Given the central role of this

channel, we consider alternative specifications of wage setting that have significant effects

on the welfare implications of sticky wages and on optimal policy. In particular, we consider
two alternative specifications in which the effects of wage dispersion on welfare are muted

relative to the Calvo-style model.55
   We first consider a modest modification to the indexation of wages in the model and

assume that non-optimized wages are indexed to last period’s wage inflation rate, as opposed

to the rate of price inflation. This modification reduces the effects of fluctuations in wage
inflation on wage dispersion and thereby on welfare.56 Table 4 reports the results from this
specification for four specifications of monetary policy. Not surprisingly, the consumption-

equivalent loss in conditional welfare under the optimal policy is somewhat smaller than in
the baseline model.

   The relative performance of the benchmark wage inflation rule, however, is considerably
worse under this form of wage indexation and is dominated by the rule that responds only to

price inflation. Under the benchmark wage inflation policy rule, the consumption-equivalent

loss in conditional welfare is 0.6 percentage points larger than under the optimal policy and
0.3 percentage points higher than under the benchmark price inflation rule. In fact, with this

specification of wage indexation, the benchmark wage inflation policy rule does slightlyworse

than the estimated policy rule. Evidently, the result that a simple policy rule designed to

maximize welfare should respond exclusively to wage inflation is not robust to changes in
   55
      Although not considered here, another model of wage and price setting that does not yield dispersion
effects on aggregate welfare is the quadratic adjustment costs model of Rotemberg (1982).
   56
      We estimated a version of the baseline model where wage indexation depends on a combination of past
price and wage inflation. We found that the weight is primarily on past price inflation, providing support
for the baseline model specification. Nonetheless, one may not be convinced by this finding and remained
concerned about uncertainty regarding the form of wage indexation.

the model of wage determination, even to this seemingly innocuous change in the model

specification.

    We now consider a more substantive change in the specification of wage and price deter-

mination, and assume that contracts have fixed duration as in Taylor (1980); see also Chari,

Kehoe, and McGrattan (2000).57 Compared with the baseline specification of Calvo-style
contracts with random duration, this alternative specification limits the degree of price and

wage dispersion–and the associated welfare costs–resulting from the presence of some prices

and wages that have not been reoptimized for many periods.
    We suppose that nominal wages and prices are determined by staggered contracts that

are reset every M periods. Thus at t the distribution of wages is given by {Wt,j } where
j = 1, . . . , M denotes the number of periods since the last re-set. In particular, we assume

that all price and wage contracts last for four quarters, implying mean contract durations

somewhat shorter than implied by our posterior mean estimates of the Calvo update param-
eters, ξp and ξw . We do not change any other parameter estimates and revert to the baseline

assumption that wages are indexed to past price inflation. The results are reported in Ta-

ble 5. As expected, replacing Calvo-style wage and price setting with Taylor-style contracts

significantly reduces wage and price dispersion and hence the welfare costs associated with

fluctuations.
 57
    As explained below, we have not formally estimated this alternative specification. The empirical perfor-
mance of the model may be sensitive to which type of nominal rigidity is assumed; see Chari, Kehoe, and
McGrattan (2000), Kiley (2002), and Guerrieri (2001).



                                                    40
       With Taylor-style staggered wages and prices, the relative performance of the benchmark

wage inflation rule falls dramatically, while the estimated policy rule is nearly optimal.
The benchmark price inflation rule outperforms the benchmark wage inflation rule, but

falls behind the estimated rule. With Taylor price and wage contracts, the welfare costs
associated with price and wage dispersion are relatively modest and, therefore, the optimal

policy focuses on coming close to the real allocation in the flexible wage and price economy.

The estimated rule accomplishes this balance very well, while the benchmark price inflation

rule is somewhat less effective owing to a lack of response to the output gap. The performance
of the benchmark wage inflation rule suffers more significantly because it implicitly puts far

too much emphasis on stabilizing nominal wage inflation relative to achieving the flexible

wage and price real allocation.58

       Finally, it should be noted that the welfare cost of business cycles and the performance of
alternative monetary policies are sensitive not only to the structure of nominal contracts but
to the specification of household preferences. For example, as in CEE and SW, our analysis

has followed Erceg, Henderson, and Levin (2000) in assuming that each individual household

provides a distinct labor service, whereas Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (this volume) assume
that each household has a continuum of members providing all types of labor services and

that the household’s utility only depends on its total hours of work. While such assumptions
might seem to be merely technical details, in fact these differences have fairly dramatic

consequences for the first-order dynamics of wage inflation, the second-order effects of cross-

sectional wage dispersion, and the design of welfare-maximizing policy rules.59
  58
     We also examined a version of the model with Taylor wage contracts and Calvo prices. The results were
very similar to those found when both wages and prices are set by Taylor contracts.
  59
     The specification of Erceg, Henderson, and Levin (2000) implies a much flatter nominal wage Phillips
curve; that is, nominal wage inflation is much less sensitive to the marginal rate of substitution between
consumption and leisure. Furthermore, cross-sectional wage dispersion induces differences in labor across
households that have substantial effects on social welfare.




                                                   41
8     Conclusion

Over the past decade there has been remarkable progress in developing empirical micro-

founded macroeconomic models for monetary policy analysis. In this paper we have drawn
on and extended this literature to consider the design of policy under uncertainty. By

confronting a fully-specified dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with the data,

we can directly gauge the uncertainty associated with the model parameters as well as the
implications of alternative assumptions about the model specification.

    Our analysis indicates that the welfare cost of business cycles is quite large–an order
of magnitude larger than the findings emphasized by Lucas (2003)–and arises mainly due

to inefficiencies associated with cross-sectional dispersion in wages and employment. As a

direct consequence, we find that the welfare outcome associated with optimal policy under
commitment is closely matched by a very simple rule that responds solely to nominal wage

inflation. Furthermore, the performance of this benchmark wage inflation rule is remarkably

robust to uncertainty about the structural parameters and the particular shocks hitting the
economy. The performance of this rule is very sensitive to the specification of wage and price

determination, suggesting that a hybrid rule involving both wage and price inflation might
be more robust across a broader class of models.

    These findings underscore the central importance of labor markets for analyzing the

welfare costs of macroeconomic fluctuations and the design of monetary policy. Of course,

the crucial role of wage setting and employment dynamics has long been recognized, and

recent research has refocused interest on these issues; see Hall (2005). Thus, further progress

in formulating micro-founded specifications of labor market behavior and comparing the
empirical performance of these specifications is likely to have substantial payoffs for the

design of monetary policy.

    Finally, while our analysis has emphasized the implications of policymaker uncertainty


                                              42
regarding the true structure of the economy, we have abstracted completely from the role

of learning by policymakers or private agents. Nevertheless, we recognize that the learning
mechanism is crucial for understanding the evolution of the economy in response to changes

in the monetary policy regime–such as the Volcker disinflation–and to other aggregate dis-
turbances.60 Thus, incorporating learning in micro-founded macroeconometric models and

reconsidering the policy implications represents a natural direction for future research.61




  60
     Erceg and Levin (2003) analyze a DGE model roughly similar to the one in this paper and show that
private agents’ gradual learning about the Fed’s inflation objective is crucial for interpreting the effects of
the Volcker disinflation, while Edge, Laubach, and J. Williams (2003) and Erceg, Guerrieri, and Gust (2005)
highlight the role of learning in fitting the stylized facts of the U.S. productivity growth boom of the late
1990s.

with ongoing structural change.

A      The Nonlinear Model
A.1     The Baseline Model
The text describes the household side, and we now fill in some detail on the firm side. Define
the capacity utilization cost function from (5) by:
                                                                          −1
                                                  U 1+ψ
                                        Ψ(Ut ) = µ t −1 ,
                                                  1+ψ
where ψ is the inverse of the elasticity of utilization cost with respect to utilization, and µ is
chosen so that steady state utilization costs are zero. Also define the investment adjustment
cost function from (4) by:
                                                                     ³                    ´2
                                                            −1 1                It (i)
                         S(ZtI It (i)/It−1 (i))        =ζ                ZtI            −1 .
                                                                 2             It−1 (i)

Note that adjustment costs are assumed to be zero at the steady state, S(1) = 0, and are
only of second-order at the steady state.
   Index households by h and firms by i. Then denote by Nt (i) plant i0 s labor input given
by
                                      ·Z 1                  ¸1+λwt
                                                       1
                                                         w
                             Nt (i) =      Lt (i, h) 1+λt dh       ,
                                            0

where Lt (i, j) is the input of labor of type j at plant i. The plant’s output is given by (3).
    Aggregate final good output, Yt is created by (costlessly) combining a continuum of
intermediate goods, Yt (i), indexed by i:
                                          ·Z       1              1
                                                                             ¸1+λpt
                                                                    p
                                   Yt =                Yt (i)   1+λt
                                                                        di            .        (7)
                                               0

Final goods output is equal to consumption, aggregate investment, It , government spending,
Gt , and capital utilization costs:

                                Yt = Ct + Gt + It + Ψ(Ut )Kt−1 .                               (8)

A.2     Equilibrium Allocation and Prices
In the following, we omit household and plant indices where no confusion will result. The
household’s budget constraint is standard and households trade in a complete market to
allocate their consumption over time. Let M U Ct denote the marginal utility associated with


                                                          51
an incremental increase in consumption in period t, accounting for its effect on period utility
in the period t + 1:

                    M U Ct = Ztb (Ct − θCt−1 )−σ − βθEt Zt+1
                                                         b
                                                             (Ct+1 − θCt )−σ .                      (9)

The consumption Euler equation summarizes the representative household’s optimal saving
behavior:
                          M U Ct = Et [M U Ct+1 Rt Pt /Pt+1 ] ,                    (10)
where Rt is the gross nominal interest rate and Pt is the price level.
   Households set wages subject to their individual labor demand curves, which arise from
the firms’ input demands. The evolution of the aggregate nominal wage index is:
                                                 µ          ¶−γw /λwt
                       −1/λw            −1/λw        Pt−1                            −1/λw
                     Wt    t
                               =   ξw Wt−1 t                            + (1 − ξw )w̃t   t
                                                                                             .     (11)
                                                     Pt−2

Here w̃t is the optimal nominal wage chosen by those households that can optimize in the
period, which satisfies:
                ∞                          ·µ                ¶γw                             ¸
         w̃t X i i                              Pt Pt+i−1          M U Ct+i
            Et     βt+i ξw Lt+i (h)²bt+i                                       L           χ
                                                                            − Zt (Lt+i (h)) = 0.   (12)
         Pt    i=0
                                                Pt−1 Pt+i          1 + λw
                                                                        t+i


As in usual in Calvo pricing models, (12) incorporates forward-looking expectations of future
nominal wages, but now includes lagged inflation via the partial indexation.
    Households own the capital stock, Kt , which they accumulate using the capital accumu-
lation technology and rent to firms at rental rate Rtk . This leads to three key relationships.
First, we let Qt be the real share value per unit of capital, which is determined by an asset
pricing Euler equation from (10):
                           ·                                                ´¸
                       q      M U Ct+1 ³                      k
               Q t = Zt E t β            Qt+1 (1 − δ) + Ut+1 Rt+1 − Ψ(Ut+1 ) ,             (13)
                               M U Ct

where Ztq is the i.i.d. external finance premium shock. The optimal investment decision leads
to an investment Euler equation:
                     µ I ¶ I             ·                   µ I       ¶ I             ¸
                   0  Zt It Zt It          M U Ct+1        0  Zt+1 It+1 Zt+1 It+1 It+1
         1 − Qt S                   = Et            Qt+1 S                               . (14)
                       It−1 It−1           M U Ct                It        It      It

This equation balances the costs and benefits of investment, with lagged investment and the
shocks showing up through the effects of the costs of adjustment. Finally, the first order
condition for utilization gives:
                                       Rtk = Ψ0 (Ut ).                                 (15)
   On the production side, the firms’ cost-minimization conditions are symmetric and given


                                                       52
by:
                                              Wt Lt               1−α

                                                              =       .                             (16)
                                            Rt Ut Kt−1             α
Thus, firms equate the marginal rate of transformation between labor and effective capital
(Ut Kt−1 ) to the relative factor prices, and the capital-labor ratio is identical across firms.
Marginal costs are then given by:

                                             Wt1−α (Rtk )α −α
                                  M Ct =                  α (1 − α)α−1 .                            (17)
                                                 At
      The evolution of the aggregate nominal price index is:
                                                   µ          ¶−γp /λft
                         −1/λft            −1/λf       Pt−1                            −1/λft
                       Pt         =   ξp Pt−1 t                           + (1 − ξp )p̃t        .   (18)
                                                       Pt−2

Here p̃t is the optimal price chosen by those firms that can optimize in the period, which
satisfies:
          X ∞                                · µ           ¶γ                      ¸
                s    s p                      p̃t Pt Pt+s−1 p         p     M Ct+s
      Et       βt+s ξp λt+s Yt+s (i)M U Ct+i                  − (1 + λt+s )          = 0. (19)
           s=0
                                              Pt Pt−1 Pt+s                   Pt+s

    Finally, we close the model by specifying an empirical monetary policy reaction function.
We specify policy in terms of a generalized Taylor-type rule, where the policy authority
sets nominal rates in response to inflation and the output gap. To do this, we define a
model-consistent output gap as the difference between actual and potential output, where
potential output is defined as what would prevail under flexible prices and wages and in
the absence of the three “cost-push” shocks (Ztw , Ztp , Ztq ) that cause variations in wage and
price markups and the external finance premium. Thus the model is supplemented with
flexible-price versions of the key equations (10)-(18) which determine potential output Yt∗ .
Then the policy rule is assumed to take the following form:
                                       ³                                            ´
                                                         ∗                      ∗
              rt = ri rt−1 + (1 − ri ) π̄t + rπ (πt−1 − πt−1 ) + ry log(Yt−1 /Yt−1 )         (20)

                                                                             ) + ηtr .

Here rt = log Rt is the short-term interest rate, πt = ∆ ln(Pt /Pt−1 ) is the inflation rate, πt∗
is an AR(1) shock to the inflation objective, and ηtR is an i.i.d. policy shock.

A.3     The Model with Monetary Frictions
In the model with monetary frictions from Section 7.1, the household also has a portfolio
allocation decision. The first-order condition is:

                             Ztb ²m
                                  t (Mt /Pt )
                                             −κ
                                                = (Rt − 1)M U Ct .                      (21)

The cost-minimization condition (16) now becomes:

                                       Rt Wt Lt    1−α
                                       k
                                                 =     .                                (22)
                                      Rt Ut Kt−1    α

In turn, the marginal cost changes from (17) to:

                                    (Rt Wt )1−α (Rtk )α −α
                           M Ct =                      α (1 − α)α−1 .                   (23)
                                            At
Market clearing in the loan market then implies:

                                       Wt Lt = At − Mt ,

where At represents the level of broad money after the infusion of money via the central
bank.

A.4     The Model with Staggered Contracts
In the model with staggered contracts from Section 7.2, we must make a few alterations to the
model. We again allow for partial indexation, so the evolution of an individual household’s
wage is given by:
                                    µ       ¶γ
                                       Pt−1 p
                           Wt,j =              Wt−1,j−1 if j 6= M
                                       Pt−2
                                 = w̃t if j = M.

The aggregate wage index changes from (11) to:
                                                 M
                                    −1/λw     1 X −1/λwt
                                  Wt    t
                                            =      W     .                              (24)
                                              M j=1 t,j

Finally, the optimal wage choice satisfies:
                  M −1               ·µ           ¶γ                           ¸
            w̃t X i                     Pt Pt+i−1 w M U Ct+i     L           χ
               Et      βt+i Lt+i (h)                          − ²t (Lt+i (h)) = 0.      (25)

                                        Pt−1 Pt+i    1 + λw

B      The Linearized Model
B.1      Baseline Model
For much of the paper we work with the log-linearized version of the model described above,
which we present here. We use lower-case letters to indicate the logarithmic deviations from
steady state. In the case of shocks, ²xt and ηtx refer to the shocks normalized to the log-linear
equations, with the ² shocks being persistent and the η shocks i.i.d.
    To save on notation, we define R̄k as the mean real rate of return on capital which
is assumed to satisfy β = 1/(1 − δ + R̄k ), and φ equals 1 plus the share of fixed costs in
production. Furthermore, we denote cy , gy , and ky as the steady-state ratios of consumption,
government spending, and capital to output, respectively.
    The following ten equations in ten endogenous variables {ct , it , qt , kt , rtk , ut , lt , yt , wt , πt }
are the linearized counterparts to the equations described in Section A of this appendix:

As shown in Onatski and N. Williams (2004), equation (32) corrects a slight error in SW
due to the capital utilization costs, which enter as the final term.
   In addition, there are ten equations for the shock processes, six of which,



                                                      55
{²at , ²πt , ²bt , ²gt , ²lt , ²it }, follow AR(1) processes of the form:

                                                 ²xt = ρx ²xt−1 + νtx ,

where νtx is a mean zero innovation with variance σx2 . The remaining four shocks,
{ηtp , ηtq , ηtr , ηtw }, are assumed to be i.i.d. with mean zero and variance σx2 . The innovations
are assumed to have zero contemporaneous correlation.
      The full model also includes counterparts to equations (26)-(33) that describe the log-
linearized equations for the flexible-price allocation. In these equations, the shocks ηp , ηq ,
and ηw are set to zero, as is the inflation rate. The nominal interest rate is replaced by the
flexible-price real interest rate, rt∗ . This yields nine equations and nine additional variables,
{c∗t , i∗t , yt∗ , wt∗ , lt∗ , qt∗ , rt∗ , rtk∗ , kt∗ }, where the asterisk superscript denotes the flexible-price value
of the variable.
      We close the model by including the linearized counterpart to the policy rule:
                                                               ¡                 ∗                   ∗

                          rt = ri rt−1 + (1 − ri ) π̄t + rπ (πt−1 − πt−1            ) + ry (yt−1 − yt−1 )           (37)
                                                                             ∗            ∗         r

B.2       Model with Monetary Frictions
Here we note the modifications to the expressions above when we consider the model with
monetary frictions. Linearizing (21) gives:

                R̄               σ                                                βθ
−κmt + ²m
        t =          rt +                 ((1 + βθ2 )ct − θct−1 − βθEt ct+1 ) −        (²bt − Et ²bt+1 )
              R̄ − 1      (1 − θ)(1 − βθ)                                       1 − βθ
                                                                                                  (38)
where mt is the log-deviation of real cash balances. Here R̄ is the steady-state gross nominal
rate which satisfies R̄ = 1 + R̄k − δ. Linearizing (22) we see that we replace (31) with:

                                         lt = −wt − rt + rtk + zt + kt−1                                          (39)

Linearizing (23) we see that we replace (36) with:

          1 n                       (1 − βξp )(1 − ξp )    k                        a    p
                                                                                            o
  πt =         βEt πt+1 + γp πt−1 +                     (αrt + (1 − α)(wt + rt ) − ²t + ηt ) .

C      Estimation Details and Results
C.1      Specification of the Priors
Table 6 reports the details of the specification of the prior for the model.62 For the parameters
of the shock processes, where we had little guidance from the literature, we set relatively loose
priors. For the standard deviations, we used gamma distributions with standard deviations
equal to the means. We gauged the relative magnitudes of the shocks from Onatski and
N. Williams (2004) and SW. For all but one persistence parameter, we used a wide beta
distribution. The exception was the inflation objective shock. Since it and the interest
rate shock enter additively in the policy rule (37), a tighter prior is necessary to distinguish
between them. For the structural parameters, we chose the parameters of the distributions
to cover the range of estimates we found in the literature with reasonably high probability.

C.2      Computation of the Posterior
As in SW, we first look for a parameter vector which maximizes the posterior mode, given our
prior and the likelihood based on the data. We took great efforts to explore the parameter
space sufficiently to locate a global maximum. In particular, we sampled 200 values from the
prior distribution, and used these as starting values for Chris Sims’s optimization algorithms
designed to avoid common problems with likelihood functions (available on his web page).
We re-ran it in combination with a standard hill-climber algorithm until it settled on the
maximal value. We used the resulting mode as the starting point for our MCMC sampling.
    We then sample from the posterior distribution using a Metropolis-Hastings Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm in order to make small sample inferences about
the parameters. We sampled 10 separate chains for 45,000 periods each, discarding the
first 15,000 periods. Thus we were left with 300,000 points from the posterior distribution.
In order to assess convergence of the Markov chains, we use the potential scale reduction
statistic described by Gelman, Carlin, Stern, and Rubin (2004) which gave clear indications
of convergence for all the parameters.

C.3      Estimation Results for the Shocks and the Monetary Model
The text reports the estimation results for the structural parameters. Table 7 reports the
estimates of the parameters for the shock processes. Figure 8 plots the prior and posterior
distributions for the parameters describing the shock processes. Our prior insures that σr
never hits zero, but its modal value is only 4 × 10−6 . Except for the investment shock, the
AR(1) shocks are highly persistent, with the inflation objective shock in particular being
nearly a unit root process.

    For a brief survey of the literature on specification of priors, see Onatski and N. Williams (2004). This
survey includes studies focusing on real models (such as King and Rebelo (1999) and Boldrin, Christiano,
and Fisher (2001)) as well as papers focusing on monetary policy in smaller models (such as Rotemberg and
Woodford (1997), Judd and Rudebusch (1998), Sack (1998)).

D     Optimal Policy
Here we report the impulse responses to other shocks.
    In response to positive shocks to wages and Tobin’s Q, the optimal policy calls for a
sharp increase in interest rates that causes a large decline in consumption. The contrac-
tionary policy response reduces the responses of wages. In contrast, the estimated policy
rule accommodates the shocks to a greater degree and allows larger rises in wage inflation.
The optimal policy response to a transitory shock to prices, however, is to do virtually noth-
ing. The estimated policy rule reacts to the rise in inflation, sending real rates higher and
reducing consumption and aggregate labor.
