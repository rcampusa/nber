Risk   prenila in t lie stock   titarket   are assumed to       move svitlm   ti ume   varying risk.   We   present a model in

which the variance of timeexcess return of a portfolio depends ott a state variable generated by a first—order
Markov process. A model in which the realization of the state is knosvn to economic agents, hut uuknosvn
to the econometrician. is estimimated.  'l'lme paraumeterestimates are found to iimmply that time risk premium

declines as time variance of returns rises.  We then extend the nmodel to allosc agents to he uncertain about

time state. Agents make their decisions in tseriod I using a prior distribution of time state based only on past

realizations of the excess return t hrouglm        period   /   — I plus knowledge of the       structure of the model. TIse

paraisseter estimates from this      imsodel   are consistent     witis asset pricing theory.

                                                                                   generated b a first—order
 Markov process. TIns approach was first tirotiosed by Haniiltoti (I ttt7A, 198713) in a dilferent context.
 Like Bollerslev (1987), I his model leads to a variance srlucli is a function of the variance of prior
                                                                                                          periods.
 however, our model will allow the conditional variance to be a stochastic function of the prior period's
 variance, Thus model will allow its to exauiinebol Ii the lieteroskedasticit.v of excess ret urns, and
                                                                                                        their time
 dependence.

     We use the model to explore the relationship between the    timmie dependent variance and the risk

premium in the stork market. We will develop two models based on the heteroskedastic structure discussed
above. Each model will be based on a different assuniption on
                                                              agent.s' information sets. We will estimate
each nsodel using postwar data from excess returns based on          a portfolio of stocks iii   Standard and Poor's
index.

     In the first nsodel we will simimply assunse that economic agents know the realization of the Markov

process underlying the generation of states, even though the econommietrician does not observe the state.
There are two risk prensia in this sperification. The first is sinsply the difference between the iiiean of the
distribution of the low variance state and the riskless return. Agents will require an increase in return over
the riskiess asset to hold an asset with a randons retsmrn. The second premium is
                                                                                   given by the difference
between the niean of the distribution of the high variance state and that of the low variance state. This

is the added return necessary to compensate for increased risk in the high variance state. Note that this
is the standard nsodel where agents know the variance extended to the case when the return on the

asset has a beterogenous variance.

     We will assunme that neither economic agents nor the economnetricianobserve the states

       The expected value of excess returns, p,, is the premium agents require at time I for accepting the
variance in returns associated with the risky asset. In general. p, is thought to be positive and to be

positively related to the variance              o. The nature of this relationship,           however, depends on the inforniation

agents acquire.

Pearson derived the first solnt ion: an application of thie niet hod of oionient                     s   ivliicb involved finding the

roots of a nonic pohynonsia!. In Pearson's problem            and in the statistics literature in general, the distribution

governing the state is generally binoniial (Everitt and Hand, 1981).
        In econojoetrics the use of finite nsixture distributions was discnssed in Coldfeld and Quandt (1973),
who called them switching regressions. They suggested that a Markov process could be osed to generate

the states. More recently Hanmilton (1987A, 1987B) modeled the growth rate of nonstationary tinse series,

such as gross national product, subject to occasional discrete shifts in rate of growth or in variance using

a Markov process. Specifically he considered niodels of the sanse foros as equations (8), though with

autoregressive terms connnon to both states. Schwert (1988) uses Hanolton's nsodel to study the instability
of nonunal stock niarket returns.
        Cosslett and Lee (1985) derived the likelihood function for this model. They use the rule of elinmination

to derivethe joint densityof the data fromthe density of the data conditionalon the state vector and uncon-
ditional distribution of the state vector. In our case, the likelihood is given by f(ym,92,...,yTkm,x2,...,xr).
In the nsodel where agents are certain of the state, ri is the null vector for I = 1,2         T. In the model
where agents are uncertainof the state ri is their prior probability of the high variance state, i.e.

heteroskedasticity in excess returns. In the following section we will examine the models' implications for
the risk premium.

5.1 Basic characlcrist.ics of the two state varmancc model


     The basic hypothesis upon which this paper is founded is that there are two states in the volatility of
stock market returns, i.e. the density of excess returns is a mixture of two normals with different variances.
Fsmrther, the distribution of the state has a time dependent element. In t.his section we will test the

hypotheses of two states and time dependence.

    IJnfortunatelv, the test of the hypothesis of only one stale forces p and q to the edge of their parameter
space: under the null one must be zero and the other unity. Under these conditions, the likelihood ratio
test is not asymptotically distributed       k However, Wolfe (1971) suggests a modified likelihood ratio
statistic for testing tile hypothesis of a mixed mnultivariate normal distribution against the null of simple
                                                                                                                                  10

where     (   is   the log likelihood of the one state model, Model 1, iii Table (1), and is the log likelihood of the
full two stale model, Model 11. This          statistic is asymptotically distributed 2 with two degrees of freedom.
The valne of this statistic is         29.9010.    This value is significant at any reasonable level of signficance.

Unfortunately, simulat.ious Isv Eventt (1981) show that this test has low power unless liii — psi > 2.
Further, the jsower of the test has also been questioned for lieteroskedastic models such as ours.
     Figure (2) plots         the probability     of the high variance    states conditional on all the data, J'(S, =
lips, y2    PT), for the full and sub—samples respectively. These posterior probabilities provide a visual
test of the mixture hypothesis. In general if the null hypothesis of simple normality is true, then the plots
of these probabilities should indicate uncertainty of the stale in usost periods. They should be relatively
flat and centered  at 0.5. There are few l)eniOds in the sausples in which the probability hover around 0.5.
The full sausple posterior is between 0.20 and 0.80 in only 18% of tbe sausple.
    Statistically, the mixture usodel, Model II, requires that the two states be characterized by different
ssseansand/or different variances. The variances in the two states are very well defined. The high variance
state is suore than three times that in the low variance state. As will be discussed below, the standard
error of this parauseter and all the high state parassseters are quite large. We may test the hupothesis
                              p
   = o, while letting $ ie Despite the relatively large standard error of d? we usay reject the null at
a reasonable level of confidence, the t-statistic is 3.2024.
                                                           Though not as widely seperated as the variances,
the iueaus of the distributions are distinct. A test of the hypothesis that i's = Os against the alternative,
while letting a? ag, yields a t.statistic of -4.6375.
     The estimates of the transition probabilities suggest the low variance state will predosuinate. The
estimates of the transition probabilities, p and q, of the Markov process suggest that the stationary, or
unconditional, probabilities of the states for the full sample will be 0.8557 and 0.1443 for for the low and
high variance states, respectively. Thus, for any given sample only about 14% of the observations will be
expected to fall into the high variance state.

     of the hypothesis that I — p = q = 0.

      The improbability of the high variance state niakes inference on high variance state parameters dif-
ficult. The sample size in estimating the high variance state parameters is, of course, dependent on the
number of observations that fall into the high variance state. Figure (2) show that there are relatively few
of these periods. More formally, Appcndcr A, shows that the sansple size in estimating these parameters-
is effectively   P(S1 = I y ,..-, yr) 64.7385 in this case. Thus, due to the relatively few periods in which
the high variance state is likely, we will not be able to estimate any of the parameters associated with it
precisely.
    The point estimates of the probabilities p and q suggest a strong time dependence iii the Markov process

generating the states. However, the large standard error of suggests that p can lie almost anywhere
between 0 and 1. This possibility makes a formal test of time dependence in the model particularly

interesting. Recall that a binomial process is simply a Markov process wit-h p = 1 — q. A binomial process
removes the dependence of the probability distribution of the current- state on past states. Fortunately,
the null hypothesis of a hinonual is nested within the Markor and does not reijilire p and q to lie near the
boundaries of their possible values. We may reject t los liypot liesis, the t-statistic is 2.5603.

       The point estimate of p suggests that      once   in the high     variance state, the state is expected to persist.

Since   j is greater then 0.5, in hot Ii 'lahle (1) and (2), the high variance state is expected to persist for at
least tss'o periods. More specifically, we wish to find the smallest value off for which

                                          =   i.Si+ji = i,...,Ss+i =              = i) < 0.5,                              (19)

       The persistence of the states and general behavior of the stock nsarket is described in a non—parametric

states are persistent,and that the low variance state is very persistent.             It persisted, in expectation, without

variance state does not exceed 0.2 during the 1950's. This period heavily influences the estimates of p and

     The parameter estimates for Model III, equations (9). are described in Table (3). They provide support
for a risk premium rising as the anticipated level of risk rises. In this nsodel, the level of risk is measured

by the probability of tile high variance state. This model predicts agents will require an annual return of
approxiniately 4%, if certain next. period's return will be drawn from the low variance density. For a one

     Tlrorrglr tire estimates of Model Ill are consistent with tireory, tire estimated model explains very little
of tire variance iii excess returns. Tire model always predicts a positive return, this its R2 is less tlren 0.6%.
Tbe reasorr wiry it caurrot predict a negative return is that tire specification ignores tIre news effect . Agents

don't know period t is drawn from the low variance density it is good news. They ucill adjust tireir prior
distribution of tire state and revalue their stocks upwards. Model IV gerreralizesthe case where agents are
unsure of tire state to allow learning during the period.

     Note that Model IV also suggests tire direction of bias of the estimate of the risk prenrinur when agents
are assunrred to know the state. Estimnatiug Modei ii under tisis reginre would yield paraureter estimates
which smear the risk prensium and this news effect together. Since an increasing risk prenniuur and the
news effect have opposite effects on excess returns, we would expect to be an upwardly biased estimate
of the risk premium and    jij to he a downwardly biased estimate.
     The estimated results indicate that we have sorted out the risk premium and the news effect. In

general, tire signs on the parameters are as predicted in Section 2.3 and suggested above. The paranreters

are aiso significantly different from each other, the t-atatistic is -2.9737. They capture the effect of the state
on the return of the stock during the period—the high variance state is bad news and the low variance
state is good news. The high variance state is very bad news. All else constant, the estimates predict that
the retsmrns from the stock market    will drop by more then 15%   on annual basis relative to the market for
T-bilis. Allowing for a news effeci, os     or, greatly improves the fit. The fl2 rises to 4.5%.
     In the mrrodel agents are assunsed to know the parameters, thus we should expect that no matter how

large the fall in the market,a perfectly forseen high variance period should lead to a positive expectation
of the excess return. That is, we should expect         + am > 0. The estimates indicate that such a period

the probability of the high variance state is quite large, so that agents anticipate it, and collect their risk
preuiiiulfl. The estimates in Table (3) indicate the risk preuiuiuuut will nearly double in the period that is,
ci post, high variance, rising to 13.6%. This fact is made clear by Figure (3). This figure compares agents'

prior distribution with the posterior conditional on all the data. This econouuetrician's posterior leads the
agent's prior. That is, most periods in which the agents' jtrior gives significant weight to the high variance
state, follow periods in which the posterior gives weight to that state. In short, agents are often surprised
by the move-from low variance to high variance. They are not surprised if (he system remains in the high
variance state.


6.0 Conclusion


       We have shown that an adequate model of the excess return from the stock market may be constructed
with a nsixt ore of normal densities with different means and variances. The heteroskedasticity that. this
mixtureimplies has a strong time dependence, suggesting that the conditional variance of the market can
be forecasted.

           MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION OF MARKOV MODELS
                       WITH THE EM-ALGORITHM

 A. I hit codaction

      As noted     iii the   body of die paper, direct itiaxinozation of the likelihood function as defined in

equation (2—15) requires the evaluation of       2
                                              teriiis in every iteration, It is coiiipntstionaily jut ractalile
for sn' reasonside sample size. We employ t lie EM—algorithm to uiaxiuiize t lie likelihood tnnct <iii. The
algoritInn was developed from an old ad hoc idea for handling nnssmg data. (1) replace t lie isnssing
values by estimated values; (2) estimate the parameters; (3) re—estimate the missing values assuming the

est iniat ed values are correct; (4) iterate over (2) and (3) until convergence.Missing data niet liods are
relevant for our purposes because the states, Si, may be interpretedas flossing data.
     '[lie algorithm differs from this technique in that the usissing values are not filled in, rather they
are replaced by sufficient statistics or, as in our case, the likelihood function is approximated in step (3).
This is called the E—step, or expectation step, while step (2) is the Al—step, or maximization step. A

good introduction to the algorithm is provided by Little and Rubin (1987). In general, if the underlying
distrihution is from an exponential distribution, each iteration of the algorithm will yield a higher value
of the likelihood, unless it is at a maximum. Denipster cL a!. (1977) show this for the general missing
data problem. Baumo.ct. aL (1970), shows the EM.algorithns maximizes the likelihood function if such
a            exists, when the data is a nsixture of exponential distributions and the underlying state is
    muaximouns

generated by a Markov process. A basic problem with the algorithns is that its rate of convergence is
proportional to the usissiug information. As the missing state variable contains much information, the
algorithm's convergence will be        slow in our case. However, as will be denmonstrated below, the ease in

interpretation and coding make—up for the lack of speed in computation.
     Scctmon A-2 presents the M—step for estinmation of the parameters of the Markov msiodel. We show that

the expected value of the likelihood function nmay be maxinsized by the simultaneous solution of normal
equations developed from the first—order conditions. The following section presents the E—step. \\'e derive
the distribution of the state conditional on the parameters. The final section combines these steps and
presents   time   formal EM—algorithm.

The parameterswhereagentsdon't know the state uoay he estimated in the same way.
    For all three models the estimates of the parameters of the density in each state are not dependents
on the transition probabilities, p and q. This implies that the maximum likelihood estimates of the

probabilities conditional on the moaximnin likelihood estimates of the density parameters will be the same
as the unconditional estinmates. Thus, a two—step technique may be ensployed to maximize the expectation
of the likelihood function with respect to all of the parameters of the model. First, the appropriate nornmal

equations are solved to estimate the parameters of the density of fit- Second, the expected value of the
likelihood function is maximiuzed with respect top and q conditional on the estimates of density parameters.
Hamilton )1988) extends this method by deriving normal equations for the transition probabilities.
