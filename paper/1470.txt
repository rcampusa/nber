                      Developing Country Debt and the
                   Market Value of Large Commercial Banks


                                   ABSTRACT


     The effect on coinmerqial banks of exposure to large amounts of developing

country debt has been a topic of increasing concern In recent years. Fear of

default on the part of t1e debtor countries has led to fears for the solvency of

the creditor banks since in nany   cases   the total of outstanding exposure to

risky debtors exceeds the entire capital base of the    banks involved. The paper
presents a first effort towards measuring the effects of LDC debt exposure on

the market value of large comniercial value banks in the United States. Our

results indicate that exposure to developing country debt has exerted a

measurable and significant negative effect on the ratio of market to book value

for these banks.

valuation of bank stock. This paper presents a preliminary effort toward the

goal, investigating the effects of debt exposure on the ratio of market to

book value of the common stock of large commercial banks in the United States.


The Market Value to Book Value Ratio


     Unlike the Mexican bond shown in Figure 1, seasoned commercial bank loans

to developing countries are not traded in organized markets. It is therefore

not possible to infer the current market valuation of such claims from

observed trading prices. There is some anecdotal evidexce from the Euromark—

ets that some second—hand tra4ing between banks does exist, and that these

so—called "silent subparticipations" on Latin American debt have been selling

at discounts of ten to twenty—five percent.3 The pricing of new loans to LDCs

also does not give a good indication of market discounts since in the major

crisis cases (like Brazil and Mexico) no new creditors are making loans, and

existing debt is being rolled over at below—market terms.4


     Our strategy is to infer the market valuation of existing loans from

changes in bank stock prices. As a rule, existing claims on debtor countries

are carried at par in assessing the book value of commercial banks. Thus,

despite re—schedulings and the risk of default, a l claim on Brazil is car-

ried at 1 book value. The market value of the commercial bank holding this

claim, however, should be below book value to the extent that the risks on the

loan reduce the value of the claim. Thus, one determinant of the book value

(BV) to market value (MV) ratio should be the extent of exposure to prob-

lematic LDC debt.


     In this preliminary investigation, we take a standard equation for By/MV

from the literature, and add LDC debt exposure (EX) relative to book value, as
                                          —3--

an explanatory variable. The regression equation is



                                   MV/BY = f3Z — aEX/BV                           (1)



where Z is a vector of traditional variables in bank stock pricing. A sig-

nificant positive coefficient for a will indicate that bank stocks are

reduced in value as a function of their exposure to the LDCs.


       Probably the most relevant previous study for our     work is Kamath (1980),
who analyses the determinants of the market to book value ratio for 52       banks
in   1974,   1975   and 1976. A variety of variables prove significant: beta,
volume of trading, growth in      earnings,   and payout ratio, as well as a capital

adequacy variable in one year. This variable is interesting in that Kamath

has utilized a capital adequacy test formulated by Vojta (1973) in which the

ratio   of loan loss chargeoffs to capital is used instead of the more commonly
used asset/capital ratios. The fact that this variable is significant only in
1974 (the year of the Franki in National failure) seems to indicate that inves—
tor   perceptions may be conditioned by highly visible events affecting bank

capitaL Therefore, in the context of exposure to developing country debt,

this result suggests that there may be a similar significance of capital ade-

quacy   variables during periods of investor uncertainty such as the period fol-
lowing August 1982.

        Using Kamath's framework, we added to his list of variables the LDC expo-
sure variable. Our sample on LDC       debt   exposure includes 62 commercial banks
in the United States (listed in the Appendix), observed on a quarterly basis
from September 1982 through June 1983. Information on levels of outstanding
exposure to particular countries was obtained from quarterly reports and 10—K
                                        — 4-.

forms submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission. It should be noted

that small levels of LX exposure are usually not reported to the SEC, as

banks are not required to present disaggregated data of exposure to individual

countries of amounts to less than 0.75%     of   total outstandings. We limited our

focus to exposure to five Latin American countries: Argentina, Brazil, Mex-
ico, chile, and Venezuela. These are by far the largest debtors (with
percent of the LDC loans   of BIS banks as of end—1982), and are the only coun-

tries    with a comprehensive representation on the 10—K forms. All    other   data
was obtained from the Bank COMPUSTAT     quarterly data tape, with the exception

of   beta values, which were obtained from the Value Line Investment Survey.

        Table 1 provides some summary measures of interest from the data set. We
show in the table the average exposure and MV/By ratios for the entire sample,
and for the most and least heavily exposed banks in the sample. The heavily
exposed banks all have an   exposure   ratio of about 2,0 or higher, while the
least    exposed banks in the sample have no exposure. For all four quarters,

the   heavily exposed banks have a considerably lower MV/lW ratio, and the gap
between the two sets of banks widens considerably in 1983:1 and 1983:11.
Thus, it will not be surprising to find a significant effect of EX/BV on
MV/BV, and perhaps an effect that grows over time. On       average, the commercial
banks    carried a large amount of LX assets,    amounting to more than 70%   of

total book value. The average MV/BV ratio indicates that banking stocks were

in general selling at a significant discount relative to book value over the

sample   period.

      Following the previous work on   the capital adequacy of commercial banks

discussed   above, several different formulations were tested. As a first step,
the formulation used by Kamath was repeated for the four quarters from

       DEVFLOPING COUNTHY DEBT AND THE MARKET VALUE OF LARGE (X)MMERCIAL BANKS




        The effect on commercial banks of exposure to large amounts of developing

country debt has been a topic of increasing concern in recent years. Fear of

default on the part of the debtor countries has lead to fears for the solvency

of the creditor banks since in many cases the total of outstanding exposure to

risky debtors    exceeds the entire capital   base of the banks involved. To take

just    one example, Citicorp's claims on Brazil alone amounted to 116% of bank
equity at year end 1982.1 Thus, it is clear that considerations of exposure to
LDC debt could potentially have quite a large effect on the relative values of
bank stocks.


        It has long been acknowledged that the events of August 1982, in which

the Mexican payments crisis focused attention on this problem, helped to

stimulate a discount of    the value of developing country   obligations in inter-

national capital markets. Figure 1,     showing the spread in yield to maturity

of   a Mexican bond over that of a relatively safe World Bank bond, shows that
this discounting was quite substantial, and that the timing of the effect
corresponds    closely to the events of August 1982. Bank stock   analysts   have

paid close attention to the level of exposure to developing country debt in

analyses of bank stocks in U.S. securities markets, For example,       the Value
Line   Investment Survey stated, "Stocks of major international banks such as

Citicorp have lately been under pressure because of adverse news reports about

Brazil.


       However, in spite of this recognition of the importance of foreign debt
in this context, no attempt has been made to quantify its effects on the

     out a high percentage of earnings as dividends rather than retaining them

     for reinvestment. In theory, this should not make any difference to the

     investor since retained earnings should be capitalized in the price of

     the stock. In fact, a good case could be made for preferring          payout

     ratios if the bank's rate of return on reinvested profits is higher than

     the investor's next best alternative. Nevertheless, this variable has

     been included both because payout may affect investor perceptions regard-

     less of its actual importance and also to facilitate comparison of the

     results presented here with those of Kamath;


     6. Beta (BETA) — Beta values obtained from the Value Line Investment Sur-

     vey. This variables was included as a proxy for systematic risk;


     7. Exposure Variable (EX/BV) —     This variable was constructed as the s
     of outstanding exposure to Argentina, Brazil, Qtile, Mexico and Venezuela

     divided   by total book value.

     The above formulation   utilizes   a very specific class of assets (claims on

the LDCs) as an explanatory variable. We also felt that an additional set of

regressions using more aggregate capital asset ratios, as a measure of bank

capital   adequacy would be of some interest. Of the various capital adequacy
variables tested, only one proved significant, total assets divided by the
total book value of common equity plus the value of preferred equity (KAIJQ2).

Regression Results

     The first of the regressions discussed above, in which the    developing

country exposure variable is used along with a vector of additional variables

to explain variation in the market/book value ratio, was performed for each of
                                           —5—

September 1982 through June 1983, with the addition of EX/BV. In these

regressions for following variables were chosen to explain variations in the

market/book value ratio:



     1. Rate of Return on Book Value (RORBV) —        This   variable, measures the pro-

     fitability      of the bank and would be expected to have a positive relation—
     ship with the market/book value ratio;

     2. Earnings Stability (ERST) — This variable was constructed in a two—
     step     process. First net current operating     earnings for each bank were
     regressed      on a time trend. Next, the variance of the regression was

     divided by the mean value of earnings over the period to provide a meas-

     ure of the stability of bank earnings. It is expected that this variable

     should have a negative relation with the dependent variable;


     3. Growth Rate of Book Value (BVGRS) —        This   variable is used as a proxy

     for    expected future growth. Insofar as recent experience provides an
     accurate measure of such expectations, this variable would be expected to
     enter    with a positive sign. Average annual growth rates over the thirty

     months    preceding each observation were used;

     4.    Common   Stock Trading Value (TRDVL) — This variable was usec1 as a
     proxy for the marketability of the stock. It is assumed that a larger
     trading volume would increase the liquidity and hence the desirability of
     a given stock. Thus, this variable is expected to enter with a positive
     Si gn;

     5.    Payout   Ratio (POUT) — Many   observers have maintained that investors
    have a preference f or current income. That is, they prefer banks           to pay

the four quarters from September 1982 through June   1983.   The results are

presented in Table 2. As can be seen, all variables enter with the expected

signs with the exception of beta and the payout ratio, which switch signs in

one period but are not significant. In general, the most important deter-

minants of the market/book value ratio over this period appear to be the rate

of return on book value, the volume of common stock trading and exposure to

developing country debt. This last variable enters negatively in all four

regressions and is significant in all but the third period. The magnitude of

the coefficients indicates that developing country debt was discounted signi-

ficantly during this period.

country exposure on the market/book value ratio might be felt after the issue

of quarterly reports containing such information rather than contemporane-

ously, the above regressions were rerun using the closing market/book value

ratio for the quarter after that corresponding to the independent variables.

In effect, this is an indirect indication of the extent to which such quar-

terly reports contain new information which is acted on subsequent to publica-

tion. As can be seen in Table 3, this formulation results in a comparable R2

together with considerably greater levels of significance for estimates of the

coefficient of LDCEX. It is interesting to note that both the magnitude and

the level of significance of this coefficient increase for later periods.

This seems to indicate that investor perceptions show a "learning effect" as

the full implications of the developing country debt crisis became apparent.


     A pooled regression over all four quarters were performed and the results

are presented in Table 4. This regression also indicates a substantial

discount of the value of developing country obligations over the period. Also

presented in Table 4 are the results of a pooled regression in which dummies

were used to allow unrestricted estimation of coefficients for the debt expo-

sure variable for each of the four                quarters.       An F—test of the stability of

this coefficient is rejected at the 5% level. An F—test of the equality of

the coefficients for exposure to individual countries could not reject the

hypothesis that the          coefficients for exposure to each country were equal.

       As discussed above, several additional capital adequacy variables were

formulated and tested along with               Fl/BY and the same vector of additional
explanatory      variables. As shown. in Table 5, only KADQ2, a                 very aggregated
ratio    consisting of total assets divided by total equity capital, is signifi-

cant. It is interesting to note that the aggregate capital adequacy is signi-

ficant only in 83:1 while the coefficient for Fl/BY increases both in magni-

tude and significance over the four quarters. The size of the coefficient and

its trend over time are comparable to the results obtained above where the

aggregate asset/capital ratio was omitted. The trends in the coefficients

over the four quarters suggest that while overall capital adequacy concerns

may   have been important in          late 1982, investor perceptions became more focused

on the    overseas portions of bank portfolios in 1983.

       The estimated coefficient for the exposure variable, Fl/BY,                    is   of partic-
ular   interest and its interpretation merits some additional discussion. In

general, we would like to infer the market discount on LDC debt fran the size

of this coefficient. A rigorous derivation of this value requires an asset

pricing model with a more precisely defined theoretical basis than that

presented here. Nevertheless, the regression results presented allow us to

make inferences which

 shed some light on our            question.

survive a major default. The fact that bank managers can expect to be penal-

ized in the marketplace to an extent related to their decisions to participate
in developing country debt demonstrates that there is a built—in disincentive
to pursuing such lending, even in the absence of an explicit default. Admit-
tedly, this effect was either not operative in previous years or proved an
insufficient check on asset expansion overseas, to provide a safeguard frcmi
the current crisis. Nevertheless, evidence that the market does provide

rewards for good performance and disincentives to poor performance may render

redundant some of the recent regulations designed to prevent a recurrence of

these problems.


       Further research will focus on two areas. First, an event study of the

effect of the Mexican announcement of August 1982 on bank stock prices should

prove an interesting complement to the results presented here in that they

would give an indication of the "impact effect" of these announcements. 'o
the extent that the onset of the crisis was unanticipated, iiortfolio of hank
stocks relative to that of t1'e market portfolio shnuld give added information
as to the effect on     the   net worth of banks.

       Secondly,   we will seek to use indenendent measures of market perceptions

and valuations of different classes of assets and liabilities to hetter

analyze the effects of differing portfolio composition on the      market value of
bank   capital. 'isk premia on sovereign developing conntry bonds traded in

Euranarkets provide an indenendnt measure of such verceptinns in the case of

developing   country obligations. Goodman and Sharue (1918) rnvide examples of
the use of other market indices in      conjunction with various asset and liabil-

ity classes,   "ithough verformed at a much mo—c aggregate level. "xtensjon of
this   type of analysis   to the prnbleins discussed here should prnve fruitful,   in

       Let P be the market value of a 41 claim on the LDC's. Assume that on the
margin a 41 increase in the bank' s liabilities (to depositors or CD holders)
reduces, cet. p. ,           the   market value of the bank by 1. Then, a purchase of
1     of claims on the LX's financed by a 1 inciease               in bank liabilities will
lower market value by *(P—1) white leaving book values unchanged. But the
coefficient on EX/BV, a, is in principle the measure of the change in market

value fran such a purchase. Thus, a                  P-i, or P    1 +   a.   Using the data from

Table 3, for example, our           point estimates     for the price of a 4i     of   LDC debt

is:

       Date                 82:IV       83:1           83:11     83:111

       Estimated

       Price:             4 .92        * .91         $ .88     * .82


The magnitude of these estimates is cnmparable to anecdotal evidence cited

earlier that sile't suparticipations in syndicated loans to Tatin Americsn

borrowers have sold in this period at a discount of between thirteen and

twenty—five percent. 'f cnrse, this calculation is very crude. As we stated

earlier. ounder measures of P                will   have to await a better oricing model

than we have offered.


Conclusions             Further   Research


        Our   results   indicate that exposure to developing country debt has exerted

a measurable and significant effect on the ratio of market to hook value for

large commercial banks. The implications of this for bank management and

regulation are of particular interest in lht of continuing doubt about the

ability of developing countries to service debt and the ability of banks to

survive a major default. The fact tiat hank managers can expect to he penal—
