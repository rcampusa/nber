                                              ABSTRACT

   While trends in college enrollment for blacks and whites have been the subject of study for a number
of years, little attention has been paid to the variation in college enrollment by socioeconomic status
(SES). It is well documented that, controlling for family background, blacks are more likely to enroll in
college than whites. This relationship is somewhat deceptive, however. Upon closer examination, we find
that blacks are more likely to enroll in college than their white counterparts only among low-SES
individuals. Among high SES individuals, this pattern is reversed. We also find that this relationship is
strongest in the 1970s and appears to disappear over time; by the 1990s, blacks are no more likely to
attend college than whites at any end of the SES distribution. This paper first documents this phenomenon
and then attempts to understand what is driving these differences across the distribution of family
background characteristics and why the relationship is changing over time. Although they have a
significant impact on college enrollment behavior, tuition costs and local labor markets explain very little
of racial differences in college entry. We do uncover different responses to tuition and labor markets by
individuals from different ends of the SES distribution, an important consideration for policies targeted
at improving college enrollment for low-SES individuals.

    I. Introduction

            The distinct pattern of college enrollment for blacks in the last three decades has been an

    important topic of study, with recent evidence suggesting family background and tuition costs as

    explanations. In the process, a number of researchers have documented the rather surprising fact that in

    the 1970s and early 1980s, controlling for family background characteristics, blacks were more likely to

    attend college than equivalent whites.1 While a number of papers have examined differing racial

    enrollment patterns and uncovered this result, very little work has focused on the result itself. To date,

    this finding remains largely a puzzle.

            Upon closer examination, one uncovers the startling observation that blacks at the low end of

    the family background spectrum are driving this result. That is, low socio-economic status (SES) blacks

    are more likely than their white counterparts to attend college. At the same time, this story flips at the

    high end of the SES spectrum; high status blacks are less likely to attend college than equivalent whites.

    This relationship is strongest in the 1970s and early 1980s and dissipates over time.

            The idea that low-SES blacks are more likely than their white counterparts to attend college

    runs counter to many preconceptions that low-income blacks exhibit the worst labor market

    performance and educational attainment relative to other groups. Anecdotal evidence often suggests

    that when blacks exhibit better education, employment, or earnings performance, it is only the already

    well off that reap the lions share of benefits. Indeed, these views are supported if one looks at other

    outcomes; Bound and Freeman (1992), among others, document the erosion of relative earnings and

(1995).

                                                                                                                 3
employment among blacks in the 1980s, noting that the wages of low-educated workers fell but the

wages of low-educated black workers fell by more than the wages of their white counterparts. In

college enrollment, however, our findings prove false many prior beliefs about racial differences in post-

secondary education. During the 1970s and 1980s, out of all groups of blacks, those blacks at the low

end of the SES distribution, regardless of how SES is measured, exhibit the strongest college enrollment

behavior relative to their white counterparts.

        We then turn to possible explanations for this pattern. What becomes clear is that patterns of

college enrollment differ not only across races, but also across individuals with different family

background characteristics. We focus primarily on the role of college costs and the idea that not only

do blacks and whites face different labor markets, but that individuals from different family backgrounds

respond differently to their local conditions. We conclude that individuals do respond to differences in

college costs and that increases in college tuition have disproportionately affected blacks at the low end

of the SES distribution. However, these differential responses explain little of the total variation in

college enrollment rates between blacks and whites. Despite this, these findings provide insight into

appropriate policies to increase college attendance among the less advantaged.

        This paper unfolds as follows. Section II frames the problem we are addressing. Section III

describes our data. Section IV establishes the basic patterns in black-white college-entry behavior,

while Section V investigates the determinants of college entry using more rigorous tools. Section VI

concludes.




II. Previous Literature on Black-White College Enrollment

                                                                                                           4
        Black college enrollment has followed an interesting path since the early 1970s (Figure 1). In

the late 1970s, black college enrollment increased dramatically, approaching the enrollment rate of

whites. In the early 1980s, however, there was a severe drop off. Since that time, black and white

college entrance rates have diverged, with blacks falling farther behind.

        Both Kane (1994) and Hauser (1993) study the time-series patterns of college enrollment in the

CPS.2 They find that parental family background is the most significant factor in explaining both the

time-series and cross-sectional differences in the data. They assign a secondary role to college tuition,

Federal subsidies to college-attenders (the most well-known of which is the Pell Grant program), and

labor market variables. The importance of family background has also been documented in a number of

other important studies. Fuller, Manski and Wise (1982) and Cameron and Heckman (1998,2001) are

examples of this work. Like Kane (1994) and Hauser (1993), Cameron and Heckman (2001) analyze

black-white differences in college entry (the latter two papers also look at Hispanic-white differences).

        On the cross-sectional front, Rivkin (1995) documents that, in the High School and Beyond

Class of 1982, blacks are more likely to attend college than whites with similar math and verbal test

scores. He finds that fewer job opportunities for blacks offer a partial explanation, where local labor

market conditions are calculated separately by race and gender.

        Our study makes three contributions to this literature. First, we establish not only that blacks

and whites exhibit college-entry behavior that is different and statistically distinct but also that looking at


2
 Kane (1994), has tried to explain this trend by focusing on college costs and family background. He
finds that the rising cost of college during the 1980s discouraged black college entry, whereas the gains
in parental education encouraged black college entry. The net effect is the decline and recovery
observed in the 1980s.

                                                                                                              5
mean predicted differences between whites and blacks--as do Kane (1994), Hauser (1992), Rivkin

(1995), and Cameron and Heckman (2001)Bfails to reveal important differences in college entry

behavior between blacks and whites across the socio-economic spectrum. We also examine how this

relationship has changed over time. Second, we conclude that the effects of college tuitionBdespite its

dramatic real increase throughout the 1980s and early 1990sBcan account for very little of the black-

white gap in college entry. Finally, we find evidence that suggests that individuals from different family

background respond differently to local labor markets and tuition; as a result, policies that target less-

advantaged youth, both black and white, for college attendance must incorporate these different

responses.




III. Data

        Because we are focusing on both the cross-section and time-series patterns of black and white

college entry for men and women, a large data set that provides consistent measures of college going

behavior over time is needed. As a result, our primary data source is the March supplement to the

Current Population Survey (CPS) from 1968 through 1998. Because this is a household-based

dataset, we are able to match 18 and 19 year olds to their parents as long as they are considered

members of the same household. While this may sound restrictive, individuals are considered members

of their parent’s household as long as they either live in their parents= household or live in group quarters

away from the household. Therefore, children who are at school living in group quarters are treated as if




                                                                                                             6
they were members of their parent’s households.3 As a result, we are able to match 74% of 18 and 19

year olds to their parent’s household and personal characteristics.4

        Previous work on college entry employs the October supplement to the CPS. We believe that

the use of the March supplement is an improvement for two reasons. First, the family intra-relationship

variable in the October supplement is virtually non-existent prior to 1984. While one can determine if a

household member is a head, spouse, or dependent, it is impossible to ascertain if a dependent is a

family member. It is therefore impossible to determine if a member is a child of the household head.5

Second, the background measures in the October supplement, especially income measures, pale in

comparison to the March supplement in both quantity and quality (Hauser 1993).

        One disadvantage of the March supplement is the absence of an indicator stating if a person

received a high school diploma. While the October supplement contains the variable explicitly, the

March supplement only reports a person=s highest grade attained. For our purposes, therefore, we treat

a person who completed the 12th grade as a high school graduate. Regardless of the differences in the

data sets, our results are robust across both the March and October supplements.


3
  Hauser (1993) and Kane (1994) use CPS data from the October supplement and make similar
assumptions in order to match 18 and 19 year olds with parental and household characteristics.
Cameron and Heckman (2001) note the limitations of this sample selection.
4
  Other 18 and 19 year olds are household heads or spouses of a household head (11.7%), other family
members of a household (6.3%) or non-family members of a household (8.3%). By focusing on 18 and
19 year olds, we are not allowing for the possibility that blacks may attend college later than whites.
While we cannot test this directly (because of our inability to get family background characteristics for
25 year olds in the CPS), we do look at overall black-white college enrollment patterns for 25 year olds
overall and find that they are similar to those of 18/19 year olds.
5
  In fact, a dependent may very well be a sibling or parent of the household head if age distinctions are
not carefully noted. In the March CPS, almost 15% of dependents are not the household head=s
children, which suggests that assigning them as such in the October CPS could affect results.

                                                                                                          7
        In this paper, we are examining the college enrollment decisions of 18 and 19 year olds who

have completed high school.6 Similar to Kane (1994), an individual is considered as enrolled in college

if the highest grade attended, prior to 1993, is 13 or higher. As of 1993, individuals are considered

enrolled in college if they indicate that they have completed Asome college@ or if they indicate that they

are currently enrolled in college.7

        Table 1 presents summary statistics of our sample. Whites are more likely to go to college on

average, have higher family income, and have more highly educated mothers. Blacks are more likely to

be living in a female-headed household with the mother on welfare. They are also more likely to be

living in a central city and in the south.8




IV. Black versus White College Enrollment: The Facts

    The trend in college enrollment for blacks and whites (Figure 1) is striking. Even more striking is

this trend when one controls for family background; examining aggregate trends in college enrollment

fails to capture important variation by family background. (Table 2) When we break college enrollment

down by this SES and compare blacks to whites, we see that, at low ends of the SES spectrum, blacks

are actually more likely to attend college than comparable whites. As we move up the SES spectrum,


6
  We focus on enrollment rates for individuals who completed high school. The CPS does not
consistently distinguish high school equivalency completers from traditional high school graduates, so we
refer to both groups as Ahigh school completers.@ Most high school equivalency degrees granted in the
U.S. are GED degrees, which require no classroom training to obtain. See Cameron and Heckman
(1993) for more details.
7
  We compare our results using the March supplement to the same analysis using the October
supplement; in the October supplement, this break occurs at 1983 instead of 1992.
8
  We do not analyze Hispanic college-entry in this paper due to sample size limitations and the changing

                                                                                                             8
this relationship twists and, at the top, we can see that blacks are less likely to attend college than their

white counterparts.

    Table 2 breaks our sample into 3 periods and presents the average black and white college

enrollment rates for all 18-19 year old high school graduates.9 The first three rows are at the heart of

much of the previous literature. We then break the sample even further into SES groups and present the

average rate of college enrollment across the SES distribution. Individuals were assigned an SES group

based on an initial regression using the pooled sample by year relating college enrollment to family

background characteristics10. Individuals were then ranked based on their predicted values from this

regression; the sample was divided into those in the bottom 20% of the distribution, the middle 60%,

and those in the top 20%. Table 2 shows that, in the earliest 2 periods, low SES blacks were more

likely to attend college than low SES whites; among the middle and high SES groups, college enrollment

is relatively equal for blacks and whites. However, in the latest period, the relationship flattens out and

blacks are less likely to attend college at all points along the SES spectrum. Table 3 shows the

relationship between family background and college enrollment broken out for men and women; again,

we see that the patterns hold for both men and women. As a result, in the remainder of the paper we

analyze men and women together when studying differences between black and white college


composition of U.S. Hispanics.
9
  The data are broken into 3 periods for ease of exposition; results are similar when broken down into
shorter periods.
10
   The index we use to represent SES is, in fact, a measure of the individual’s propensity to attend
college. This propensity appears to coincide with what we consider to be measures of family
background: individuals with lower family incomes and poorer educated parents are less likely to attend
college. The probit based on the college enrollment decision merely provides a set of weights for the
creation of an index. While these weights are somewhat arbitrary, the results are relatively insensitive to

                                                                                                                9
enrollment.

    Table 4 reveals the same pattern in a regression framework.11 College enrollment is regressed on a

number of family characteristics, including mother's education, father's education, welfare status, single

parent family indicator, family income (log form), income squared, family size (log form), a sex

indicator, center city and rural indicators, and dummies for region of the country. In addition, data is

divided into 3 periods (1973-78, 1979-89, 1990-1998), which are included as dummies and interacted

with an indicator equal to one if the individual is black. Column 1 presents these results. Consistent

with the earlier literature, we see that blacks in the earliest period are more likely to enroll in college

once one controls for family background. This effect dissipates over time, until, in the latest period,

blacks are less likely to enroll in college, controlling for family background.

    The impact of the family background variables on college enrollment is quite consistent with

expectations. Better educated parents are associated with a higher probability of the child attending

college. Controlling for parents education, family income appears to have a negative impact on college

enrollment; this may be due to the idea that a “more successful” (i.e. higher income) less educated

parent may suggest to a child that there is no need for education, as is the case with a “less successful”

(i.e. lower income) well-educated parent. Finally, consistent with the literature, we find that men are

less likely to attend college than women, ceteris paribus (See Anderson, 2001.)

    Column 2 then presents the results when the black dummy in each period is interacted with dummies

indicating low SES, middle SES, or high SES family backgrounds. Importantly, we see that it is blacks



our choice of SES measure.
11 All standard errors are adjusted for clustering at the state level.

                                                                                                              10
from low SES backgrounds who are more likely to attend college than their white counterparts; this

effect dissipates as one moves up the SES distribution. It is also interesting to note that this impact is

strongest in the earliest period; by the middle period the effect is somewhat reduced and it has

disappeared by the last period.

    It is not surprising that we find that blacks are more likely to attend college at some points during the

last 30 years; this finding is consistent throughout the literature. The interesting feature is that low-SES

blacks, and not high-SES blacks, are doing better than equivalent whites and thus driving this result.

Again, this finding runs counter to the notion that blacks who achieve gains in education attainment tend

to be those from high SES backgrounds. Evidence from the 1970s and 1980s directly contradicts the

“cream-skimming” argument that well-off blacks are enjoying the benefits of improved education

attainment relative to whites.




IV. Explanations

Data sample selection

        One possible explanation is that these relationships are merely an artifact of our data selection

 criterion; we are selecting only those 18 and 19 year-olds who are still dependents of their parents and

 who also completed high school. We confirm our overall findings with the use of both the October

 CPS and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), which suggests that sample selection is

 not driving our results. In addition, as we noted previously, we are able to match over 70% of

 individuals to their parents in our sample.

        If we delve deeper, we find other reasons to suggest that sample selection is not the primary

                                                                                                             11
explanation of our findings. We test this hypothesis by comparing individuals who we are able to match

to their parents at age 18 and 19 to individuals we are able to match to their parents at age 15 or 16

three years prior. At age 15 or 16, the fraction of children who are not part of their parent’s household

is much smaller; as a result, we are able to look at the family background characteristics of these

younger individuals and compare them to our matched sample three years later. In order to explain the

relationships that we observe in the cross-section, it would need to be the case that we are somehow

selecting better blacks (or relatively worse whites).

        From Appendix Table 1 we can see that individuals in our sample are slightly better than the

family background of 15 and 16 year olds three years earlier (this is consistent with the fact that, at age

18 or 19, individuals who have already formed their own household are more likely to come from less

advantaged family backgrounds). However, this is relatively consistent for both blacks and whites. In

fact, it does not appear that there is much selection of our sample, as the means of the family

background variables are relatively similar among the 18/19 year olds and the 15/16 year olds three

years earlier.

        A second concern is that the pattern we observe may be driven by our decision to focus on high

school graduates only. However, restricting our sample to high school graduates does not affect our

results; we see the same relationship when we consider college enrollment rates relative to the whole

population of 18 and 19 year olds. (See Appendix Table 2.) In addition, when we look at the

probability of high school graduation by family background characteristics, we see a similar, although

much weaker, relationship, suggesting the using the whole population as a control group would only

reinforce our findings.

                                                                                                         12
Mis-Measurement of Family Background

        When examining the trends in black college enrollment over time, Kane (1994) noted that one

part of the story is the improvement in family background characteristics of blacks over this time period.

Indeed, the trend is striking; as Figure 3 shows, there have been remarkable improvements in mothers’

education--a particularly good predictor of college enrollment--for blacks over this time period. This

trend is especially notable among less than high school and high school educated mothers and less

pronounced (relative to whites) among more educated women. In much of our analysis we are explicitly

controlling for family background characteristics. While these changes are obviously part of the story in

explaining what is happening over time, it cannot explain the patterns we observe in the cross section.

        Another concern may be that, in the earlier periods, observable family characteristics do a poor

job of characterizing the true family background for blacks but do a better job for whites. This could be

due to poor labor market and educational opportunities for blacks in the 1940s and 50s, which would

make otherwise able individuals choose not to get more education. As a result, although families may

appear, based on observables, to have family backgrounds less conducive to higher educational

attainment, unobservable parental “quality” among blacks may actually be higher than observable

characteristics suggest. As a result, the pattern we see would merely be an artifact of improper

classification of blacks. Over time, observable characteristics may become a better measure of family

background for blacks, which is why we would observe the cross-section relationship flattening over

time.

        One observation that refutes this possibility is that we do not see the same pattern when we

                                                                                                          13
isolate the earliest part of our sample, the late 1960s. If it were really the case that weak measures of

family background for blacks caused the cross-sectional relationship we observe in the 1970s and early

80s, then we would expect to see the same relationship in the 1960s. But we don=t; in fact, we observe

the same relationship in the 1960s as we do in the 1990s.

        As another test, we considered the extreme case. If comparing blacks and whites with similar

family background characteristics is not a valid comparison, as we have assumed thus far, then what if

we compare blacks and whites at the same percentile in their own racial distribution of family

background characteristics? This methodology implicitly assumes that blacks and whites have the same

underlying distribution of family backgrounds, even though observably blacks look worse. To test this,

we run regressions of the probability of college enrollment as a function of observable characteristics

separately for blacks and whites and then rank individuals in each group based on their predicted

values. We then compare individuals at the different percentiles in each group; that is, we compare the

probability of college enrollment for individuals in the 20th percentile of the black distribution to those in

the 20th percentile of the white distribution. Table 5 presents the results when we do this; it allows us to

compare college enrollment probabilities for the bottom 20% of the black distribution to the bottom

20% of the white distribution, the middle part of the two distributions, and then the top 20% of both

distributions.12 We can see that the same relationship appears to hold, although it is somewhat weaker.

Blacks at the lower end of their SES distribution still do relatively better than those at the upper end


12
  Note that in earlier comparisons, the bottom 20% of the SES distribution was not calculated
separately for blacks and whites; as a result, we were comparing individuals with similar observable
family background characteristics instead of blacks and whites at the same points in their own
distribution.

                                                                                                            14
relative to their white equivalents. The results of this “extreme” case regression offer convincing

evidence that low-SES blacks are outperforming their white counterparts. In Table 5, by assuming a

similar distribution of characteristics across the races, we are now comparing whites to blacks who are

observably much worse (because, on average, blacks have worse family background characteristics

than whites especially at the low end of the SES spectrum). We still see low-SES blacks performing

the relative best.




Different Costs and Benefits of College Enrollment

        Another explanation is that individuals are behaving optimally, considering costs and benefits,

and the observed patterns of behavior reflect responses to different choice sets. When an individual is

deciding whether to enroll in college, he/she considers a number of factors. The first is the cost of going

to college, both the direct cost in terms of tuition, as well as the indirect cost in terms of the opportunity

cost of not working. He also considers the benefit, generally measured as the financial return to going to

college. Because these factors can vary across individuals of different socioeconomic status as well as

over time, they may be able to explain the pattern we observe in the data. Either blacks face different

costs or benefits of going to college, or, facing the same costs and benefits, they respond differently for

some reason. We explore whether we see any evidence of this in the data.

        The existing literature has already considered the effect of local labor market conditions on

college enrollment (See, for example, Rivkin 1995); however, in doing so, they have been limited by a

single cross-sectional analysis or have assumed that blacks and whites face the same labor market and

therefore include a single measure for blacks and whites (see, for example, Kane 1995). Theory

                                                                                                            15
suggests that strong labor markets will discourage college attendance, as the opportunity cost is higher.

However, in general, the average wage as a measure of the opportunity costs tends to work in the

wrong direction, as blacks are more likely to live in cities, which have higher wages. Average local

wages and unemployment rates have had little success explaining variation in college enrollment.

          As mentioned earlier, there is limited work that has considered the fact that blacks face a

different labor market from whites. However, the idea that they face different labor markets is

consistent with the evidence presented in Bound and Freeman (1992) showing that, from the mid 1970s

through the 1980s, there was a widening in black-white earnings and employment gaps among young

men, with the gap in earnings widening particularly among college graduates and in the Midwest and the

gap in employment widening most among high school dropouts. Figures 4 and 5 show the distinction

between black and white labor market outcomes, specifically unemployment rates and the college

premium; this disparity between black and white labor market experiences suggests a need for

considering them separately.

          Finally, the literature has assumed that individuals from advantaged backgrounds respond

similarly to costs and labor market conditions as do individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds. This,

however, is an empirical question that we test directly. In particular, earlier evidence has suggested that

college costs play an important role in determining college enrollment; however, if college costs have a

differential impact based on family background, policies targeted at individuals from disadvantaged

backgrounds need to incorporate these differences in order to evaluate the potential impact of the

policy.

          Table 6 tests these hypotheses by examining the relationship between race-specific local labor

                                                                                                         16
market variables, college tuition, and college enrollment. We first present results when coefficients on

these variables are constrained to be the same for all individuals of the same race, as the earlier literature

has done, and then allow the impact to vary by family background.

        We include a number of labor market measures in our regression. Ideally, we would like to

calculate labor market variables that vary by race, state, and year. Unfortunately, the March CPS does

not contain sufficient observations to calculate such labor market variables. As a result, we calculate

time-, race-, and state-varying labor market variables using the Outgoing Rotation for the years 1979-

1998.13 Because the Outgoing Rotation begins in 1979, we use the March CPS to calculate time-,

race-, and region-varying, labor market variables from 1973-1979. The March CPS does not

provide consistent state identifiers prior to 1976; we use their more aggregate identifier which breaks

the country into 21 state groups.14


        Our first measure of local labor market conditions is the unemployment rate, calculated using

individuals 25-40 years of age. We calculate it separately for blacks and whites; if blacks faced higher

unemployment rates in the market, possibly due to factors such as discrimination, they may be more

likely to go to college than observably equivalent whites.


        We also consider the relative return to a college education, measured as the ratio of the average

wage for college graduates aged 25-40 to the average wage for high school graduates for the same age



13
  Local labor market variables constructed using the Outgoing Rotation are 3 year moving averages.
14
  All state-level data was aggregated to the state-group level by averaging across individuals in the
states, thereby giving more weight to larger states. From here on in the paper, when we refer to states
we are actually referring to state-groups.

                                                                                                           17
group among full time workers.15 Again, we calculate a race-specific measure, allowing for different

returns for blacks and whites in a particular state.

        As a measure of college costs, we utilize resident university tuition data from the State of

Washington Higher Education Coordinating Board. These data vary by state and by year for the years

in our sample. To calculate the appropriate “state-group” tuition, we use a weighted average of state

tuitions within the group, with weights given by the respective state population for the given year.

        Table 6 presents the results when we estimate probit models of college enrollment for blacks

and whites separately. Only the coefficients on the labor market and tuition variables are shown;

however, the regressions all include the family background, regional, and center city/rural variables

presented in Table 4.

        Columns 1 and 3 present the basic results when one includes tuition and local labor market

variables in a college enrollment regression. While whites appear to respond as expected to both labor

market and tuition variables, this is not true for blacks; in fact, these variables do little to explain what is

happening with black college enrollment.16 Among whites, Column 1 shows that a higher college

premium increases college enrollment, as does a higher unemployment rate and lower tuition (although at

a decreasing rate as tuition rises). In columns 2 and 4, we allow for differential impacts of these

variables by family background category. In the case of both blacks and whites, tuition appears to have

a significant impact on college enrollment among low-SES individuals. However, this effect disappears

among higher SES blacks, while it holds true among whites of all SES groups. Notably, whites respond

16 Note that Kane (1994) finds a significant impact of tuition on college enrollment. This result appears

                                                                                                              18
strongly to labor market variables, with high SES whites responding even more strongly to the college

premium than lower SES whites. On the contrary, blacks appear to respond negatively to the college

premium. This reflects in large part the fact that blacks appear to respond perversely to the high school

wage—as high school wages deteriorated during the late 1970s and early 1980s, it appears that blacks

did not respond by enrolling in college, as would be expected. Low SES blacks responded to

increasing tuition costs by reducing college attendance, while at the same time low SES blacks did not

respond to labor market factors that should encourage college enrollment. To understand the magnitude

of their responsiveness, within the relevant range, an increase in tuition of approximately 5% reduces

college enrollment of low SES blacks by almost 35%.

        These results suggest some important patterns. Among whites, tuition costs and local labor

markets appear to have a significant impact on their college enrollment decisions (and these effects are

even stronger among high SES individuals). On the contrary, blacks appear to be relatively insensitive

(or even responding in a way that is negatively related) to local labor market conditions. Tuition

appears to be the only policy variable that has a strong impact on blacks, and only those from poorer

family backgrounds.

        How much of the variation in enrollment among blacks and whites do these variables explain?

Figure 6 presents white college enrollment, black college enrollment, and predicted college enrollment

for blacks if they had white characteristics and faced white tuition costs and labor market conditions.

(i.e. using black coefficients from table 6 column 4). We can see that, although family background, local

labor market characteristics, and tuition costs can explain much of the differences between black and


to be quite sensitive to the model specification.
                                                                                                          19
white college enrollment in the later period, it actually overpredicts black college enrollment in the earlier

period.

          Although we explain little of the overall variation, the results have important policy implications.

Earlier work that suggested that college tuition has an important impact on college enrollment behavior

did not consider different responses by individuals from diverse family backgrounds. However,

empirical evidence suggests that there may be diverse responses. As a result, efforts targeted at

improving college enrollment among disadvantaged individuals must consider the appropriate

relationship when evaluating different policies.




V. Other Possible Explanations

Affirmative Action

          Anecdotal evidence suggests that affirmative action may be an explanation for the patterns we

observe. Clearly, if we knew nothing beyond the positive coefficient on the black dummy in the college

enrollment equation, this would seem like a reasonable explanation. In addition, the time series seems

roughly consistent with affirmative action: increasing strength in the late 1970s and then declining in the

1980s.

          However, when we examine more closely, we see a number of contradictions. First, if there is

affirmative action in hiring and wages/promotion, then we would expect our race-varying labor market

measures to reflect this; black workers would have lower unemployment rates or higher wages as a

result.

          If there were affirmative action in college admission, we would expect this to affect blacks

                                                                                                            20
across the SES spectrum and would thereby observe a level shift up of black enrollment instead of the

pattern we observe, with low-SES blacks more likely and high-SES blacks less likely to attend college

than equivalent whites. In addition, anecdotal evidence also suggests that colleges most likely to admit

based on affirmative action would be those who would attempt to Acream-skim@ the best black

students; in this case, we would expect the opposite pattern from the cross-section we observe.

        Directly testing the effects of affirmative action is difficult, however, because of the difficulty in

measuring differences in the “effectiveness” of affirmative action in different states at different times. We

can, however, compare the patterns we observe in two year- versus four year-colleges. Because many

two year colleges have open enrollment, we would not expect to see the same relationship in two-year

as in four-year college enrollment if affirmative action is the underlying cause. When we estimate a

multinomial logit where the potential outcomes are no college enrollment, two-year college enrollment,

and four-year college enrollment (Table 7), we see similar relationships for both types of college

enrollment. In the earliest period, the lowest SES blacks are more likely to attend college than the

equivalent whites for both two- and four-year colleges. In the middle period, this relationship persists

among four year college enrollees but dissipates among the two-year college students. Finally, in the

third period, this relationship has disappeared among all students, and blacks are unambiguously less

likely to attend either type of college than equivalent whites. These results suggest that it is not

affirmative action among the four-year colleges that is driving the relationship.17


17
  We use the October CPS for this estimation because the March does not distinguish between
enrollment in two-year and four-year colleges. It is interesting to note that, over this time period, the
percentage of blacks attending two year colleges as a fraction of total blacks attending college is
remaining relatively constant, as is this number for whites.

                                                                                                                 21
Credit Constraints/Pell Grants

        There is also a literature that considers the effect of credit constraints on college enrollment

decisions. If blacks face different credit constraints than whites, then one might expect to see different

patterns of college enrollment by race. Cameron and Heckman (2001) examine this directly to

determine whether differences in college enrollment by race are due to differences in family background

or differences in the availability of credit. The authors conclude that it is family background, and not

credit constraints, that explain the relationship between family characteristics and school attendance. In

contrast, Acemoglu and Pischke (2001) exploit changes in the distribution of family income to examine

the effect of parental resources on college education and find evidence of large effects of family income

on college enrollment.

        In the CPS, we do not observe wealth, so it is difficult to test this directly. Our findings on this

topic are mixed, however. Though the cross-section pattern we observe runs counter to traditional

belief that poorer blacks are more credit constrained than equivalent whites, the fact that we find that

tuition has such a strong impact on low SES blacks (and not blacks from wealthier backgrounds) may

provide some support for the credit constraint argument.18




Pell Grants


18
  Another proposed explanation is differences in school quality by race. However, to observe the
relationship we see, it would have to be the case that poorer Blacks, who receive lower quality
education, are compensating by increasing the quantity. This runs counter to much of the evidence
on the relationship between school quality and quantity, which suggests a positive relationship

                                                                                                           22
        Finally, Kane (1994) also considers the roll of financial aid in the form of Pell grants and finds

little effect of changes in Pell grants on college enrollment. More specifically, he looks at the

establishment of Pell grant awards and compares changes in college enrollment for eligible versus

ineligible youths before and after the implementation of the program. He concludes that there is little

evidence that those to whom the Pell grant program was targeted enjoyed particularly large increases in

enrollment.

        It is unlikely that changes in Pell grant generosity are driving the relationships we observe in the

data. Given that Pell grants are not race-specific but instead are income specific, we should not expect

to see differential effects of Pell grants within SES class; low-income individuals should benefit equally

regardless of race. Additionally, we see similar results when we allow year*SES effects, which should

pick up any changes in the generosity of Pell Grants for low-SES individuals.

        However, it may be the case that there are wealth differences among low-SES blacks and

whites that we are unable to pick up in our dataset. Because we observe differential behavior by SES

and race, this could be consistent with some sort of financial aid/credit constrain story. Further work

needs to address this issue, focusing on the differential impact by family background.19




V. Conclusion

        Although it is well-documented in the literature that, controlling for family background



between the two. (See Light and Strayer, 2000).
19 Consistent with the findings in this paper, recent work by Linsenmeier, Rosen, and Rouse (2002)
finds differential effects of financial aid packages on low-income blacks and whites when they focus on
one university.

                                                                                                             23
characteristics, blacks are more likely to attend college than whites, very little work has focused on

explaining this phenomenon. The literature instead has primarily focused on understanding the time

series patterns of black college enrollment.

          This paper attempts to understand what is driving this difference between black and white

college enrollment. Interestingly, it is not the blacks at the high end of the family background spectrum

who are more likely to attend college than their white counterparts; it is the blacks at the bottom of the

SES spectrum who are driving this result. In addition, this relationship appears to flatten over time; by

the 1990s, blacks at all parts of the SES spectrum are less likely to attend college than equivalent

whites.

          We examine possible explanations for this phenomenon and make a number of conclusions.

First, contrary to earlier evidence, college tuition appears to explain very little of the observed pattern.

Interestingly, we do uncover differential responses by individuals from different family backgrounds. As

a result, although we explain little of the overall variation in college enrollment, the results have important

policy implications. Earlier work that suggested that college tuition has an important impact on college

enrollment behavior did not consider different responses by individuals from diverse family

backgrounds. However, the empirical evidence suggests that there may be diverse responses. In

particular, low-income blacks appear to be very sensitive to changes in tuition costs, while blacks from

middle- or high- SES backgrounds are not. As a result, efforts targeted at improving college enrollment

among disadvantaged individuals must consider the appropriate relationship when evaluating different

policies.

          While this paper has focused on differences between blacks and whites, these findings suggest

                                                                                                            24
the need for more extensive research when considering policies directed at the assimilation of more

disadvantaged groups into the education system, and future research will extend this analysis to

immigrants. It is not surprising that appropriate education policies vary for by race for different target

groups. This research suggests that these policies must also take into account different behavioral

responses based on family background characteristics as well.

Black and white SES distributions are determined separately based on race- and year-specific regressions
relating college enrollment to family background characteristics. Black individuals were ranked based on the
predicted values from their own regression and then compared to individuals in the same percentile of the
white distribution. * indicates statistical difference between black and white averages at the 5% level.

Source: October CPS. These results represent partial results from a multinomial logit, run separately by period, with three
outcome possibilities: no college, two-year college, and four-year college enrollment. Other variables included in the regression
include mothers education (four categories), father’s education (four categories), log of family income, log of family size, an age
dummy indicating if the individual is 18, inner city/rural indicators, region indicators, sex, an indicator if the individual is part of a
single parent household, and year dummies. Level effects of all interactions are included. SES distributions are determined based
on predicted values from year-specific regressions relating college enrollment to family background characteristics. All standard
errors are adjusted for clustering at the state level.
