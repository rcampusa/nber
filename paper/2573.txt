                      The Time-Variation of Risk and Return
                    in the Foreign Exchange and Stock Markets



                                    ABSTRACT



     Recent empirical work indicates that, in a variety of financial markets,

both conditional expectations and conditional variances of returns are time-

varying.     The purpose of this paper is to determine whether these joint

fluctuations of conditional first and second moments are consistent with the

Sharpe-Lintner-Mossin capital-asset-pricing model.     We test the mean-variance

model under several different assumptions about the time-variation of

conditional second moments of returns, using weekly data from July 1974 to

December 19a6, that include returns on a portfolio composed of dollar, Deutsche

mark, Sterling, and Swiss franc assets, together with the US stock market.     The

model is estimated constraining risk premia to depend on the time-varying

conditional covariance matrix of the residuals of the expected returns

equations.

     The results indicate that estimated conditional variances cannot explain

the observed time-variation of risk premie.     Furthermore, the constraints

imposed by the static CAPM are slwsys rejected.

Introduction

       Rates of return on international financial assets are characterized by

statistical properties that are quice common to all financial markets: they are

highly volatile and largely unpredictable.    These properties make it very

difficult to extract statistically reliable estimates of systematic exchange-

rate and asset-price movements, and are at the root of the generally poor

empirical performance of inter tional asset pricing models.     Nevertheless, two

important results have been uncovered by empirical researchers and tan be

considered a fair characterization of the data:   (a) expected returns   on foreign

assets vary over time (Cumby and Obscfeld [1981[ and the numerous articles that

followed, recently surveyed by Frankel and Meese [19871); (b) the volatility of

returns on foreign assets also changes over time (Cumby and Obatfeld [l984j,

Hodrick and Srivastava [1984], Hsieh [1985}, smong others).    The purpose of this

paper is to determine whether the observed fluctuations of conditional variances

and conditional expectations of returns in international financial markets are

consistent with a family of asset pricing models)

       We test the mean-variance capital-asset-pricing model (CAPM) under several

different assumptions about the time-variation of conditional second momenta of

returns, using weekly data from July 1974 to December 1986.    The model is

estimated constraining risk premis to depend on the time-varying conditional

covariance matrix of the residuals of the expected returns equations.     Unlike

all formal tests of capital asset pricing models we are aware of, we pool data

on    the foreign exchange market and on the    195   atook market,   This strategy is

juatified by the sheer size of the stock market in international financial

portfolios: in our sample, the averaga share of the US stock market is .55,

versus .31 for dollar-denominated external assets, and only .06 for pound

sterling and Deutaohe mark aaseta, respectively.          Furthermore, we oan explore

whether some puzzling aspects of the behavior of risk premia, which have been

noted in the stock market by Mehra and Prescott [1985] , and in the foreign

exchange market by Fama [1984]      and Frankel ]l966[, have common characteristios

across these different assets,

I.   The Issues

     Je postulate a representative investor, maximizing a utility function

defined over the (conditional) expectation and the (conditional) variance of

end-of-period wealth:



                         MAX                                                              (1)

                                                                W(lxt'l)R                 (2)

                                       — W2x 'i x                                         (3)

                                                                 the vector of investment shares
and where W represents the investor's wealth,               x

point for the Sharpe-Litner-Mossin static capital-asset-pricing model, but can

also be obtained from an alternative, explicitly dynamic, framework, as we show

in appendix A,     Indeed the model we estimate is 'static'               only because it imposes

unit elasticity of interteaporal substitution, but is consistent with time-

variation of the distribution of returns.

        The first order conditions for problem (1) imply the following relation

between asset shares and the conditional moments of returns:




                               x — (p+i)          (E(R+1)
                                                                 -
                                                                     R)                         (4)




where p stands for the relative risk-aversion coefficient, defined as
                                                                                        2W1J2/U1,
and assumed to be constant.       U1 and U2 ate the partial dsriva°ives              of the

Note that equation (4) is both a first-order recast-sty condition for individual

forward premia.   Frankel [19863   argues that the variation of asset supplies,

the model of equation (6) with     he assumption of constant 2 is true, cannot

possibly explain the numbers reported by Fama.     For example, in the case of the

Deutsche mark, and assuming that p—2, observed fluctuation of asset supplies can

only predict a standard error of the risk premium that is 1/200 of the standard
error of the risk premium estimated with unrestricted projection equations,

Thus the difficulties encountered in estimating the coefficient of risk aversion

are due to the exceedingly low variation of                cannot statistically be

distinguished from a constant.

     The assumption of constant conditional covarianca of returns, however, has

been proven wrong by the evidence on conditional heteroskedasticity, both in the

stock market and in the foreign exchange market.       Evidence on the stock market

was reported by Christie [19821.    Poterba and Summers [1984),   French at al.

[19873, among others, while tests of homoskedasticity using foreign exchange

data were performed by Cumby and Obstfeld    [19841,   Hodrick and Srivastava [1984),

and Hsieh [1985).   Giovannini and Jorion [1987)   find that both in the stock

market and in the foreign exchange market nominal interest rates have

substantial explanatory power for the variation of conditional (non-central)



  the covariance of disturbances with the matrix Q.
 second moments.    They argue that the time variation of conditional second
moments could improve the empirical performance of the static tARN..

       Recently, a number of papers have attempted to explicitly account for the

variation of conditional second momenta in tests of the static CAPM.°

Bollerslev, Engle and Wooldridge [1985]        apply the Generalized Autoregressive

Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARtH) model to returns on hills, bonds and

stocks, and find some empirical support to the static tARN., although the

diagnostic tests they perform do not include rho test of overidenrifying
restrictions. Engel and Rodrigues [1987] and Artanasic and Edo [1987]--
independently of this paper--use the data on asset supplies originally
constructed   by Frankel   [1982]   to test the international CAPM with different

specifications of the conditional covariance of returns,        Both studies test a

version of the ARCH model, while Engel and Rodrigues also project second moments

onto   macroeconomic indicators. Both papersfind a substantial improvement in
the performance of the model once the time variation of conditional second
moments is accounted for. However, they still obtain rather inpreci.aa eatimatea

of   the ooeffcient of risk aversion, and Engle sod Rodrigues
                                                              reject in all cases
the overidentifying restrictions associated with the CAPS!.

       The common result of these papers is that the specification of the
                                                                          procsss

second moments used so far in the literature, notes that alternative models

appear to imply widely different magnitudes for the predicted volatility of risk

premia.   This result is especially disturbing, since all of the models that have

been used for the process followed by conditional second moments are just

projection equations, with no theoretical grounding.                Therefore it seems

particularly important to explore alternative specifications for the process

followed by conditional second .oments.            This is the task of this paper, which

we describe in more detailed in the next section.




II.   Soecification and Estimation

      Equation (6) is the starting point for the estimation of the CAPM.                 Since

we use data on nominal returns, the own-currency interest rate is riskiess:                    we

assume that     represents the dollar interest rate.               This implies that the

investor's consumption basket is denominated in dollars and is not subject to

purchasing-power risk.      Given the large variability of nominal asset returns

relative to inflation rates, empirical tests do not seem to be affected by the

choice of the deflator.4       Define         as the difference between             and the

product of the score vectors, as suggested by Zerndt et al. (1974).

     If the covariance matrix of the error terms is constant, the restrictions

imposed by the CAPM on the function f in equation (7) are:



                              f(9,t) —       p 0   x                                   (10)



In this case the conditional          sn   unconditional distributions of   e   coincide.

     If the covariance matrix of the error terms varies over time, the

restrictions imposed on the function f in equation (7) are:



                          f(8,t) — p                                                   (11)




     As we argued in section          2, one important factor   in the empirical

implementation of the CAP?! with time-varying second momenta is the specification

of the fluctuations of             For this reason, we present in this peper a number

of alternative specifications of the time-variation of conditional variances and

compare their impact on tests of asset pricing.           This strategy is necessary

since there is no economic model of the fluctuation of variances to rely on.

The first general specification is the ARCH process proposed by Engle [1982J

which implies that the conditional covariance matrix is a nonstochastic function

of the current information        set:




                          —   r   +

the   following processes:

As is well knosm, non-zero conditional expected returns are frequently found in

empirical research, while unconditional expected returns in the foreign exchange

market appear to be small.            These two pieces of evIdence indicate that foreign

exchange risk premia change sign over time.7                How can we get sign reversals in

conditional risk premia with the specifications for                 in equations (12) and

(13)7     Consider model (14) and (13) first.           Changes in sign of risk premia can

arise from negative covariance terms in 0, or when                 and p have opposite signs.

In model    (14) and (12),   on the other hand, sign reversals in risk premia can

also arise from sign     reversals        in the estimated conditional covariance terms in

0.     As we argue below, the      twc.   '-pecifications   end up producing nearly identical

estimates of the movements of risk premia, for all assets.

       Our equations nc1ude as a speca1 case the simple ARCH model adopted by

Engel and Rodrigues      [1987),    where the    conditional   variance depends on the lagged

value of the squared forecast error (thus E and                are constrained to equal

zero).    That specification               generate persistence in fluctuations of 0,

because         is drawn from a distribution with covariance                    a large value of

matrix A, makes
                   0 larger.        A nonzero B coefficient, by contrast, does always

produce persistent fluctuations of 0.             As we show below, the observed

persistence in volatility cannot be adequately captured if P is constrained to

zero.

       Christie [1982)   and Ciovannini and Jorion [1987),           among others, point that

nominal interest rates are significantly correlated with variances of returns in

the stock market and in the foreign exchange market.               Giovannini    [1987)   shows

how these correlations could arise from the joint movements of money demand and

asset demands.    Hence we include the interest-rate   tens   in equations (12) and

(13)
       To test the restrictions imposed by the CAPH, an alternative hypothesis is

needed.    We specify the following general model:



                             r    —u'+Qx
                                       r t    + t÷l                           (15)


where the elements of the matrix Q are defined similarly to the restricted

version, but are of course unrelated to the covariante of the residuals in (13)




8
    The two alternative specifications of the conditional covariance matrices
    allow for somewhat different interest-rate effects, While    n  equation (12) we
    assume that all cross products of interest-rate differentials affect the risk
    premium on each security, in equation (13) only the own-currency interest
    rates are assumed to determine conditional variances of each asset's return.
    The specification of (12) insures that £3 is positive definite.

III.    Empirical Results

       The models surveyed above were estimated using weekly data.      Since the

asset supplies data can only be constructed on a monthly basis, the weekly

series of asset shares have been computed by interpolating the own-currency

values of asset supplies, and by translating them into dollars at the actual

weekly exchange rates, to compute the value shares.       We believe that this method

should not affect our estimatts dramatically, because exchange-rate chsnges

account for a large fraction of the variation of dollar values of asset

supplies, as shown in table 1.        In the case of the stock market we use the

actual capitalization data, that era available on a weekly basis.        The

currencies in the portfolio, together with the US dollar, include the British

pound, the Deutsche mark and the Swiss franc.       Our ssmple ranges from July 5,

1974 to December 19, 1986, and includes 651 observations.

       Tables 2 snd   3   report the maximum-likelihood estimation results, for the

homoskedastic model, and the GARtH model of equation (12).       The tables report

point estimates and t statistics for the coefficient of risk aversion, the

constant terms in the regressions, and the parameters of the conditional

covariance matrix.        We also compute the Lagrange multiplier test for the CAPM

restrictions implied by equation (l4).




  The Lagrange multiplier is computed as follows. Define n and (n+r) as the
  number of parameters for the restricted and unrestricted models, respectively.
  The test statistic is q'H 'q, where q is cha score vector- -defined as the
  derivative of the log-likelihood function with respect to the parameters- -end
  H the Hessian matrix, both of dimensions (n+r) and evaluated at the restricted
  point. By the Cramer-Rso inequslity, the Hassisn matrix is itself computed
  from the outer product of the score vectors.
                                           15


     To make a comparison with Frankel's [1982]           results,   in table 2 we report

the estimates of the model where we assume a constant covariance matrix of

returns (although our model is estimated with weekly data on a longer sample

period, and includes a different set of assets from Frsnkel'a).             We find that

the ooeffioent of risk aversion is negative and very large.              This is a strong

rejection of the model, since a negative risk aversion implies a failure of the

neceasery conditions for optimization.      The Lagrange multiplier test also

rejects the reatrittions imposed by the model against a general (homoskedastir)

alternative apeoifioation of excess rerurna.            The alternative rodel is specified

as in equation (15)   ,   assuming that the matrix of unreerrirted coeffitients Q          ia
ronatant.   No other restrictions are imposed on         Q.

     Table 3 contains the estimates of the risk aversion parameter in the

heteroskedastic model of equation (12), and of the elements of the matrioes F,

A, B, and   &   Since--as pointed out above-we actually estimate the Cholaski

factors of those metrites, the t statistios are obtained by using the

invarianoe property of maximum-likelihood estimators.           The table reveals several

important facts.     Ffrst, the hypothesis of constant conditional second moments

is strongly rejected, as shown by the x2        tests   at the bottom of the table: the

statistic tests the hypothesis that the elements of the matrices A, B and              are

all equal to zero.    Releasing the constraint that the oovarianoe of returns is

constant over time seems also to improve the estimate of the coefficient of risk

aversion, which becomes positive and of reasonable magnitude, although

insignifiosmtly different from zero.      Second, we find that the autoregressive

terms- -the elements of the matrix B- -are highly signifitant: changes in

volatility of returns have a high degree of persistence.             Finally, the
                                           16


overidentifying restrictions imposed by the CAPM are strongly rejected.        In this

case    the alternative hypothesis for the test of overidentifying restrictions

assumes that the matrix of time-varying coefficients         of equation (15) evolves

as the matrix      in equation (12).      In order to save space, we do not report the

results obtained assuming constant conditional correlations (equation (13)): the

estimate of the coefficient of risk aversion is in that case .23 (with t

statistic .03),   and, as above,   oth the constancy of conditional variances and

the restrictions of the CAPM are strongly rejected.

       Table 4 contains a number   of   specification tests on the two models of

conditional covariances: constant correlations (equation (13)) and the model of

table 2 (equation (12), referred to as 'General Model).        The table shows that

the explanatory value of the variables we include in the model of time-varying

covariances is very similar under the two alternative specifications:       in both

cases we reject at very high confidence levels the hypothesis that lagged rate-

of-return innovations have no marginal explanatory power over a constant, and

the hypothesis that movements in conditional variances are not autocorrelated.

Interest rates appear to be highly significant in the case where conditional

correlations are constant, but are just below the 10 percent significance level

in the more general model.    This discrepancy between the two models is due to

the way interest rates enter equations (12) and (13), as we explain in footnote

S above.

       In summary, our empirical analysis suggests three main results:     first, the

time variation of conditional second moments is not adequately captured by the

simple models which include as explanatory variables only the lagged forecast

errors.    Second, the risk aversion parameter does not seem to be estimable with
                                           17


any precision.      And third, constraining conditional correlations to be constant

does not dramatically affect the significance of explanatory variables of the

conditional covariance matrix.




remia   The ability of conventional asset pricing models to reproduce      the   patterns

of unreatricted estimates of foragn exchange risk precia has bean questioned by

several      authors and   in several different contexts.   Fame   1984   shows thac   -




under rational expectations- -the fluctuations of risk premia in the foreign
exchange market are at least as large as those of forward premia. While Frankel
concludes     that such evidence cannot be reconciled with the static CAPM (in the

version with constant conditional oovariances)       Hodriok and 9rivasoava [1986]

claim that such evidence is not in principle inconsistent with the dynamic

general   equilibrium model due to Lucas {l982{, Work on rhe PS stock market by
Mehra   and Prescott 11985] indoeres that the conventional general-equilibrium
dynamic asset pricing model cannot explain simultaneously the relatively low
level of the risk-free race and the (on average) high risk premia for the stock
market.10

10
     Mehra end Prescott, while addressing similar questions as Frankel, use quite
     e different framework of analysis: rates of return on the riskiess asset are
     endogenous in Mehra and Prescott's model, given assumptions about the
     exogenous distribution of output growth. Hodriok and Srivastavs [1986] also
     carry   out a general equilibrium exercise.

       Our objective in this section is limited to the comparison between

unrestricted estimates of risk premis, and the predictions of the models

estimated above.    Figures 1 end   2   illustrate unrestricted risk premia for the US

stock market and the Deutsche mark.11       These were obtained by projecting excess

returns on a constant, the own-asset portfolio share, the product of the forward

premium and the own-asset share, and the product of the lagged value of the

squared return and the own-asse share.          The hypothesis that excess returns in

the two markets are constant wss rejected, for all assets, at the 99 percent

significance levels, using a Hansen [19823            and White [19803 estimate of the

covariance matrix of the parameters.       Although these forecasts are quite noisy,

the size of the fluctuations is remarkable.            The ex-ante excess return of the

stock market over dollar deposits fluctuates within plus and minus 1 percent per

week, while the ex-ante excess return of        OPt   assets fluctuates within plus and

minus 0.6 percent per week: hence the annualized numbers in figures 1 and 2,

which are obtained by multiplying the weekly returns by 52.

       The ability of the CAPM to reproduce these numbers depends on the

volatility of asset supplies, the volatility of conditional second moments, and

the size of the risk aversion coefficient.            Does the volatility of conditional

second moments--which was not taken into account by Frankel's original

calculations--make the model's predictions closer to the unrestricted estimates?

To answer this question we plot the predicted values of the risk premis obtained

from the model whose estimates are reported in table 3.            Figures   3   and 4 plot

     Once again, we omit the other currencies to save space. The general
     conclusions we draw from the discussion of the OPt and 5Th simulations also
     hold for the other currencies.

the estimated conditional variances of returns and the estimated risk premia for

the US stock market and DM assets.12    Although we do not report predicted values

of expected returns and stendard errors in all alternative models, we should

point out that the exclusion of nominal interest rates from the specification of

the conditional covariance matrix does not affect the estimates of means and

standard errors of returns in any noticeable way.    On the other hand, excluding

the lagged conditional variance term does: as expected, the persistence of

fluctuations of conditional variances, and, to some extent, of risk premia,

decreases dramatically.    This is highlighted by figures 5 and 6. which report

the eatimatea of conditional standard errors of the stock market and Deutsche

mark aaaeta, obtained when the (significant) autoregreaave tern is omitted.

       The moat striking fact appeering from a comparison of figures 1 and 2 with

3    and 4 is that the fluctuations of the estimates of risk premia implied by the

OAPM are dramatically different from those of the unrestricted ones.     Although

this evidence iS only of a qualitative nature, it is borne out by the Lagrange

multiplier tests diacuaaed above.     Excess returns cn DM esacta condirional on

the estimated CAPM model fluctuate between C and 2 percent per annum, while the

unreatrcted eatimate fluctuates between plus and minus 30 percent.      Similarly,

the eatmated excess return on the US stock market, conditional on the CAPM,

fluctuates   beeeen 6 and 10   percent per year, while the unconstrained estimate

ranges between plus and minus 40 percent.

       We have also found no appreciable difference between our two alternative

specification of conditional covariance matricea- -represented by equations (12)



12
     Returns and their standard errors are also in annual terms.

and   (13).   The estimated conditional variances obtained from the two

specifications have very high correlation coefficients.13      The correlations

between risk premia in the two    specifications   is 0.96 for the pound, 0.91 for

the Deutsche mark, 0.95 for the Swiss franc, and 0.99 for the stock market.         In

other words, assuming constant correlation coefficients does not in any way

affect the pattern of fluctuations of risk premia consistent with the estimated

capital asset pricing model)"




V.    Suiuyery and Concludina Remarks

     This paper has specified and estimated a static capital asset pricing model

to explain the empirical behavior of rates of return in the US stock market and

in the foreign exchange market.     The purpose of the paper was to explore the

role of alternative specifications for the process followed by the conditional

second moments of returns.

       The empirical findings indicate that the    specification   of the process

followed by conditional second moments of returns affects significantly the

estimate of the risk aversion parameter, and as a result, affects the estimates




13
     The correlations are: 0.99 for the pound, 0.97 for the Deutsche mark, 0.99
     for the Swiss franc, and 0.99 for the stock market,
14
     While the two models predict the same fluctuations of risk premia, the
     average risk premia differ in the two models, because the estimates of the
     risk aversion parameters differ.

of the ex-ance risk premium on various assets.      Both lagged conditional

varisnoes and nominal interest rates have significant predictive ability for

second moments of asset returns,      For all specifications of conditional

variances we estimate, however, the overidenrifying restrictions imposed by the

CAPM are rejected at very high confidence levels.

      Simulations with the estimates of the model show that our esoimares of the

CAPM fail to reproduce unrestricted estimates of risk premia cbrainsd from

projection equarions.    Furthermore, since the general shapes of astimsted

conditional variances (their peeks end rroughs) do not differ dcamericelly

across the various specifications ye adopt, it appears that the empirical

failure of the CAPM ran be ascribed to the absolute lack of resemblance of the

fluctuations of condrional verienoes end the fluctuations of unresrrcred

estimates of risk premia.      This lack of resemblance is clearly nor made up for

by fluctuations in asset supplies.

      Overall, the results of this paper tend to be discouraging to those who

believe that the static CAPM is a fair description of the determination of

equilibrium returns in world financial markets.      However, the evidence also

seems to suggest rhec e thoroughly satisfactory test of the static CAPH would

probably require the inclusion      of meny more assets then those we use, end a

much more          specification of the process followed by conditional second
            complete
moments. Both of these extensions involve the construction of very large

models, that--given the current computational technology--crc quite difficult
and   expensive to estimate.

          Apyendx A: Unit Intertemporel Substitution and the "Static" CAPM



        In this appendix, which draws heav1y from Ciovannini and Weil {1988, we

prove that the equations chatacterizing the "static" Sharpe-Litner-Mossin

capital asset pricing model can be derived in a dynamic model where

interremporel substitution and risk aversion are expltcirly distinguished? and

where the eThscicity of intertemporal subacirucion is constrained to unity.

kenton    [l9fl'   showed that assuming logarithmic utility (which implies unit

intertemporal eLasticity of conaumpccon), the dynamic saving and portfclio

selection problem collapses co one whera the consumer maximires the expectation

of the logartrhm of end-ofperiod weelth               The advantage of the framework

outlined here? as stressed by Giovannini and Weil [1988],            is that? unlike    n
Merton's model       no restrictions are imposed on the coefficient of risk aversion

        Consloer the ptoblem of a consumer whose preferences are represented by the

following runcrional equation:

                        —
                                             S(E'J)[                                   (ml)



                        subject to, Pt4      ('rC_)+i                                a2)


where       denotes the expectation operator, conditional on information available

at time    t,   P represents the investor's wealth, C consumption,      S   is proportional

to the utility discount factor, and x'j —         I   (we omit, for simplicity but without

baa     of generality, the riskless asset and assume that only risky investments

are available).       For notational ease,   we denote the maximand in (al) as

U[C,(EV)], where U is referred to as an "aggregator" function.
                                                23


        Equation (al) has been studied by Wail [19871988].              Similar versions were

independently developed by Farmer [1987] and Epstein and Zin [1987]               .   If
preferences are as in (al), the coefficient           l/       represents the elasticity of

intertemporal substitution (as suggested by considering the corresponding

problem under certainty) while p is the coefficient of relative risk aversion

(as suggested        by the fact chat the risk premium for a lottery on permanent

consumption is proportional to p            see Wail [1987]).

        By application of L'Hopical rule, the following can be established:


                        lim
                                U[c,(EV1)[      —

        As teil [1988]        shows, the first-order necessary condition for the aolution

of   (al) is for every element        Ri of the vector    R,




                                [ (U2 U1   1/U1 R1    [
                                                          —    I                           (a4)




                    U2 are the partial derivatives of the function U with respect
where         and                                                                            to
        U1-

the first and second argument, respectively.              The expression for (a4) in terna

of the original tastes parsmeters requires the solution to the functional

equation (al).         Given the assumed preferences, it can be verified that V is an

power function of wealth, and that optimal consumption, in the oase of

logarithmic intertemporal preferences, is just (1-5)               times current wealth.

Using these facts, some algebra establishes that (a4) is equivalent to the

following:

Equation (a5) ia just the first-order condition for the probln of maxirnizing    an

The notation g(e) is used for the various restrictions on the models of
equations (12) (Heteroskedastic, Ger.eral Model) and (13) (Heteroskedaatic,
Constant Correlations).  g(r) indicates that only constant terms are includea;
g(r,A) indicates that constant terms and lagged rate-of-return innovatfons are
included; g(r,A,B) includes all of the above, plus lagged conditional variances,
while g(r,A,B,') stands for the general case, which includes all of the above
plus nomna1 interest rates. See section ii for details on the specification of
conditional covariance matrices. The chi-square statistics test the incremantal
contribution of the last term in each g(') function.
