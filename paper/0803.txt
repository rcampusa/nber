                        Human Capital and Economic Growth



                                    ABSTRACT



     Individuals differ in both inherited and acquired abilities, but only
the latter differ among countries and time periods. Human capital analysis
deals with acquired capabilities which are developed through formal and
informal education at school and at home, and through training, experience,
and mobility in the labor market.
     Just as accumulation of personal human capital produces individual
economic (income) growth, so do the corresponding social or national aggre-
gates. At the national level, human capital can be viewed as a factor
of production coordinate with physical capital. This implies that its
contribution to growth is greater the larger the volume of physical capital
and vice versa. The framework of an aggregate production function shows
also that the growth of human capital is both a condition and a consequence
of economic growth.

     Human capital activities involve not merely the transmission and em—
bodiment in people of available knowledge, but also the production of new
knowledge which is the source of innovation and of technical change which
propels all factors of production. This latter function of human capital
generates worldwide economic growth regardless of its initial geographic
locus.

     Contrary to Malthus, economic growth has not been eliminated by popu-
lation growth. Indeed, spatial and temporal patterns of the "demographic
transition" appear to be congruent with economic growth. Human capital is
a link which enters both the causes and effects of these economic—demographic
changes.

                      HUMAN   CAPITAL AND ECONOMIC GROWTH



I.     Introduction

       As an economic concept human capital is at least two centuries old,

but its incorporation into the mainstream of economic analysis and research

is a new and lively development of the past two decades. The need for this

development became apparent in the 1950's, when the application of empirical

economic research to the concerns about economic growth and about income

distribution revealed major defects not only in our understanding of each

but also in our way of thinking about these matters. Two types of findings

were especially significant:        (1) The observed growth of conventionally

measured inputs of labor and capital was by far smaller than the growth of

output in the U.S. and in other countries for which long time series were

available, and (2) Data on personal income distribution, which began to appear

with greater frequency and detail , showed that the variance of labor incomes,

rather than the "functional" differences between returns to labor and to

capital, represented the major component of personal income inequality.

        The development of human capital theory was a response to these twin

challenges. This response did not require a revolution in economic theory

or a resort to extra—economic explanations which economists sometimes invoke

when answers to pressing questions escape their competence. It merely in-

volved the abolition of two simplifying, but as it turned out unduly inhibit-

ing assumptions: (1) the restriction of the concept of capital to physical

     Mexico City, November 1980.

 capital, even after a more general definition was provided by Irving Fisher,1

 and (2) the assumption of homogeneous labor which underlies both the concept

 of functional income distribution and the measurement of labor input in

manhours.

         Fisher's definition of capital as any asset that gives rise to an

income stream requires the inclusion of human capital, even if it cannot

be. bought and sold (it is, of course, rented), and even though investhent.s

in such capital often involve non—market activities. But non—market acti-

vities are not necessarily extra-economic. To the extent that they involve

costs and returns, whether explicit or implicit, they are amenable to

economic analysis, even if measurement problems are difficult. The con-

tribution of human capital theory to economics does not lie in a reformu-

lation of economic theory, but in pushing back the boundaries of economics

beyond the sphere of market transactions. The payoff is now apparent in

both of the problematic contexts:     (1) At the macroeconomic level, the

social stock of human capital and its growth are central to the process

of economic growth. (2) At the niicroeconomic level, differences in indi-

vidual human capital stocks and in their growth can explain much of the

observed variation in the wage structure and. in the personal distribution

of income.

         The application of the human capital concept to economic growth and

to labor economics were initially pioneered independently.2 The concepts

are the same, and are applied basically to the same problem: individual

economic growth at the micro—level, and growth of the economy at the macro—

level.

II.    Human Capital and Personal Economic Growth

       Individuals differ in both inherited and acquired abilities, but only

the latter clearly differ among countries and time periods. Human capital

analysis deals with acquired capacities which are developed through formal

and informal education at school and at home, and through training, exper-

ience, and mobility in the labor market. The central idea of human capital

theory is that whether deliberate or not, these activities involve costs

and benefits and can, therefore, be analyzed as economic decisions, private

or public. The costs involve direct expenses and earnings or consumption

foregone by students, by trainees, and by workers engaged in labor mobility.

Since production and consumption benefits from these activities accrue

mainly in the future, and are for the most part quite durable, the costly

acquisition of human capacities is an act of investment. Deterioration of

health and erosion or obsolescence of skills represent the depreciation of

human capital which is offset, though not indefinitely, by maintenance

activities such as the production of health and retraining.

       The general categories of human capital investments can be described

in a life—cycle chronology: resources in child care and child development

represent pre—school investments. These overlap and are followed by invest-

ments in formal school education. Investments in labor market mobility,

job choice, job training, and work effort occur during the working life,

while investments in ha1th and other maintenance activities continue

throughout life.


  •   School Education

        Initially, investment in school education has been the subject of

almost exclusive attention by human capital analysts. While economists
                                    -4-




since Adam Smith recognized the importance of education as a type of pri-

vate or social investment, only recently have economists undertaken

rigorous conceptual and statistical examination of the evidence on costs,

returns, and rates of return to education.

         The costs of education borne by the student or his parents consist

not merely of tuition and other school expenditures, but also of foregone

earnings——the loss of what the student could have earned if he had spent

the school years in gainful employment instead. Beyond early schooling,

foregone earnings are the largest component (over a half) of schooling

costs.

         As in the analysis of physical capital   ,   the difference between the

discounted future returns and casts represents the profit or loss on the

investment. Gains do or ought to induce further schooling and losses

discourage it. Another way to represent this decision making process is

to calculate that rate of interest which makes the profit equal to zero,

that is, it makes the investment just about worthwhile. This rate is

called the internal rate of return on the investment; further schooling

is encouraged if the internal rate of return on schooling exceeds the rate

on alternative investments. The advantage of this approach is that while

individual discount rates are not observable, internal rates of return can

be calculated given estimates of costs and of earnings streams. Comparisons

of rates of return to education with rates of return on other (say in busi-

ness capital) investments, can indicate the desirability of existing alloca-

tions or of changes in them, since equality of rates in all types of invest-

ments are required for a social optimum.

         it is understood, of course, that relevant concepts of costs and bene-

fits are real, that is not restricted to pecuniary terms. Education itself
                                 —5—



may be attractive and it may enhancefuture enjoyment of life, apart from

the monetary gain.

      Employers pay higher wages to the more educated workers because their

skill and productivity are seen and experienced as greater than that of less

educated workers. In the absence of strong barriers to supply, the

wage differential translates into a r3te of return com-

parable to those on alternative human or other investments. Increases in

demand favoring more educated workers raise the rate of return on school-

ing, inducing growth of enrollments until the increased return has been

reduced back to an equilibrium level. Autonomous increases in supply,

given no changes in demand, reduce the rate of return to education and thus

become self-limiting. The estimated rates of return to schooling in the

U.S. have remained relatively stable in the past several decades despite

the continuous growth of educational attainment, suggesting that the trend

is mainly a response to the continuous growth of demand for educated labor.

      If financial and social barriers to education are stronger than in

other fields of investment, the rate of return on education exceeds that

on physical capital. Reduction of these barriers brought about by wide-

spread growth of family incomes and by public policy has also been a factor

in the long—term growth of education. As an example, the growth of educa-

tion in the U.S. between 1890 and 1950 was accompanied by a decline in the

rate of return to education, to levels which no longer exceed the return

to business investment.3

     A recent survey of estimates made in 32 countries4 shows that rates

on physical and especially on human capital investments are higher in

developing countries (LDC's) than in the industrialized (DC's). This is
                                  —6—



-'perhaps not surprising as it reflects the greater scarcity of capital in

LX's. More interesting is the finding that, rates of return to human capital

exceed the rates on business capital in LDC's, while if anything the appo-

site appears to be true in the DC's. Evidently, the scarcity of human

capital is significantly greater than the scarcity of physical capital in

the LDC's.5

      The calculations that are available do not include non—pecuniary

or 'consumption   components" of costs or of returns. To the extent that
these are positive and important in the benefits of schooling (an assump-

tion dear to the hearts of educators), the rates are underestimated,

though the pattern of their historical changes need not be affected.

      An important distinction is made between private and social rates.

Thus, in calculating private rates, costs and returns to students and their

families are computed from after-tax data, and schooling costs do not

include public financing of schools.    In contrast, the calculation of

social cost is based on before—tax- earnings, and school costs are total

costs of the relevant school system (per student) regardless of the source

of financing. The real difficulty in calculating social rates of return

is the problem of measuring externalities. To the extent that the gain

to society exceeds the sum of gains to students, social returns are under-

estimated. An assumption of public policy which is difficult to verify

and.to quantify is that such externalities are substantial and positive.

      It is often suggested that these externalities include, among others,

informed and responsible citizenship, comunications skills, lawful behavior,

and standards of health. The existence of such externalities is invoked to

justify public efforts to stimulate educational investments. Such efforts
                                 —7—



can take the form of a publicly owned school system and/or direct

subsidies to students. The extent of required support is always

debatable, as the magnitude of externalities is unknown.

      There are also other reasons for public intervention. This is

the concern with the distribution rather than with the total volume

of educational investnents. Helping children of the poor to acquire

a minimal degree of earning power is an objective for which schooling

is also viewed as an instrument. Since poverty is often viewed as

a relative concept, thefl amount of minimal universal government

supported education has been progressively lengthening as average

education (and income) have increased. It is not always clear, how-

ever, to what extent these policies are efficient in alleviating

poverty. There is some evidence6 that public spending on primary

education tends to be redistributive toward the poor, but that above

that in LDC's, and above secondary education in DC's, the opposite

is likely to be true, on balance, since children of the poor are

less likely to acquire higher education.


2. Post—school Human Capital Investments7

      There is no reason to believe that human capital investments cease

with the termination of schooling. The educated have higher earnings, but

the earnings are not fixed. They grow over the working life, albeit at a

decelerating pace. This growth is additional to, and largely independent

of economy—wide trends in earnings. These patterns of growth also differ

among persons whose education is similar.

     The economic interpretation of lifetime earnings growth is as fol-

lows: Wages of a worker are proportionate to the size of his human capital
                                   -


stock.    Thus, wage differentials among workers are due primarily to dif-

ferencesin human capital stacks, not in the "rental price" employers

pay per unit of the stock. The individual P human capital stock grows

over the life cycleS by means of investment, which is initially in school-

ing, later in job choice, job training, job mobility, and in health. At

any stage, the level of earnings depends on the size and utilization of

the human capital which accumulated up to this point, and its growth depends

on the rate of net additions to the stock, that is, on the net investment

rate. The deceleration in the rate of growth which is observed in indi-

vidual earnings reflects the rate of decline of investments as the worker

ages. Investments diminish over time because (1) benefits decline as the

payoff period (remaining work life) shortens, and (2) the opportunity costs

of time, which is an input in the learning process, are likely to rise over

the working life. While gross investment proceeds at a slackening rate

throughout working life, net investments (gross minus depreciation) vanish

or turn negative earlier. This happens when depreciation (including obso-

lescence) begins to outstrip maintenance, a progression which eventually

brings about retirement.

         An alternative interpretation of the earnings profile is that it is

an intrinsic age phenomenon; initial productivity growth corresponds to

inherent biological and psychological maturation, while later stability

and decline are due tO first stable then declining physical and intellec-

tual vigor.     In the perspective of human capital, this view is incomplete

since it explains the earnings profile solely by a life—cycle pattern of

the depreciation rate, seen as negative in early years, zero in middle

life, and positive in later years. There is evidence, however, which
                                 —9—.




indicates that this inherent age—depreciation factor affects earnings only

to a minor degree, except at teenage and in the near or post-retirement

years; in data where age and length of work experience are statistical ly

separable, levels and shapes of earnings curves are mainly a function of

experience rather than of age. Moreover, earnings profiles differ by

occupation, sex, and other characteristics in systematic ways that cannot

be attributed to agtng.

      One may also interpret the shape of the earnings profile as a

"learning curve," or a reflection of growth of skills with age and exper-

ience known as "learning by doing." This view is not at all inconsistent

with the human capital investment interpretation, as long as opportunities

for learning are not costless. Since more learning, hence a more steeply

rising wage is available in same jobs compared to others, qualified

workers would gravitate to such jobs if learning were thought to be

costless. In consequence, entry wage levels in such jobs would be re-

duced relative to entry wages elsewhere, for workers of the same quality,

thereby creating opportunity investment costs in moving to such jobs.

Thus, it is not merely training on the job (formal or informal), but also

the processes of occupational choice that give rise to investments beyond

schooling. Similarly, geographic mobility and other labor turnover in

search of higher real earnings represent investments in human capital

      It follows that barriers to occupational choice and to job

mobility reduce the opportunities for investment in human capital. The

elimination of such barriers increases individual economic growth and

the overall efficiency of allocation of resources in the economy,

hence total product.
                                 —10—




     Empirical economic research indicates that the relation between

schooling and post—school investment is positive: More educated people

invest more in the labor market. One interpretation is that ability and

opportunity factors which induce individuals to have more schooling affect

their post—school behavior similarly, even though the correlation is far

from strict: Abilities and opportunities change over the life—cycle,

and there is a fair amount of substitution between the two forms of skill

accumulation. Another interpretation is that schooling improves the effi-

ciency with which people can absorb learning on the jab, leading thereby

to greater job investments. This hypothesis is consistent, in a dynamic

context, with evidence on the so—called "worker allocative effect" pro-

pounded by Schultz (1976) and Welch (l97a). Their proposition that educa-

tion promotes the adjustment to technological change has been documented,

mainly in studies of agricultural production activities. The more limited

macro-economic evidence of a positive relation between rates of return to

schooling and.rates of economic growth is also suggestive.9


3. Preschool Investments and Women's Education

      Inherited abilities, or what is called the 'original" endowment is

an important part of the human capital stock, yet the line between heredity

and Environment is by rio means clear. Much of the physical and intellec-

tual deficiency shown by infants born in poor conditions can be avoided

by improved nutrition of mothers and sanitary environments for childbirth.

Similarly, subsequent child care represents an investment in better adult

health and so in greater productivity of the adult worker.

      Especially In low income countries, the effects of a healthier child

rearing on adult productivity are double: Not only is a healthier adult
                                 —11—




more productive but he also lives longer10 Consequently, the incentives

to invest in lengthier schooling and training increase, since with the

lengthened payoff period, the profitability of such investments increases.

Thus, it is inappropriate to view reductions in mortality with alarm as a

cause of the "population explosion." The mitigating effects on population

growth and improvements in work quality eventually predominate, since

the costs of investing in child quality, including health and education,

represent a powerful force toward reduction of family size; given the

families' limited resources. Indeed, research has shown that even at the

same level of family income, children in smaller families tend to be

healthier, more intelligent and better educated.

      Much of the accumulation of a person's human capital takes Ølace

in the home, particularly during the pre—school stage of the life—cycle.

It appears that education of parents is a significant influence in this

process, even after controlling for family income and numbers of siblings.

This suggests that aside from expenditures on schooling and health,

child care is also an important qualitative input into the production

of human capital. The time inputs are usually those of the

mothers who take the major child care responsibilities and reduce their

market activities to engage in them. The consequent reduction in their

earnings may be viewed as a partial measure of opportunity costs of these

investments. So viewed, the opportunity cost o ehild care is greater, for

more educated women. The observed positive effects on children's health,

intelligence, education and future earning power may thus be viewed as an

indirect return on the investment in maternal education.

     An important consequence of the larger opportunity cost per unitof
                                          —12—



time spent in child care by more educated mothers is the reduction of total

time so spent. This is accomplished largely by•a reduction in the number

of children. The strong inverse relation between fertility and education

of mothers has been documented repeatedly. Thus the growth of women1s edu-

cation and of their wages induces declines in fertility coupled with in-

creased investments in the resultant smaller number of children per family.

          Since, in most countries, evsi educated women spend less time in the

labor market than men, the direct earnings benefits of education are smaller

for women. From this point of view, It might seem that the provision of

equal amounts of education to both sexes is wasteful .      However, if better
educated mothers produce greater human capital In children and a better

quality of family life, apart from contributing to family money income,

educational equality need not be questioned. Indeed, it is rarely questioned

as a matter of public policy.

          It appears, however, that private schooling decisions are still very

much influenced by the expected participation in the labor market, and

therefore by the directly expected payoff in earnings.       In the U.S. sex

differentials in enrollment now appear only at the postgraduate university

III. Human Capital and National Economic Growth

      1. Human Capital as a Factor of Production. The micro—economic

analysis of investilent in human capital is the underpinning of our under-

standing of the contribution of human capital to the aggregate level of

income and to its rate of growth. The micro—economic view is most directly

applicable to the analysis of labor heterogeneity and of the resulting

wage structure. Given sufficient labor mobility, wages tend to be simi-

lar for the same human capital stock in various employments, regardless

of differences in size and quality of other factors of production in

such employments. Equilibrium wage differentials within the economy may

therefore be viewed as reflecting solely differences in individual magni-

tudes of human capital stocks. Although international mobility of labor

is not negligible and it mitigates somewhat the disparities in wages of the

same human capital in different countries, national wage levels' differ because

of differences in volumes of human capital as well as of other forms of

capital. For the understanding of macro—economic differences in levels

and in growth of income It is best to start with the view of human capital

as a factor of production alongside physical capital in an aggregate

production function

      The traditional trinity of factors of production contained land

viewed as fixed, "original and indestructible," labor measured in numbers

and hours, and capital •restricted to tangible plant and equipment. It is

now well recognized that this conception is false. The notion of a quantity

of land as a fixed factor of production has already been discarded prior to

the realization that the measurement of labor in manhours is entirely inade-

quate. As T. W. Schultz has emphasizedl2differerices in amount and "original

quality" of arable land (in terms of land—population ratios) do not at all
                                 -14-



neip in accounting for differences in income levels among countries. Exper-

ience and research have shown that it is not the quantity and the original

endowment of land, so much as the improvement or modernization of agri-

culture that matters. Inferior raw lands and even deserts have been trans-

formed into superior productive resources, while total acreage declined.

Investment in modernization of agriculture is a capital investment, and

the capital nature of land is now fully recognized.

      The capital nature of the sources of labor services is now also re-

ceiving its proper recognition. The inadequacy of the traditional view

of labor in the field of growth accounting is well known. But the biases

went beyond description to affect policy: The misunderstanding of the

nature of expenditures on health, education, labor mobility, and informa-

tion as consumption which reduces saving lead to investments in steel

mills rather than in people.

      Land, by itself, is no longer a limiting or critical factor. But

the quality and behavior of people is increasingly recognized as such.

Indeed, it appears that indexes of human capital, such as average levels

of education, are more strongly correlated with average income levels
                                                                        13
across countries than measures of physical capital per unit of labor.

Although suggestive, this finding is not conclusive since the demand for

education as a consumer good is income elastic. In this sense, education

is an effect rather than a cause of income. The role of education as a

cause, however, is evident from the micro—economic findings that the rela-

tion between education of persons and their own future income is strong

and largely unaffected by parental income, even though parents' income

does affect the amount of education their children receive.14
                                  —15—



       Some critics question the inference that education increases pro-

ductivity from the observation that it increases wages, and still others

assert that schools do not affect skills but serve merely as a filter to

sort differences in ability which exist independently of schooling. If

so the micro—economic relation between education and income would not

carry over to the economy as a whole. This argument is contradicted by

research: Studies of empirical production functions have shown that not

only differences in wage rates but differences in productivity are related

to differences in education and training of the labor force across states,

regions, and over time.15

       This is not to say that the screening or sorting function of educa-

tion is unimportant or unproductive. Indeed, the search for talent by

the school and by the student are activities no less productive than the

search for any other scarce natural resource. Human capital is augmented

both by learning and by selection. The interaction of the two is efficient:

The more able student learns more at the same cost.

       The view of human capital as a factor of production coordinate with

physical capital implies that its contribution to growth is greater the

larger the volume of physical capital. This relation is symmetric: The

contribution of physical capital is larger the higher the average level of

human capital. In this light, the success of the Marshall Plan in Europe

and the failure of foreign aid to LDC's are perhaps not surprising. To

quote Harry Johnson: "Europe had available the industrial and comercial

organization, and the skilled people required for modern industry; what it

lacked was precisely physical capital which was largely destroyed or obsolete.

The problem of LDC's was different: They lacked virtually everything
                                  —16—



necessary for a higher standard of economic productivity, and the injection

of only one element (physical capital).was found to be both wasteful and

disappointing."16

       For the more recent period the problem of absorption of massive

amounts of physical capital in the human capital—poor OPEC countries is

another example of the significance of compiementarity between the two

forms of capital. But, while physical plant and equipment can be acquired

or built quite rapidly, the development of a significant and broadly based

level of human capital of a nation is a lengthy process which involves

profound social and cultural changes)7

       The framework of an aggregate production function makes it clear

that the growth of human capital is both a condition and a consequence of

economic growth. The growth of human capital raises the marginal product

of physical capital which induces further accumulation of physical capital

thus raising total output both directly and indirectly. Conversely and

symmetrically, the growth of physical capital raises the marginal product

of human capital. This produces an increased demand for human capital

relative to unskilled labor, if human capital is more complementary with

physical capital than is unskilled labor)8 The resulting increase in the

skill wage differential exceeds the increase in (opportunity) costs, so

the acquisition of human capital by students and workers becomesrnore pro-

fitable. As already indicated, the continuous long—term growth of human

capital in the U.S. and elsewhere is consistent with this interpretation of

supply responses to growing demand.

      The differential shifts in demand forskilled and unskilled labor

implied by the complementarity hypothesis also tend to produce the well known
                                   —17-




skill differentials in unemployment rates, observable in most countries

which experience economic growth. The greater cyclical stability of

employment of skilled labor is also consistent with the hypothesis that      -




skilled   labor is complementary with fixed plant and equipment. Actually,

recent research suggests that both wages and employment of skilled labor

are relatively insensitive to the business cycle, because human capital

acquired on the job contains elements of finn specificity which make

separations unprofitable to both workers and firms)9

       Growth of human capital is also spurred on the supply side by

growth of family incomes. Since markets for financing of human capital

investJnts do not exist, growth of income enables larger numbers of

people to self-finance their human capital investments. In poor countries,

these financial restrictions create monopolistic advantages for the children

of the wealthy, and high rates of return on human capital. Both are reduced

by the spread of education made possible by growing incomes. However,

human capital growth due to growth of family incomes is eventually self—

limiting, when rates of return become sufficiently depressed in consequence

of "overeducation.' Public subsidies are also self-limiting in the same

sense, and they may become unprofitable from a social point of view (when

the social rate of return on human capital drops below the corresponding

rate on physical capital) before they inhibit private incentives. It fol-

lows that for a sustained growth of human capital we must look to increasing

market demands for skills and technology.

       2. Human   Capital   and Technology1 Although the effects of human

capital growth and some of its causes can be described in the framework of

an aggregate production function in which technology is fixed, few will argue

against the view that growth of technology Is the ultimate force which propels

all factors of production by increasing their productivity. A fixed tech-

nology may be maintained for analytical convenience by viewing all technical

change as embodied in human and in physical capital.2° Whether or not such

a device is purely semantic, I think it is helpful to distinguish between

the stock of human capital as a standard factor of production and the stock

of knowledge as the source of technology. Human capital activities involve

not merely the transmission and embodiment of available knowledge in people,

but also the production of new knowledge which is the source of innovation

and of technical change. Without new knowledge, it is doubtful that larger

quantities of existing physical capital, more widespread education and health would

create a continous growth in productivity on a global scale.    In a fundamental

sense, modern economic growth is a result of the scientific revolution,

that is, of the growth of systematized scientific knowledge.

       The geographic origin and spread of the industrial revolution since

the 18th Century supports this view and the pivotal role of human capital

in generating and facilitating it. The industrial revolution started with

the scientific revolution in the Northwest of Europe and spread most rapidly

to those areas where educational development has made the transfer of tech-

nology most feasible.

       It is clear now that the process of growth and diffusion is worldwide.

Human capital as embodiment of skills is a convenient conceptualization of

its role as coordinate factor of production in its contribution to national

economic growth. Human capital as a source of new knowledge shifts production
                                   —19—




functions upward and generates woriwide economic growth.

        Even though "knowledge knows no boundaries," its utilization requires

local adaptation which is more costly the more dissimilar ("distant") the

economies and societies to which it is transmitted. Moreover, as technical

progress continues, the slower the diffusion the wider the technological

gap between the initiators and the "latecomers." Consequently, the capacity

to absorb and to adapt new technology requires an increasingly specialized

and   sophisticated labor force backed by a broadly educated population.
For reasons that certainly make sense in the technology exporting countries,
the imported modern technology is capital and skill intensive. Thus, problems
of "labor absorption" are added to the difficul ties of absorbing modern
technology.21
         Yet, the disadvantages of factor bias are transcended by the advan-
tages of being able to skip several generations of technology in a short
time. At any rate, it is only the most modern technology that is truly

available. Older vintages which may be more labor intensive are not usable

without complementary or ancillary industries which are obsolete. Even if

the initial effects on the creation of highly productive employment are

relatively small, the simultaneous adaptation of human capital by job

training and some job redesign can help to widen the process. Initially,

the pressure of modernization is most acutely felt at the highest education

levels: specialized scientists, technicians and researchers are needed to

adopt, master, and modify the new technologies. But only widespread educa-

tional growth, especially at basic levels of literacy and numeracy can lead

from islands of modernity to a complete transformation of the economy.22

 111.   Human Capital and Population

        According to Malthus, economic growth can only be sporadic: It is

self-defeating, since it produces population growth which in turn swallows

all the gains. This theory has long been contradicted by empirical evidence.

The notion that this hypothesis may be applicable to LDC's which was enter-

tained by some is also being discredited by events.    Economic growth has not

been eliminated by rapid population growth in    these countries.

                                 Moreover, the patterns of population change

associated with the "demographic transition' in the West are now being

visibly repeated in the rest of the world?3 Indeed, the congruence of

spatial and temporal patterns of economic growth and demographic change

suggest an important interaction between the two. Human capital is a link

which enters both the causes and effects of
                                              economic-demographic changes.

        Human capital, or population quality, was left out of Malthusian

theory. The theory actually omits any economic motivation. It presents

a strictly biological view of mortality as a mechanism which adjusts

numbers of people to available resources. The contrary facts of economic

growth and of the demographic transition have led to a reformulation of

population theory in terms of parental decisions about numbers and

"quality of children."24 In primitive, premodern regimes of very high

mortality, especially in an agricultural setting, unlimited fertility may

be viewed as a rational- response, which is also (or therefore?) culturally

sanctioned. Declines in mortality, brought about by publichealth measures

or by higher levels of living bring about the need for family size decisions,

given the family's limited resources. Implicitly such decisions must con-

sider both material and 'psychic' costs and returns from children. Intentio
                                  -21—




about human capital formation in children, or child 'quality" play a part

in the decision. Given the family budget, resources spent on "quality"

compete with the number of children the family might otherwise want.

This trade—off becomes pronounced in the context of economic growth

which raises the payoff to human capital formation.

       In the West, mortality reductions initially resulted in increased

fertility but after a long lag, they were followed by fertility declines.

Surviving average family size grew initially, but eventually declined to

the present-day low levels. Roughly speaking, family size begins to de-

cline when fertility rates drop more sharply than mortality rates.

Although even exogenous declines in mortality tend to induce declines in

fertility, it appears that for birth rates to fall more than death rates,

the additional stimuli of economic growth and of widespread education are

necessary.

       This generalization is supported both by the history of DC's and

by current experience inLDC's. An intercountry analysis of changes during

the past decade (1965—1975) in Latin America25 showed that declines in

birth rates were positively related to declines in death rates, but the

declines in births were steeper than the declines in deaths only in coun-

tries whose rates were above average during the decade and educational

enrollments of the population aged 5-14 were significantly above average

at the outset. The regression analysis shows that at a rate of 2% growth

of per capita income the enrollment rate must be at least 80%, to gen—

erate a reduction in family size. With a growth rate of 3%, the minimum

enrollment rate is 60%.
                                      -22-


        But what is there in the process of economic and educational growth that

makes   incipient   incentives toward reductions in family size widespread, effective,

and progressive? In a way, the emergence of strong growth implies that some

of the cultural inhibitions to rationalism have already weakened. More directly,

economic theory contains three implications of economic growth which point to

deliberate reductions in family size:        (1) urbanization, (2) the rising cost

of time, and (3) educational growth:

        (1) Since demands for agricultural products are relatively income and

price inelastic, the growth of productivity reduces the demand for farm laboy,

which in turn flocks to cities in search of employment and higher wages. With

children less productive and more costly to raise in the city than on the farm,

incentives of migrants to limit family size are strong.

        (2) The growth of wages in the labor market attracts people from non—

market activities (households and subsistence sectors) to the labor market. Tq

the extent that child—rearing is a time—intensive activity, increases in market

wages represent a rising foregone cost of time spent in child care rather than

in gainful work. Therefore, incentives of women to limit family size and to

enter (or stay in) the labor market appear and grow. This is especially true

of educated women, since opportunity costs increase with education. A strong

negative correlation between education of mothers and family size has been

widely documented.26

        (3) With growing incomes and industrial demands for literate, dis-

ciplined, and skilled labor, both private and public demands for education

increase. At the family level ,    the demands for prolonged education of
children represent an additional incentive to substitute "quality" for

the quantity of children, as the reduction in numbers of children increases
                                 -23—



the available family resources, per child. The inducement•to invest in

quality and in greater future earning capacity_of the children is strengthened

by increased life expectancy as it constitutes a lengthened "pay—off period'

on the investments. In turn, when the educated children become parents, they

tend to have more favorable attitudes and more infonnation about birth control

behavior and greater demands for education and health of their children.

       In sum, we should expect growing urbanization, education, female labor

force participation, and declining family size to follow economic growth.

Such trends are, indeed, widely observed under conditions of sustained

economic growth, although intensities and time lags in these processes can

and do differ from one setting to the next. For example, growing market

wages may induce women into the labor market without reducing their fer-

tility, if the extended family and cheap domestic service can help in

child rearing, and if the nature of work, such as farming or cottage indus-

try are not incompatible with the immediate presence of children. Also, for

a time, growth of wages may reduce fertility without increasing the labor

force: This happens when women employed in the occupations just described

including domestic service move to better paid factory work. All the same,

the extended family institution and the occupations compatible with uninter-

rupted mother's child care eventually decline as incomes and education con-

tinue to grow, and all the predicted effects become apparent as they do in

the industrially developed countries.

       The significance of these demographic events for the quality of

labor is twofold:

       (1) High birth rates imply an age distribution of the population

heavily weighted toward youth. For example close to one—half of the Mexican
                                   —24—



population is less than 15 years of age. This represents a heavy burden on

the economy, since the consumption and educational needs of the young popu-

lation are paramount, and their economic contribution small .   Continuation
of declines             in birth rates will change the age distribution

toward a more productive labor supply.




       (2) Beyond improving he quality of the labor force via changes in

age distribution, reductions in the size of large families apparently also

affect educational progress, as was already alluded. Families with fewer

children can more readily afford educational expenditures. If the frequency

of large families is greater among the poor, the induced demographic changes

have important positive effects on the future distribution of income and on

social mobility.




       In this brief exposition it was not possible to do more than sketch

the theory and allude to some of the empirical research which documents the

vital and manifold roleof human capital formation in personal, national,

and global economic development.   I think it is fair to conclude that even

if substantial levels of human capital may not be a prerequisite for an accelera-

tion of economic growth at a certain time and place, the concurrent growth and

diffusion of human capital appear to be necessary to insure sustained economic

development.

Table 5.3, p. 86 shows that in a sample of countries whose per capita

income was under $1,000 in the early 1960's, the average rate of return

on education was 19.9% and on physical capital 15.1%.       In countries with

higher income, the educational rate of return was 8.3% while the rate on

physical capital was 10.5%. An estimate for Mexico at about that time

was 21.9% for education and 14.0% for business capital. These estimates

appear in Martin Carnoy "Rates of Return to Schooling in Latin America,"

The Journal of Human Resources, Summer 1967.

     5.   Indeed, ir a recent meticulous study, "Perspectives on Capital

and Technology in Less—Developed Countries" (1978), Arnold Harberger

shows that around 1970 rates of return (social or private) on physical

capital no longer differed between advanced and less developed countries.

One may speculate that the growth of international investments has led

to this result. Does this mean that physical capital is no longer scarce
                                      —26—



in developing countries? Not at all, its quantity is still limited by

the scarcity of human capital: An increase in the latter will raise

the rate of return on the fonner, increasing the demand for it until

marginal returns on both fonns of capital have equalized.

and labor in proportions that are very similar to those employed in the

advanced economies.' His own estimates show that modern sectors are

in advanced economies.
