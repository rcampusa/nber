Individual Versus Aggregate Collateral Constraints and the Overborrowing Syndrome

                                            ABSTRACT

This paper compares the equilibrium dynamics of an economy facing an aggregate collateral
constraint on external debt to the dynamics of an economy facing a collateral constraint imposed at
the level of each individual agent. The aggregate collateral constraint is intended to capture an
environment in which foreign investors base their lending decisions predominantly upon macro
indicators as opposed to individual abilities to pay. Individual agents do not internalize the aggregate
borrowing constraint. Instead, in this economy a country interest-rate premium emerges to clear the
financial market. The central finding of the paper is that the economy with the aggregate borrowing
limit does not generate higher levels of debt than the economy with the individual borrowing limit.
That is, there is no overborrowing in equilibrium.

1     Introduction
A central question in emerging-market macroeconomics is what factors lead countries to
accumulate excessive levels of external debt. This question is of relevance because periods
of abnormally large capital inflows to emerging markets are more often than not followed
by sudden reversals in capital flows, sharp contractions in aggregate activity, exchange-rate
collapses, and banking crises (see, for instance, Calvo et al. 2004).
    Before the 1990s, existing theoretical explanations of overborrowing emphasize domestic
policy failures. McKinnon’s (1973) model of deposit guarantees, for example, has been
intensively used to understand the effects of financial liberalization in the Southern Cone of
Latin America in the 1970s. In McKinnon’s model, deposit guarantees induce moral hazard,
as banks tend to undertake immoderately risky projects and depositors have less incentives
to monitor the quality of banks’ loan portfolios. As a result deposit guarantees open the
door to excessive lending and increase the likelihood of generalized bank failures.
   A second theory of overborrowing that stresses domestic policy imperfections is the tem-
porariness hypothesis due to Calvo (1986). Under this theory, an economic reform, if per-
ceived as temporary by economic agents, can induce a suboptimal boom-bust cycle in capital
inflows. Consider, for instance, a temporary reduction in import tariffs. To take advantage
of the transitory nature of the trade reform, agents will tend to substitute current spend-
ing for future spending, generating current account deficits while the new policy is in effect
and a current account reversal when the policy is abandoned. The temporariness hypothe-
sis has been influential in explaining failed trade and financial liberalizations and inflation
stabilizations in Latin America in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
   the debt crisis of the early 1980s was followed by almost a decade of dry credit conditions
for emerging markets. This situation came to an end in the early 1990s when capital flows to
the region resumed with vigor. The increased external borrowing was accompanied by large
trade imbalances, real-exchange-rate appreciation, and expansion in the nontraded sector.
As in the 1980s, this expansionary phase came to an end traumatically, Starting with Mexico
in the mid 1990s a number of countries in Latin America, Asia, and eastern Europe faced
a sudden discontinuation of capital inflows, reversals in trade flows, large depreciations,
significant drops in aggregate activity, and financial stress.
    Although domestic policy mismanagement is not ruled out as a factor behind the lat-
est generation of economic crises, researchers, policymakers, and economic observers have
increasingly emphasized the role played by foreign lenders. Ferri, Liu, and Stiglitz (1999),
for instance, argue that credit rating agencies, such as Standard and Poor’s and Moody’s,
were too procyclical in their rating behavior of emerging-market debt in the 1990s, particu-


                                              1
larly in Asia. These authors argue that credit-rating companies were too quick in massively
upgrading Asian debt during the period of capital inflows and equally quick in massively
downgrading the same assets during the contractionary phase. Because international lend-
ing, particularly by institutional investors, is highly sensitive to credit ratings, credit-rating
agencies exacerbated the boom-bust cycle in Asia in the 1990s.
   More generally, it is argued that emerging markets tend to overborrow when the lending
decisions of foreign financial institutions are guided by aggregate indicators of the emerging
country’s macroeconomic performance and not by careful assessment of individual borrowers’
abilities to repay. When lending is based on aggregate indicators overborrowing occurs
because individual agents fail to internalize the effect their own borrowing decisions have
on the country’s aggregate credit conditions. Overborrowing, it is argued, makes emerging
countries prone to balance-of-payments crises, or sudden stops, and calls for government
policy aimed at putting sand in the wheels of external finance.
   The contribution of this paper is to investigate whether lending practices based on ag-
gregate indicators indeed lead emerging countries to overborrow. To this end, I characterize
the equilibrium dynamics of a small open economy subject to an aggregate borrowing con-
straint. I have in mind a situation in which foreign lenders lack the ability or the incentives
to monitor individual investment projects in the emerging country and instead base their
lending decisions on observation of a few macroeconomic indicators, such as total external
debt or domestic stock prices. Individual agents do not internalize the credit constraint. I
assume that in this economy credit rationing is implemented through a market mechanism.
Specifically, when the aggregate debt limit is reached, an interest-rate premium emerges in
the domestic economy inducing individual borrowing decisions to be collectively compatible
with the aggregate credit constraint. I compare the equilibrium dynamics of this economy to
those of an economy in which the borrowing limit is imposed at the level of each individual
agent.
   The specific question that my investigation aims to address is whether the economy
with the aggregate debt limit tends to overborrow relative to the economy with debt lim-
its imposed at the level of each individual agent. I find that there is no overborrowing in
equilibrium. That is, the equilibrium distribution of external debt is the same under an ag-
gregate borrowing limit and under an individual borrowing limit. The reason is that in the
economy with the aggregate credit constraint, market incentives, conveyed by the interest
rate, induce individual saving decisions that are identical to those caused by the imposition
of agent-specific debt limits. The no-overborrowing result holds under two alternative speci-
fications of the debt limit: one in which debt is limited by a constant, and one in which debt
is limited by a fraction of the market value of domestic assets.


                                                2
    Two features of models with debt limits are key in generating no overborrowing. One
feature is that when the debt constraint is internalized the opportunity cost of funds is in-
dependent of the household’s debt position, even for levels of debt arbitrarily close to the
ceiling. Only when the debt constraint is binding does the shadow cost of loans adjust up-
wards. The second theoretical feature that is important in generating the no-overborrowing
result is that when the debt limit binds, it does so for all agents at the same time.
    I present two theoretical examples showing that once any of the aforementioned two
features are absent aggregate debt limits may induce overborrowing in equilibrium. In one
example, agents are heterogeneous in their endowments, allowing for the possibility that
not all households be financially constrained at the same time. In the second example,
households face an interest-rate schedule that is increasing in the external debt position, as
in models of sovereign debt à la Eaton and Gersowitz (1981).
    The remainder of the paper is organized in six sections. Section 2 presents a simple
model of a small open economy facing an aggregate borrowing ceiling. Section 3 presents
an economy where the borrowing ceiling is imposed at the individual level. Section 4 es-
tablishes analytically the central result of no overborrowing. It shows that when rents from
financial rationing accrue to domestic residents, the equilibrium dynamics in the economy
with the aggregate debt limit and in the economy with the individual debt limit are identical.
Section 5 studies the case in which rents from financial rationing accrue to foreign lenders.
In this case, the economies with an individual and an aggregate debt limit can no longer
be compared analytically. However, I establish numerically the absence of overborrowing.
Section 6 analyzes an economy where external debt is limited by the market value of a do-
mestically owned asset. In this environment the credit limit is time varying and becomes
tighter when the market price of domestic assets falls. Section 7 puts the no-overborrowing
result in perspective and explores modifications to the basic framework capable of inducing
overborrowing in the presence of aggregate debt limits.


2     An Economy With An Aggregate Borrowing Ceiling


Consider an economy populated by a large number of identical households with preferences
defined over consumption of a perishable good, ct , and labor effort, ht , and described by the
utility function
                                       X∞
                                    E0     θt U (ct , ht ),                                 (1)
                                         t=0




                                               3
where U denotes the period utility function, which is assumed to be increasing in its first
argument, decreasing in its second argument, strictly concave, and twice continuously dif-
ferentiable. To ensure that the deterministic steady state is independent of the initial as-
set position, I adopt the standard practice in modeling small open economies of assuming
that the subjective rate of discount is a function of endogenous variables (see, for instance,
Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe, 2003, and the references cited therein). Specifically, let θ0 = 1 and
θt /θt−1 = β(Ct, Ht ), where Ct and Ht denote, respectively, aggregate consumption and hours
worked. The function β is assumed to be decreasing in its first argument and increasing in
its second argument. The household takes the evolution of Ct and Ht as given. The choice of
aggregate variables as arguments of the discount factor simplifies the household’s optimality
conditions. It will become clear that the central result of this paper is robust to assuming
that the discount factor is a function of the individual levels of consumption and effort.
   Output, denoted yt , is produced with a technology that takes labor as the only input.
Production is subject to an aggregate, exogenous productivity shock denoted by zt . Formally,
yt = ezt F (ht). The production function F is assumed to be positive, strictly increasing, and
strictly concave. Allowing for capital accumulation would not alter the main results of the
paper.
   The only financial asset available to households is a risk-free international bond. The
household’s sequential budget constraint is given by

                                  at+1
                                       = at + ct − ezt F (ht ),                            (2)
                                   Rt

where at denote debt due in period t, and Rt denotes the gross interest rate on assets held
between periods t and t + 1. Households are assumed to be subject to a no-Ponzi-game
                                  a
constraint of the form limj→∞ Et Qj t+j+1
                                       R
                                          ≥ 0.
                                    s=0   t+s
   The household’s problem consists in choosing contingent plans ct, ht , and at+1 so as to
maximize (1) subject to (2) and the no-Ponzi-game constraint, given the processes Rt and zt
and the initial condition a0 . The first-order conditions associated with this problem are (2),
the no-Ponzi-game constraint holding with equality, and

                                       Uh (ct , ht )
                                   −                 = ezt F 0(ht),                        (3)
                                       Uc (ct , ht)

                          Uc (ct , ht) = β(Ct, Ht )Rt Et Uc (ct+1 , ht+1 ).

   Foreign lenders impose an aggregate borrowing limit on the domestic economy, which
stipulates that the aggregate per capita level of external liabilities assumed by the country



                                                  4
in any period t ≥ 0, which I denote by At+1 , be no greater than a ceiling κ > 0. That is,

                                           At+1 ≤ κ.

Foreign lenders take the evolution of the country’s external debt At as given. They interpret
this variable as an indicator of the strength of the country’s fundamentals and are willing to
lend funds to domestic residents without restrictions as long as the country’s external debt
is below the threshold κ. Individual domestic households also take the evolution of At as
exogenous.
   In periods in which the aggregate borrowing ceiling is not binding, foreign investors lend
to domestic residents at the world interest rate, which is assumed to be constant and equal
to R∗ > 1. When the aggregate borrowing limit is binding, the domestic interest rate may
adjust upward to ensure market clearing in the domestic financial market. In this case, the
economy faces a country interest-rate premium equal to Rt − R∗ . It follows that Rt must
satisfy Rt ≥ R∗ and (Rt − R∗ )(At+1 − κ) = 0.


2.1    The Rents From Financial Rationing
When the domestic interest rate, Rt , is above the world interest rate, R∗ , a financial rent
is generated. Values of Rt above R∗ create pure rents because in this economy there is no
default in equilibrium by assumption. The precise way in which these rents are allocated will
in general have consequences for aggregate dynamics. Here, I consider two polar cases: on
in which all financial rents accrue to foreign lenders, and one in which financial rents accrue
entirely to domestic residents.
   When financial rents are appropriated by nonresidents, increases in the domestic interest
rate entail a resource cost to the domestic economy as a whole. This cost is reflected in an
aggregate resource constraint of the form At+1/Rt = At + Ct − ezt F (Ht). Note that this
expression features the domestic interest rate, Rt , instead of the world interest rate, R∗ .
   Alternatively, rents from credit rationing may accrue to domestic residents when, possibly
because of competition among foreign lenders, domestic financial intermediaries borrow in
the world financial market at the rate R∗ . Thus, the country interest-rate premium represents
a net rent to domestic financial institutions. I assume that these rents are distributed in a
lump-sum fashion among domestic households, who own the domestic financial institutions
in equal shares. In this case, the existence of an interest-rate premium does not introduce a
resource cost to the domestic economy. The aggregate resource constraint is therefore given
by At+1 /R∗ = At + Ct − ezt F (Ht). Note that this expression features the world interest rate,
R∗ , instead of the domestic interest rate, Rt .

                                                   5
   Because households are homogeneous, in equilibrium individual and aggregate per capita
variables are identical. That is Ct = ct , Ht = ht , and At = at. We are ready to define a
competitive equilibria when financial rents accrue to domestic lenders:

Definition 1 (Equilibrium When Rents Accrue Domestically) A stationary compet-
itive equilibrium under an aggregate borrowing ceiling when rents from financial rationing
accrue to domestic residents is a set of stationary stochastic processes {ct , ht , at+1, Rt }∞
                                                                                              t=0
satisfying
                             Uc (ct , ht ) = β(ct, ht )Rt Et Uc (ct+1 , ht+1 ),                 (4)
                                          Uh (ct , ht )
                                      −                 = ezt F 0(ht),                          (5)
                                          Uc (ct , ht)
                                                Rt ≥ R∗ ,                                       (6)

                                                at+1 ≤ κ,                                       (7)

                                     (Rt − R∗ )(at+1 − κ) = 0,                                  (8)
                                    at+1
                                         = at + ct − ezt F (ht ),                               (9)

given the process {zt}∞
                      t=0   and the initial condition a0 .

   Similarly, competitive equilibria when financial rents accrue to foreign lenders is defined
as follows:

Definition 2 (Equilibrium When Rents Accrue to Foreigners) A stationary compet-
itive equilibrium under an aggregate borrowing ceiling when rents from financial rationing
accrue to foreign lenders is a set of stationary stochastic processes {ct , ht , at+1 , Rt }∞
                                                                                            t=0 sat-
isfying conditions (4)-(8) and the resource constraint

                                     at+1
                                          = at + ct − ezt F (ht ),                             (10)

given the process {zt}∞
                      t=0 and the initial condition a0 .


I postpone the characterization of equilibrium in these economies until I described equilib-
rium in an economy with an internalized borrowing limit.

3     An Economy With An Individual Borrowing Ceiling


Suppose now that lenders impose a debt ceiling at the level of each individual household.
That is,
                                                    at+1 ≤ κ.                             (11)

Unlike in the economy with the aggregate debt ceiling, in this economy domestic agents
internalize the borrowing constraint. As a result, they take this constraint into account in
determining the intertemporal allocation of consumption and financial assets. Accordingly,
the household problem consists in maximizing (1) subject to (2) and (11). The optimality
conditions associated with this problem are (2), (3), (11), and
                                             
                                       1

                                                      ξt ≥ 0,

                                                (at+1 − κ)ξt = 0,

where ξt denotes the Lagrange multiplier associated with the debt constraint (11) divided by
the marginal utility of consumption. When ξt is strictly positive, the debt ceiling is binding
and the household faces a shadow interest rate given by Rt /(1 − Rt ξt ), which is greater than
the market interest rate Rt . This shadow interest rate reflects the fact that at the market
interest rate the household would like to borrow beyond the limit κ.
    Foreign lenders supply funds to domestic residents at the world interest rate, R∗ . There-
fore, Rt equals R∗ at all dates and states. The following definition of a competitive equilib-
rium then applies:

                      t=0   and the initial condition a0 .

We are ready to compare equilibrium dynamics under aggregate and individual debt limits.


4    An Equivalence Result
This establishes that the equilibrium processes for debt, consumption, hours, and output
in the economy with an individual debt ceiling and in the economy with an aggregate debt
ceiling with rents from financial rationing accruing to domestic households are identical. To
this end, consider the economy with an individual debt constraint. Definition 3 lists the
equilibrium conditions corresponding to this economy. Equations (12) and (14) together
with the fact that Uc (ct , ht ) > 0 imply that ξt ∈ [0, 1/R∗ ). Define

                                                       R∗
                                             Rt =             .
                                                    1 − R∗ ξt

Clearly, ξt > 0 iff Rt > R∗ , and ξt = 0 iff Rt = R∗ . Use the definition of Rt to eliminate ξt
from equilibrium conditions (12), (14), and (16). It follows immediately that the equilibrium
conditions of the economy with an individual debt ceiling can be written as:

                             Uc (ct , ht ) = β(ct, ht )Rt Et Uc (ct+1 , ht+1 ),

                                          Uh (ct , ht )
                                      −                 = ezt F 0(ht),
                                          Uc (ct , ht)
                                                Rt ≥ R∗ ,

                                                at+1 ≤ κ,

                                   (Rt − R∗ )(at+1 − κ) = 0,
                                  at+1
                                       = at + ct − ezt F (ht ).
                                   R∗
These expressions are identical to the equilibrium conditions pertaining to the economy with
an aggregate debt limit and rents accruing to domestic households, given by equations (4)-
(9). As a result, the equilibrium behavior of at , ct , and ht are identical in the economy with
an individual debt ceiling and in the economy with an aggregate debt ceiling and financial
rents owned domestically.


                                                     8
   We conclude that in the economic environment studied here the practice by foreign
investors of basing their lending decisions on macroeconomic indicators, as opposed to indi-
vidual solvency indicators, does not induce overborrowing. The individual incentives created
by the market (i.e., by Rt ) in the economy with the aggregate debt limit are exactly the same
as those emerging from an individual debt limit. Formally, as is clear in the derivation of the
equivalence result, the market and social price of external funds are identical in the economy
with the aggregate debt limit. The following proposition summarizes the no-overborrowing
result:

Proposition 1 (No Overborrowing) The equilibrium dynamics of ct , ht , yt , and at are
identical in the economy with an individual debt limit and in the economy with an aggregate
debt limit with rents from financial rationing accruing to domestic households.

    This proposition is robust to a number of modifications of the basic model within which
it was derived. For instance, it can be shown that the equivalence result continues to hold
in the context of an economy with capital accumulation. The result can also be shown to be
robust to alternative specifications of the discount factor. In particular, when the discount
factor is assumed to depend on the individual levels of consumption and effort, as opposed
to aggregate measures of these variables. Enriching the sources of uncertainty to include
shocks to endowments, tastes, the world interest rate, or the debt limit κ would also leave
the no-overborrowing result unaltered.
   The no-overborrowing result stated in proposition 1 contrasts sharply with the findings
of Fernández-Arias and Lombardo (1998). These authors conclude that when agents fail to
internalize the debt limit, the economy tends to overborrow. The structure of the model
economy used by Fernández-Arias and Lombardo is similar to the one presented here, with
three nonessential differences. Namely, their model is cast in perfect foresight and in contin-
uous time, and output is assumed to take the form of an exogenous endowment. The central
difference between the Fernández-Arias and Lombardo model and the one I study here has
to do with the mechanism through which credit rationing is brought about in the economy
with an aggregate debt limit. In the formulation I adopt in this paper, credit rationing is
implemented through a market mechanism. The interest rate, Rt , adjusts to induce agents
to borrow an amount that in the aggregate is in line with the credit limit imposed on the
country as a whole. In the Fernández-Arias and Lombardo model, credit rationing is not
implemented through the price system. Indeed, they assume that the domestic interest rate
is always equal to the world interest rate (Rt = R∗ , ∀t). Instead they impose a credit con-
straint of the type at ≤ aτ , t ≥ τ , at the level of each individual household, where τ is the
date at which the aggregate borrowing constraint becomes binding, which is known under


                                              9
perfect foresight. Agents do not internalize the fact that in equilibrium aτ must equal κ.
Note that in the Fernández-Arias and Lombardo model agents internalize a substantial part
of the credit limit, namely the fact that individual debts cannot grow beyond aτ after time
τ . The only aspect of the debt ceiling agents do not internalize is the ceiling κ itself. In
the formulation adopted in the present paper, by contrast, agents do not internalize any
component of the credit limit. They borrow and lend freely at the interest rate Rt (subject,
of course, to the standard no-Ponzi-game constraint).


5     Resource Costs
When rents from financial rationing are appropriated by foreign lenders, it is no longer
possible to compare analytically the dynamics of external debt in the economies with the
aggregate debt limit and in the economy with the individual debt limit. I therefore resort to
numerical methods to characterize competitive equilibria. Preferences and technologies are
                                                    1−σ                                        −ψ
parameterized as follows: U (c, h) = [c − ω −1 hω ]     /(1 − σ), β (c, h) = [1 + c − ω −1 hω ] ,
and F (h) = k ∗α h1−α , where σ, ω, ψ, k ∗, and α are fixed parameters. Table 1 displays the

                                 Table 1: Parameter Values
           σ     ω        ψ       α      R∗     κ      k∗    πHH = πLL    z H = −z L

values I assign to these parameters. The time unit is meant to be one year. The values for
α, ω, σ, and R∗ are taken from Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2003). I set the parameter ψ so
as to induce a debt-to-GDP ratio, a/y, of 50 percent in the deterministic steady sate. The
calibrated value of κ is such that in the economy without the debt limit, the probability
that at is larger than κ is about 15 percent. The parameter k ∗ can be interpreted as a factor
of production that is fixed in aggregate supply, such as land. I set k ∗ so that its market
price in the deterministic steady state is unity. The productivity shock is assumed to follow
a two-state symmetric Markov process with mean zero. Formally, zt takes on values from
the set {z 1 , z 2} with transition probability matrix π, and z 1, z 2, and π satisfy z 1 = −z 2
and π11 = π22. I set π11 equal to 0.71 and z 1 equal to 0.0258. This process displays the
same serial correlation (0.58) and twice as large a standard deviation (2.58 percent) as the
one estimated for Canada by Mendoza (1991). My choice of a process for the productivity
shock that is twice as volatile as the one observed in a developed small open economy like
Canada reflects the view that to a first approximation what distinguishes business cycles
in developed and developing countries is that the latter are about twice as volatile as the

former (Kydland and Zarazaga, 1997).
   I solve the model using the Chebyshev parameterized expectations method. The state
space is discretized using 1000 points for the stock of debt, at . The parameterization of
expectations uses 50 coefficients. I compute the equilibrium for three model economies: An
economy with no debt limit, an economy with a debt limit and financial rents accruing to
domestic residents, and an economy with a debt limit and financial rents flowing abroad. The
procedure approximates the equilibrium with reasonable accuracy. The DenHaan-Marcet
test for 5-percent left and right tails yields (0.047,0.046) for the economy without a debt
limit, (0.043,0.056) for the economy with a debt limit and rents owned domestically, and
(0.048,0.056) for the economy with a debt limit and rents flowing abroad. In conducting
this test, I use 1000 simulations of 5000 years each, dropping the first 1000 periods. The
Matlab code that implements the numerical results reported in this section are available on
my website.
   Figure 1 displays with a solid line the equilibrium probability distribution of external debt
in the economy with an aggregate debt limit and financial rents from rationing accruing to
domestic agents. According to proposition 1, this economy is identical one with a household-
specific debt limit. The figure shows with a dash-crossed line the distribution of debt in the
economy with an aggregate debt limit and financial rents accruing to foreign lenders. As a
reference, the figure also displays, with a dashed line, the debt distribution in an economy
without a debt limit.

                                                            11
    The main result conveyed by the figure is that the distribution of debt in the economy
with a debt limit is virtually unaffected by whether financial rents are assumed to flow abroad
or stay within the country’s limits. The reason behind this result is that the resource cost
incurred by the economy when financial rents belong to foreigners is fairly small, about 0.008
percent of annual GDP. This implication is the result of two properties of the equilibrium
dynamics. First, the economy seldom hits the debt limit. The debt constraint binds on
average less than once every one hundred years. Agents engage in precautionary saving to
mitigate the likelihood finding themselves holding too much debt in periods in which the
interest rate is above the world interest rate. Second, when the debt limit does bind, it
produces a country interest-rate premium of less than 2 percent on average. Finally, the
external debt is about 40 percent of GDP when the economy hits the debt limit. It follows
that the average cost of remitting financial rents abroad is less than 0.008 = 40×0.02×100−1
percent of GDP per year.
    The no overborrowing result continues to hold under a more stringent debt limit. I
experimented lowering the value of κ by 25 percent, from 7.8 to 5.9. This smaller value of
the debt limit is such that in the unconstrained economy the probability that at is larger than
κ is about 30 percent. Under this parameterization, I continue to find no overborrowing.
Specifically, the debt distribution in the economy with an aggregate borrowing limit and rents
accruing to foreign lenders is virtually identical to the distribution of debt in the economy
with an aggregate debt limit and rents accruing to domestic households, which, as stated
in proposition 1, is identical to the debt distribution in the economy with an individual
borrowing limit.


6     The Role of Stock Prices
Thus far, I have limited attention to a constant debt limit. In practice, debt limits take
the form of collateral constraints limiting the size of debt to a fraction of the market value
of an asset, such as land or structures. This type of borrowing limits are also common in
recent models of sudden stops. This type of time-varying debt constraints have been shown
theoretically to induce more severe financial crises, because states in which the collateral
constraint is binding are accompanied by fire sales of collateral and sharp declines in stock
prices (see, for example, Mendoza, 2006). In the context of the present investigation, the
relevant central question is whether these fire sales are more or less severe when the collateral
constraint is imposed at an aggregate level as opposed to at the level of the individual
borrower.
    To model a time varying collateral constraint, assume that output is produced via an

                                               12
homogeneous-of-degree-one function F that takes labor and land as inputs. Formally, yt =
F (kt , ht). Suppose further that the aggregate per capita supply of land is fixed and given
by k ∗ > 0. Let qt denote the market price of land in terms of consumption goods. Consider
first the case in which foreign investors impose a collateral constraint at the country level of
the form
                                              At+1 ≤ κqt k ∗,

where, as before, At+1 denotes the country’s net external debt position due in period t + 1
and κ > 0 is a parameter. It can be shown that the equilibrium price of land satisfies the
following Euler equation:
                                                                           
                                              λt+1          zt+1  ∗
                       qt = β(ct, ht)Et            [qt+1 + e Fk (k , ht+1 )] .             (18)
                                               λt

Iterating this expression forward yields
                                 " j−1                          #

                                                          λ t+s


Intuitively, this expression states that the price of land equals the present discounted value
of its future expected marginal products.
   A stationary competitive equilibrium with an aggregate collateral constraint and financial
rents accruing domestically is given by a set of stationary stochastic processes {ct, ht , at+1,
Rt , qt}∞
        t=0 satisfying (4)-(6), (9), (18), and


                                              at+1 ≤ κqtk ∗ ,                              (19)

and
                                     (Rt − R∗ )(at+1 − κqtk ∗ ) = 0,                       (20)

with F (ht) replaced by F (k ∗, ht) and F 0(ht) replaced by Fh (k ∗, ht ).
   Consider now the case in which the collateral constraint is imposed at the level of each
borrower. That is, at+1 ≤ κqt kt+1 . In this case, all external loans are extended at the world
interest rate R∗ . In states in which the collateral constraint is binding, a shadow interest-
rate premium Rt − R∗ ≥ 0 emerges. When households internalize the collateral constraint,
the price of land incorporates the financial services provided by this asset in its capacity
as collateral. Specifically, with an internalized collateral constraint the pricing equation for

Comparing this expression with its counterpart in the economy with an aggregate borrowing
constraint, we observe that the fact that the shadow value of collateral, given by 1/R∗ −1/Rt ,
is nonnegative implies, ceteris paribus, that the individual agent discounts future marginal
products of land less heavily in the economy with the internalized borrowing constraint. In
effect, in this case the agent applies the effective discount factor

                                      β(ct, ht )
                                                    ≥ β(ct , ht).
                                1 − κ(1/R∗ − 1/Rt )

This difference reflects the fact that when the collateral constraint is internalized the indi-
vidual agent values the financial service provided by land, namely, collateral.
   The above expression for qt does not say that the price of land should be higher in periods
in which the collateral constraint is binding. Indeed, we will see shortly that the real value
of land falls dramatically during such periods. The above expression does say that during
financial crises all other things equal the value of land is likely to be higher in an economy in
which the collateral constraint is internalized than in an economy in which it is not. But if
in the economy with an individual collateral constraint the value of collateral is higher than
it is in an economy with an aggregate collateral constraint, it follows that agents will be able
to hold more debt in the former environment. Thus, at least at an intuitive level, one should
not expect that the no-overborrowing result of the previous section be overturned by simply
replacing the constant debt limit by one increasing in the market value of some domestically
owned asset.
   A stationary competitive equilibrium with an individual collateral constraint and financial
rents accruing domestically is given by a set of stationary stochastic processes {ct, ht , at+1,
Rt , qt}∞                                                                        ∗            0
        t=0 satisfying (4)-(6), (9), and (19)-(21), with F (ht ) replaced by F (k , ht ) and F (ht )
replaced by Fh (k ∗ , ht). It is worth noting that the only difference between the equilibrium
conditions of the economy with an aggregate collateral constraint and those of the economy
with an individual collateral constraint the Euler condition for land.


                                                  14
        To ascertain whether the imposition of an aggregate collateral constraint induces external
overborrowing, I compute equilibrium dynamics numerically. I calibrate the economy as in
section 5, except for the parameter κ, which now takes the value 0.1.1 I solve the model
using the Chebyshev parameterized expectations method.2
    The top-left panel of figure 2 displays the unconditional distribution of external debt. A
solid line corresponds to the economy with an internal collateral constraint, and a dashed
line corresponds to the economy with an aggregate collateral constraint. The distribution of
debt is virtually identical in the economy with an individual collateral constraint and in the
economy with an aggregate collateral constraint. Similarly, as shown in the top-right and
bottom-left panels of the figure, whether the collateral constraint is imposed at the individual
or the aggregate levels appears to make no difference for the equilibrium dynamics of stock
prices or consumption. Note that when the stock of debt is high agents engage in fire sales
of land resulting in sharp declines in its market price, qt. But the collapse of land prices
in periods of high external debt is quantitatively similar in economies with aggregate and
individual debt constraints. The contraction in real estate prices is caused by the increase in
interest rates (market interest rates in the economy with an aggregate debt limit and shadow
interest rates in the economy with an individual debt limit) as the economy approaches the
debt limit.3 In line with the intuition developed earlier in this section, land prices are indeed
higher in the economy with an individual debt limit, but this difference is quantitatively
small.
    We conclude that the no-overborrowing result is robust to allowing for a debt limit that
is increasing in the market value of a fixed factor of production.


7         Inducing Overborrowing
The reason why in the of section 2 households do not have a larger propensity to borrow
under an aggregate debt limit is that the market and social prices of international liquidity
are identical. Two features of the economy studied in this paper are crucial in generating the
equality of market and social prices of debt. First, when the borrowing limit is internalized

     In the deterministic steady state qt = 1, so that κqtk∗ = 7.83, which is the value assigned to κ in the
economy with the constant debt limit.

     The DenHaan-Marcet test for 5-percent left and right tails yields (0.043,0.061) for the economy with an
individual collateral constraint, and (0.048,0.06) for the economy with an aggregate collateral constraint. In
conducting this test, I use 5000 simulations of 5000 years each, dropping the first 1000 periods. The Matlab
code that implements the numerical results reported in this section are available on my website.

     Formally, the fire sale of land is driven by a drop in the stochastic discount factor β(ct , ht)λt+1 /λt , which
takes place in both the economy with an aggregate collateral constraint and the economy with an individual
collateral constraint.

the shadow price of funds, given by the pseudo interest rate R∗ /(1 − R∗ ξt ), is constant and
equal to the world interest rate R∗ except when the debt ceiling is binding. The shadow
price of funds equals the world interest rate even as households operate arbitrarily close to
the debt ceiling. Second, in the economy with the individual debt constraint, when the debt
ceiling binds, it does so for all agents simultaneously. This property is a consequence of the
assumption of homogeneity across economic agents.
   The absence of either of the abovementioned two features may cause the market price of
foreign funds to be below the social price, thereby inducing overborrowing. Here, I provide
two theoretical examples in which this is the case. One in which agents are heterogeneous
in endowments, and one in which agents face a debt-elastic interest rate.


7.1    Debt-Elastic Country Premium
Let the domestic interest rate be given by an increasing function of aggregate external debt
of the form Rt = R(At+1 ), with R0 > 0. Because individual households take the evolution
of the aggregate debt position, At , as exogenous, they do not internalize the dependence of
the interest rate on their individual debt positions. The reason why the cost of funds is debt
elastic is unspecified in this simple setting, but it could be due to the presence of default risk
as in models of sovereign debt. Let A∗ denote the steady-state value of debt in this economy.
Then A∗ must satisfy the condition

                                          1 = R(A∗ )β,

where β is a constant subjective discount factor. This steady-state condition arises in vir-
tually all formulations of the small open economy with utility-maximizing households (e.g.,
Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe, 2003). Assume now that the debt-elastic interest-rate schedule is
imposed at the level of each individual household, so that Rt = R(at+1 ). Let A∗∗ denote the
steady-state level of external debt in this economy. It can be shown that A∗∗ is determined
by the condition
                                       A∗∗R0 (A∗∗)
                                  1−               = R(A∗∗ )β.
                                        R(A∗∗)
Clearly, the fact that R0 > 0 implies that

                                           A∗ > A∗∗.




                                               17
That is, the economy with the financial externality generates overborrowing.4 We note that
in the economy with the aggregate debt limit the market price of foreign funds, R(At+1 ), is
strictly lower than the social cost of foreign funds, given by R(At+1 )/[1−At+1R0 (At+1 )/R(At+1 )].
This discrepancy, which is key in generating overborrowing, is absent in the economy of the
previous sections.


7.2       Heterogeneous Agents
The following example describes a situation in which overborrowing occurs because debt
limits do not bind for all agents at the same time. The example is in the context of a two-
period, endowment economy without uncertainty. The economy faces a constant debt ceiling
κ per capita. There is a continuum of agents of measure one, and agents are heterogeneous.
The central result obtains under a variety of sources of heterogeneity, such as differences in
endowments, preferences, or initial asset positions. Here, I assume that agents are identical
in all respects except their period-2 endowments. Specifically, all households receive the
same endowment of y units of goods in period 1, but in period 2, half of the households
receive an endowment of y a > y and the other half receive a smaller endowment of y b < y a.
Agents receiving the larger future endowment have a stronger incentive to borrow in period
1 to smooth consumption over time.
   We have in mind a situation in which in the absence of a debt ceiling households with
high expected endowment consume ca > y +κ units in period 1 and the rest of the households
consume cb < y+κ units. Figure 3 depicts the equilibrium in the absence of a debt constraint.
In this case, aggregate external debt per capita equals Au = (ca + cb )/2 − y.
    When the borrowing ceiling κ is imposed at the level of each individual household, half
of the households—those with high period-2 endowment-are constrained and consume y + κ
units, whereas the other half is unconstrained and consumes cb . Aggregate external debt per
capita equals Ai = (κ + cb − y)/2 < Au . Clearly, we also have that Ai < κ.
       Now suppose that the debt ceiling is imposed at the aggregate level, Here two alternative
situations are possible. One is that the aggregate debt limit is not binding. This case takes
place when in the absence of a debt constraint aggregate per capita debt does not exceed the
ceiling. That is, when Au ≤ κ. In this case, the equilibrium interest rate equals the world
interest rate R∗ , and consumption of each agent equals the level attained in the absence of
any borrowing constraint. External debt is given by Aa = Au > Ai .
   Alternatively, if the aggregate level of external debt in the unconstrained environment
   4
     Auernheimer and Garcı́a-Saltos (2000) derive a similar result in a model in which the interest rate
                                                      A
depends on the leverage ratio. That is, Rt = R( qtt+1   k ∗ ) in the case of an aggregate debt limit, and Rt =
    at+1
R( qt kt+1 ) in the case of an individual debt limit.


                                                     18

exceeds the ceiling (i.e., if Au > κ), then the economy is financially rationed, the domestic
interest rate exceeds the world interest rate, and aggregate borrowing per capita is given by
Aa = κ > Ai . Therefore, regardless of whether the aggregate debt limit is binding or not,
external borrowing is higher when the debt ceiling is imposed at the aggregate level.
   Therefore, the combination of heterogeneous consumers and debt limits imposed at the
aggregate level induces overborrowing in equilibrium. Overborrowing occurs because of a
financial externality. Specifically, the group of more frugal consumers provides a financial
service to the group of more lavish consumers by placing comparatively less pressure on
the aggregate borrowing constraint. This service, however, is not priced in the competitive
equilibrium.5
       We close this section with a brief comment on the concept of overborrowing when agents
are heterogeneous. The term overborrowing has a negative connotation, referring to a subop-
timal amount of external financing. In the models with homogeneous agents and a constant
debt limit studied earlier in this paper, one can safely interpret any difference in the dis-
tribution of external debt in the economies with aggregate and individual debt limits as
suboptimal, or overborrowing. This is because the competitive equilibrium associated with
the economy featuring individual debt limits coincides with the optimal allocation chosen
   5
     Interestingly, economic heterogeneity, although of a different nature, is also the root cause of overbor-
rowing in the dual-liquidity model of emerging-market crisis developed by Caballero and Krishnamurthy
(2001). In their model, there is heterogeneity in the provision of liquidity across assets. Some assets are
recognized as liquid collateral by both domestic and foreign lenders, while other assets serve as collateral only
to domestic lenders. Caballero and Krishnamurth show that in financially underdeveloped economies this
type of heterogeneity produces an externality whereby the market price of international liquidity is below
its social marginal cost.

by a social planner that internalizes the debt limit.6 When agents are heterogeneous it is
not necessarily the case that the debt distribution associated with the economy featuring an
aggregate debt limit is less desirable than the one implied by the economy with an individual
debt limit. To see this, suppose, for instance, that in the economy analyzed in this section
the social planner cared only about the well being of agents with high period-2 endowments.
In this case, the social planner would favor the equilibrium associated with an aggregate
borrowing limit over the one associated with an individual debt limit.

     As noted by Auernheimer and Garcı́a-Saltos (2000), this is not the case when debt is limited by the
value of capital. For in this case agents take as given the price of land, qt, which appears in the collateral
constraint. The social planner, by contrast, takes qt as endogenous.
