                                         ABSTRACT

In light of the human suffering and economic costs associated with mental illness, we provide the
first assessment of whether local credit conditions shape the incidence of mental depression.
Using several empirical strategies, we discover that bank regulatory reforms that improved local
credit conditions reduced mental depression among low-income households and the impact was
largest in counties dominated by bank-dependent firms. On the mechanisms, we find that the
regulatory reforms boosted employment, income, and mental health among low-income
individuals in bank-dependent counties, but the regulatory reforms did not increase borrowing by
these individuals.

1. Introduction
          Almost one in five U.S. adults experienced mental illness in 2016 and over three million
became recipients of Social Security and Disability Insurance benefits due to a mental health
condition. Insel (2008) estimates that mental illness lowers U.S. earnings by $193 billion per
annum due to absenteeism, presenteeism, and lower productivity. Looking globally, the World
Health Organization (2011) reports that mental illness is the leading cause of lost working hours
and estimates that the global cost of mental illness in 2010 was nearly $2.5 trillion. 1
          In light of the human suffering and economic costs from mental illness, we provide the
first assessment of the impact of local credit conditions on mental health. Two lines of research
guide our study. First, extensive research shows that credit conditions shape economic welfare
by influencing economic growth (King and Levine 1993; Jayaratne and Strahan 1996; Levine
and Zervos 1998; Rajan and Zingales 1998), income inequality (Beck, Levine, and Levkov 2010),
entrepreneurship (Black and Strahan 2002; Kerr and Nanda 2009; Levine and Rubinstein 2017,
2018), household consumption and borrowing (Agarwal and Qian 2014; Agarwal et al 2018),
and access to education and homes (Sun and Yannelis 2016; Favara and Imbs 2015). Second,
research highlights the connections between economic welfare and mental health, as low-
incomes, underemployment, and economic duress are positively associated with mental
depression (e.g., Lund et al 2010 2011; Reeves et al 2012; Apouey and Clark 2015; Wickham et
al 2017; Persson and Rossin-Slater 2018; Adhvaryu, Fenske, and Nyshadham 2019). These two
lines of research, therefore, offer the following hypotheses: (1) improvements in credit
conditions will reduce mental illness and (2) these effects are likely to be largest among lower-
income workers because (a) improvements in credit conditions tend to disproportionately boost
the earnings of lower-income individuals (Beck, Levkov, and Levine 2010) and (b) mental
illness is more prevalent among lower-income individuals. There are, however, potentially
countervailing influences. For example, Kerr and Nanda (2009) find that improvements in credit
conditions increase the rates of business entry and exit. While this spurs economic dynamism, it
might also increase anxiety about job stability and harm mental health.
          To evaluate the impact of credit market conditions on mental health and shed empirical
light on the mechanisms linking finance and mental health, we exploit an exogenous source of

                                                                                                      2


variation in local credit conditions: the deregulation of interstate bank branching that began in
1995 and continued through 2005 (e.g., Johnson and Rice 2008). Although the Riegle-Neal Act
eliminated regulatory prohibitions on interstate banking in 1995, it did not prohibit states from
erecting barriers to out-of-state branch expansion. Since the costs of branching are lower than the
costs of establishing subsidiaries, interstate branching restrictions limited competition between
banks in different states and made banking markets less efficient. Rice and Strahan (2010) show
that lowering regulatory barriers to interstate branching improved credit conditions by reducing
the interest rates charged by banks on loans to small firms. Building on their strategy, we use
cross-state, cross-time variation in the removal of regulatory impediments to interstate bank
branching as an exogenous source of variation in local credit conditions and examine the impact
of these regulatory reforms on mental health.
       We explore the impact of these bank regulatory reforms on mental illness using data from
the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79). The NLSY79 is a nationally
representative survey that follows individuals born in the years 1957-1964. There are 12,686
individuals, who were between the ages of 14 and 22 when the survey started in 1979, and the
NLSY79 continues to survey these individuals. In addition to information on employment,
income, education, wealth, demographics, cognitive and noncognitive traits, and family
background, the NLSY79 also obtains information on each individual’s physical and mental
health. For mental health, the NLSY79 asks seven questions that comprise the Center for
Epidemiological Studies (CES) depression index. We examine (a) the answers to each of the
seven questions separately, (b) the composite depression index based on equally weighting the
answers to the seven questions, and (b) several other measures of depression based on different
weighting schemes. We focus our discussion on the results using the composite, equally
weighted depression index. Since the NLSY79 provides these mental health measures over time
for each individual, we test whether changes in credit conditions trigger changes in the mental
health of individuals.
       We use three empirical strategies to assess the impact of interstate branch deregulation on
mental health. First, exploiting the cross-state, cross-time variation in bank deregulation and the
longitudinal nature of the NLSY79, we examine the response of individual mental health to
branch deregulation while conditioning on individual fixed effects, gender-race-year fixed
effects, state-specific linear time trends, and time-varying state characteristics, such real gross
                                                                                                    3


state product (GSP) per capita and population. Furthermore, we also differentiate between high-
and low-income individuals. As noted above, bank deregulation exerts an especially large impact
on the earning of lower income individuals, so we test whether the relationship between branch
deregulation and mental health is more pronounced among lower-income individuals. By
controlling for individual and gender-race-year effects, we condition out time-invariant
individual-level characteristics that shape mental health and time-varying factors that
differentially affect these sub-population groups.
       The second empirical strategy differentiates among counties within states and uses a
spatial regression discontinuity research design to compare neighboring counties that are subject
to different interstate branching policies. Huang (2008) compared counties across state borders
when assessing the impact of interstate banking deregulation that allowed banks to establish
subsidiaries in another state. We apply this method to interstate branch deregulation that allowed
banks to establish branches in other states. Thus, we compare two otherwise similar counties
separated by a state border in which the states have different interstate branching regulations and
evaluate the impact of changes in these branching regulations on changes in mental health in the
counties. If the results from this spatial regression discontinuity strategy confirm the earlier
findings, this will reduce concerns that omitted variables drive the findings on the relationship
between finance and mental health.
       Our third empirical strategy also differentiates among counties within states and explores
two potential mechanisms through which credit conditions shape mental health: The “firm credit”
and “consumer credit” mechanism. The firm credit mechanism holds that enhancing credit
conditions will improve mental health by boosting income and employment. We evaluate this
potential mechanism in two ways. First, we differentiate counties by the degree to which the
county’s firms depend on external finance, namely banks. If easing credit constraints improve
mental health by boosting income and employment, then we should find a particularly large
impact of deregulation on mental health in counties where bank branch deregulation is likely to
have the biggest effect on firm credit conditions: counties with firms that depend heavily on
banks. Following Rajan and Zingales (1998), we differentiate counties by the degree to which
firms are financially dependent and examine whether interstate branch deregulation exerts an
especially pronounced effect on mental health among low-income workers and in counties
dominated by financially-dependent firms. Second, we differentiate counties by the density of
                                                                                                     4


bank branches before bank branch deregulation. Holding other features of the counties constant,
we expect that bank branch deregulation will have a bigger effect firms’ access to credit in
“under-banked” counties than in counties that were already densely banked before deregulation.
The second mechanism—the consumer credit mechanism—holds that enhancing credit
conditions will improve mental health by easing household access to credit, without necessarily
increasing income or employment. To assess this consumer credit, we test whether interstate
bank branch deregulation triggered an increase in borrowing among lower-income workers.
       We discover that (1) interstate branch deregulation is associated with a material drop in
mental depression, (2) this effect is driven by improvements in mental health among low-income
individuals, and (3) these results hold when implementing the spatial regression discontinuity
strategy. These findings are robust to including individual and gender-race-year fixed effects,
state-specific linear time trends, and time-varying state characteristics. The estimated impact is
large. If the average U.S. state relaxes interstate branching restrictions by one degree—where
branch restrictions range from zero (most restrictive) to four (least restrictive), the estimates
indicate that the composite depression index (Depression Index) for the low-income group drops
by 0.522, which represents a 15% drop relative to the sample mean, and clinical depression falls
by 3.8%.
       Turning next to the mechanisms through which credit conditions shape mental health, we
first find that interstate branch deregulation triggers an especially pronounced increase in income
and employment and decrease in mental depression (a) among low-income workers within
counties dominated by bank-dependent firms and (b) among low-income workers within
counties with low pre-deregulation bank density. Thus, following branch deregulation, the same
group of individuals experienced both a disproportionately large increase in employment and
income and especially large decrease in mental depression. These findings are consistent with the
firm-credit channel: easing firm credit constraints boosts income and employment and these
improvements enhance mental health. By focusing on a group of individuals most likely to be
affected by interstate branch deregulation—low-income workers in bank-dependent counties, we
reduce concerns that omitted variables confound our findings. Second, we do not find evidence
consistent with the consumer-credit channel. In particular, we find no evidence that interstate
branch deregulation increases borrowing by individuals, with beneficial effects on mental
depression.

       The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses the Riegle-Neal Act
and the details of interstate branch deregulation, while Section 3 presents the data and variable
definitions. Section 4 presents the baseline result and spatial regression discontinuity design.
Section 5 explores potential channels and deepens understanding of factors influencing mental
health condition and subjective well-being. Section 6 concludes.


2. Bank Branch Deregulation

       The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Act (IBBEA) of 1994 effectively
removed restrictions on banks expanding across state lines through the establishment of
separately capitalized bank subsidiaries and removed federal barriers to interstate branching. As
explained by Johnson and Rice (2008), however, the Act provided states with the discretion to
limit bank expansion across state lines through the establishment of bank branches. Interstate
branching can occur through two means: (a) an out-of-state bank can acquire an in-state bank
and convert that bank into its branches or (b) an out-of-state bank can either establish new
branches within a state (“de novo” branching) or purchase the branches of an in-state bank.
       Following Riegle-Neal, many states erected barriers to banks from other states
establishing branches within their borders. States used four types of regulatory restrictions on
interstate branching. First, some states imposed minimum age restrictions with respect to how
long a target bank has been in existence before it can be acquired and consolidated into branches.
These minimum age restrictions, which have a federally set maximum of five years, make cross-
state banking more costly because they required that banks (a) purchase an entire older bank,
which is more costly than opening a branch, or (b) open a new subsidiary and then wait until the
minimum age restriction has been satisfied before converting the subsidiary into a branch.
Second, some states prohibited de novo interstate branching. Third, some states prohibited the
acquisition of a single branch or portions of an institution, which represents an additional barrier
to cross-state branching. Fourth, some states imposed limits on the percentage of insured
deposits in state that a single bank could hold, which could limit large interstate bank mergers.
       Building on Johnson and Rice (2008), Rice and Strahan (2010) construct an index of
regulatory restrictions on interstate branching. Based on their data, our IBBEA Index takes a
value between zero and four, where we add one point to the index if the state (1) does not impose
a minimum age restriction for acquisition, (2) allows de novo interstate branching, (3) permits
                                                                                                       6


interstate branching by acquiring a single branch; (4) sets the deposit-cap no less than 30%. Thus,
larger values indicate a more deregulated interstate branching environment. We use this index to
exploit post-1994, cross-state variations in restrictions on interstate branching.


3. Data and Variables

3.1 Individual-Level Data
       We extract data from the National Longitudinal Surveys Youth 1979 (NLSY79)
administered by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The NLSY79 is a nationally representative
survey that follows a sample of American youth born in the years 1957-1964. A total of 12,686
individuals (aged 14 -22 years) were interviewed in the initial survey year, 1979. The surveys
were conducted annually from 1979 to 1994, and then biannually afterwards. Following Altonji
and Pierret (2001) and Levine and Rubinstein (2017), we restrict the NLSY79 sample as follows.
We drop individual-year observations with a missing state identifier and those not residing in one
of the 50 states or the District of Columbia. We also drop observations with missing data on key
variables and those who change their residence state over the sample period. We use the sample
weights provided by NLSY79.
       The NLSY79 has two advantages over several other individual-based U.S. datasets. First,
it is a representative, longitudinal survey. The long-panel nature of the NLSY79 allows us to
control for individual fixed effects to better identify the impact of interstate branch deregulation
on mental health. Second, in addition to containing information on standard demographic and
economic traits, the NLSY79 also contains information on family background, physical and
mental health, and an assortment of other cognitive and noncognitive traits.
       In our analyses, we control for several time-varying, state-specific traits that are not part
of the NLSY79 data. Gross State Product (GSP) per capita and total population come from the
Bureau of Economic Analysis. We adjust all nominal values into 2010 prices using CPI prices.
                                                                                                  7


3.2 Key Variables
       3.2.1 Depression Measures
       We use measures of each respondent’s level of depression based on questions in the
Attitudes, Health, and Health Module 40 & Over sections of the NLSY79. The NLSY79 surveys
each individual’s mental health in 1992, 1994, and the year immediately after the person
becomes 40 years old. Thus, we have three measures of each individual’s mental health. For
most of the interviewees, therefore, we have two depression measures before the 1994 Riegle-
Neal Act and one measure afterwards. Given data on mental health and the index of restrictions
on interstate bank branching, our sample period runs from 1992 through 2005.
       We utilize the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, which measures
symptoms of depression using seven sets of questions. Respondents were asked to evaluate their
degree of agreement (during the past week) with the following statements:
       (1) I did not feel like eating; my appetite was poor (Trouble Eating),
       (2) I had trouble keeping my mind on what I was doing (Trouble Concentrating),
       (3) I feel depressed (Feel Depressed),
       (4) I felt that everything I did was an effort (Everything an Effort),
       (5) My sleep was restless (Trouble sleeping),
       (6) I felt sad (Feel Sad), and
       (7) I could not get “going” (Lethargic).
For each statement, respondents were asked to choose from (a) Rarely/None of the time/1 Day,
(b) Some/A little of the time/1-2 Days, (c) Occasionally/Moderate amount of the time/3-4 Days,
and (d) Most/All of the times/5-7 Days. Corresponding ordinal values of 0 to 3 points are
assigned to these four responses.
       Besides ratings on the seven individual items, NLSY79 also reports a total score
(Depression Index) that aggregates the individual responses to a single number spanning from 0
(individual chooses 0 as an answer for all seven questions, least depressed) to 21 (individual
chooses 3 for all dimensions, most depressed). This Depression Index is often employed in
epidemiological and treatment studies to screen for depression disorder in the community, and a
cutoff value of 8 is widely used to detect clinical depression (Levine, 2013).
       To measure whether an individual passes a particular threshold measure of “clinical
depression,” we create dummy variables based on the Depression Index. Specifically, if the
                                                                                                 8


Depression Index is above 8, then D-Depression Index Above 8 equals one and equals zero
otherwise; if the Depression Index is above 10, then D-Depression Index Above 10 equals one
and equals zero otherwise; and if the Depression Index is above 12, then D-Depression Index
Above 12 equals one and equals zero otherwise. Thus, in addition to the Depression Index, we
examine these three indicators of severe depression.
       As an additional robustness test, we create and examine measures based on the intensity
of the answers to the seven questions regarding mental depression. In particular, % of Answers
“0” equals the percentage of the seven questions that the respondent answers, “Rarely/None of
the time/1 Day per week;” % of Answers “1” equals the percentage of the seven questions that
the respondent answers, “Some/A little of the time/1-2 Days per week;” and % of Answers “2”
and % of Answers “3” are defined analogously.

       3.2.2 Individual-Level Characteristics
       Inspired by a growing literature on the “economics of happiness” and subjective well-
being (Dolan, Peasgood and White, 2008), we examine several individual-level characteristics.
With respect to basic traits, we examine Education and Age, which equal the highest grade
completed by the respondent, ranging from below high school (less than 12 years of schooling)
to advanced graduate (over 16 years of schooling), and the age of the difference between the
birth year and the survey year respectively. With respect to family background, we examine the
following. FamilyIncome7981 equals the natural logarithm of one plus the average total family
income over the 1979 to 1981 period (in 2010 dollars). MotherEducation and FatherEducation
equals the maximum years of schooling received by the respondent’s mother and father
respectively. D-BothParents is a dummy variable that equals one if the respondent lived with
both parents at the age 14, and zero otherwise.
       To capture an individual’s aptitudes, attitudes, and personality traits, we examine the
following. AFQTAbilityTest equals the respondent’s percentile score from taking the Armed
Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) test in 1980, where the test is designed to
measure knowledge and skill in the areas of arithmetic reasoning, word knowledge, paragraph
comprehension and numerical operations. RosenbergSelfEsteem equals the individual’s score
using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, which is computed from respondent’s answers in 1987
                                                                                                                       9


to questions designed to measure self-worth (Rosenberg, 1979). 2 PearlinSenseOfControl equals
the Pearlin Mastery score based on questions from the 1992 survey and is based on answers to
seven questions designed to measure the respondent’s sense of control over one’s life (Pearlin et
al 1981). 3 D-RiskAttitude is a dummy variable that equals one if the respondent answers “Yes”
facing the question “Would you take a job that could either double family income or cut income
by a third” in the 1993 survey year, and zero otherwise. This dummy variable proxies for the
respondent’s level of risk tolerance just before 1994 IBBEA deregulation.

         3.2.3 Variables for the Channel Explorations
         We also examine the impact of interstate bank branch deregulation on each individual’s
economic conditions. D-WorkHours is a dummy variable that equals one if the respondent
participates in the job market and has positive working hours in a given year, and zero otherwise.
Log(WorkHours) takes the natural logarithm of one plus total working hours. Log(EmpWeeks)
takes the natural logarithm of one plus total employment weeks. Log(TotalIncome) is the natural
logarithm of one plus the respondent’s total income (in 2010 dollars) including wages, salaries,
and income from farm or business.
         Finally, we examine the degree to which individuals borrow. Leverage equals the ratio of
total liabilities (excluding mortgages on residential property, such as debts on
farm/business/other property, debts on vehicles etc.) to total assets (excluding the market value
of residential property, such as the market value of the farm/business/other property, vehicles,
etc.). D/I Ratio is the ratio of total liabilities excluding mortgages on residential property as
defined above over respondent’s total income (including wages, salaries, and income from farm
or business).

         3.2.4 State-Level Controls
         We also control for the following time-varying, state-specific influences. Log(GSP Per
Capita) and Log (Population) are the natural logarithm of Gross State Product (GSP) per capita
and total state population respectively and are obtained from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

2
  Respondents were asked to choose (1) Strongly Agree, (2) Agree, (3) Disagree, and (4) Strongly Disagree over ten
statements, such as “I am a person of worth,” “I have a number of good qualities” etc. The total score ranges from 0
to 30, with a higher value indicating a higher level of self-esteem.
3
  Respondents were asked to choose (1) Strongly Disagree, (2) Disagree, (3) Agree, and (4) Strongly Agree over
seven statements, such as “I have little control over the things that happen to me,” “There is little I can do to change
many of the important things in my life” etc. The total score ranges from 7 to 28, with a higher value indicating a
more positive self-concept and a stronger internal control over one’s destiny.

3.3 Summary statistics
           Table 1 provides summary statistics on key variables using the sampling weights
provided by the NLSY79 over our sample period 1992-2005, and Appendix 1 provides detailed
variable definitions. 4 The Depression Index ranges from 0 (not depressed at all) to 21 (most
depressed), and the sample average is 3.5. 13.6% of respondents suffer from clinical depression
as measured by a Depression Index score that is above eight.
           Figure 1 graphs the average value of the Depression Index from 1992 through 2014. As
shown, depression falls during the period of rapid economic growth in the 1990s, but rises
sharply following the 2008 global financial crisis. In our analyses, we will focus on individual-
level data and will condition out such trends, but the aggregate movements are consistent with
past work showing the positive association between economic conditions and mental health.


4. Empirical Results

           In this section, we first exploit the cross-state, cross-time variation in bank deregulation
and the longitudinal nature of the NLSY79 to examine the relationship between branch
deregulation and mental health while differentiating between high- and low-income individuals
and conditioning on individual, state, and gender-race-year fixed effects as well as time-varying
state economic conditions. We also show that the results are robust to several sensitivity analyses,
including the inclusion of state specific linear time trends. We then exploit the county-level data
and employ a spatial regression discontinuity research design to compare neighboring counties
that are subject to different interstate branching policies.


4.1 Baseline Results
           We use a generalized difference-in-difference estimation strategy that exploits the
staggered lowering of regulatory impediments to interstate state branching to evaluate the impact
of bank regulatory reforms on mental depression. Thus, our analyses employ the following panel
regression model:

             𝑌𝑖,𝑠,𝑡 = 𝛼 + 𝛽 ∙ 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑠,𝑡 + 𝜃 ∙ 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖,𝑠,𝑡−1 + 𝛿𝑖 + 𝛿𝑔,𝑟,𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑠,𝑡 ,           (1)


4
    All continuous variables are winsorized at the 1st and 99th percentiles.
                                                                                                     11


where 𝑌𝑖,𝑠,𝑡 measures the mental health of individual i from state s at time t. 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 𝐼𝐼𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑠,𝑡 is
the interstate bank branching deregulation index of state s at time t. 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑠,𝑡 ranges from
zero to four, where higher values indicate fewer restrictions on interstate branch banking. 𝛽 is
our key coefficient of interest, capturing the impact of bank branch deregulation on mental health.
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖,𝑠,𝑡−1 is a matrix of (a) time-varying state-level characteristics, including the log of
GSP per capita and the log of total population and (b) time-invariant individual-level traits,
including the income of the individual’s family when the individual was young, the education
level of each parent, whether the individual was raised in a home with both parents, the
individual’s AFQT, Rosenberg, Pearlin Mastery, and Risk Aversion scores. In some
specifications we include individual fixed effects, 𝛿𝑖 , instead of these individual-level traits.
𝛿𝑔,𝑟,𝑡 denotes gender-race-year fixed effect. All regressions use the survey weights provided by
NLSY79 to adjust for non-response, clustering, and stratification issues inherent in the survey
data. Standard errors are clustered at the state level.
        Table 2 presents the results from estimating equation (1) while using various
combinations of controls and using different subsamples of individuals. Columns (1) to (3) report
results with state and gender-race-year fixed effects and an extensive list of time-invariant
individual traits. Columns (4) to (6) include individual fixed effects. By including individual and
gender-race-year effects, we condition out time-invariant individual-level characteristics that
might shape mental health and time-varying factors that differentially affect these sub-population
groups. Following Chetty, Hendren, Kline and Saez (2014), we differentiate between the low-
and high-income subsamples by (1) computing average total income (in 2010 dollars), including
wages, salaries and income from farm or business, over the three-year window immediately
before our sample period, (i.e., 1989-1991) and (2) dividing each state’s sample of individuals
into low- and high income subsamples based on the state median value of average total income
over the 1989-1991 period.
        As shown in columns (1) – (3), we discover that bank branch deregulation is associated
with a sharp drop in depression among lower income individuals, but not among the high-income
group. The estimated coefficient on IBBEA Index is both economically large and statistically
significant among the sample of low-income individuals. The point estimate for the low-income
group is -0.284, which implies that one more degree of interstate bank branch openness, i.e., an
increase of the IBBEA Index of one, is associated with an 8% reduction in the Depression Index
                                                                                                   12


relative to the sample mean (0.08=0.284/3.508). In contrast, the point estimate for the high-
income group is -0.053 and statistically insignificant. The difference between the estimates for
the low- and high-income groups is statistically significant as measured by the Wald test. The
remaining coefficients in column (1) to (3) are consistent with existing research on the
“economics of happiness.” For example, individuals from higher-income families
(FamilyIncome7981) and those who were raised in two-parent households (D-BothParents) tend
to suffer from less mental depression. We also find that individuals with higher learning aptitude
scores, greater self-esteem, and a stronger sense of internal control over one’s life also have
lower depression scores.
       When also conditioning on individual fixed effects, we continue to find that lowering
regulatory barriers to interstate bank branching is associated with a material improvement in
mental health among low-income individuals, but not among high-income individuals. As shown
in columns (4) - (6) of Table 2, lower regulatory barriers to interstate bank branching is
associated with a material improvement in mental health among low-income individuals. For
example, the coefficient in column (5) suggests that one more degree of interstate bank branch
openness—as measured by the IBBEA Index that ranges from 0 to 4—reduces the Depression
Index by almost 0.297, which represents a 8.5% decline relative to the sample mean.


4.2 Baseline Results: Robustness Tests
       We next focus on severe depression by examining D-Depression Index Above 8, D-
Depression Index Above 10, and D-Depression Index Above 12. These dummy variables indicate
whether the individual has a Depression Index value above 8, 10, and 12 respectively, where the
cut-off value of 8 is often used to gauge clinical depression. We use these as the dependent
variables in columns (1) to (3) of Table 3. Furthermore, as an additional robustness test, we
examine the intensity of the answers to the seven questions regarding mental depression using
the four variables defined above: % of Answers “0,” % of Answers “1,” % of Answers “2,” and %
of Answers “3.” Table 3 also provides the results on these four mental depression indicators.
       As shown in Table 3, the results on severe depression are fully consistent with the earlier
results using the Depression Index: reducing regulatory restrictions on interstate branching is
associated with a material drop in the incidence of severe depression among low-income
individuals, but not among high-income individuals. For example, among the low income group,
                                                                                                  13


the estimated coefficients indicate that one more degree of interstate branch deregulation (as
measured by the IBBEA Index) is associated with a drop in the probability of severe mental
depression of between 1.4% and 1.8% depending on which cutoff is employed (e.g., D-
Depression Index Above 8, D-Depression Index Above 10, or D-Depression Index Above 12. The
results in Table 3 also emphasize the negative impact of bank deregulation on depression among
low income individuals when using the alternative indicators of depression that focus on
intensity of the answers to the seven questions used to gauge depression (columns 4 to 7).
Following a reduction in the restrictions on interstate branch deregulation (an increase in IBBEA
Index), individuals are much more likely to answer that they rarely or never experience the seven
features of depression and are much less likely to answer that they experience the seven features
of depression 5-7 days per week.
       We also examine the relationship between interstate branch regulatory reforms and
responses to each of the seven questions underlying the composite Depression Index. As reported
in Table 4, we find that regulatory reforms that improve the operation of banking systems
improve the mental well-being of low-income individuals with respect to Trouble Concentrating,
Feel Depressed, Everything an Effort, Trouble sleeping, and Feel Sad. This examination of the
seven core aspects of depression largely confirms the earlier findings that bank regulatory
reforms that improve credit conditions tend to reduce mental distress among low-income
individuals.
       Furthermore, we show that the results are robust to including state-specific linear time
trends. Although the analyses above include individual (and hence state) fixed effects, there
might be trends in state conditions that account for the reduction in depression following the
relaxation of interstate branching restrictions. When we control for state-specific linear time
trends, all of the results hold—as reported in Table 5. The point estimates are even larger. For the
Depression Index, the coefficient in column (1) suggests that one more degree of interstate bank
branch openness reduces the Depression Index by 0.522, a 15% drop relative to the sample mean.
When examining severe depression among the low-income group (D-Depression Index Above 8),
the estimated coefficient in column (2) indicates that one more degree of interstate branch
deregulation is associated with a drop in the probability of severe mental depression of about
3.8%. In the remainder of the analyses, we include state-specific linear time trends but all of the
results hold if these trends are excluded.
                                                                                                                      14




4.3 Spatial Regression Discontinuity Design
         We next employ a spatial regression discontinuity design to address concerns that omitted
variables bias the results. As argued by Huang (2008), geographically proximate counties across
a shared state border are likely to be similar in both observable variables (e.g., economic growth)
and unobservable—and hence omitted—variables. As a result, adjacent counties with different
bank branch regulations can be a good “match” with respect to observables and unobservables
and therefore provide an additional empirical strategy for assessing the impact of changes in
credit conditions on mental health. Employing this strategy, we compare changes in mental
health in adjacent counties across state borders with different and changing branching regulations.
         To implement the empirical design, we obtain 1990 state- and county-boundary data from
the U.S. Census and create contiguous county-pairs across state borders. 5 We then map this
county-pair data into our NLSY79 sample and re-perform the main tests above. We restrict the
sample to contiguous county-pairs in these analyses. We control for county-pair and gender-race-
year fixed effects, as well as state-specific linear time trends, in all regressions and cluster the
standard errors at the county-pair level.
         As shown in Table 6, the results from spatial regression discontinuity analyses confirm
the analyses above: interstate branch deregulation is associated with a sharp reduction in mental
illness among low-income individuals, but not among high-income individuals. Among the low-
income group distributed in contiguous counties along the state border, an increase in bank
branch deregulation is associated with a reduction in mental depression. 6

  One potential concern with these analyses is that because cross-state lending is not restricted, residents close to the
borders with other states may turn to those banking markets for credit. In this case, the bank regulations of the state
in which an individual is a resident might not matter much. Since people tend to borrow from geographically close
banks, we examine whether the reported results hold when eliminating county-pairs across state borders that are “too
close.” To define “too close,” we first note that Petersen and Rajan (2002) find (in their Table I, Panel A) that the
median distance between a firm and its lender is nine miles. Starting with this definition of “too close,” we first
measure the travel distance between the geographic centers of two contiguous counties and then drop county-pairs in
which the distance is less than nine miles. We try different cutoffs (see Table OA3) and confirm that the results
presented in Table 6 hold across different cutoff levels of closeness.
                                                                                                 15


5. Evidence on the Channels between Bank Branch Deregulation and Depression

       In this section, we use additional empirical strategies to provide evidence on the channels
connecting interstate bank branch deregulation and mental depression. We first consider the
“firm-credit channel,” which posits that interstate bank branch deregulation eased firm credit
constraints, which in turn boosted income and employment among workers, with positive
ramifications on mental health. As demonstrated by Rice and Strahan (2010), interstate bank
branch deregulation eased firm credit constraints. As shown above, interstate bank branch
deregulation reduced mental depression among low-income workers. We now assess whether
income, employment, and mental health improved primarily among individuals most likely to be
affected by an easing of firm credit triggered by interstate bank branch deregulation.
       To explore the firm-credit channel, we differentiate counties by the degree to which firms
in each county depend on external finance, where banks are the major providers of external
finance. The motivation is as follows: If branch deregulation improves mental health by easing
firm credit constraints and enhancing the economic conditions of workers, then we should find
an especially pronounced impact of deregulation on the economic conditions and mental health
of workers in counties where bank branch deregulation is likely to have the biggest effect on
firms: counties with firms that depend heavily on banks for external finance. To examine this
channel, we follow Rajan and Zingales (1998) and differentiate counties by the degree to which
firms are financially dependent. We then examine whether interstate branch deregulation exerts
an especially pronounced effect on mental health, employment, and income among low-income
workers in counties dominated by financially-dependent firms. As a robustness check, we
differentiate counties by the density of bank branches before bank branch deregulation. Holding
other features of the counties constant, we expect that bank branch deregulation will have a
bigger effect on economic conditions and mental health in “under-banked” counties than in
counties that are already densely banked before deregulation.
       Second, we consider the “consumer-credit channel.” The consumer-credit channel
suggests that bank deregulation eases individual credit constraints, which in turn allows
individuals to reduce economic stress, with positive ramifications on mental health. To shed
some empirical light on the consumer-credit channel, we assess whether interstate bank branch
deregulation triggers increased borrowing among the same group of individuals who experience
a drop in mental depression: low-income workers.
                                                                                                  16




5.1 Firm-credit Channel: External Financial Dependence (EFD)
       We now examine whether interstate bank branch deregulation triggered improvements in
income, employment, and mental health among individuals in counties where bank branch
deregulation is most likely to ease firm-credit constraints: counties with firms that depend
heavily on banks for external finance. We divide counties into those with firms that depend
heavily on external finance dependence (EFD) and those that do not. To obtain county-level EFD,
we first follow prior studies (Rajan and Zingales, 1998; Duchin, Ozbas and Sensoy, 2010) and
define each firm’s EFD as the ratio of capital expenditures minus net cash flows from operating
activities over the capital expenditures. We obtain data from Compustat and calculate the firm-
year EFD over a long time-series window 1980-2000. We first aggregate firm-level values to the
3-digit SIC industry-level and calculate annual EFD for that industry. We next take the median
of industry-year EFD over the long window (1980-2000) as the measurement of industry-level
EFD. To arrive at the county-level EFD, we retrieve data from County Business Patterns (CBP)
administered by the U.S. Census and compute the employment-weighted EFD across all 3-digit
SIC industries for each county-year. Finally, we average the county-year EFD over the pre-shock
period 1989-1991 to gauge a persistent measurement of county-level EFD. We split the low-
income group sample into low county EFD and high county EFD based on the county EFD
median. The results are reported in Table 7.
       In line with the firm-credit channel view, we find that low-income individuals living in
high EFD counties experience large improvements in mental health, employment, and income
following interstate branch deregulation but low-income individuals living in low EFD counties
do not. When focusing on low-income individuals in counties most likely to be influenced by
deregulation (high EFD counties), the estimated effect of branch deregulation on mental health is
large. From column (1) of Table 7, one more degree of interstate bank branch deregulation is
associated with a reduction in the Depression Index of 0.826 among low-income individuals in
high EFD counties, which represents a 23.5% drop relative to the sample mean. Table 7 results
are consistent with the view that interstate branch deregulation eases credit conditions among
firms that depend on banks for external finance and that this easing of credit constraints
improves the economic conditions of workers with positive repercussion on mental health.
Furthermore, consistent with the findings in Beck, Levine, and Levkov (2010) that
                                                                                                  17


improvements in bank operations exert a disproportionately positive influence on low-income
workers, we find that the positive effect of interstate branch deregulation on employment,
income, and mental health occurs among low-income individuals in high EFD counties.
       We also differentiate counties by bank density. The hypothesized economic mechanism is
as follows: The impact of interstate branch deregulation on firm-credit conditions in a county
will be larger if the county had lower bank density prior to interstate branch deregulation than if
the county was already heavily banked. Namely, since deregulation will tend to have bigger
positive effect on the availability of banking services and credit in previously under-banked
counties than in already densely-banked counties, deregulation will improve employment,
income, and mental health more in counties with low-density banking prior to deregulation. To
assess this view, we compile county-level branch density data, which is available from June 1994,
from the Sum of Deposits (SOD) files supported by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporate (FDIC).
We use pre-deregulation branch data from 1994 and compute the total number of branches per
county scaled by total county population. We split counties into low- and high-density counties
based on the median of this branch per capita indicator.
       These analyses also yield results consistent with the firm-credit channel view. As shown
in Table 8, we find that low-income individuals living in low pre-deregulation branch density
counties experience large improvements in employment, income, and mental health following
interstate branch deregulation. In contrast, low-income individuals living in high pre-
deregulation branch density counties do not experience significant gains in employment, income
or mental health. As with the county-level EFD results, these results on pre-deregulation branch
density at the county-level also support the firm-credit channel.


5.2 Consumer-Credit Channel
       We now consider the “consumer-credit channel.” Applied to our study of branch
deregulation and mental health, this channel suggests that interstate bank branch deregulation
improves credit conditions for individuals, so that they can borrow to smooth the vagaries of
economic life, reducing stress and mental illness. We shed empirical light on this potential
channel from interstate branch deregulation to mental depression by using two measures of
individual borrowing. Leverage equals the ratio of total liabilities excluding mortgages on
residential property (e.g., debts on farm/business/other property, debts on vehicles etc.) over total
                                                                                                     18


assets excluding the market value of residential property (e.g., total amount of money assets like
savings, market value of farm/business/other property, market value of all vehicles and all other
assets worth more than $500 etc.). D/I Ratio is the ratio of total liabilities excluding mortgages
on residential property as defined above over respondent’s total income (including wages,
salaries, and income from farm or business).
       As shown in Table 9, we find no evidence that interstate branch deregulation facilitates
borrowing by individuals most affected by deregulation: low-income workers. We also show that
the lack of an association between interstate branch deregulation and borrowing by individuals
holds in low- and high-EFD counties and in low and high pre-deregulation branch density
counties.


6. Conclusion
       In this paper, we examine the question: Do bank regulatory reforms that improve local
credit conditions reduce the incidence of mental depression? Research suggests both that (1) the
removal of restrictions on interstate bank branching eases credit conditions, spurs
entrepreneurship, and boosts earnings, especially the earnings of low-income workers, and (2)
economic duress, including low-incomes and unemployment, tends to increase mental depression.
Combined, these strands of research motivate the hypothesis that we examine: Bank regulatory
reforms that improve economic conditions will tend to reduce mental depression, especially
among low-income workers. Since improvement in the operation of banking systems tends to
spur “churn,” the more rapid entry and exit of firms, this can create uncertainty and anxiety
among workers that increase mental distress.
       We discover that the lowering of regulatory impediments to interstate branching reduced
mental health disease among low-income households, especially in counties dominated by firms
that depend heavily on banks. These results also hold when using a spatial regression
discontinuity design to compare contiguous counties across state borders with different interstate
branch regulations. On the mechanisms linking credit conditions and mental health, we find that
interstate branch deregulation boosted employment and income among low-income workers in
counties dominated by bank-dependent firms, which is consistent with the firm-credit channel
argument that interstate bank branch deregulation eased firm credit constraints, which in turn
boosted income and employment among workers, with positive ramifications on mental health.

Table 1. Summary Statistics
This table summarizes descriptive statistics for the main variables. The sample period ranges from 1992 to
2005, in line with the data availability for our key mental health variables. Each respondent is surveyed three
times over the depression symptoms, the first in 1992, the second in 1994 and the final when (s)he turns age 40
(over 1998-2005). Our variable of interest, IBBEA Index, takes the value from 0 (most restrictive) to 4 (most
deregulated). All other variables are defined in Appendix 1.

Table 2. Bank Branching Deregulation and Total Score of CES-Depression Scale
This table reports OLS regression results of the effect of the interstate bank branching deregulation on total score of CES- Depression Scale over 1992 to
2005. Each respondent has three observations for Depression Index, one in 1992, one in 1994 and one when (s)he turns age 40. Column (1) to (3) report
the results conditioning on state and gender-race-year fixed effects, and column (4) to (6) further include individual fixed effects. Column (1) and (4)
report the results in the full sample, and column (2) and (3), (5) and (6) report results in the low- and high-income group respectively. The dependent
variable is Depression Index, ranging from 0 (least depressed) to 21 (most depressed). The key independent variable is IBBEA Index, ranging from 0
(most restrictive) to 4 (most deregulated). Education denotes the highest grade/years of schooling completed by the respondent, ranging from 0 (never
attend school) to 20 (8th year college or more). Age is the difference between the birth year and the survey year. FamilyIncome7981 is the natural
logarithm of one plus the average total family income (in 2010 dollars) over 1979 to 1981. MotherEducation and FatherEducation measure maximum
years of schooling received by the respondent's parents. D-LiveWithParents equals one if the respondent lived with both parents at the age 14.
AFQTAbilityTest is the normalized percentile score after controlling for age groups among all the respondents in the 1980 survey. A higher percentile
indicates better learning aptitude. RosenbergSelfEsteem is an aggregate score ranging from 0 to 30 in the 1987 survey to measure the respondent's self-
evaluation of personal worth. A higher value indicates a higher level of self-esteem. PearlinSenseOfControl is an aggregate score ranging from 7 to 28 in
the 1992 survey to measure the respondent's sense of control over one's life. A higher value indicates a more positive self-concept and a stronger internal
control over one's destiny. D-RiskAttitude is a dummy variable that equals one if the respondent answers “Yes” facing the question “Would you take job
that could either double family income or cut income by a third” in the 1993 survey, and zero otherwise. State controls include log of GSP per capita and
log of total population. All regressions use the sample weights provided by NLSY79. Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors clustered at the state level
are in parentheses. We test the coefficient difference between the high- and low-income group and p-value is reported in the last row. *, **, and ***
indicate significance at 10%, 5%, and 1%.

Table 3. Bank Branching Deregulation and Answers’ Distribution of CES-Depression Scale
This table reports OLS regression results of the effect of the interstate bank branching deregulation on the choice distribution of the CES-Depression
Scale in the low-income group over 1992 to 2005. D-Depression Index Above 8, D-Depression Index Above 10, D-Depression Index Above 12
respectively represents a dummy variable that equals one if Depression Index is above the cutoff 8/10/12, and zero otherwise. This set of dummies can
measure the likelihood of clinical major depression. CES-Depression Scale is made up of seven statements evaluating the level of depression symptoms
over the last week and respondents choose from the following four alternatives as their ratings: (1) Rarely/None of the time/1 Day (respondents choose 0
as the answer), (2) Some/A little of the time/1-2 Days (respondents choose 1 as the answer), (3) Occasionally/Moderate amount of the time/3-4 Days
(respondents choose 2 as the answer), (4) Most/All of the times/5-7 Days (respondents choose 3 as the answer). % of Answers “0,” % of Answers “1,” %
of Answers “2” and % of Answers “3” respectively denotes the percentage of choosing 0/1/2/3 as the ratings among the seven statements. The key
independent variable is IBBEA Index, ranging from 0 (most restrictive) to 4 (most deregulated). State controls include log of GSP per capita and log of
total population. We include individual and gender-race-year fixed effects in all columns. All regressions use the sample weights provided by NLSY79.
Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors clustered at the state level are in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significance at 10%, 5%, and 1%.

Table 4. Bank Branching Deregulation and Seven Dimensions of CES-Depression Scale
This table reports OLS regression results of the effect of the interstate bank branching deregulation on seven dimensions of the CES-Depression Scale in
the low-income group over 1992 to 2005. CES-Depression Scale is made up of seven statements evaluating the level of depression symptoms over the
last week and respondents choose from the following four alternatives as their ratings: (1) Rarely/None of the time/1 Day (respondents choose 0 as the
answer), (2) Some/A little of the time/1-2 Days (respondents choose 1 as the answer), (3) Occasionally/Moderate amount of the time/3-4 Days
(respondents choose 2 as the answer), (4) Most/All of the times/5-7 Days (respondents choose 3 as the answer). Trouble Eating is “I did not feel like
eating; my appetite was poor”. Trouble Concentrating is “I had trouble keeping my mind on what I was doing”. Feel Depressed is “I feel depressed”.
Everything an Effort is “I felt that everything I did was an effort”. Trouble sleeping is “My sleep was restless”. Feel Sad is “I felt sad”. Lethargic is “I
could not get ‘going’”. The key independent variable is IBBEA Index, ranging from 0 (most restrictive) to 4 (most deregulated). State controls include log
of GSP per capita and log of total population. We include individual and gender-race-year fixed effects in all columns. All regressions use the sample
weights provided by NLSY79. Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors clustered at the state level are in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significance
at 10%, 5%, and 1%.

Table 5. Bank Branching Deregulation and CES-Depression Scale-Robustness Checks
This table reports robustness checks on OLS regression results of the effect of the interstate bank branching deregulation on the CES-Depression Scale in
the low-income group over 1992 to 2005, by further considering state-level linear time trends. Depression Index ranges from 0 (least depressed) to 21
(most depressed). D-Depression Index Above 8, D-Depression Index Above 10, D-Depression Index Above 12 respectively represents a dummy variable
that equals one if Depression Index is above the cutoff 8/10/12, and zero otherwise. This set of dummies can measure the likelihood of clinical major
depression. The key independent variable is IBBEA Index, ranging from 0 (most restrictive) to 4 (most deregulated). State controls include log of GSP per
capita and log of total population. We include individual and gender-race-year fixed effects, as well as state-level linear time trends in all columns. All
regressions use the sample weights provided by NLSY79. Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors clustered at the state level are in parentheses. *, **,

Table 6. Spatial Regression Discontinuity Design
This table presents OLS regression results of the effect of the interstate bank branching deregulation on the CES-Depression Scale over 1992 to 2005.
Odd columns report the results in the low-income group and even columns report the results in the high income. We exploit a spatial regression
discontinuity design and restrict the sample to the contiguous county-pairs across the state borders. Depression Index ranges from 0 (least depressed) to
21 (most depressed) and measures the severity of depression symptoms. D-Depression Index Above 8, D-Depression Index Above 10, D-Depression
Index Above 12 respectively represents a dummy variable that equals one if Depression Index is above the cutoff 8/10/12, and zero otherwise. This set of
dummies can measure the likelihood of clinical major depression. The key independent variable is IBBEA Index, ranging from 0 (most restrictive) to 4
(most deregulated). State controls include log of GSP per capita and log of total population. We include county-pair and gender-race-year fixed effects, as
well as state-level linear time trends in all columns. Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors clustered at the county-pair level are in parentheses. We test
the coefficient difference between the high- and low-income and p-value is reported in the last row. *, **, and *** indicate significance at 10%, 5%, and
1%.

Table 7. Labor Market Outcomes: Cross-County Heterogeneity by Local External Finance Dependence
This table presents OLS regression results of the firm-credit channel tests by exploiting the heterogeneous responses in the low income group between
residents living in counties with high` and low external finance dependence (EFD). Following the literature (Rajan and Zingales 1998; Duchin, Ozbas and
Sensoy 2010), we define EFD as the ratio of capital expenditures minus net cash flows from operating activities over the capital expenditures. We first
aggregate firm-level values to the 3-digit SIC industry-level and calculate annual EFD for each industry. We next take the median of industry-year EFD
over the long window (1980-2000) as the measurement of industry-level EFD. To arrive at the county-level EFD, we compute the employment-weighted
EFD across all 3-digit SIC industries for each county-year. Then we average the county-year EFD over the pre-shock period 1989-1991 to gauge a
persistent measurement of county-level EFD. We split the low-income group sample into low county EFD and high county EFD based on the county
EFD median. Depression Index ranges from 0 (least depressed) to 21 (most depressed) and measures the severity of depression symptoms. D-WorkHours
is a dummy variable that equals one if the respondent participates in the job market and has positive working hours in a given year, and zero otherwise.
Log(WorkHours) denotes natural logarithm of one plus total number of hours worked in a given year. Log(EmptWeeks) denotes the natural logarithm of
one plus total employment weeks in a given year. Log(TotalIncome) is the natural logarithm of one plus the respondent’s total income (in 2010 dollars),
including wages, salaries, and income from farm or business. The key independent variable is IBBEA Index, ranging from 0 (most restrictive) to 4 (most
deregulated). State controls include log of GSP per capita and log of total population. We include individual and gender-race-year fixed effects, as well as
state-level linear time trends in all columns. All regressions use the sample weights provided by NLSY79. Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors
clustered at the state level are in parentheses. We test the coefficient difference between the high and low EFD counties and p-value is reported in the last
row. *, **, and *** indicate significance at 10%, 5%, and 1%.

Table 8. Labor Market Outcomes: Cross-County Heterogeneity by Local Credit Condition
This table presents OLS regression results of the firm-credit channel tests by exploiting the heterogeneous responses in the low-income group between
residents living in counties with high and low branch density. We utilize the pre-shock branch density data in 1994 and first totalize the county-level
number of branches before the deregulation. We then scale this raw density by county total population. We split the low-income group sample into high
county branch density and low county branch density based on the county density median. Depression Index ranges from 0 (least depressed) to 21 (most
depressed) and measures the severity of depression symptoms. D-WorkHours is a dummy variable that equals one if the respondent participates in the job
market and has positive working hours in a given year, and zero otherwise. Log(WorkHours) denotes natural logarithm of one plus total number of hours
worked in a given year. Log(EmpWeeks) denotes the natural logarithm of one plus total employment weeks in a given year. Log(TotalIncome) is the
natural logarithm of one plus the respondent’s total income (in 2010 dollars), including wages, salaries, and income from farm or business. The key
independent variable is IBBEA Index, ranging from 0 (most restrictive) to 4 (most deregulated). State controls include log of GSP per capita and log of

Table 9. Bank Branching Deregulation and Leverage
This table reports OLS regression results of the effect of the interstate bank branching deregulation on leverage condition in the low-income group over
1992 to 2005. Leverage is the ratio of total liabilities excluding mortgages on residential property (e.g., debts on farm/business/other property, debts on
vehicles etc.) over total assets excluding market value of residential property (e.g., total amount of money assets like savings, market value of
farm/business/other property, market value of all vehicles and all other assets worth more than $500 etc.). D/I Ratio is the ratio of total liabilities
excluding mortgages on residential property (e.g., debts on farm/business/other property, debts on vehicles etc.) over respondent’s total income (including
wages, salaries, and income from farm or business). The key independent variable is IBBEA Index, ranging from 0 (most restrictive) to 4 (most
deregulated). State controls include log of GSP per capita and log of total population. We include individual and gender-race-year fixed effects, as well as
state-level linear time trends in all columns. All regressions use the sample weights provided by NLSY79. Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors

Partitioning Variables
Individual-Level Partitioning Variable
                                 We first average total income (in 2010 dollars), including wages, salaries and
                                 income from farm or business, for each respondent over a three-year window

                                 (1989-1991) just before the sample period (1992-2005). We then divide the
                                 whole sample into high and low groups based on the state median income.
                                                                                                                      37


County-Level Partitioning Variables
                                Following the literature (Rajan and Zingales, 1998; Duchin, Ozbas and
                                Sensoy, 2010), we define EFD as the ratio of capital expenditures minus net
                                cash flows from operating activities over the capital expenditures. We first
                                aggregate firm-level values to the 3-digit SIC industry-level and calculate
                                annual EFD for each industry. We next take the median of industry-year EFD
                                over the long window (1980-2000) as the measurement of industry-level
External Finance Dependence                                                                                    Compustat, CBP
                                EFD. To arrive at the county-level EFD, we compute the employment-
                                weighted EFD across all 3-digit SIC industries for each county-year. Then we
                                average the county-year EFD over the pre-shock period 1989-1991 to gauge
                                a persistent measurement of county-level EFD. We split the low-income
                                group sample into low county EFD and high county EFD based on the county
                                EFD median.
                                We utilize the pre-shock branch density data in 1994 and first totalize the
                                county-level number of branches before the deregulation. We then scale this
Branch Density                  raw density by county total population. We split the low-income group          FDIC
                                sample into high county branch density and low county branch density based
                                on the county density median.

Table OA1. Online Appendix. Bank Branching Deregulation and Clinical Depression Severity
This table repeats table 3 and reports OLS regression results of the effect of the interstate bank branching deregulation on the choice distribution of the
CES-Depression Scale in the high-income group over 1992 to 2005. D-Depression Index Above 8, D-Depression Index Above 10, D-Depression Index
Above 12 respectively represents a dummy variable that equals one if Depression Index is above the cutoff 8/10/12, and zero otherwise. This set of
dummies can measure the likelihood of clinical major depression. CES-Depression Scale is made up of seven statements evaluating the level of
depression symptoms over the last week and respondents choose from the following four alternatives as their ratings: (1) Rarely/None of the time/1 Day
(respondents choose 0 as the answer), (2) Some/A little of the time/1-2 Days (respondents choose 1 as the answer), (3) Occasionally/Moderate amount of
the time/3-4 Days (respondents choose 2 as the answer), (4) Most/All of the times/5-7 Days (respondents choose 3 as the answer). % of Answers “0,” %
of Answers “1,” % of Answers “2” and % of Answers “3” respectively denotes the percentage of choosing 0/1/2/3 as the ratings among the seven

Table OA2. Online Appendix. Bank Branching Deregulation and Seven Dimensions of CES-Depression Scale
This table repeats table 4 and reports OLS regression results of the effect of the interstate bank branching deregulation on seven dimensions of the CES-
Depression Scale in the high-income group over 1992 to 2005. CES-Depression Scale is made up of seven statements evaluating the level of depression
symptoms over the last week and respondents choose from the following four alternatives as their ratings: (1) Rarely/None of the time/1 Day
(respondents choose 0 as the answer), (2) Some/A little of the time/1-2 Days (respondents choose 1 as the answer), (3) Occasionally/Moderate amount of
the time/3-4 Days (respondents choose 2 as the answer), (4) Most/All of the times/5-7 Days (respondents choose 3 as the answer). Trouble Eating is “I
did not feel like eating; my appetite was poor”. Trouble Concentrating is “I had trouble keeping my mind on what I was doing”. Feel Depressed is “I feel
depressed”. Everything an Effort is “I felt that everything I did was an effort”. Trouble sleeping is “My sleep was restless”. Feel Sad is “I felt sad”.
Lethargic is “I could not get ‘going’”. The key independent variable is IBBEA Index, ranging from 0 (most restrictive) to 4 (most deregulated). State
controls include log of GSP per capita and log of total population. We include individual and gender-race-year fixed effects in all columns. All
regressions use the sample weights provided by NLSY79. Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors clustered at the state level are in parentheses. *, **,
and *** indicate significance at 10%, 5%, and 1%.

Table OA3. Online Appendix. Spatial Regression Discontinuity Design-Robustness Checks
This table presents OLS regression results of the effect of the interstate bank branching deregulation on the CES-Depression Scale in the low-income
group over 1992 to 2005 under different distance cutoffs, to mitigate cross-state lending concern. We exploit a spatial regression discontinuity design and
restrict the sample to the contiguous county-pairs across the state borders. We further drop county-pairs with very close travel distance to address cross-
state lending issue. We measure the distance in miles using the travel distance between two contiguous counties. Depression Index ranges from 0 (least
depressed) to 21 (most depressed) and measures the severity of depression symptoms. The key independent variable is IBBEA Index, ranging from 0
(most restrictive) to 4 (most deregulated). State controls include log of GSP per capita and log of total population. We include county-pair and gender-
race-year fixed effects, as well as state-level linear time trends in all columns. Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors clustered at the county-pair level
are in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significance at 10%, 5%, and 1%.
