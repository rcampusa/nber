The Induced Innovation Hypothesis
and Energy-Saving Technological Change

NBER Working Paper No. 6437
March 1998

                                            ABSTRACT

        It follows from Hicks’ induced innovation hypothesis that rising energy prices in the last two
decades should have induced energy-saving innovation. We formulate the hypothesis concretely
using a product-characteristics model of energy-using consumer durables, augmenting Hicks’
hypothesis to allow for the possibility that government efficiency standards also induce innovation.
Through estimation of characteristics transformation surfaces, we find that technological change
reduced the total capital and operating costs of air conditioning by one-half and water heating by
about one-fifth. Although the rate of overall innovation in these products appears to be independent
of energy prices and regulations, the evidence suggests that the direction of innovation has been
responsive to energy price changes. In particular, energy price increases induced innovation in a
direction that lowered the capital cost tradeoffs inherent in producing more energy-efficient products.
In addition, energy price changes induced changes in the subset of technically feasible models that
were offered for sale. Our estimates indicate that about one-quarter to one-half of the improvements
in mean energy-efficiency of the menu of new models for these products over the last two decades
were associated with rising energy prices since 1973. We also find that this responsiveness to price
changes increased substantially after product labeling requirements came into effect, and that
minimum efficiency standards had a significant positive effect on average efficiency levels.
Nonetheless, a sizeable portion of efficiency improvements in these technologies appears to have been
autonomous.
