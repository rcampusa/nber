                                             ABSTRACT


        What is the effect of trade on a country’s environment, for a given level of GDP? Some have

observed an apparent positive correlation between openness to trade and measures of environmental

quality. But this could be due to endogeneity of trade, rather than causality. This paper uses

exogenous determinants of trade – geographical variables from the gravity model – as instruments

to isolate the effect of openness. The finding is that trade may indeed have a beneficial effect on

three measures of air pollution. Statistical significance is lacking for Particulate Matter, but is

moderate for NO2, and high for SO2. Results for broader environmental measures are not as

encouraging, but one can at least say that there is little evidence that trade has the detrimental effect

on the environment that the race-to-the-bottom theory would lead one to expect. The larger effect

appears to come via income itself: our results generally support the environmental Kuznets curve,

which says that growth harms the environment at low levels of income and helps at high levels, and

to support the proposition that openness to trade accelerates the growth process.

                 Is Trade Good or Bad for the Environment?
                             Sorting Out the Causality

                             Jeffrey Frankel and Andrew Rose



        Opponents of globalization usually do not argue that trade is bad for economic

growth, as measured by GDP. Rather they fear adverse effects on such “non-economic”

objectives as environmental quality.1 If the term globalization is meant to capture the

totality of industrialization, then there is little question that, at least at the early stages of

economic development, environmental degradation is a consequence. If the human

species still consisted of a few thousand hunter-gatherers, for example, man-made

pollution would be close to zero. This is not the interesting question, however. The

interesting questions are (1) whether economic growth eventually brings environmental

improvement and (2) whether cross-border integration helps or hurts in this process.

That first question is the much-studied environmental Kuznets curve, while the second is

the focus of this paper.



        1. Hypotheses



        The paper seeks to disentangle a variety of simultaneous causal relationships, on a

cross-country data set. The question of central interest is the effect of international trade


1
  The quotation marks are necessary around “non-economic,” because economists’
conceptual framework fully incorporates such objectives as environmental quality, even
though pollution is an externality that is not measured by GDP. Frankel (2002) reviews
recent controversies surrounding globalization and the environment.

on the environment, for a given level of GDP. We consider certain causal relationships

as already fairly well established:



       1) Openness has a positive effect on countries’ real income per capita.

           Economists have long made the theoretical case, from the Smith-Ricardo idea

           of comparative advantage to the Helpman-Krugman model of trade under

           imperfect competition. The empirical case is also moderately strong.



       2) Output has a positive effect on pollution through the physical scale of

           production, but at the same time,



       3) At higher levels of income per capita, growth raises the public’s demand for

           environmental quality, which, given the right institutions, can translate into

           environmental regulation. People value both their economic standard of

           living as measured by GDP and the environment as well. Environmental

           regulation, if effective, then translates into a cleaner environment. The ratio

           of pollution to GDP can be improved through a composition channel and a

           technique channel. While the effects described under propositions (2) and (3)

           go opposite directions, there is by now a rough conventional wisdom that the

           negative effect of growth on environmental quality dominates at low levels of

           income, while the positive effect may dominate at higher levels. This

           proposition is:
                                              3

       4) The environmental Kuznets curve: the relationship between income per capita

           and some kinds of pollution is roughly shaped as an inverted U. The World

           Bank (1992) and Grossman and Krueger (1993, 1995) brought to public

           attention this empirical finding.2 Growth is bad for air and water pollution at

           the initial stages of industrialization, but later on reduces pollution, as

           countries become rich enough to pay to clean up their environments. The

           standard theoretical rationale is that production technology makes some

           pollution inevitable, but that demand for environmental quality rises with

           income. 3




2
  Grossman and Kruger (1993, 1995) found the Kuznets curve pattern for urban air
pollution (SO2 and smoke) and several measures of water pollution. Selden and Song
(1994) found the pattern for SO2, suspended particulate matter (PM), NOx, and carbon
monoxide. Shafik (1994) found evidence of the U shape for deforestation, suspended
PM, and SO2, but less for water pollution and some other measures. Among more recent
studies, Hilton and Levinson (1998) find the U-shaped relationship for automotive lead
emissions and Bradford, Schlieckert and Shore (2000) find some evidence of the
environmental Kuznets curve for arsenic, COD, dissolved oxygen, lead and SO2, while
finding less evidence in the cases of PM and some other measures of pollution. Bimonte
(2001) finds the relationship for the percentage of land that is protected area, within
national territory. Harbaugh, Levinson, and Wilson (2000) point out that the relationship
is very sensitive with respect, for example, to functional form and updating of the data
set.
3
  Theoretical derivations include Andreoni and Levinson (1998), Jaeger and Kolpin
(2000), Selden and Song (1995) and Stokey (1998), among others. Another explanation is
that the compositional pattern results from the stages of economic development, the
transition from an agrarian economy to manufacturing to services (Arrow, et al, 1995;
Panayotou, 1993). This explanation is not inconsistent with the usual view, but it is less
likely to require the mechanism of effective government regulation. In terms of our
testable implications, if the Kuznets curve results solely from this composition effect,
then high incomes should lead to a better environment even in the absence of democracy
at the national level and even when externalities arise at the international level.
                                               4

        To portray the Kuznets curve as claiming that if countries promote growth, the

environment will eventually take care of itself, would be an unfair caricature. This

optimistic view applies to pollution only if it is largely confined within the home or

within the firm.4 Most pollution, such as SO2, NOx, etc., is external to the home or firm.

For such externalities, higher income and a popular desire to clean up the environment

are not enough. There must also be effective government regulation, which usually

requires a democratic system to translate the popular will into action (something that was

missing in the Soviet Union, for example), as well as the rule of law and reasonably

intelligent mechanisms of regulation. That is at the national level; the requirements for

dealing with cross-border externalities are greater still.

        We will be testing the environmental Kuznets curve, along with the other

propositions on this list. But it is not the central focus of the paper.

        The central focus of the paper is, rather:

        5) The effect of trade on the environment for a given level of income per capita.

        This is an interesting question for two reasons. First, it is perhaps the most

relevant fundamental question for policy. If it were established that trade had an adverse

effect on the environment solely because openness raised countries’ incomes, and the

higher incomes damaged the environment, in practice few would conclude from this that




4
 Perhaps 80 percent (by population) of world exposure to particulates comes from
cooking fire smoke in poor countries, which need not involve any externality.
Chaudhuri and Pfaff (2002) find a U-shaped relationship between income and indoor
smoke, across households. In the poorest households, rising incomes mean more cooking
and more indoor pollution. Still-higher incomes allow a switch to cleaner fuels. Engel
curves can produce the relationship, with no role for government regulation.
                                             5

we should try to turn back the clock on globalization. Few would choose deliberate self-

impoverishment as a means to a clean environment.5

       Secondly, the question is interesting because the answer is completely unknown.

There are possible effects in both directions. Most widely discussed is the race to the

bottom hypothesis, which says that countries that are open to international trade (and

investment) will adopt looser standards of environmental regulation, out of fear of a loss

in international competitiveness.6

       Less widely recognized is the possibility of an effect in the opposite direction,

which we will call the gains from trade hypothesis. Trade allows countries to attain

more of what they want, which includes environmental goods in addition to market-

measured output. How could openness have a positive effect on environmental quality,

even for a given level of GDP per capita? One widely identified possibility is an

international ratcheting up of environmental standards.7 A second possibility concerns




5
   Meadows, et al (1972), and Daly (1993), could, however, be interpreted as arguing that
trade is necessarily bad because it raises measured GDP which in turn harms the
environment. For a general survey of the issues, see Esty (2001).
6
   What is competitiveness? Economists tend to argue that concerns regarding
international competitiveness, if interpreted as fears of trade deficits, are misplaced,
which would seem to imply they would not affect rational policy-making. Or else, to the
extent competitiveness concerns can be interpreted as downward pressure on regulation
commensurate with cost considerations, economists figure that they may be appropriate.
But Esty and Gerardin (1998, p. 17-21) point out that competitiveness fears, under actual
political economy conditions, may have a greater effect on environmental standards than
is rational, particularly by creating a political drag against new regulation.
7
  E.g., Vogel (1995), Porter (1995), and Braithwaite and Drahos (2000). This ratcheting
up may be more effective for product standards than for standards regarding production
processes and methods.
                                             6

technological and managerial innovation.8 Multi-national corporations tend to bring

clean state-of-the-art production techniques from high-standard countries of origin, to

host countries where they are not yet known, for several reasons:

       “First, many companies find that the efficiency of having a single set of
       management practices, pollution control technologies, and training programmes
       geared to a common set of standards outweighs any cost advantage that might be
       obtained by scaling back on environmental investments at overseas facilities.
       Second, multinational enterprises often operate on a large scale, and recognise
       that their visibility makes them especially attractive targets for local enforcement
       officials...Third, the prospect of liability for failing to meet standards often
       motivates better environmental performance...” -- Esty and Gentry (1997, p.161)


Trade economists think that openness encourages ongoing innovation, that this may be

why countries that trade more appear to experience a sustained increase in growth rather

than just the one-time increase in the level of real income predicted by classical trade

theory. Trade speeds the absorption of frontier technologies and best-practice

management. It then seems likely that openness could encourage innovation that would

be beneficial to environmental improvement as well as economic progress.

       Another possibility is that, because trade offers consumers the opportunity to

consume goods of greater variety, it allows countries to attain higher levels of welfare

(for any given level of domestically produced output), which, as under proposition (3)

above, will raise the demand for environmental quality. Again, if the appropriate




8
 Esty and Gentry (1997, pp. 157, 161, 163) and Schmidheiny (1992). Eskeland and
Harrison (2002) find that, within given sectors in given developing countries, foreign
plants are significantly more energy efficient and use cleaner types of energy than
domestic plants.
                                               7

institutions are in place, this demand for higher environmental quality will translate into

effective regulation and the desired reduction in pollution.9



       Whether the race-to-the-bottom effect dominates the gains-from-trade effect is an

empirical question.



       Figure 1 is a schematic illustration of the causal relationships that are

hypothesized above, and several others as well. Two controversial propositions are:

       6) The pollution haven hypothesis: To the extent that countries are open to trade

           and investment, some (e.g., those with low demand for environmental quality)

           will adopt lax environmental standards to attract multinational corporations

           and export pollution-intensive goods, while others (e.g., those with high

           demand for environmental quality) will adopt high standards and import

           pollution-intensive goods. It is worth emphasizing one of the differences

           between the race-to-the-bottom hypothesis and the pollution haven

           hypothesis: while the former implies an overall world level of environmental

           regulation that is less than optimal, the latter does not. Some countries may




9
  A final possibility is that globalization offers interest groups that care particularly about
the environment new weapons. Domestically, they can threaten to block the trend
toward free trade unless they are bought off. [This is by analogy with the “embedded
liberalism” identified by Ruggie (1982), a post-war quid pro quo that gave workers an
increased level of social protection, in exchange for an open international trading
regime.] Across borders, the new weapons include consumer labeling for imports and
corporate codes of conduct for multinationals.
                                               8

             choose high environmental standards for their own production, and import

             from others goods that embody pollution.10



          7) The Porter hypothesis: a tightening of environmental regulation stimulates

             technological innovation and thereby has positive effects on both the economy

             and the environment -- for example, saving money by saving energy.11 The

             analytical rationale for this view is not entirely clear. (Is the claim that any

             sort of change in regulation, regardless in what direction, stimulates

             innovation, or is there something special about pro-environment regulation?

             Is there something special about the energy sector?) Nevertheless the Porter

             hypothesis is sufficiently widely discussed that it merits a position on our list

             of propositions to be taken into account.




10
   Some economists’ research suggests that environmental regulation is not a major
determinant of firms’ ability to compete internationally. When deciding where to locate,
multinational firms seem to pay far more attention to such issues as labor costs and
market access than to the stringency of local environmental regulation: Jaffe, Peterson,
Portney and Stavins (1995), Low and Yeats (1992), and Tobey (1990). Other empirical
researchers, however, have found more of an effect of environmental regulation: Lee and
Roland-Holst (1997) and Smarzynska and Wei (2001). Theoretical analyses include
Copeland and Taylor (1994, 1995, 2001) and Liddle (2001).

       2. Endogeneity



       This list of propositions includes important possible causal arrows running in both

directions among each pair out of the three key endogneous variables – trade, income,

and the environment. In estimating a system of equations, the simultaneity problems are

formidable. Let us say that we find a positive correlation between trade and

environmental quality. Eiras and Schaeffer (2001, p. 4), for example, find: “In countries

with an open economy, the average environmental sustainability score is more than 30

percent higher than the scores of countries with moderately open economies, and almost

twice as high as those of countries with closed economies.” Does this mean that trade is

good for the environment? Not necessarily. It might be a result of the Porter hypothesis

-- environmental regulation stimulates productivity -- together with the positive effect of

income on trade. Or it might be because democracy leads to higher levels of

environmental regulation, and democracy is causally intertwined with income and trade.

       A couple of studies seek to isolate the independent effect of openness. Harbaugh,

Levinson, and Wilson (2000, Table 4) report (in passing) a beneficial effect of trade on

the environment, controlling for income. Antweiler, Copeland and Taylor (2001), which

is probably the most careful existing study explicitly focused on the effects of trade on

the environment, estimates an effect that is favorable (though only of borderline

significance, statistically speaking). But neither study makes allowance for the problem

that trade may be the result of other factors rather than the cause.

       Or let us say that we were to find a negative correlation between trade and

environmental quality. Does this mean that trade is bad for the environment? Not
                                                 11

necessarily. It might be a result of a negative effect of environmental regulation on

growth, together with the positive effect of growth on trade.12

        The endogeneity of trade is a familiar problem in the empirical literature on whether

openness promotes growth. Rodrik (1995), for example, argues that the common finding of

a positive correlation between trade and per capita income is "quite misleading on the

importance it attaches to the role of export-orientation in the growth performance. It also

has backward the causal relationship between exports, on the one hand, and investment and

growth on the other."     Similarly, Helpman (1988, p.6) asks "Does growth drive trade, or is

there a reverse link from trade to growth?" Harrison (1995) concludes that "existing

literature is still unresolved on the issue of causality."

        Quite a few stories of reverse causality, running from income to trade, are possible.

The mechanism that Rodrik, or Levine and Renelt (1992), have in mind runs as follows: an

exogenous increase in investment in a developing country with a comparative disadvantage

in producing capital goods will necessitate an increase in imports of such goods. Another

mechanism is that trade might rise with income because foreign goods are superior goods in

consumption. Many studies have sought to identify some direct measures of trade policy,

hoping that they are exogenous.        But, aside from difficulties in measuring trade policies,

which are typically serious enough, a fundamental conceptual problem of simultaneity

remains (e.g., Sala-i-Martin, 1991).        What if free-market trade policies are no more

important to growth than free-market domestic policies, but tend to be correlated with them?



12
  The same ambiguity attaches to correlations among the other pairs of variables. For
example, Esty and Porter (2001) find a positive correlation between income and
environmental regulation. Their preferred interpretation is the Porter hypothesis, but they
are obligate to admit that “These findings do not establish causality.” (p. 26).
                                               12

Then openness will be observed to be correlated with growth, even though trade does not

cause growth. A final possible mechanism is a pattern whereby poor countries tend to

depend fiscally on tariff revenue, and to reduce tariffs as they become more developed.

          What is needed is a good instrumental variable, which is exogenous yet highly

correlated with trade. The gravity model of bilateral trade offers a solution. This model

says that trade is determined by indicators of country size (GDP, population, and land

area) and of distance between the pair of countries in question (physical distance as well

as dummy variables indicating common borders, linguistic links, and landlocked

status).13 Such geographical variables are plausibly exogenous. Yet when aggregated

across all bilateral trading partners these variables are highly correlated with a country’s

overall trade, and thus make good instrumental variables. Such gravity instruments have

recently been used to isolate the effect of trade in studies of growth (Frankel and Romer,

1999; Irwin and Tervio, 2001), studies of currency union (Frankel and Rose, 1996, 2002),

and studies of inequality (Chakrabarti, 2000, and Gurkaynak and Krashinsky, 2001).

          Income too is endogenous.        We thus also use a second set of instrumental

variables, for income per capita, from the growth literature: lagged income (the

conditional convergence hypothesis), size (Frankel and Romer, 1999; Frankel and Rose,

2002), and rates of investment rates and human capital formation (the factor

accumulation variables familiar from neoclassical growth equations: Solow, 1956; Barro,

1991; Mankiw, Romer and Weil, 1992).

          As always, there is the possibility that some of our instrumental variables are in

truth endogenous. This could be an issue with the factor accumulation variables in the


13
     Frankel (1997) offers a comprehensive review of the gravity model.
                                                  13

income equation: Concern has been expressed that investment is endogenous, or that

human capital is.14 To us, the geographic variables seem the least likely to be

endogenous, not just in a causal sense, but also in the econometric sense, i.e., correlated

with the error term in the trade equation. These are the instruments we need for testing

our question of central interest, the effects of trade on the environment for a given level

of income.



       3. Results



       We estimate a system of two equations:

Growth equation:

        ln(Y/Pop) 90,i = β 0 + α ([X + M]/Y) 90,i + β1ln(Pop) i + φZ i
                                                                                           (1)
        + γln(Y/Pop) 70,i + δ 1 (I/Y)i + δ 2 n i + δ 3 (School1)i + δ 4 (School2)i + u i

The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of GDP (Y) divided by total population

(Pop) at the end of 1990, measured in real PPP-adjusted dollars for country i. Aggregate

exports, aggregate imports, and gross investment are denoted “X”, “M” and “I”

respectively. The growth rate of population is denoted “n”. “School1” and “School2” are

estimates of human capital investment based, respectively, on primary and secondary

schooling enrollment rates. “Z” denotes other controls; Greek letters denote coefficients;

and “u” denotes the residual impact of other, hopefully orthogonal influences. We denote

second line of the equation: initial income, investment, human capital and population

growth.15    Variables other than GDP per capita and openness are computed as averages

over the sample period. Following the norm in the growth literature, we measure

openness as the ratio of trade to output.



Environmental quality equation:

                EnviroDamagei = ϕ 0 + ϕ 1 (Y / pop1 ) 90,i + ϕ 2 (Y / pop 2 ) 90,i
                                                                                      2

The dependent variable is any of three of measures of pollution or other measures of

environmental damage, each estimated as separate equations. The first two variables are

per capita income and per capita income squared, for country i. The EKC hypothesis

predicts that the coefficient on the latter is negative, so that the pollution curve eventually

turns down. As an alternative to the quadratic functional form, we also tried the three

segments of a spline (split at the .33 and .66 percentiles) fit to the natural logarithm of per

capita income. Per capita income is again defined as real 1990 GDP (Y) divided by total

population (Pop), taken from the Penn World Table 5.6, which is measured in real PPP-

adjusted dollars. Aggregate exports and aggregate imports as before are denoted “X” and



15
   Frankel and Romer (1999) and Irwin and Tervio (2000) adopt a more stripped-down
specification by omitting these controls, following Hall and Jones (1999). They regress
output per capita against distance from the equator and measures of country size,
reasoning that the factor accumulation variables might be endogenous. Including the
controls in the output equation might result in a downward-biased estimate of α, if some
of the effect of openness arrives via factor accumulation. But inappropriately excluding
these variables would also produce biased results and could be expected improperly to
attribute too large an effect to trade. Our own preference is for the specification that
includes the controls, in part because it is likely to avoid a possible upward bias in the
openness coefficient.

“M”; Polity is a measure of how democratic is the structure of the government, ranging

from -10 (“strongly autocratic”) to +10 (strongly democratic).16 Land area per capita is

intended to allow for the likelihood that population density leads to environmental

degradation (for a given level of per capita income).17   Again, allowing for the

endogeneity of trade and income is the main new contribution of this paper.

       We focus on results for three measures of air pollution:

SO2: sulphur dioxide, mean (in micograms per cubic meter), 1995

NO2: nitrogen dioxide, mean (in micograms per cubic meter), 1995

PM: Suspended Particulate Matter, mean total (in micograms per cubic meter), 1995


       We have also looked at four other measures of environmental quality:

CO2/cap: Carbon dioxide emissions, industrial, in metric tons per capita

Def: annual deforestation, average percentage change, 1990-95

Energy: Energy depletion, in percent of GDP (“genuine savings”)18, and

Water: Access to clean water (percentage of rural population) 1990-1996.

Of these seven, the three measures of local air pollution -- SO2, NO2, and PM -- are the

most relevant. As noted, CO2 is a purely global externality, and unlikely to be addressed

16
   It is taken from the Polity IV Project at the University of Maryland., described in
Marshall and Jaggers (2000). Barrett and Graddy (2000) also find that an increase in
civil and political freedoms significantly reduces some measures of pollution.
17
  Cropper and Griffiths (1994) study deforestation and find that, in addition to the usual
Kuznets curve effect of per capita income, population density has a further adverse effect.
18
  Energy depletion is a measure computed for the World Bank’s World Development
Indicators. It is equal to the product of unit resource rents and the physical quantities of
fossil fuel energy extracted (including coal, crude oil, and natural gas). Table 3.15,
available at http://www.worldbank.org/data/wdi2001/pdfs/tab3_15.pdf,
explains the data computations.
                                             16

by regulation at the national level. Deforestation19 and Energy depletion are not

measures of pollution, and measuring them involves some serious problems of

composition and data reliability, as does water access. But we thought that it was worth at

least taking a look at these broader measures of environmental quality.



        3.1 Results for the Growth Equation

        We begin by estimating our output equation, equation (1), to replicate the

common finding that there is a statistical association between trade and income. In Table

I, we report OLS estimates of the impact of trade on output. The coefficient on initial

GDP is a highly significant 0.71, representing a plausible degree of conditional

convergence -- about 30 percent over a 20-year period. The estimated coefficient on

trade, 0.33 in the OLS version, says that, holding constant for 1970 income, income in

1990 was 1/3 per cent higher for every 1.0 percentage point increase in the trade/GDP

ratio. When multiplied by 3.45 (=1/(1-.71)) to convert to an estimated effect on long-run

income, the effect on output is 1.14 per cent for every 1.0 percentage point increase in

openness.

        The effects of investment and both schooling variables are statistically significant

and reasonable. Population growth has the negative sign hypothesized by the

neoclassical model, but as in earlier work is the one growth determinant that is not

statistically significant.


19
   It seems plausible that trade in wood products might lead to some chopping down of
trees. For example, Brooks, et al. (2001), estimate that the Accelerated Tariff
Liberalization initiative now underway in forest products may increase aggregate world
trade in this sector by 2 percent and increase the world timber harvest by 0.5 per cent.
But, as they note, this need not imply net deforestation, since planting increases as well.
                                               17

                                        [Table 1 about here.]

        The next step is to estimate the corresponding output equation using IV estimation

to account for the possible endogeneity of openness. The instrumental variables we

choose come from a simple gravity model that uses as controls an aggregation of: the log

of distance, the log of partner country population, the log of area, and dummy variables

for common language, common land border, and landlocked status. After estimating the

gravity model for a large data set on pairwise trade, we aggregate the exponent of the

fitted values across bilateral trading partners to arrive at a prediction of total trade for a

given country. The correlation between actual trade shares and our generated instrument

is a reassuringly high value of .72.20 Table I also reports the IV estimate of equation (1).

The estimate of interest to us here is α, the coefficient on openness. When we include

initial income and other controls, the effect of trade on output is 0.43. The implied

steady state impact is 1.6 (=.43/(1-.73)).

        The Porter Hypothesis reverses conventional economics wisdom by suggesting

that aggressive efforts to protect the environment can be good for productivity growth. A

crude way to test this hypothesis is to include measures of environmental quality on the

right-hand side of the growth equation, using the polity variable as an instrument to




20
  See Frankel and Rose (2002) for results of the estimation of the bilateral trade equation
and details of the calculation of the gravity instrument, which corresponds closely to that
used here. That paper also includes a response to critiques from Rodriguez and Rodrik
(2001) and Rodrik (2000) regarding the gravity instruments. The most difficult part of
the controversy concerns whether trade can be assumed to have similar effects on growth
when the “globalization” arises from deliberate policy (such as trade liberalization) as
when it arises from geographic and technological factors (such as proximity or declining
shipping costs).
                                             18

control for the endogeneity of environmental quality. When we tried this, we found no

support for the hypothesis of a positive effect on growth. [Results not reported here].



       3.2 Results for Pollution: Race to the Bottom, or Gains from Trade?

       Table 2 reports the results of OLS estimation of equation (2), where the

dependent variable is represented by the three measures of air pollution.    The estimated

effect of the polity variable on pollution is always negative, suggesting that improved

governance has a beneficial effect. It is generally significant statistically. The same is

true of land area per capita, offering some evidence that population density has an

adverse effect on pollution.

       Of greater interest is the relationship with per capita income. The estimated

coefficient on the quadratic term is negative for all three measures of air pollution,

confirming the EKC hypothesis: after a certain point, growth is good for the environment.

Statistically, it is highly significant in the case of SO2 and NO2, and moderately

significant in the case of PM.

       When we used a spline function in place of a quadratic, the results again tend to

support the EKC [Table A2]. That is, increases in income in the low-income countries

increases pollution, and in the high-income countries reduces it.    The adverse effect in

the low-income range is insignificant for SO2, but is highly significant for suspended

particulate matter. The effect in the high-income range is significant for PM, borderline

significant for SO2, and insignificant for NO2. The measure that does not exhibit a clear

Kuznets curve in the spline case is NO2, where the adverse effect does not show up until

the middle third of the spline.
                                             19

       The quadratic specification is far more common than the spline in the literature,

and is probably better. It is less arbitrary in its cut-off points and yet more sparing in

degrees of freedom. Also it allows one to try to identify the level of income at which

pollution peaks. The OLS point estimates say that PM peaks at an income level of

$2,882 per capita, SO2 at $5770 per capita, and NO2 at $7665 per capita.

                                   [Table 2 about here.]

       Our central interest is in µ, the coefficient on openness. The coefficient on

openness is negative for all three kinds of air pollution – insignificantly so for PM,

moderately significant for NO2, and highly significant for SO2. Apparently any adverse

“race to the bottom” effect on air pollution is outweighed by positive “gains from trade”

effects. When we use the spline for income, the same results emerge for openness [Table

A2].

       The contribution of this paper is to address the possibility that these apparent

effects may be the spurious results of simultaneity. Table 3 estimates the environmental

equation via instrumental variables, where the gravity-derived prediction of openness is

the instrument for trade and the factor accumulation variables are the instruments for

income.

                                       [Table 3 about here.]

       The IV results are generally similar to the OLS results, though with somewhat

diminished significance levels in some cases. The EKC is still there for all three

pollutants: SO2, NO2, and PM. In the IV results of Table 3, the coefficient on

openness is negative for all three pollution measures. As in the OLS results, statistical

significance is high for SO2, moderate for NO2, and altogether lacking for PM. (When
                                              20

the income relationship is estimated with a spline instead of a quadratic form, in Table

A3, the effect on pollution again turns down for all three measures. The general pattern

of coefficients on openness is the same as in the OLS estimates.)



       3.3 Results for Other Environmental Measures

       Air pollution is only one kind of measure of environmental quality. We also tried

these tests with some others: carbon dioxide, deforestation, energy depletion, and access

to clean water. As noted, the measurement difficulties tend to be much greater than with

air pollution. The OLS results are reported in Tables 4 (for the case of quadratic EKC)

and (for the spline). In most cases, the effects of polity, area, and quadratic income go in

the same direction as with the air pollution indicators. The Kuznets curve shows up with

high statistical significance for deforestation, energy depletion, and rural water access.

Beneficial effects of openness show up only for energy depletion and water access, and

are of borderline statistical significance. (In the case of water access, a positive

coefficient indicates a beneficial environmental effect, the reverse of the other six

indicators.)

                                    [Tables 4 and 5 about here]

       The case that would give an environmentalist the greatest concern is CO2. The

coefficient on quadratic income is positive and highly significant. In the spline version

as well, growth continues to have a positive, indeed increasing, effect through all three

segments in the case of CO2. This confirms findings of other researchers, as well as a

priori reasoning: CO2 is a purely global externality, so that there is no reason to expect

individual countries to address it on their own, no matter what their level of income.
                                             21

Furthermore, the coefficient on openness is apparently positive, and of moderate

significance in the OLS case. This result could be viewed as one piece of evidence

supporting the idea that global warming cannot be addressed without an international

treaty, or at least has not been.21

         The IV results are reported in Tables 5 (for the case of quadratic EKC) and A4

(for the spline). While some results, such as the Kuznets curve, differ very little from

OLS, in some other cases the use of instrumental variables makes a difference.

Encouragingly, the apparently detrimental effect of openness on carbon dioxide

emissions loses all significance, awhile the apparently beneficial effect on energy

depletion becomes significant (at the 10% level). On the other hand, the beneficial effect

on water access (which was not quite significant under OLS) disappears.

         Thus the results continue to be generally supportive of both the Kuznets curve and

the proposition that openness is at least as likely to help the environment, for a given

level of income, as to hurt it. The only case where growth appears always detrimental for

the environment -- and openness perhaps to exacerbate the problem, though significance

disappears under IV -- is CO2. This is the one gas on our list that is a purely global

externality, where countries cannot expect to be able to address it by national regulation

on their own, and indeed where fears of adverse effects on competitiveness are most

acute.




21
   Of course, we cannot rule out that emissions of CO2 also follow a Kuznets Curve, but
that the peak is not reached until higher levels of income than yet experienced by rich
countries. (Schmalensee, Stoker and Judson, 1996.) But, as Dua and Esty (1997, p. 74)
point out, that the ability to control pollution would diminish with the geographical
diffusion of the externality is exactly what one would expect.
                                             22


       3.4 Do Some Countries Have a “Comparative Advantage” in Pollution?

       To summarize the results regarding openness so far, trade, if anything, appears

often to have a beneficial effect on measures of environmental quality, for given levels of

income. The cases where the effect is statistically significant, particularly SO2 and

NO2, are cases where the effect is beneficial. We interpret the absence of a general

upward effect of openness on environment degradation as evidence against the “race to

the bottom” hypothesis.22

       Putting aside now the effects on the overall level of environmental quality

worldwide, one might also be concerned about a possible “pollution haven” hypothesis

according to which economic integration results in some countries exporting pollution to

others, even if the overall level of pollution does not rise. One version of the hypothesis

would be that countries that have a particularly high demand for environmental quality –

e.g., the rich countries -- specialize in products that can be produced cleanly, and they let

the poor countries produce and sell the products that require pollution.23 This hypothesis

can be readily tested by adding to the environment equation the product of openness and


22
   Good economic practice forbids interpreting the absence of statistically significant
rejections of the null hypothesis as proof that the null hypothesis is true. The test can
have low power. Still, this is not one of those contexts where one would necessarily
expect low power on a priori grounds (as one would, for example, when testing the
hypothesis that a financial spot price follows a random walk -- Frankel, 1990). Many
observers claim to see in the world around them evidence that trade is bad for the
environment. Thus our inability to find it in when looking across countries has some
meaning.
23
  E.g., Suri and Chapman (1998) find that middle-income countries’ growth only leads to
lower domestic pollution if they increase imports of manufactures. Muradian, O’Connor
and Martinez-Alier (2001) have found recent evidence that the imports of rich countries
embody more air pollution than their exports. Levinson and Taylor (2001) find that those
US industries experiencing the largest rise in environmental control costs have also
experienced the largest increases in net imports.
                                             23

income per capita. If rich countries take advantage of trade by exporting pollution-

creating activities to poor countries, the interaction between openness and income should

have a negative effect on the level of a country’s domestic pollution. When we tried this

as an extension, we found that the estimated coefficient on the interactive term in most

cases not significant. The exceptions are PM and to some extent SO2; under either OLS

or IV estimation, openness interacted with income appears to have a positive effect on

these types of pollution. But this is the opposite of the sign predicted by the pollution

haven hypothesis, which says that it is poor countries for whom trade leads to

exploitation of the environment, with rich countries supposedly specializing in clean

products.

                                        [Table 6 about here]

          A second version of the pollution haven hypothesis would be that countries that

are endowed with a particularly high supply of environmental quality – e.g., those with

high land area per capita become pollution havens and import clean goods from those that

are more densely populated. We tested this by adding the product of openness and land

area per capita. Again, signs were divided between negative and positive, and

coefficients were usually not at all significant. The only two cases where the coefficient

on the interactive term was moderately significant -- IV for PM and OLS for CO2 --

again showed the wrong sign, counterintuitively suggesting that to the extent countries

are open to trade, those that are sparsely populated have lower emissions than they

otherwise would, not higher. In any case, there is no evidence for the pollution haven

effect.

                                        [Table 7 about here.]
                                             24

       A third possible source of “comparative advantage” derives from traditional trade

theory. If some countries have a comparative advantage in capital intensive sectors such

as mining or heavy manufacturing and other countries in labor intensive sectors, and if

the former sectors are more polluting than the latter, then trade may lead to an increase in

pollution among the capital-endowed countries and a decrease among the labor-endowed

countries. Note that this version of the comparative advantage hypothesis is likely to

imply that trade leads to lower pollution in poor countries, the opposite of the prediction

of the first version considered above. (Rich countries usually have higher capital/labor

ratios than poor countries, though not always.) We tested this version by including

interactive terms defined as openness times the country’s capital/labor ratio. The signs

were negative as often as positive. Standard errors were large. In only one case out of

14 did the interactive term appear statistically significant: in the OLS estimate for CO2,

the coefficient was positive and significant. This one case would suggest that

international trade encourages capital-intensive countries to emit more carbon, and labor-

intensive countries to emit less. The finding vanishes under IV estimation.

                                       [Table 8 about here.]

       To summarize this section, there is no evidence of that some countries use trade to

exploit a comparative advantage in exporting pollution and others in importing it. This

applies equally to versions that hypothesize countries deliberately setting pollution

regulation so as to respond to their environmental comparative advantage, and to the

version that says capital intensive countries will naturally pollute more as a side effect of

trading according to comparative advantage. The only cases where the coefficient on the

interactive term appears significant are of the wrong sign.
                                             25




       4. Conclusions



       Trade can have several sorts of effects on the environment. We have found

evidence that, for any given level of income, trade appears to have a beneficial effect on

some measures of environmental quality, though not all. This is particularly true of

measures of air pollution, such as SO2. Even among other measures of environmental

quality, one can at least say that there is no evidence that trade has the detrimental overall

effect on the environment that the race-to-the-bottom theory would lead one to expect.

There is also no evidence for the pollution haven hypothesis, which claims that to the

extent countries engage in trade, some will specialize in dirtier environments and others

in clean. In addition, trade helps promote economic growth, which in turn is an indirect

channel of effect on the environment. At low levels of income this effect is detrimental

to the environment, at high levels beneficial.



       4.1 A Sample Calculation

       An interesting question is whether, within the class of low-income countries, the

direct beneficial effect of openness is large enough to offset the indirect effect via

income. The openness coefficient is too variable across measures of pollution and is

estimated too imprecisely to allow us to answer this question reliably. But an illustrative

calculation may still be instructive. The environmentally damaging phase of the Kuznets

curve is particularly strong for energy depletion, so let us take this case. Table 1 reports

that for every 1 percentage point increase in openness, income rises by an estimated 0.3
                                              26

percentage points (over the subsequent 20 years). The relevant coefficient from Table A2

implies that, in a poor country, this economic growth in turn induces energy depletion of

8.5*0.3= 2.6. At the same time, the 1 percentage point increase in openness diminishes

energy depletion by an estimated 3.3 for a given level of income. Taking the difference

of the two effects produces an estimated beneficial net effect.

       We must be sure not to read much into this calculation of the net effect. The

difference is not statistically significant. Furthermore, the estimated net effect is much

better than this for some of the measures of environmental damage, and much worse for

others. But if it is necessary to attempt an overall verdict, it is also worth recalling two

key points. Even if the two effects of trade on pollution cancelled out, that would still

leave the country with a higher level of income and no change in environmental quality.

Furthermore, once the country gets past the peak in the Kuznets curve, the two effects of

openness, indirectly via income and directly, go the same direction.



       4.2 Summary of Conclusions

       The results regarding the effects of trade and growth on air pollution, measured

here by SO2, NO2 and Particulate Matter, are generally good. We confirmed the pattern

of the environmental Kuznets curve, whereby growth eventually has a beneficial effect

on pollution, after the initial adverse relationship at low levels of income. Trade

accelerates the growth process. However the primary emphasis of the paper was on the

effect of openness for a given level of income. Here we found little or no evidence of

the race to the bottom hypothesis. To the contrary, a higher ratio of trade to income, for

a given level of income, seems if anything to reduce air pollution. The new contribution
                                             27

of the paper is to address the likely endogeneity of trade, by means of instrumental

variables drawn from the gravity model. The relationship holds up, suggesting that the

observed correlation between trade and environmental quality is not attributable to other

factors.

           The results are more mixed when one tries broader measures of environmental

quality. In particular, the optimistic story does not hold for the case of CO2. Here there

is no evidence that the Kuznets curve ever turns down on its own. Furthermore, openness

is estimated under OLS to have a detrimental effect even for a given level of income,

although, encouragingly, the latter effect disappears under IV estimation. In this case,

trade and growth alone won’t do it. International cooperation is also needed to address

this sort of global environmental problem.
