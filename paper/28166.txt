                                           ABSTRACT

Missed clinic appointments present a significant burden to health care through disruption of care,
inefficient use of staff time and wasted clinical resources. Short message service (SMS)
appointment reminders show promise to improve clinics' management through timely
appointment cancellations and efficient re-scheduling, but evidence from large-scale
interventions is missing. We study a nationwide SMS appointment reminder program in Chile for
chronic disease patients at public primary care clinics. Using longitudinal clinic-level data we
find that after two years the program increased clinics' total number of visits per by 5.1% on
average. The program did not change the number of visits by chronic patients eligible to receive
the reminder, but it instead increased visits by other patients, ineligible to receive reminders in
clinics that adopted the program by 7.4% on average. These results suggest that the appointment
reminder systems increased clinics' ability to care for more patients through timely cancellations
and re-scheduling.

       I.         INTRODUCTION

    A major obstacle to efficient health care delivery are appointment no-shows; patients who fail
to show-up for scheduled appointments without prior cancellation or timely rescheduling. These
patients not only fail to receive needed care, but leave appointment slots unused creating
operational waste, poor use of staff time, under-utilization of other clinical resources, and longer
waiting times (Bech, 2005; Gucciardi, 2008; Gupta & Wang, 2012; Parikh et al., 2010). In the US,
no-shows make up between 12% and 50% of scheduled appointments (Dreiher et al., 2008;
Geraghty et al., 2008; LaGanga & Lawrence, 2007; Moore et al., 2001; Parikh et al., 2010);
resulting in an annual loss of more than $150 billion (Manfredi, 2017). In the UK, patients missing
primary care appointments cost the National Health Service more than £216 million in 2019 alone
(Ellis et al., 2017); (Iacobucci, 2019) (NHS, 2018) (Oliver, 2019). In primary care facilities in
Chile, no-shows rates are as high as 30% (InterSystems Corporation, n.d.). Appointment no-
shows are a major problem not only in the health sector but also in many service sectors such as
restaurants and beauty salons.
    Reasons for missing appointments typically boil down to different forms of behavioral biases
such as inattention and memory (Gabaix, 2019). Specific reasons cited include forgetting or
confusing the date, time or the location of the appointment (Barron, 1980; Dantas et al., 2018;
Geraghty et al., 2008; González-Arévalo et al., 2009; Husain-Gambles et al., 2004; Lacy et al.,
2004; Murdock et al., 2002; Neal et al., 2005; Sawyer et al., 2002; Spikmans et al., 2003). To
address these issues, providers have turned to mobile health interventions (Free et al., 2013) such
as Short Message Service (SMS) automatic appointment reminders, which is a low-cost scalable
management tool that has proven to improve individual visit appointment attendance.1 Such
systems are software driven and integrated into scheduling systems so that they automatically send
out reminders with limited human resources and therefore have extremely low marginal costs.
SMS appointment reminders can also be used to identify patients who will miss their appointments

in time to be able to reassign the visit to another patient, thereby reducing clinical dead time and
improving efficiency.
           All existing evidence, to our knowledge, has focused on the effect of SMS reminders on
nudging patients to make their own appointments and not on the effect on repurposing canceled
appointments for other patients. Further, while the efficacy of SMS reminders for visit adherence
is well established through small pilot programs and short-term studies, these are conducted in
randomized controlled settings and none have examined the effectiveness of SMS reminders at
scale in a real-world setting (de Jongh 2012; Hamine et al. 2015). In addition to a lack of evidence
from scaled-up programs, no peer-reviewed studies to our knowledge have examined how such
programs affect medical visits for all patients - those who do and do not receive appointment
reminders.
      This paper examines the effect of a nationwide SMS automatic appointment reminder program
(CCAMP) in Chile on primary care visits. The program was phased-in across 267 out of 757
Chilean primary care clinics between January 2015 and December 2016. At clinics that adopted
the program, CCAMP sent SMS appointment reminders 24-48 hours prior to the scheduled
appointment to patients diagnosed with diabetes, hypertension, and/or dyslipidemia2 (i.e., also
referred to as chronic or eligible patients hereafter) who could then cancel or reschedule their
appointment via SMS or over the phone. Patients without these conditions who were seeking acute
care did not receive any reminder.
      Using, clinic-level panel data from administrative records held by the Ministry of Health in
Chile, we implement an event-study approach to test for changes over time and difference-in-
difference (DiD) estimators to examine how CCAMP affected clinics' total number of patients'
visits, visits by chronic patients eligible to receive the reminder, as well as the indirect program
effects on those that were not eligible, that is, the number of acute care visits.
      Our results show that the program increased clinics' total number of visits by 3.3% on average.
The increase was observed the first semester after the CCAMP implementation and increased over
time through the first year of its implementation. By the second year of the data treated clinics'
total visits increased by 5.1%. The effects are mostly driven by visits from acute care patients who
were ineligible to receive the reminders, a 4.6% increase on average, and a 7.4% increase in the

                                                                                                                        2
program's second year, while we estimate positive but not statistically significant effects on visits
from chronic disease patients, who were eligible to receive the reminder.
        These results are similar whether we use a standard two-way fixed effects estimator, a DiD
estimator that is identified off only cells where treatment changes, and are robust to new methods
that account for potential biases in staggered DiD designs as discussed recently in de Chaisemartin
& d'Haultfoeuille, (2020). Our results are also robust to different placebo CCAMP start dates and
we also show evidence of no differential trends in outcomes across clinics before the program was
implemented.
        Finally, our heterogeneity results show that the clinics that had a larger burden of chronic
patients before the intervention benefited the most from the program as they experience a 9.8%
increase in visits from ineligible for SMS patients. We also show that clinics with a younger
population experienced a 7.2% increase in the number of visits for chronic patients, suggesting
that IT technologies work better for managing health of relatively younger adults.
        There are a large number of interventions and policies to improve efficiency, for example
telemedicine (Kruse et al., 2017), supply-side incentives for value-based care (Gentry & Badrinath,
2017; Tompkins et al., 2009), and decision support tools (Ali et al., 2011; Scheitel et al. 2017), but
many are costly to implement in practice. Our paper contributes to the literature on health care
efficiency (Shipman & Sinsky, 2013), and provides evidence that a low-cost technology can
improve management practices and reduce missed visits among high-use patients resulting in an
improvement in overall clinic efficiency.
        Our paper also contributes to the literature on the effects of `nudges' for health seeking
behavior (Roberto & Kawachi, 2015), particularly using mHealth tools as nudges for disease
management. Existing studies mostly focus on how SMS appointment reminders affect patients'
treatment adherence directly but fail to incorporate the analyses of overall clinic efficiency gains.
A considerable variation in significance and magnitude of the associations between SMS
reminders and clinic attendance is observed in the literature so far (Berrouiguet et al., 2016; Gurol
Urganci et al., 2013; Kannisto et al., 2014; Schwebel & Larimer, 2018); ranging from null
(Bellucci et al., 2017; Bos et al., 2005; Clough & Casey, 2014) to significant and large positive
ones (Altuwaijri et al., 2012; Arora et al., 2015; Baker et al., 2015; Bangure et al., 2015; Berenson
et al., 2016; Bourne et al., 2011; Branson et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2008). Among the potential
explanations put forth for inconclusive results is variation in characteristics of patients and clinics,


                                                                                                      3
type or frequency of appointments, and in treatment duration across varied (mostly small scale)
service settings for which interventions are studied. Our study is unique in its size, duration, setting
and inclusion of outcomes for patients, ineligible to receive treatments, and in using a quasi-
experimental design for causal inference.
      In the next section, we briefly discuss the Chilean health care system and the CCAMP - the
SMS appointment reminder implemented across primary care clinics in Chile that we evaluate.
Section 3 describes the data and the empirical strategy used to evaluate its impact on primary care
visits. Section 4 discusses results and discusses robustness, and Section 5 concludes.

       II.        The SMS Appointment Reminder Program

         In Chile, there are 11 million people (57% of the population) estimated to have one chronic
condition that utilize health services from a primary care system that is able to accommodate only
4 million (Margozzini & Passi, 2018).3 These patients consume 84% of total primary care health
resources (MINSAL, 2008), placing a significant burden on the public health care system. Part of
this burden is attributable to waste from missed appointments. According to data from the Ministry
of Health, in 2019 nearly 16.7% of appointments to a specialist physician were missed.4
Consequently, patients in several primary care clinics cannot schedule appointments more than a
month in advance, and many fail to schedule any (Alvarez et al., 2018). Although waiting times
have decreased in the last years, they still remain at high levels compared to OECD standards
(Bedregal et al., 2017); with the longest waiting lists being that of appointments for non-chronic
conditions that are not covered by the health guarantees implemented since 2005 (FONASA, 2018;
Martínez et al., 2019).
         To reduce delays and increase efficiency in delivery of care, beginning in January 2015,
the Chilean Ministry of Health offered the option to opt-into the Critical Care Appointment
Management Program (Mensajería para la Gestión de Citas en Pacientes Crónicos or CCAMP) to

    The Chilean healthcare system is a two-tier system with nearly 80% of the population enrolled in public insurance
(FONASA, 2018; Goic, 2015). In the public sector, primary care clinics are fundamental in providing a wide range of
preventative care services as well as for ongoing treatment of patients with chronic diseases, such as hypertension and
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

all primary care clinics, provided they were using electronic systems for registering patients, which
applied to approximately 90% of all clinics (Ministerio de Salud de Chile, 2014).5
      CCAMP's objective was to reduce no-shows among chronic patients at public primary care
clinics with the goal of improving clinics' efficiency in care, time and resources. If enrolled in the
CCAMP program, clinics sent automatic SMS appointment reminders to patients with T2DM
and/or hypertension 48 hours prior to the scheduled appointment with information on date, location
and time of the appointment. Patients could cancel or reschedule their appointment by replying to
the SMS at no cost to them or could reschedule their appointment via phone. If the patient canceled
their appointment, the time slot was re-assigned to any other patient seeking to schedule an
appointment with the clinic regardless of diagnosis. If the patient did not respond, the appointment
was kept. The content of the message was as follows:


      "Dear [Patient Name], this is a reminder that you have a medical appointment on the day
[Date of appointment] at [Time] hours at [Clinic Name] with the doctor [Name of the doctor].
Do you confirm your time? Yes/No"


By December 2015, 210 primary care clinics adopted CCAMP, with an additional 57 clinics
adopting by the end of 2016;6 in total 267, covering 303 municipalities (out of 345) in Chile. Figure
1 describes program implementation across primary care clinics over time.

      III.        Data

         We obtain semesterly, balanced longitudinal clinic-level data from all Chilean public
primary care clinics eligible for CCAMP between 2013 and 2016 from the Chilean Ministry of
Health's Primary Care Division (N = 877). A clinic was eligible if it has an electronic health
records system. These data are administrative records detailing the number of visits by patient
type, and the number of patients enrolled at each clinic, and are publicly available from the Chilean



  5
     The second requirement was that primary care clinics also participate in the Pharmacy Fund Program ­ a program
aimed at ensuring of pharmacological treatments of the population that is attended in the Primary Health Care system
with a priority on patients with chronic conditions. It is determined at the municipality level for all of its primary care
clinics. By 2015, 99% municipalities participated in this program.
   6
     The list of health clinics with their date of implementation was obtained from a request of public information to
the Ministry of Health on Dec 26th of year 2016.

                                                                                                                         5
Department of Statistics (DEIS). Each clinic tracks the number of patients enrolled at their clinic
who have been diagnosed with one or more conditions of hypertension, T2DM, or dyslipidemia.
            We dropped clinics located in extreme regions (N=71 clinics) due to the low number of
medical appointments, and those without any patients diagnosed with a chronic condition (N=49
clinics). Our final sample consisted of 757 primary care clinics in total (N=267 serve as treated,
and N=490 as a control group). Figure 2 visualizes our sample selection steps.
            Each clinic in our data has a unique clinic-level identifier. The data provided information
on the number of patients and their medical visits per clinic over time ­ in total and by patient type.
In particular, we observed two types of patients in these data: 1) those with dyslipidemia,
hypertension and/or T2DM and thus eligible to receive SMS reminders for each scheduled
appointment, and 2) those who are ineligible to receive SMS reminders, that is, were diagnosed
with neither dyslipidemia, hypertension or T2DM. These data also included information on
CCAMP start date for each clinic that implemented the program.
            The primary outcomes in these data are changes in number of medical visits per clinic per
semester, overall and by patient type: eligible and ineligible to receive the reminder. Visits by
chronic patients included all routine and non-routine visits made by a patient who was eligible to
be enrolled in the SMS reminder program. Each outcome was a continuous measure, and log-
transformed for the analyses. To observe heterogeneity in the program response, we identified
clinics in the bottom quartile of the distribution of share of visits in 2014 by patients older than
657 (younger clinics), clinics in the top quartile of the distribution number of eligible chronic
patients needing ongoing care (specialized clinics), and clinics in the top quartile of total number
of visits in 2014 (large clinics).
            To obtain municipality-level controls, such as mean age, sex, income per capita, share of
rural population, and share of population below the poverty line, we matched the administrative
clinic data with the National Socioeconomic Survey (Casen 2013) at the municipality level (303
municipalities) (MDS, 2013).

Descriptive Statistics

            A total of 757 clinics were analyzed; 267 of them implemented the program between 2015
and 2016 (see table 1). In 2014, clinics that implemented the program had 17,416 patients on

      The administrative data on visits does not contain patient age, but does contain counts of patients under 65 and a count of patients over 65.


                                                                                                                                                      6
average: 2,595 chronic (eligible) and 14,669 non-chronic (ineligible) patients. 15% of clinics were
rural primary care clinics, 10% were low-complexity hospitals, but the majority were urban
primary care clinics (75%). We observe that the urban primary care clinics were more likely to
implement CCAMP compared to low-complexity hospitals. Related to this, the mean monthly
income per capita was higher among municipalities with treated clinics

    IV.        Empirical Strategy

   Our strategy to identify the causal impact of CCAMP program on medical visits employs event
study and difference-in-difference (DiD) models. We first use a discrete time hazard model to
show how program take-up correlates with fixed and time variant clinics characteristics and then
test for whether pre-intervention trends in outcomes differ between treated and untreated clinics.
For our analysis, we use clinic-level longitudinal data at the semesterly (6 month) level between
the first semester of 2013, and the last semester of 2016.

Selection into the CCAMP Program

       We start by testing for systematic differences in the timing of CCAMP adoption by primary
care clinics. Our identification strategy controls for time invariant characteristics of clinics with
clinic fixed effects, and for time trends with semester fixed effects. To test for idiosyncratic time
varying shocks that could influence take-up, which are not controlled for in our two-way fixed
effects approach, we estimate discrete time hazard models.
       Specifically, we estimate the probability that a clinic in a given semester adopted the
program as a function of time-invariant and time-variant municipality and clinic-level
characteristics using the discrete-time hazard estimator with logistic regression. We test
characteristics including average age of patients at the clinic, share of patients enrolled in each
level of FONASA, as well as data on municipality-level characteristics, such as but not limited to
median income, from the CASEN 2013 Socioeconomic survey of Chile.
       We estimate two discrete time hazard models where the outcome is the probability of SMS
program take-up in each semester from semester 1 2015 onward. First, we include time invariant
municipality characteristics to understand whether program take-up is related to a municipality's
socioeconomic status, which we operationalize as mean income per capita, and education. We also
include time invariant clinic characteristics such as clinic type and share of visits at the clinic by


                                                                                                    7
chronic patients to understand whether particular characteristics of clinics predict program take-
up. Lastly, we include time fixed effects. We then extend the model by adding time-varying clinic
characteristics: both characteristics of patients at the facility, and clinic staff characteristics.

Event-study

        We start with estimating a non-parametric event-study design to study the link between the
timing of the CCAMP program adoption and change in clinic-level outcomes over time by
estimating the following regression model:


                        !" = $
                             #%&' # # + !"  + " + ! + !"                      (3)


Where # are coefficients on semester indicators (# ) for time relative to the CCAMP program
adoption (at  = 0) at a clinic i. The key coefficients of interest are the # 's that estimate the
difference in outcomes at a clinic i at a given  relative to the omitted category, ( . Each model is
adjusted for seasonality and common temporary shocks with semester indicators (! ) and
controlled for time-invariant attributes that may determine clinic's outcomes of interest
irrespective of CCAMP by including clinic-level indicators or fixed effects (" ). We also
incorporate a vector of additional controls, such as average municipality age, sex ratio, and income
per capita, and trends specific to clinics with more than the median share of patients eligible to
receive the reminder at baseline ("! ). !" is an error term correlated within clinics across time.

Difference-in-differences

        In our second step, we use a more parametric, two-way fixed effect DiD approach, which
we first estimate as described in equation (4) below:


                       "! =  + "! + "!  + ! + " + "!                            (4)


Where "! is the log of number of visits for clinic  at semester , "! is an indicator variable
that takes value one for all semesters t in each clinic i after the CCAMP was implemented. For
clinics that did not implement the CCAMP by the end of the last semester of 2016, this variable is
always zero (490 clinics). The main coefficient of interest is  ; a DiD estimate which measures


                                                                                                       8
the impact of the CCAMP program on the outcome of interest and corresponds to the Average
Treatment on the Treated (ATT) parameter. As above, each model was adjusted for seasonality
and common temporary shocks with semester indicators (! ) and clinic-level indicators or fixed
effects (" ). We again calculated robust standard errors, clustered at the clinic level.
        Recent studies have shown that the OLS estimate of  in (4) may be biased if the treatment
effect of a policy or program varies across units of analysis (treatment effect heterogeneity).8 de
Chaisemartin & d'Haultfoeuille (2020) (C&H) show this for the general case where different units
are used as a treatment group and control group at different points in time. As the adoption of the
policy we study was staggered over time across health facilities, estimation of (4) through OLS
could be biased under treatment effect heterogeneity. C&H provide tests and adjustments to
account for potential biases from treatment effects heterogeneity and we estimate a version of (4)
using their approach as a robustness check.
        Last, we implement different heterogeneity analyses to understand which clinics and
patients where most benefited from the program. To observe this heterogeneity in the program
response, we extend the standard, two-way fixed effects DiD model interacting the CCMAP
indicator variable with a binary variable that (i) equal to one if the clinic had above median share
of visits by chronic patients before the program started at baseline; defined as the semesterly
number of chronic visits divided by the semesterly total number of visits, averaged over all four
semesters of 2014. Other heterogeneity analyses were done by using indicator variables for
whether a clinic is in the (ii) bottom quartile share of 2014 visits by patients that were aged 65 and
over, and (iii) top quartile of total number of medical visits. We run the following regression:

                               #
          "! =  + "! + "!  " + "!  + ! + " + "!                                            (5)


Where ! is an indicator variable that equals 1 for each clinic type (i, ii or iii). Other
components are the same to those described in equation (3).

     V.         Results

       Take-up analyses

       Across both models, the results in table 2 show that a clinic's decision to implement the
SMS program is not related to municipality or clinic characteristics, with the exception of
urbanicity status of primary care clinic (p<0.05) and baseline share of chronic patients (p<0.01),
which are both controlled for with clinic fixed effects. Program take-up is significantly predicted
by time showing that the probability of take-up is decreasing over the time period in our analysis.
This is consistent with the fact that tale-up is very large in the first periods we analyze, as shown
in Figure 3, where we observe a large spike in program adoption immediately after the program
was offered. These results suggest our event study and difference-in-differences approaches are
likely robust to potential confounders after including time and clinic fixed effects. The variation
in start dates over time also validates our use of the C&H estimator.

       Event study

       The results from the event study analysis are presented in figure 4 (see table A2 in Online
Appendix). The key identifying assumption that allows us to interpret coefficients on indicators
for time after the program adoption as causal is that, conditional on its adoption and included
controls, potential outcomes are uncorrelated with the timing of the program adoption. Although
this is not testable, Figure 4 shows that pre-trends in outcomes are very similar across treated and
untreated clinics which supports the parallel trend assumption needed for identification. In
particular, differences in outcomes change sharply around the event.
       Figure 4 illustrates an increase in visits in the first semester after the program
implementation, and that the effect slightly rises after the start of the program (figure 4, panel A).
The figure also shows that the effect of reminders on the production of medical visits is driven by
visits from patients ineligible to receive appointment reminders (figure 4, panel B), but no such
change is observed for chronic patients, eligible to receive the reminders (figure 4, panel C).

          Difference-in-differences

       Table 3 describes the effect of the CCAMP on medical visits using three DiD approaches.
Using the standard, two-way fixed effects estimator we find that on average, adopting the SMS
program increases clinics' total number of semesterly visits by 3.3% (see table 3, panel A, column

                                                                                                   10
1). However, this increase in visits is largely driven by visits from patients who were ineligible to
receive the reminders ­ their visits increased by 4.6% (see table 3, panel A, column 3) ­ and not
by visits from eligible patients for whom no change in the number of visits was observed (see table
3, panel A, column 2). Due to the program, clinics had on average 1,031 more visits from non-
chronic patients in the post-treatment period (on average we observe clinics for 3 semesters after
implementing CCAMP).9
           We also estimate average treatment effects using the estimator proposed by de
Chaisemartin & d'Haultfoeuille (2020), first without weighting (table 3, panel B), and then
weighted by the number of switchers in each period (table 3, panel C; weights are included in
Online appendix table A3). This estimator also relies on the common trends assumption, but does
not allow any weights to be negative, which can be an issue with the two-way fixed effect estimator
when heterogenous treatment effects are present and treatment is phased in over time. In the event
studies we observe an increase in the treatment effect on visits by total and non-chronic patients
over time (figure 4, panels A and C respectively), justifying our use of the C&H estimator10.
           We find very similar results using both the unweighted, and weighted estimators: on
average, adopting the SMS program increases clinics' total number of semesterly visits by 4.0%
(unweighted) or 4.1% (weighted) (see table 3, panel B, column 1 and table 3, panel C, column 1).
Again, this increase in visit is largely driven by visits from patients who were ineligible to receive
the reminders ­ their visits increased by 5.9% (unweighted) or 5.7% (weighted) (see table 3, panel
B, column 3 and table 3, panel C, column 3). We proceed with standard, two-way fixed effects
estimator DiD as our preferred specification because the results from the three DiD specifications
in table 3 are economically similar.
           We next present results using this DiD estimator where we allow the ATE to vary by year
in the post-treatment period (table 4). In the semester of program adoption, total visits increased
by 3.5% and visits by non-chronic patients increased by 5.6% (table 4 columns 1 and 3
respectively). The effect of the program is lower in the semester after adoption and increases to
5.1% and 7.4% for visits by all and non-chronic patients respectively (table 4 columns 1 and 3).


   9
     To estimate additional non-chronic visits at treated clinics attributable to CCAMP we multiplied treatment effect on non-chronic visits, 4.6%
by each clinic's pre-treatment average non-chronic visits per semester and summed across the post-treatment period.
   10
       C&H demonstrate that b from two-way fixed effect estimators can be expressed a weighted average of the treatment effects in each group,
time cell. Another diagnostic to understand if b is biased is to regress these weights on a variable that is associated with the treatment effect. We
find a small but statistically significant correlation between the weights and semesters (-0.09, p<0.05, see online appendix table A4), providing
more support for our use of the C&H estimator.


                                                                                                                                                 11
There is no effect for chronic patients, who do receive the reminder, until two semesters after
program adoption, when visits by chronic patients fall by 4.4% (table 4, column 2).
        To reassure our interpretation that the results in tables 3 and 4 show reallocation of time to
existing patients rather than a change in patient inflow we change our dependant variable to total
number of patients in equation (4). Results in table A6 in the online appendix show that the effects
on the number of patients are small and insignificant, hence our main results are not driven by a
change in the flow of patients. In addition to the analysis of selection, we further assess the validity
of our results by implementing a placebo test where we lag the onset of the program in time by
four semesters (see Online Appendix table A7). The results in table A6 show that there is a small
and insignificant association between patients visits and treatment status in the preprogram period.
This suggests that pre trends are unrelated to treatment onset.

        Heterogeneity by population and clinic's characteristics

        We implement different heterogeneity analyses to understand which clinics and patients
benefited most from the program, using two-way fixed effect DiD estimators. First, we study
whether the impact of CCAMP varied by clinics with a relatively large number of visits by eligible
patients at baseline (i.e., in the pre-intervention period). We observe a larger, 7.1% increase in total
number of visits in clinics with above the median share of visits by eligible chronic patients
needing ongoing care (table 5A, Column 1). Again, this increase was largely due to a 9.8% increase
in visits for ineligible patients in those clinics (table 5A, column 2).
        Next, we compute the share of chronic patients who are 65 years old or younger and
construct an indicator variable that equals to one if a clinic's share of chronic patients over 65 years
old is at the bottom quartile of the distribution of patients over 65 years old in 2014. We label this
indicator "Young Population". The results in table 5B show that the effect of the program on
chronic patients' visits is positive for clinics whose population of chronic patients is younger. The
results show that on average clinics classified as having a "Young population" increased the
number of visits by chronic patients by 5.5%. The results in column 3 show that the effect on non-
chronic visits is entirely driven by clinics where the population of patients is older, which suggests
that the efficiency gains in these clinics are more in terms of rescheduling rather than improved
visit adherence of chronic patients.




                                                                                                     12
        Finally, we explore whether the effect of the program varies by clinic size, proxied by an
indicator variable that equals one if a clinic's total number of visits was at the top quartile in 2014.
We label this indicator as "Large". The results in table 4, column 3, show that there are no
differences in total visits between clinics of large/small size. However, when we separate the total
number of visits by type, the results show that the program reduces by 5.2% the number of chronic
patients' visits in clinics that had a large visit flow before the intervention. In addition, the program
increases the number of non-chronic patients' visits in clinics classified as non "Large". In the
online appendix, table A8 shows that most of these effects hold when we include all variables at
once. The exception are the differential effects by clinic size "Large", however this is plausibly
due to the collinearity with the share of chronic patients.

        Discussion

        Overall, the results show that reminding chronic patients the date of their visit and allowing
them to confirm attendance and reallocate canceled appointments in a timely manner increases
efficiency within clinics as it allows clinic management to optimize the use of physicians' time.
On average, the flow of visits by chronic patients does not change, but the number of visits of
patients with other conditions increases in the same clinics. This is consistent with clinics' being
able to improve the timing of attendance of chronic patients so that they visit the doctor at the date
or around the date scheduled and not after, once they recall that they have missed their
appointment, or their health has worsened. Hence, on average, total number of visits by chronic
patients does not change but the timing and organization of attendance to this population is more
efficient.
        Better timing of attendance to chronic patients should help clinics' management organize
other activities better, including scheduling visit hours for other patients. As such, the number of
visits from patients needing acute care increases as the clinics are able to accommodate more visits
from this population. This evidence is further supported by the larger effects observed for clinics
with a high proportion of chronic patients before the intervention, where there is an increase in
9.8% in the number of visits from non-chronic patients. Hence, efficiency gains from the program
are larger in clinics that are more congested by the untimely attendance of chronic patients, as the
program enables a relatively larger number of visits for ineligible patients.




                                                                                                      13
        The effects of the reminders increased over time, suggesting a learning period just after
implementation in which clinics improved the program's implementation quality. This could be
explained by a lag between collecting a patients' phone number for the SMS reminder, and the
patient's next visit.
        The results by population age are consistent with findings from the literature that show the
use of IT technology is more effective to manage care in younger populations. One reason is that
the younger population may have less severe conditions so that the relative importance that they
assign to their disease is lower than among older adults and so they are more likely to forget their
appointments. On the other hand, young adults are typically more connected and have less
difficulty engaging in self-care programs that involve IT technologies. These stories are
indistinguishable with our data, but they are both consistent with finding larger positive effects of
the SMS reminder program in clinics whose population of patients is younger on average.

    VI.         Conclusions

        In this paper we examined the effects of a nation-wide phased in SMS reminder program
to manage visit adherence of patients with chronic conditions in Chile. We used this analysis to
investigate whether implementing management care practices improves overall efficiency of
primary care clinics. The intervention sent automatic SMS appointment reminders to patients with
T2DM and/or hypertension 24-48 hours prior to the scheduled appointment with information on
date, location and time of the appointment. Patients could cancel or reschedule their appointment
by replying to the SMS. Using semesterly data at the clinic level on the number of visits by type
of patient, we compare the quantity of visits at clinics with and without the program over time. We
found that treated clinics became more efficient in managing overall patient visits, as the program
helped to optimize the use of healthcare providers' time. In particular we find that the program's
primary impact on patients who were not eligible to receive the SMS reminder themselves: the
number of visits by these patients increased on average by 4.6%, with the effect rising to 7.4% in
the second year of program implementation.

        We also showed that clinics with a high burden of chronic patients in the time before the
program experienced larger efficiency gains from SMS reminders, as these clinics were able to
accommodate a relatively larger number of visits for non-chronic patients. In addition, the results
show that while average effects for chronic patients are null, there are positive effects on visits by


                                                                                                   14
chronic patients below 65 years old, who are likely to have less severe chronic conditions and may
be more prone to miss appointments, and who are also more likely to engage in self-care
management that uses IT. Finally, as previous work in this area focuses on small pilots or studies
in randomized controlled settings, the results in this paper provide the first evidence on the effects
of SMS reminders at scale.

       Our results have a few important policy implications. They suggest that SMS programs
implemented at scale may be effective in improving efficiency in primary care clinics. The results
highlight that when clinics work under tight capacity constraints, focusing on case management in
particular populations can have beneficial effects to case management overall. With health costs
rising swiftly, cost effective programs such as SMS reminders for case management offer countries
a low-cost way to complement primary care management.

      difference-in-differences model. Each model includes municipality level controls: share of
      municipality that is male, mean age, share of municipality that is rural, share of municipality's
      population below Chile's poverty line. Each model also includes a control for the number of
      chronic patients at baseline, and controls for differential trend by clinic type. Treated is an indicator
      equal to 1 in the semesters on and after a clinic adopted CCAMP, 0 otherwise.  +  is the
      coefficient on a test that the treated + interaction term coefficients are equal to zero. Specialized is
      an indicator for if the clinic's share of chronic visits is in the top quartile. Young population is an
      indicator for it the clinic's share of chronic patients that are over 65 years old is in the top quartile.
      Large clinic is an indicator for if the clinic's semesterly number of total visits was in the top
      quartile. Each heterogeneity variable was measured in 2014 (before CCAMP was implemented).
