A considerable literature has examined the causes, consequences, and policy responses to surges in
international capital flows. A related strand of papers has attempted to catalog current account reversals
and capital account "sudden stops." This paper offers an encompassing approach with an algorithm
cataloging capital inflow bonanzas in both advanced and emerging economies during 1980-2007 for
181 countries and 1960-2007 for a subset of 66 economies from all regions. In line with earlier studies,
global factors, such as commodity prices, international interest rates, and growth in the world's largest
economies, have a systematic effect on the global capital flow cycle. Bonanzas are no blessing for
advanced or emerging market economies. In the case of the latter, capital inflow bonanzas are associated
with a higher likelihood of economic crises (debt defaults, banking, inflation and currency crashes).
Bonanzas in developing countries are associated with procyclical fiscal policies and attempts to curb or
avoid an exchange rate appreciation -- very likely contributing to economic vulnerability. For the advanced
economies, the results are not as stark, but bonanzas are associated with more volatile macroeconomic
outcomes for GDP growth, inflation, and the external accounts. Slower economic growth and sustained
declines in equity and housing prices follow at the end of the inflow episode.

1. Introduction

       A pattern has often been repeated in the modern era of global finance. Foreign

investors turn with interest toward some developing country. Capital flows in volume

into small and shallow local financial markets. The exchange rate tends to appreciate,

asset prices to rally, and local commodity prices to boom. These favorable asset price

movements improve national fiscal indicators and encourage domestic credit expansion.

These, in turn, exacerbate structural weaknesses in the domestic banking sector even as

those local institutions are courted by global financial institutions seeking entry into a hot

market. At the same time, local authorities resort to large-scale foreign exchange sales of

the local currency to cushion the effects on the exchange rate of the capital inflow

bonanza.

       Other policy interventions, such as increases in reserve requirements and

transactions taxes, usually follow to insulate the domestic economy from the

accumulation of reserves. An inherent tension emerges: Local authorities take such

changes as a global vote of approval that might encourage them to delay the difficult task

of structural adjustment.

       This pattern is etched sharply in the experience of the ERM, the ERM2, and the

Latin convergence associated with NAFTA and its regional successors. In the run-up to a

more perfect union, potential entrants are increasingly looked upon favorably by global

investors. Those investors appreciate that close integration with a strong anchor country

or group of countries will ultimately discipline policymakers in the periphery, which will

narrow exchange rate fluctuations and country risk spreads and buoy local equity prices.

But these same dynamics also play out in commodity-exporting emerging market




                                              1
economies when the prices of their output surge on world markets or when very low

interest rates and sluggish growth in the advanced countries turn the attention of investors

there outward. Across countries, a different rising tide raises all boats.

        But tides also go out when the fancy of global investors shifts and the “new

paradigm” looks shop worn. Flows reverse and asset prices give back their gains, often

forcing a painful adjustment on the economy.

       This experience has provided a fertile testing ground for international economists.

A varied flora has blossomed that will be reviewed in Section 2. Given double-entry

bookkeeping and the zero-sum nature of global trade, these issues of global adjustment

have been described in terms of the current or financial accounts and as deterioration in

some countries or improvement in others. Moreover, the time windows have been

chosen to isolate the build-up or run-down of any of these measures.

       This paper attempts to be encompassing in its examination of these issues by

simplifying the definition of the key event that is studied and by widening the time

window around that event. We investigate what happens before, during, and after a

capital flow bonanza. That is, we ask how do economies perform in and around periods

when capital inflows are relatively large (or, equivalently, when their financial account

surpluses are relatively large)? Due to data limitations discussed below, we make this

operational by examining episodes of large current account deficits.

       We study 181 countries from 1980 to 2007, a subset of 66 countries from 1960 to

2007 for which more detailed information on economic variables is available, and a

smaller group of 18 countries for which house price data are available; the samples

include all regions and income groups. Our primary aim is to quantitatively define and




                                              2
date capital inflow bonanza episodes, so as to study their various aspects. In Section 3,

we document several features of these bonanza periods, including their incidence and

duration. In Section 4, we examine the evidence on potential links between capital flow

bonanzas and debt, currency, inflation, and banking crises. In Section 5, we

systematically illustrate the behavior of a variety of macroeconomic, financial, and policy

indicators on the eve and aftermath of these episodes.

       Our main findings can be summarized as follows:

       With nearly fifty years of data, it is evident that bonanzas have become more

frequent as restrictions on international capital flows have been relaxed worldwide.

Although the approaches differ, this finding is in line with the evidence presented in

Eichengreen and Adalet (2005).

       The heavy inflow episode can persist, often lulling policymakers and investors

into treating the bonanza as a permanent phenomenon rather than a temporary shock.

Episodes end, more often than not, with an abrupt reversal or “sudden stop” à la Calvo

(as in Calvo, 1998). The current account path around bonanzas is distinctly V-shaped,

irrespective of whether the broader, but more recent, sample or the less inclusive, but

longer, sample is the benchmark.

       Capital inflow bonanza periods are associated with a higher incidence of banking,

currency, and inflation crises in all but the high income countries (using some of the

crises indicators developed in Kaminsky and Reinhart, 1999, and codified in Reinhart and

Rogoff, 2008a). This result is not the artifact of a few extreme cases; in more than 60

percent of the countries, the probability of a crisis around the dates of a capital flow




                                              3
bonanza is higher than for the entire sample. Capital flow bonanzas systematically

precede sovereign default episodes.

       In developing countries (those designated by the World Bank as middle and low

income), the stance of fiscal policy, as measured by the growth in real government

spending, is notoriously procyclical during capital inflow bonanzas. This is consistent

with the earlier observation that temporary “good times” are often treated as permanent.

In effect, our preliminary results also suggest that fiscal policy plays a destabilizing role

around capital flow bonanzas—and possibly more generally.

       For the advanced economies, the results are not as stark, as there is no systematic

cross-country evidence over 1960-2007 that the probability of a financial crisis increases

during bouts of heavy capital inflows. The crisis-prone Nordic countries in the early

1990s and the Iceland, U.K., and U.S. crises at present would appear to be important

departures from this general result (as in Reinhart and Rogoff, 2008b). Nonetheless,

capital flow bonanzas are associated with more volatile macroeconomic outcomes for

real GDP growth, inflation, and the external accounts.

       Real GDP growth tends to be higher in the run-up to a bonanza and then

systematically lower. The imprint of bonanzas is evident in asset markets. Equity prices

rise when capital flows in and retreat when capital flows out. A similar pattern is evident

in house prices for our small sample. A bonanza is not to be confused with a blessing.

       The last section turns to some of the policy implications of our analysis and

discusses possible future research in this area.

2. Concepts and Data Issues

1. Reviewing the existing literature

       The existing literature has studied multiple manifestations of international

adjustment in the balance-of-payments data. Double-entry bookkeeping and the global

summing to zero of trade flows produces the four alternative frames of reference laid out

in Table 1. The main issues of adjustment can be described in terms of either an

improvement or deterioration (along the rows of the matrix) in either the current or

capital accounts (along the columns).

       Table 1. Frames of reference in the literature

                     Improvement       Current account       Capital inflow

                     Deterioration     Twin deficits         Sudden stop



       There is a rich empirical literature on current account reversals, the upper left cell,

mostly documenting the macroeconomic consequences of a marked improvement in a

sample of many countries. Many features of these studies follow the path laid out in the

pioneering paper by Gian Maria Milesi-Ferretti and Assaf Razin (2000). As summarized

in Table 2, they established three criteria to identify a current account reversal that are

now the norm: The change in the balance must be large relative to nominal GDP, large

absolutely in dollar terms, and not the product of a spike in a single year. Focusing on

low- and middle-income countries, they find that the adjustment experience is




                                              5
heterogeneous and depends importantly on whether the currency crashes on the foreign

exchange market.

Table 2. Current and capital account reversals: Some definitions

Study                      Criteria used to select the episodes of interest

                           Their underlying idea is that “large” events provide more information on
Current account            determinants of reductions in current-account deficits than short-run
reversals:                 fluctuations. These events have to satisfy three requirements:
Milesi-Ferreti and Razin   1) An average reduction in the current account deficit of at least 3 (or 5)
(2000). Also               percentage points of GDP over a period of three years with respect to the three
Edwards (2005),            years before the event;
Eichengreen and Adalet     2) The maximum deficit after the reversal must be no larger than the minimum
(2005), and Freund and     deficit in the three years preceding the reversal;
Warnock (2005)             3) The average current account deficit must be reduced by at least one third.
                           The first and second requirements should ensure that we capture only
                           reductions of sustained current account deficits, rather than sharp but
                           temporary reversals. The third requirement is necessary so as to avoid counting
                           as a reversal a reduction in the current account deficit from, say, 15 to 12
                           Percent. Events are based on three-year averages.

                            A Sudden Stop is defined as a phase that meets the following conditions:
Capital account--sudden    1) It contains at least one observation where the year-on-year fall in capital
stops:                     flows lies at least two standard deviations below its sample mean (this
Calvo, Izquierdo, and      addresses the“unexpected” requirement of a Sudden Stop).
Mejia (2004)               2) The Sudden Stop phase ends once the annual change in capital flows
                           exceeds one standard deviation below its sample mean. This will generally
                           introduce persistence, a common fact of Sudden Stops.
                           3) Moreover, for the sake of symmetry, the start of a Sudden Stop phase is
                           determined by the first time the annual change in capital flows falls one
                           standard deviation below the mean.

Capital account--sudden    1) In addition to the criterion of large capital flow reversals exceeding two
stops:                     standard deviations from the mean (for their capital flow proxy), CIL require
Calvo, Izquierdo, and      that
Loo-Kung (2006) or CIL     2) these reversals be accompanied by a spike in some external aggregate
                           measure of the cost of funds in order to capture systemic effects. More
                           specifically, CIL uses the (log of) J. P. Morgan Emerging Market Bond Index
                           (EMBI) spread over US Treasury bonds for EMs, the Merrill Lynch Euro-area
                           Government Index spreads for Euro-area countries (as well as Nordic countries
                           such as Denmark, Norway, and Sweden), and G7 Government Index spreads
                           for all remaining developed countries. CIL construct aggregate high-spread
                           episodes in analogous fashion to the Calvo, Izquierdo and Mejía (2004)
                           measure of large capital flow reversals (i.e., CIL consider spikes in spreads
                           exceeding two standard deviations from the mean), and that a Sudden Stop
                           occurs when the measure of the fall-in-capital-flows phase overlaps (on a
                           yearly basis) with the aggregate high-spread phase. Episodes that lie within a
                           six-month interval are considered part of the same Sudden Stop phase.

        Barry Eichengreen and Muge Adalet (2005) extended the sample to include the

pre-1970 experience, thereby providing historical context. In particular, large current


                                                    6
account reversals appear to be the product of open trade in goods, services, and assets.

Reversals have only been frequent in the two heydays of global capital markets—the

recent period and the 1920s and 1930s. Large adjustments were much rarer under the

pre-World-War I gold standard and during the Bretton Woods years.

       An important fuel to the study of current account reversals has been the U.S.

experience of sustained large deficits. The intent is to find rules of thumb that will be

informative about the U.S. experience when the presumed “day of reckoning” comes and

the unsustainable is no longer sustained. The search for such lessons appears in

important papers by Sebastian Edwards (2005 and 2007) and Caroline Freund and Frank

Warnock (2005). They find an important role for the textbook forces thought to rein in a

current account imbalance—a slowing in income growth and a real depreciation of the

currency.

       Similar interest in the U.S. experience produced work in the 1980s on why the

current account deteriorated, which is the subject of the lower left cell of Table 1. The

main culprit at that time was identified to be the large budget deficit, which through

national income accounting was mirrored in its twin, the current account.

Contemporaneous discussions of this can be found in Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas

City (1985) and a later review has been provided by Bosworth (1993). This line of

argument petered out in the late 1990s when the U.S. federal budget went into surplus but

the current account remained deeply in red.

       Those researchers focusing on the right cells of the contingency table typically

take the perspective of emerging market economies. In particular, they view the portfolio

investment decisions of investors at the center of the global financial system as somewhat




                                              7
fickle. Assets in some emerging markets may be in fashion for a time. Those inflows

tend to appreciate the exchange rate, lead to reserve accumulation as authorities attempt

to offset that force, and push up prices in asset markets. Altogether, this presents a

“capital inflow problem” as described by Guillermo Calvo, Leo Leiderman, and Carmen

Reinhart (1993), an issue also studied by Eduardo Fernandez-Arias and Peter Montiel

(1996).

          When capital no longer flows into an emerging market, the nation can no longer

support an excess of spending over income. The result, in the phrase of Guillermo Calvo

and his coauthors, is a “sudden stop,” forcing current account adjustment. The empirical

application of this insight can be found in Calvo, Izquierdo, and Mejia (2004) and Calvo,

Izquierdo, and Loo-Kung (2006), both of which are described in more detail in Table 2.

2. Defining a capital flow bonanza

          The decision to adopt a particular algorithm to date and catalog capital inflow

bonanzas naturally involves tradeoffs. An advantage of casting our net wide to all large

capital inflow episodes is that it does not predispose us to episodes that inevitably ended

in a marked reversal. In this sense, there is a lower predisposition to tilt the analysis

toward economic crises. An inflow bonanza can end with a bang or with a whimper. In

this sense, our approach parallels the analysis of Goldfajn and Valdes (1999), who rather

than starting their analysis with currency crises dates, began by documenting episodes of

cumulative real exchange rate appreciations of varying degrees and then sorted out which




                                               8
episodes unwound through an abrupt nominal exchange rate crash and which did so

through reductions in inflation versus their trading partners. 1

         We began with the presumption that the best indicator of capital flows would be

reserve accumulation less the current account balance, as it measures the resources

acquired (or dispersed) through issuance (or retirement) of home country liabilities. This

indirect measurement of the change in liabilities seemed more likely to be available for a

longer time span and for more countries than direct information from financial accounts.

In the event, data on reserves tends to be published only on a delayed basis in many

countries. To keep our efforts topical, the current account balance as a percent of GDP is

our benchmark indicator. It is measured more consistently across time and international

boundaries than its capital account and financial account counterpart.2 For the more

recent period, the same filter rules are applied to the other measures as a robustness check

as is reported in an appendix.

         We began by applying the three-step approach proposed by Milesi-Ferreti and

Razin to our data set with a suitable revision that does not enforce a current account

reversal. This approach, however, raised some issues about dating the bonanzas of many

well-known episodes. In some countries where the deterioration in the current account

(and hence the rise in capital inflows) was a relatively smooth process over several years,

this algorithm did not flag these episodes as bonanzas even though the current account

deficits were large by historical standards. Heavy inflow cases, such as the United States



1
  Gourinchas et. al. (2001) perform a similar exercise to assess which credit booms end in crises and credit
crunches and which do not. Edwards (2004) is particularly careful in trying to consider both abrupt
reversals and more gradual adjustment.
2
  We would also like to thank Gian Maria Milesi-Ferreti for pointing out the financial account figures have
to be interpreted with care during years in which there is debt forgiveness, which show up as large debt
repayments (i.e., capital outflows).


                                                     9
since 2004 and Australia in several cycles since 1960, were missed altogether. In other

cases, the inflow bonanza persisted after the peak current account deficit had been

reached. For instance, the Thai and Malaysian current account deficits peaked in the

early 1990s; however, while the deficits remained large by historical standards well into

1996, these years are not classified as bonanzas by this algorithm. Many of the important

(but less persistent) surges in capital inflows of the late 1970s and early 1980s also go

undetected.

         We ultimately settled on an alternative algorithm that provided uniform treatment

across countries but was flexible enough to allow for significant cross-country variation

in the current account. As in Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999), we select a threshold to

define bonanzas that is common across countries (in this case the 20th percentile).3 This

threshold included most of the better known episodes in the literature but was not so

inclusive as to label a bonanza more “routine” deteriorations in the current account.

Because the underlying frequency distributions vary widely across countries, the

common threshold produces quite disperse country-specific cutoffs. For instance, in the

case of relatively closed India, the cutoff to define a bonanza is a current account

deficit/GDP in excess of 1.8 percent, while for trade-oriented Malaysia the comparable

cutoff is a deficit/GDP ratio of 6.6 percent. 4

         Figure 1, which plots the frequency distribution for 181 countries, highlights these

differences both across countries and major income groups. As the figure makes clear,




3
  We also impose a non-negativity constraint, so countries that are capital exporters throughout the sample
never record a bonanza.

definitions of bonanza episodes—using the current account, the financial account, and capital flows.

the range of experience is wide, but large deficits appear more frequently in lower-

income countries.

3. Sample coverage and data

       We employ three samples to analyze the capital bonanza phenomenon. The

broadest sample includes the 181 countries covered in the International Monetary Fund’s

World Economic Outlook for 1980 through 2007. Information is available on the current

account, real GDP, inflation, and the real exchange rate. This allows us to examine the

recent country experiences in a truly global setting.


                                                                      11
           We will refer to the second dataset as the “core” sample, which spans 1960

through 2007 and covers 64 countries across all regions. This sample is dominated by

high- and middle-income countries, where data availability poses less of a constraint. It

is for this sample that we are able to examine in greater depth the macroeconomic

features of the bonanzas. Also, for the core countries, we have a sufficiently complete

dating of economic crises (debt, banking, etc.) that allow us to assess whether a capital

inflow bonanza predisposes countries to financial crises.

           The third set is a small sample of eighteen industrial countries for which we have

data on house prices from the Bank for International Settlements. Otherwise, the data

coverage for this group is the same as the core group. Appendix Tables 1 and 2 list the

countries (and the income group they belong to) that make up the three samples. 5

           All data are annual. In addition to including time series on the current account,

capital and financial accounts, and nominal GDP (all in US dollars), we employ a variety

of macroeconomic times series. These include country-specific variables: international

reserves, nominal and real exchange rates, real GDP, consumer prices, export, imports,

government expenditure, revenue, and deficits, equity, and (in the case of some advanced

economies) real estate prices. In addition, we have dichotomous variables that date

external debt crises, currency crashes, and inflation and banking crises. Global variables,

such as commodity prices, international interest rates, growth in the world’s largest

economies, measures of macroeconomic volatility, and the global incidence of capital

flow bonanzas and various “types” of economic crises, round out the analysis. Appendix

Table 3 provides a full list of the variables as well as their respective sources.

    The income group classification is that provided by the World Bank.

        The availability of long time series on various aspects of macroeconomic

performance was important in deciding on the design principle of our key indicator—a

capital flow bonanza. Because we had gathered a sufficiently rich dataset, we could be

somewhat general in defining events, because we will be able to characterize behavior in

a wide window around those events. That is, we can see the run-up and the wind-down

in a manner that encompasses the definitions of earlier work.

3. Capital Flow Bonanzas: Global Cycles and Country Episodes

        In what follows, we provide a sketch of country-specific and global capital flow

cycles, including: incidence, by region and income group; duration; and links to global

indicators.

1. The big picture

        It is relatively well known that international capital flows have an important

cyclical component.6 The fact that capital (contrary to the predictions of the neoclassical

growth paradigm) does not flow from rich to poor countries has also received

considerable attention. 7 Both of these stylized facts are illustrated in the two panels of

Figure 2, which plot the incidence (i.e. the percent of countries) of capital inflow

bonanzas for the broad sample consisting of 181 countries. The specific dates of the

bonanza episodes on a country-by-country basis are listed in the four-part Appendix

Table 4, for high, middle-high, middle-low, and low income groupings. The third

various components of international capital flows into their permanent and transitory components.

  Lucas (1990) suggested human capital differentials might account for this “paradox,” while Reinhart and
Rogoff (2004) and Alfaro, et.al. (2008) point to the high incidence of sovereign default and weak
institutions, respectively.

column of this appendix table also provides the dates of sovereign external debt crises

(defaults or restructuring).8 For our core sample of 66 countries, which account for about

90 percent of world GDP, the bonanza dates for 1960 through 2007 are listed in Table 3.

           As the top panel of the figure illustrates, the last major “boom in booms” was the

early 1980s. To be more precise, as the core sample reveals for the longer 1960 to 2007

period, the upswing of this cycle was from 1975 to 1982, or just before the onset of the

debt crisis of the 1980s. Prior to 1975, capital flow bonanzas were fewer and further

between, consistent with the historical evidence presented in Eichengreen and Adalet

(2005). Capital flow bonanzas resurfaced in the early 1990s coinciding with a decline in

U.S. interest rates (see Calvo, Leiderman, and Reinhart, 1993 and Chuhan, Claessens and

Mamingi, 1998) and the large-scale Brady plan restructuring of emerging market debt.

This resurgence was modest and occurred in a more selective group of countries—a

feature well documented by the World Bank (1997). With Uruguay in 2002 marking the

last major crisis in emerging markets, bonanzas have re-appeared in force. The regional

breakdown indicates that the recipients in this latest wave include countries in Latin

America, mostly smaller ones benefiting from the commodity-price boom, industrial

countries where real estate prices had been rising rapidly, and the nations of Central and

Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, presumably being rewarded for closer

integration with the European Union.9

           Illustrated in the bottom panel of the figure is the well-publicized empirical

regularity that middle- and high-income countries receive the lion’s share of cross-border

    The link between capital flow bonanzas and debt crises will be the focus of Section 4.

  Discussions of the earlier wave of capital to Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union

in Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2007).

capital flows. This is true by a huge margin when flows are measured in U.S. dollar terms

and remains so when we calculate the incidence of bonanzas (which scale current account

deficits by GDP). Despite the fact that low-income countries account for 28 percent (50

countries) of the 181 countries in this sample, less than 18 countries have recorded a

capital bonanza in any given year during the past 30 years or so. The incidence of capital

flow bonanzas is far less cyclical for the low-income group. On the basis of these

observations, we base our more in-depth analysis of capital flow bonanzas and their link

to financial crises in the next two sections on a group of 66 countries, of which 58 are

middle- or high-income.10

           The two panels in Figure 3 provide complementary information on the duration of

bonanzas. The upper panel plots the maximum duration of bonanzas (in years) by

countries (rather than episodes). So, for example, six of the 181 countries never

experienced a capital inflow bonanza, as they are net capital exporters; this group

includes Brunei, Luxembourg, Namibia, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United

Arab Emirates. For most countries, bonanzas lasted somewhere between two and four

years, which is perhaps why so many governments (and investors) fall into the all-too-

common trap of treating bonanzas as permanent rather than transitory shocks—an issue

we take up later when examining the typical fiscal response to the abundance of foreign

capital.

           Turning now to an analysis of individual episodes, consistent with their cyclical

nature, three-quarters of the episodes identified during 1980 to 2007 last two years or less.

Some caution is in order in that there are a large number of instances in which bonanza

   It is important to note that the middle-income group is comprised of middle-low and middle-high income
(the latter constitute the largest single group), so our analysis bears on many developing countries beyond
the largest emerging markets.

longer and adds to the ex-ante confusion as to what is permanent and what is transitory.

The present US bonanza, which began in 2002 and was into its sixth consecutive year by

2007, is by no means common, but neither is it unique. Australia, and the United

Kingdom, among others, experienced similar long-lived bonanzas in the earlier (1960-

1979) period, as Table 3 makes plain.

2. The capital flow cycle and world commodity prices

         Capital inflow surges have often been linked to reductions in international

interest rates, economic growth in advanced economies, and global commodity price

booms. 11 In the remainder of this section, we briefly revisit the well-trodden path of the

external roots of capital flow bonanzas. Our primary aim in this paper—beyond

establishing systematically the dates and incidence of capital inflow bonanzas—is to

focus on the macroeconomic consequences or developments surrounding capital flows (a

topic that takes up the next two sections of the paper. As such, we only provide a mere

sketch of the links between the bonanza cycle and selected developments in global

macroeconomic conditions, so as to build on earlier analyses using the most recent data.

        To this end, we perform two simple exercises. First, we plot our time series on

the incidence of bonanzas for the 181-country sample over 1980 through 2007 against: (i)

real per-capita GDP growth in the advanced economies, as reported in the IMF’s World

Economic Outlook (upper panel of Figure 4); and (ii) the IMF’s index of real

commodity prices, excluding oil (bottom panel of Figure 4).12 The evidence presented in

top panel of Figure 4 is in line with Calvo, Leiderman, and Reinhart (1993), who posit

 As is conventionally done, the nominal commodity price index is deflated by an index of the price of
manufactures (see, for example Boughton, 1991).


                                                    20
that when growth slows in the advanced economies, global capital searches for higher

yields and profit opportunities abroad in emerging markets—a phenomenon that is well

underway at the current conjuncture, as discussed in Frankel (2007) in the context of the

carry trade and its previous incarnations. The capital flow bonanza-commodity price

boom link has an old history and some classic episodes of well-managed (in terms of the

macroeconomic policy response) and badly-botched varieties make for interesting

reading in Cuddington (1989) and sources cited therein. While the earlier 1980s do not

fit the pattern as neatly, it is important to note that a spectacular boom in commodity

prices prevailed in the late 1970s when the surge in the incidence of bonanzas began in

earnest, as shown in the next section. Beyond the direct positive implications of higher

commodity prices for export revenues for much of the emerging world, as Frankel (2006

and 2008a and 2008b) demonstrates, an underlying impetus to world commodity prices is

low or negative world interest rates, much along the lines of the late 1970s and the last

few years. Hence, the effects of lower international interest rates work not only through

the portfolio channels stressed in Calvo, Leiderman, and Reinhart (1993), but also the

commodity price channel à la Frankel (2006). A third, and important link between world

real interest rates and capital flows to emerging markets comes from the channel stressed

in Dooley and Fernandez-Arias (1996), who emphasize the benign impacts of low real

rates on default probabilities.

       Our second empirical exercise is an attempt to explain the share of bonanzas in

terms of the growth of real GDP in the advanced economies, real commodity prices, and

the U.S. real short-term interest rate. We employ the core dataset to capture the

significant swing in real commodity prices as well as the long stretch of negative real

limited range, from zero to 100 percent as befits a share of a total. Accordingly, we

specify that our independent variables explain the dependent variable by way of a logistic




                                                                  22
function. That is, the explanatory variables, along with a vector of ones to capture a

constant term, are aligned in the vector xt with corresponding coefficients in the vector β

to obey the functional form, 100·exp(xt β)/[1+exp(xt β)].

          The coefficients reported in the first column of Table 4 were estimated with a

maximum likelihood procedure using annual data from 1967 to 2006. As this is a

probability forecasting model, the goodness-of-fit measure we rely on chiefly is the

quadratic probability score (QPS), for the reasons explained in Diebold and Rudebusch

(1989).

          As anticipated in the figures, the coefficient on commodity prices is positive and

that on growth is negative; both are statistically significant at the one percent confidence

level. The coefficient on the contemporaneous real interest rate, however, does not match

the intuition provided in Calvo, Leiderman, and Reinhart (1993). Their explanation relies

on the cumulative encouragement to capital flows to the periphery afforded by low

interest rates at the core. To match this, the next six columns of the table report estimates

using successive individual lags of the real rate, from one to six years. In the event, the

size of the negative effect of real rates on the share and the significance of that effect, as

well as the explanatory power of the model, tends to increase as the lag lengthens.

4. Do capital flow bonanzas make countries more crisis prone?

       Are capital flow bonanzas a blessing, a curse, or neutral in making financial crises

more likely or more severe? The literature is filled with famous case studies of capital

flow bonanzas that ended in spectacular crises. The papers range from the infamous

episodes in the Southern Cone in the late 1970s-early 1980s (see, for instance, Diaz

Alejandro’s 1985 classic) to Calvo and Talvi (2005), who place great store in the capital

flow sudden stop following the Russian 1998 crisis in explaining Argentina’s subsequent

crash. Rather than focusing on specific episodes that are either as famous or more

obscure, we systematically examine the potential links between the likelihood of a capital

inflow bonanza and financial crises. Our analysis is conducted on a country-by-country

basis as well as at the “global” level consistent with the aim of providing an

encompassing approach. Our comprehensive database on the dates of bonanza and crises

episodes allows us to uncover novel results on the systematic connection between the

incidence of bonanzas and debt, currency, inflation, and banking crises. Hence, our

analysis sheds light on the first part of the question of whether financial crises are more

likely; it remains for future research to investigate issues glimpsed here pertaining to a

possible link between the order of magnitude of the bonanza and the severity of the crises.

The latter part of the section is devoted to more general macroeconomic volatility (as

opposed to crises).

catalogued, country-by-country, all the identified bonanza episodes. To examine the

potential links with financial crises of various stripes, we proceed symmetrically. Our

are reproduced in Table 5, while a full listing of dates for sovereign external defaults (or

restructurings), currency crashes, inflation crises, and banking crises are presented in

Banking crisis     We mark a banking crisis by two types of events:         This approach to dating the

bonanzas.13 In line with our dating of bonanzas, Table 6 provides beginning and ending

dates to define each crisis episode. Hence, an entry of a single year denotes that the crises

only lasted that long.




           From the crises dates shown in Table 6 and the bonanza dates listed in Table 3,

we constructed a family of country-specific probabilities. For each of the countries, this

implies four unconditional crisis probabilities, that of: default (or restructuring) on

external sovereign debt, a currency crash, an inflation crisis, and a banking crisis. We

also construct the probability of each type of crisis within a window of three years before

and after the bonanza year or years, this we refer to as the conditional probability of a

crisis. If capital flow bonanzas make countries more crises prone, the conditional

probability, P(Crisisi│Bonanza) should be greater than the unconditional probability of a

crisis, P(Crisisi), where the subscript i refers to the ith “type” of crisis (default, currency,

etc.).

         Table 7 aggregates these country-specific conditional and unconditional

probabilities by three groups (all countries, high income, and middle and low income).

         The main results are summarized as follows. For the full sample, the probability

of any of the four varieties of crises conditional on a capital flow bonanza is significantly



                                                       29
higher than the unconditional probability. Put differently, the incidence of a financial

crisis is higher around a capital inflow bonanza. However, separating the high income

countries from the rest qualifies the general result. As for the high income group, there

are no systematic differences between the conditional and unconditional probabilities.

        These results are not entirely surprising as the high income countries do not

default on their sovereign debts during the sample in question.14 Given that the threshold

that defines an inflation crisis is 20 percent per annum, it is also hardly a surprise that this

cutoff is seldom surpassed by wealthy countries—whether experiencing a capital flow

bonanza or not. It is less obvious, a priori, that there is no discernable increase in the

likelihood of a banking or currency crisis for the advanced economies. The bottom row

of Table 7 provides the share of countries for which P(Crisisi│Bonanza) ≥ P(Crisisi) as

an additional indication of how commonplace is it across countries to see bonanzas

associated with a more crisis-prone environment. For sovereign defaults, less than half

the countries record an increase in default probabilities around capital flow bonanzas.

(Here, it is important to recall that about one-third of the countries in the core sample are

high income.) For currency, banking, and inflation crises, the majority of countries

register a higher propensity to enter into crisis around bonanza periods.

        Beyond the aggregate results presented in Table 7, Figures 5 to 8 for debt,

currency, inflation, and banking crises, respectively, present a comparison of conditional

and unconditional probabilities for individual countries, where the differences in crisis

probabilities were greatest. (Hence, the country list varies across figures). As noted

earlier, no high-income country turns up in Figure 5 on debt crises. The same cannot be

  There are, however, many instances where the now-advanced economies defaulted in their earlier
incarnations (see Reinhart and Rogoff, 2008a for a full chronology of these episodes).

said of Figures 6 through 8. While the advanced economies register much lower

(conditional and unconditional) crisis probabilities than their lower income counterparts,

the likelihood of crisis is higher around bonanza episodes in several instances. Notably,

Finland and Norway record a higher probability of a banking crisis during the vicinity of

a capital flow bonanza, while Greece, Italy, and the United Kingdom show a greater

predisposition to an inflation crisis when bonanzas are present.

2. Bonanzas as a predictor of sovereign defaults

        Beyond the country-by-country comparisons described in the preceding section,

we wanted to refine further the relationship between bonanzas and sovereign defaults. As

discussed in Reinhart and Rogoff (2008a) in the context of the evidence from 1800 to

2007, there is an intimate connection between the global capital flows (as measured

annually in terms of U.S. dollars) and default (exactly as measured here, by the incidence

of sovereign default). A variant of this relationship is presented in Figure 9, which plots

the annual incidence of capital flow bonanzas during 1960-2007 for the core sample and

the comparable incidence on sovereign default. The overall incidence is higher and more

variable than that shown in Figure 1 for the 181 countries, as the core sample

predominantly represents countries that have access to international capital markets and,

in particular, private flows. A cursory inspection of this figure is suggestive that the

incidence of bonanzas possibly “leads” the incidence of default. This temporal pattern

would seem plausible in light of the fact that capital inflows to developing countries have




                                                         35
historically been predominantly debt-creating flows.15 As the bonanza continues,

leverage (usually public and private) increases.16

         To investigate this possibility formally, we ran a series of logistic regressions

where the dependent variable is the aggregate or global probability of sovereign default

against the aggregate or global probability of a capital flow bonanza, either

contemporaneous or lagged anywhere between one year and six years. As in the prior

section, this functional form respects the limited range of the dependent variable. These

results are summarized in Table 8 along the column headings for lags up to six years. As

the results indicate, the fit of regression improves steadily as the lag length is extended up

to six years. The single bonanza regressor is statistically significant at the one percent

level for the regressions where the t-statistics appear in italics. The preferred

specification (six lags) yields an R2 of about 0.50. Similarly, the QPS statistic falls. As

in the previous discussion on determinants, the global factors behind bonanzas, this

exercise is meant to be illustrative rather than a self-contained model of sovereign default.

It is worth mentioning that this external default time series registers a contemporaneous

correlation with world real interest rates of 0.59, underscoring that there are multiple

factors beyond bonanzas that determine the likelihood of a sovereign debt crises. These

results would not be unfamiliar to the reader on Mendoza and Terrones (2008), who

conclude that not all credit booms end in financial crises, but most emerging markets

crises were associated with credit booms.



15
   It is important to reiterate that the incidence of sovereign default during the period in question owes to
emerging markets.
16
   On the basis of the historical track record, it is plausible to expect a higher chance of a sovereign default
after a bonanza even in cases where government debt is not increasing. This is because the government
sooner or later has usually ended up guaranteeing private sector debts.

3. Bonanzas and macroeconomic volatility

        Crises, like bonanzas, are discrete, traumatic, and (in the more stable countries)

relatively rare. Yet another possibility where capital flow bonanzas would be less than a


                                                 37
blessing might be if these bouts of capital inflows lead to an overall increase in

macroeconomic volatility, even if it did not increase the odds of a financial crisis outright.

To shed some light on this issue, we performed some simple exercises involving the

volatilities of real GDP growth, consumer price inflation, and the current account-GDP

ratio. Needless to say, this only skims the surface of the potential links between

bonanzas and macroeconomic volatility.

         We measure volatility as the 66th percentile of the absolute annual change in each

macroeconomic variable. Table 9 reports for the full sample the simple pairwise

correlations between the incidence of capital inflow bonanzas from 1981 to 2007 and the

volatility (as described above) of real GDP growth, inflation, and the current account to

GDP. For all three variables the correlation is positive (ranging from a low of 0.25 fo

inflation to a high of 0.43 for real GDP growth) and statistically significant. Of course,

this exercise does not speak of causality or how representative this “global” bonanza-

volatility link plays out for individual countries.

5. Anatomy of Bonanza Episodes

         The macroeconomic developments associated with surges in capital inflows are a

mixture of anecdotal evidence from case studies and more systematic analyses which (to

our knowledge) have no standardized definition of “a capital inflow episode” or

bonanza.17 The collective evidence from this literature suggests that capital inflows are

most often associated with both a deterioration in the current account and an

accumulation in international reserves, ostensibly from the central bank’s persistent

efforts to avoid or mitigate the tendency towards a nominal and real exchange rate

appreciation that usually goes hand-in-hand with the capital inflow.18 As Calvo,

Leiderman,and Reinhart (1993) document in several papers, the pressures for the

exchange rate to appreciate stem both from an increased demand for the local assets

(which may or may not lead to an asset price boom or bubble) as well as from an increase

in aggregate demand for both traded and nontraded goods. As long as the supply of the

nontraded good is not perfectly elastic, the relative price of nontradeables increase (i.e., a

real exchange rate appreciation).

         In an attempt to analyze the cyclical behavior of fiscal policy in advanced and

emerging market economies, Kaminsky, Reinhart, and Vegh (2004) present evidence for

emerging markets of the “when it rains, it pours” phenomenon; that is to say that the

cyclical components of GDP, net capital flows and real fiscal spending all reinforce each

other. Periods of cyclically high capital inflows are associated with an expansion in real

government spending—fiscal policy is procyclical both in relation to output and capital

inflows.

17
  See Reinhart and Reinhart (1998) for a discussion of the stylized facts and the references cited therein.
18
  See Reinhart and Reinhart (2008) for evidence of fear of floating or, in the recent context, fear of an
appreciation.


                                                     39
       Some of these macroeconomic trends, notably the worsening current account,

appreciating real exchange rates, and rising asset prices, regularly present themselves on

the eve of currency and banking crises (Kaminsky and Reinhart, 1999) and sudden stops

(Edwards, 2004 and 2007). In the remainder of this section, we extend such comparisons.

1. Growth, inflation, and the current account

       Capital flow bonanzas—as with sudden stops, current account reversals, and

financial crises—each have their own idiosyncrasies. However, these episodes also tend

to share common threads that cut across time and national boundaries, which we exploit

by opening a wide window of comparison.

       Our strategy is to examine the behavior of key macroeconomic and financial

indicators in the run-up and aftermath of the identified bonanza episodes, starting with

the “big picture.” Figure 10 presents four panels showing medians across episodes

during 1980 to 2007 for key macroeconomic indicators: real GDP growth, inflation, the

current account balance-to-GDP, and the real exchange rate. We plot each series from

four years (-4) before the bonanza (year 0) to four years (4) after. Because of the

enormous diversity in our 181-country sample, the medians are plotted separately for

high-, middle-, and low-income countries (denoted by a solid, dashed, and dotted lines,

respectively). In line with the findings of several papers on capital account reversals and

sudden stops, the average path of the current account balance to GDP (top right panel) is

distinctly V-shaped, with the current account deteriorating into the bonanza year and




                                            40
Figure 10. Growth, inflation, the current account, real exchange rate around
bonanzas: 181 countries, 1980‐2007




improving steadily thereafter. Note that this is not an artifact of our selection criteria.

We do not select for big changes, only big levels. Current account deficits are, on

average, largest for the low-income countries and smallest for the advanced economies,

consistent with the evidence reported earlier on cut-off values. The path of the real




                                              41
exchange rate (bottom left panel) shows that there is a cumulative appreciation (a decline

denotes an appreciation) up to the bonanza year and a sharp depreciation afterwards. The

analysis of Goldfajn and Valdes (1999) presents compelling evidence that in the

overwhelming majority of cases, the cumulative real appreciation unwinds through a

swift nominal depreciation (perhaps through a full-fledged currency crisis) rather than

through a downward adjustment in prices.

       GDP growth rises into the bonanza but then slows, settling back to a roughly pre-

bonanza growth rate for middle- and low-income countries and a markedly lower growth

rate for high-income economies. As to inflation, the trajectory is so diverse across the

three income groups that it is impossible to draw any conclusion as to a fixed behavioral

pattern. This suggests that the efforts of central banks in anchoring expectations are more

important than the stage of the capital-flow cycle.

       This association holds across individual countries as well. Figure 11 provides

reinforcing cross-episode evidence via scatter plots that compare the real GDP growth

and inflation performance for the year before and after the bonanza. Observations above

the 45 degree ray indicate that growth (inflation) is higher one year after the bonanza than

the year before the bonanza episode; the converse is true for observations below the

diagonal. Taken together these scatter plots confirm that for the most part (63 percent of

the episodes) growth is lower after the capital inflow boom, while no clear pattern

emerges for inflation.

       The narrative illustrated in Figure 12 for the core 66 countries for the longer

sample spanning 1960 through 2007 intimately mirrors the broader post-1980 experience;

the current account registers a V-shaped pattern, inflation is markedly different for the

wealthy and not-so-wealthy countries, and real growth picks up in the run-up to the

bonanza but does worse in the aftermath—particularly for high-income countries.

Whatever growth benefits accrue during the bonanza phase are but short-lived.




                                             44
2. External sector: Reserves, exchange rates, and trade

           There is a blossoming recent literature trying to explain why many emerging

market countries have been amassing international reserves at an unprecedented clip.

Some studies have stressed a “precautionary” motive in which countries build their war

chests in good times to provide liquidity if need be in bad times.19 What the upper panel

of Figure 13 makes plain is that the practice of accumulating reserves, especially in

developing countries during capital inflow years (which characterizes the current juncture

for many emerging markets) is far from new, as the episodes depicted in this figure span

1960 to the present. Reluctance to allow for a sustained nominal or real exchange rate

appreciation is a constant that has withstood the test of time in emerging markets.

Tendencies to lean against the wind are seldom more pronounced than when there is a

capital inflow bonanza underway. The forty-percent-plus increase in reserves in the run-

up to the bonanza is no trivial change for the middle and low income countries, who as of

2007 held about twice as much in reserves as their high-income counterparts (bottom

panel).




19
     See for instance, Bastourre, Carrera, Ibarlucia (2008), and Carrol and Jeanne (2008).


                                                       45

                                              46
       There is little surprising in Figure 14, which displays the same graphs for the

external indicators (trade balance, exports, imports, and real exchange rate) for the 66-

country sample. The trade balance follows the same path of the current account, as

imports expand more rapidly than exports at the outset of the bonanza. The real

exchange rate initially appreciates and subsequently depreciates in the years immediately

following the capital flow bonanza. The only incremental evidence revealed by

Figure 14 is that the real depreciation shown in the bottom right panel is noticeably

smoother than that shown in Figure 9 for the 181 country average post-1980; possibly,

this difference may reflect that crises are more severe (Kaminsky and Reinhart, 1999) and

reversals more acute (Eichengreen and Adalet, 2005) in the more recent period or that the

addition of lower-income countries in the larger sample adds to volatility.

3. Fiscal policy: amplifier or stabilizer

       Managing surges in capital inflows poses nontrivial policy challenges, particularly

if the inflows are persistent and/or if the orders of magnitude are staggering; these policy

challenges are discussed in detail and examples provided in Reinhart and Reinhart (1998).

Policy responses can mitigate the down-side of capital flow bonanzas (recall the main

conclusion from the preceding section is that bonanzas are historically associated with

higher odds of a financial crises) or amplify their more worrisome tendencies. The

mismanagement of capital flow bonanza-commodity price boom episodes (see

Cuddington, 1989) more often than not has its roots in the authorities’ premise that the

“good times” are permanent and, as such, can fully support a full-fledged expansion in

real fiscal spending. This is the essence of fiscal procyclicality as documented by Gavin

and Perotti (1997) and Kaminsky, Reinhart, and Vegh (2004) (or KRV henceforth).

       Figure 15 presents, in a comparable format, the evolution of real government

spending and revenues and the fiscal balance (all indexed to the level four years prior to

the bonanza). The deeply entrenched pattern of procyclical fiscal behavior by middle and

low income countries emerges unambiguously from the three panels that make up the

figure. Government spending from two years prior to the year of the bonanza rises by

about 20 percent in real terms at a time during which growth is accelerating, as discussed.

Despite even faster growth in government revenues (than in expenditures), the fiscal

balance deteriorates markedly into the bonanza year. (This deterioration materializes




                                            48
Figure 15. Fiscal Indicators and Bonanzas: 66 Countries, 1960‐2007




because, while revenues are growing more rapidly, they are doing so from a lower base

than expenditures four years prior to the bonanza.) The lax expenditure during the boom

phase (and the associated deterioration in the fiscal balance) sets the stage for a “non-

voluntary” fiscal tightening when the economic downturn sets in. Hence, as KRV (2004)

illustrate, the magnitude of the swing in real fiscal spending during the cycle from boom

to bust can be as large as 25 to 35 percentage points (as in the case of Uganda and Liberia,

respectively.)20



20
  To be clear, the amplitude of the swing is calculated as the percent growth in real government spending
during an expansion minus the growth in government spending in downturns. In the case of an extremely
procyclical government, real spending would grow during good times (as shown in Figure 15), perhaps by


                                                   49
        KRV rank the government’s procyclicality propensity by two measures: the

correlation between the cyclical component of real GDP and real fiscal spending (if

positive, it implies procyclicality) and the amplitude of the swing in real spending (as

described). Using these two indicators, we conducted a simple exercise to shed light on

the plausible conjecture that the procyclical nature of government spending may help

explain why the odds of a financial crisis increase around capital flow bonanzas, as

illustrated in the preceding section. On a cross-country basis, we correlated the

difference between the conditional, P(Crisisi│Bonanza), and unconditional probability,

P(Crisisi) for each of the four types of crises (as shown for selected countries in Figures

4-8) and the two KRV measures of fiscal procyclicality (one at a time). The eight

correlations were positive ranging from 0.25 to 0.46; six of the correlations were

statistically significant. The results of these preliminary exercises are, thus, consistent

with our conjecture about the destabilizing role of fiscal policy around capital flow

bonanzas—and possibly more generally.

4. Asset markets

        The last indicators we examine around bonanza periods are asset prices,

specifically, real equity prices for the 66-country sample and real house prices for a

subset of 18 high income countries for the period from 1970 through 2007. There has

been discussion and some anecdotal evidence to suggest that asset prices boom during

some famous capital inflow bonanzas (as in Calvo, Izquierdo and Talvi, 2003). Such a

phenomenon appears reasonable, as a capital inflow represents an increased demand (by

the rest of the world) for a particular country’s assets, which would include equity and


15 percent; and in downturns it would contract by about 10 percent. Thus the amplitude of the swing
during the business cycle would be 25 percent.


                                                   50
real estate. As to asset prices and crises, one cannot read Kindelberger (1989) without

drawing a tight link between the two.

       Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999) present evidence to suggest that equity price

bubbles are systematically present in the eve of banking crises—indeed, they are a good

leading indicator of these. Reinhart and Rogoff (2008b) present evidence that real house

prices boomed on the eve of the worst post-World War II banking crises in emerging

market economies.

       Figures 16 and 17 suggest a three-way link between capital inflow bonanzas, asset

price booms, and financial crises. For both asset markets (for equities in Figure 16 and

houses in Figure 17), there is a marked rise in inflation-adjusted prices that peaks at the

time of the bonanza and is followed by a sustained decline during the four years

following the bonanza. Taking together the evidence on the higher likelihood of a

sovereign default in particular (and other types of financial crises in general), the

slowdown in real GDP growth, and the protracted decline in asset values following the

capital bonanza, the swift corrections in the twin deficits (current account and fiscal)

observed after the bonanza may likely be a matter of necessity rather than choice.

6. Conclusion

        Conversations revolving around international financial adjustment sometimes

have an aspect similar to the climactic scene in a few Hollywood crime movies in which

the villain lures the hero in a hall of mirrors. It is not clear which is the originating action

and which is the reflection, so that left can be right, or right left. Invariably, the initial

target turns out to be glass. In international finance, one country’s current account

surplus can correspond to many countries’ deficits, and a surplus is mirrored in a deficit

in the capital account. As a consequence, the considerable literature on international

adjustment overlaps to a significant degree, even though the studies adopt different

selection criteria for what constitutes an event.

        We have adopted a back-to-basics approach toward understanding some of the

features of episodes of heavy capital inflows which, given double-entry bookkeeping, has

usually meant periods of large current account deficits by historical standards. By

focusing squarely on the perspective of the recipient of capital inflows (wherever or

however poor or wealthy that country may be), our analysis does not extend to issues

pertaining to lending countries or the broader and currently popular discussion of global

imbalances. Nearly all the areas we have touched upon, both as to the causes and

consequences of the bonanzas, merit further scrutiny, particularly as relates to the links

between asset prices, bubbles, crises, and capital flows.

        As to the policy responses to capital inflow bonanzas, our analysis has been silent

in all dimensions but one. Namely, we present evidence on the infamously procyclical

and destabilizing reaction of fiscal policy (specifically government spending) to the




                                               54
capital flow bonanza in nearly all but the high income countries.21 The expansionary

fiscal policy unfolds against a backdrop of higher growth in output and government

revenues associated with the bonanza. It is not unreasonable to conjecture that these

government spending practices in “good times” set the stage for a multi-decade pattern of

serial default.

         During the past few years, international interest rates have remained low (by

historical standards), and real interest rates have turned negative on a sustained basis for

the first time since the late 1970s. Commodity prices have surged. Once again,

investors in the financial centers of the world and elsewhere are tripping over themselves

in the eternal quest for higher yields in emerging markets and other higher-risk

investments. From an emerging market perspective, the external scenario of the past few

years can be best characterized as “benign.” Yet, as of 2007, 85 percent of countries in

our core sample have recorded increases in real government expenditures. Perhaps once

again, authorities view the favorable global environment as permanent). Fully two-thirds

of the 181 countries covered in the IMF’s latest World Economic Outlook recorded

higher inflation in 2007 than in 2006, and an equal share recorded even higher inflation

on a year-end basis in 2007 than on a year-average basis—pointing to even higher

readings for 2008. If this is what is to be expected in good times, where capital bonanzas

are plentiful, it is perhaps time to start re-reading Kindleberger.




21
  It is important to recall that there is a positive association between the degree of fiscal procyclicality and
the incremental odds of a financial crisis around capital flow bonanzas.
