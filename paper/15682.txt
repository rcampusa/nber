This paper examines how labor income volatility and social security benefits can influence lifecycle
household portfolios. We examine how much the individual optimally saves and where, taking into
account liquid financial wealth and annuities, and stocks as well as bonds. Higher labor income uncertainty
and lower old-age benefits boost demand for stable income in retirement, but also when young. In
addition, a declining equity glide path with age is appropriate for the worker with low income uncertainty;
for the high income risk worker, equity exposure rises until retirement. We also evaluate how differences
in social security benefits can influence retirement risk management.

                         The Effect of Uncertain Labor Income
                       and Social Security on Life-cycle Portfolios

          Risky labor income and pension payouts are key determinants of retirement wellbeing

and investment behavior over the life-cycle. In the past, defined benefit (DB) pension plans

and social security benefits provided a substantial and relatively stable component of

retirement wealth, whereas more recently, labor market flexibility has grown, along with

defined contribution (DC) plans. As a result, households will be required to take on increased

responsibility for retirement accumulation and decumulation in a more uncertain world. This

paper examines how consumers can optimally allocate their saving among two major asset

classes, namely equity and bonds, and two types of retirement assets, namely liquid saving

and illiquid annuities. We illustrate how incorporating labor income risk as well as social

security benefits influences optimal asset allocation, in a realistically-calibrated dynamic life-

cycle model.

          Our study extends prior literature by taking into account life annuities which pay a

defined stream of benefits over the remaining lifetime (e.g. Cocco, Gomes, and Maenhout

2005). This work evaluates the impact of alternative empirical labor income trajectories,

allowing for an observed inverted-U-shaped age-related pay profile as well as volatility

around that profile. We use this approach to assess how differences in earnings profiles and

shocks may drive life-cycle investment behavior and the demand for annuities. We also build

on our own prior work (Horneff, Maurer, Mitchell, and Stamos 2009a, b) which shows that

households can benefit substantially from holding annuities as well as capital market assets.

As demonstrated there, the particular appeal of annuities is that they offer consumers not only

an investment return from the underlying assets but also the survival credit generated from

pooling mortality risk.1 These papers provide insight into how a reasonable investor would

optimally save and invest her wealth across bonds, stocks, and annuities, taking into account

various levels of social security replacement rates.

          In what follows, we model the effect of uncertain labor income and social security

benefit replacement ratios on life-cycle portfolios. After outlining the empirical framework

employed, we present results on optimal expected consumption, saving, asset allocation, and

annuity purchases for representative households. We show that higher labor income risk and

lower social security replacement rates will induce higher demand for stable income – not

only in retirement but also earlier in life. In other words, individuals exposed to labor earnings

risk can, to some extent, “roll their own” personal defined benefit scheme by resorting to the

private annuity market. We also show that a declining equity glide path with age is

appropriate for both low and middle income risk workers, while, for the high income risk

worker, equity exposure rises until retirement.



Empirical Strategy

          To illustrate how different levels of labor income uncertainty and social security

retirement benefits affect outcomes of interest, we examine the case of an individual who is

assumed to work from the age of 20 until retirement at age 65, after which she expects to rely

on social security benefits, withdrawals from liquid saving, and privately-purchased life

annuity income.2 The maximum assumed survival age is 100. She can invest her liquid saving

in riskless bonds or risky stocks, and she may also purchase immediate real fixed payout


dynamic portfolio choice models, see Horneff, Maurer, Mitchell, and Stamos (2009a, b) and

Wachter and Yogo (2009).

    For a more detailed description of the modeling approach see Horneff, Maurer, Mitchell, and

Stamos (2009a, b); flexible hours and endogenous retirement ages are considered in Chai,

Horneff, Maurer, and Mitchell (2009).

annuities, both before and after retirement. The individual anticipates surviving from period t

to t + 1 with probability pts , which is her subjective probability. She derives CRRA utility

from consumption of a single non-durable good C. The value function is maximized over the

                                                           pts Et Vt 1  where ρ is the coefficient of

relative risk aversion, β is a time discount factor, t is the share of liquid assets held in

equities, and at refers to annuity purchases each period.3 The household is precluded from

borrowing against future labor income and from short-selling bonds, stocks, and life

annuities.

          A topic of considerable recent interest is how to model labor income uncertainty.4 We

posit that each period’s labor income Yt is given by Yt  exp( f (t )) PtU t with Pt  Pt 1 N t , where

f(t) represents a hump-shaped income profile over the life-cycle often used in empirical

research (Cocco, Gomes, and Maenhout 2005). Here, Pt represents the permanent human

capital component and Nt allows for stochastic changes; Ut is a transitory shock; σu is the

volatility of the transitory shock and σn of the permanent shock. 5 In retirement (t > K), we

assume (for simplicity) that the individual receives constant and real social security benefits

with a constant benefit replacement ratio (ζ ) with respect to final salary, expressed as

Yt   exp f K PK , where K is the final year of work.

3
    For this analysis, we assume that the household derives no utility from bequests. Hurd

    (1989) suggests that most bequests are accidental.
4
    Notable prior studies on asset allocation that consider uninsurable labor income risk include

Campbell and Viceira (2002); Heaton and Lucas (1997); Viceira (2001); Bodie, Detemple,

Otruba, and Walter (2004); and Polkovnichenko (2007).
5
    The logarithms of both Nt and Ut are normally distributed with means zero and with

volatilities σn and σu, respectively. The shocks are assumed to be uncorrelated.
                                                                                                      4



       Our benchmark case for an illustrative consumer sets preference parameters to

standard values found in the life-cycle literature: the relative risk aversion coefficient is ρ = 5

and the discount factor β = 0.96 (e.g. Gomes and Michaelides, 2005). Representing subjective

survival probabilities, we apply nonlinear least squares to fit the Gompertz force of mortality

to the 2000 Population Basic mortality table for US females. To calculate the actuarial

premium of a life payout annuity, we use annuitant mortality tables and include expense

loading λ of 7.2 percent, consistent with Mitchell et al. (1999). The household can directly

invest in two financial assets: riskless bonds and risky stocks. The riskless real bond gross

return is 2 percent, while the real risky stock return is log-normally distributed with an

expected return of 6 percent and a volatility of 18 percent as in much of the literature. The

deterministic age-dependent labor income function for an individual with only a high-school

education is taken from Cocco, Gomes, and Maenhout (2005). The assumed base case social

security replacement rate ζ of 68 percent is currently typical of low-wage retirees in the

United States (Mitchell and Phillips 2006). In an alternative scenario, we also show how

outcomes would change with a lower replacement rate of 50 percent; this figure is consistent

with replacement ratios for low-wage earners in Japan (OECD 2009: 39). These two

alternatives are of interest given that Japan’s current demographic situation and social security

shortfalls may well presage the future for the United States.

       The labor income volatility parameters for the base case are σn = 0.05 and σu = 0.075,

representing a labor income profile with relatively low risk; here correlations between the

stock returns and the permanent (transitory) income shocks are set to n  0 u  0 . In the

alternative scenario, we evaluate results using a much higher labor income risk volatility of

four times the base level as well as n  0.25 . In sensitivity analysis, we also show results for
                                                                                                  5



lower (ρ = 3) and higher (ρ = 8) levels of risk aversion. 6 Table 1 summarizes model

parameters.

Life-cycle Patterns of Investment, Saving, and Consumption

         The base case investor is one with low labor income risk, high social security

replacement rate, and medium risk aversion, who faces incomplete private markets for

immediate annuities with high loadings. Results appear in Figure 1, which displays the

expected development of labor income, consumption, liquid saving, annuity purchases, and

annuity income from age 20 to 100. To generate a smooth lifetime consumption path, the

worker saves from her 30’s to her mid-50’s so as to pay for later consumption. By her late

50’s, liquid assets – outside of annuities – rise to a maximum of almost 11 times her starting

or initial labor income. After that, the investor gradually starts drawing down assets to

compensate for declining labor income; after about age 60, liquid assets are deployed to buy

private annuities. From retirement at age 65, liquid assets are depleted rapidly permitting the

retiree to maintain pre-retirement consumption; as well, she relies increasingly on income

flowing from private annuities, which she continues to buy even well beyond retirement age.

In her early 80s, her liquid assets are fully exhausted because she has no bequest motive; after

that point, the annuity payout stream is considerable, helping maintain a smooth consumption

path throughout her remaining lifetime.

    We solve the optimization problem by backward induction in a three-dimensional state

space, whereby for each grid point we evaluate the policy and value functions using Gaussian

quadrature integration and cubic spline interpolation. For technical details we refer the

interested reader to Horneff, Maurer, and Stamos (2008) and Horneff, Maurer, Mitchell, and

Stamos (2009a, b).
                                                                                                         6



Figure 1 here

          Figure 2 indicates how liquid assets as a multiple of first-year labor income, and

saving rates are expected to change with age. The saving rate is defined as

SRate t  1  C t / Income t and Income refers to the flow of labor income and annuity benefits.7

The base case is represented by the solid line, for the low labor income risk/high social

security replacement rate scenario. In this safer world, the individual has little need to save

early in life: the saving rate is low at young ages and only from the mid-20’s does saving rise,

with a peak in the mid-40’s of 10 percent per year, and it becomes negative (-5 percent) in the

mid-50’s. After retirement, saving rates drop precitipitously and reach a negative -40 percent

so as to smooth consumption; the elderly older than about age 85 have a saving rate of zero.

Liquid assets grow slowly early in life, rising to around 10 times first-year labor income at

their peak.

Figure 2 here

          In the riskier scenario, the social security replacement rate is reduced to 50 percent,

and labor income risk is four times the base level and correlated with the stock market. Here,

the young adult will engage in substantially higher saving to build a buffer against high labor

income volatility – over 40 percent per annum. Assets rise to 40 times first-year income by the

late 50‘s. Next, the saving rate falls, crossing the zero mark around the early 60’s; thereafter it

rises again briefly just before retirement to offset low social security benefits. As we shall

show next, the money is used mainly to purchase annuities that provide a secondary stable

income stream in retirement. Nevertheless, this individual’s liquid saving continues to rise



7
    Here we report the saving rate as SRatet  1  E (Ct ) / E ( Incomet ) ; in unreported results, we

have also computed SRatet  1  E (Ct / Incomet ) which is substantially lower in the high

risk/low replacement rate scenario.
                                                                                                   7



through the mid-50’s, due to returns on investment. After retirement, at 65, when the social

security benefit begins, assets are consumed and the saving rate trajectory follows the one

described earlier.

        Turning to Figure 3, the three Panels illustrate how the individual will optimally

allocate her total financial wealth by age across equities, bonds, and private annuities; here,

total financial wealth is defined to include both liquid assets and the present value of future

private annuity income claims. On average, as is indicated in Panel A, the base case

individual (solid line) will optimally hold only equities from youth to about age 50 (apart

from a few bonds early on, shown in Panel B). This is a common result in many life-cycle

studies and occurs because, early in life, the individual’s main asset is human capital which

has bond-like payout characteristics. This is especially true with low labor income

uncertainty, where her relatively safe labor income is also protected in retirement with a

relatively high social security benefit. She will optimally diversify her complete portfolio,

which includes both the present value of her human capital (labor income plus social security

benefits) as well as financial assets, by holding little to nothing in bonds and instead invests

entirely in equities. Beginning about age 55, her asset allocation begins to include more bonds

as her remaining work years dwindle.

        The optimal pattern for privately-purchased annuities is illustrated in Panel C; these

play no role in the investor’s portfolio prior to the age of 59, as they are relatively unattractive

vis a vis bonds due to high loading and the use of annuitant survival tables in pricing. At older

ages, however, the annuity survival credit rises above the bond rate; as a result, annuities

crowd out bonds. In retirement, liquid assets are depleted to support consumption and buy

annuities, which provide a secure private income stream (assuming no bequests). From the

early 80’s, the retiree is fully annuitized.
                                                                                                  8



          These results should be contrasted those generated by the alternative scenario with

high labor income uncertainty and low social security replacement rates.8 In general we would

expect that this consumer will need to save more, and hold more safe assets. This is borne out

in Panels A-C (dashed line), where the equity fraction starts at zero and even in middle age

remains below 30 percent; by contrast the bond fraction starts out at 100 percent and falls as

the worker nears retirement. This is because labor income no longer produces a bond-like

stream of payments that previously pushed the young investor into equities. This investor also

demands more annuities, beginning around age 45, to help offset variable work earnings. The

annuitized fraction then rises quickly around retirement, to help offset the now-low social

security replacement rates. Around age 60, the rising survival credit dominates the annuity

pricing offsets due to loads and the use of annuitant mortality tables. In all cases the transition

to annuities is accomplished by a substantial movement out of bonds: her allocation to bonds

drops from 65 to about 15 percent. As in the base case, the individual is fully annuitized from

age 83 onward. It is also worth noting that, around age 65 when she becomes entitled to social

security benefits, she is no longer exposed to labor income risk. Accordingly, the stabile

private annuity income plus the social security payments permits the investor to hold more

equities. Thus equity exposure rises to over 40 percent, and then it gradually declines in favor

of annuities, until liquid savings are exhausted at age 83.9



Sensitivity Analysis




8
    These are partial equilibrium computations, in that lower social security benefit are not

offset by social security tax cuts.
9
    This is because of the increasing survival credit at older ages, which raises expected annuity

payouts vis a vis equities (Horneff, Maurer, Mitchell, and Stamos 2009a, b).
                                                                                                    9



          Next we review how results change across six combinations of labor income risk

levels and social security replacement rates; comparative results appear in Table 2. Panel A

focuses on the high social security replacement rate scenario and reports liquid assets, saving

rates, and asset allocation fractions, for three workers: the low income volatility case (the base

case above), a high volatility case (the alternative scenario defined above), and a middle risk

case (defined as σn = 0.10, σu = 0.20 and n  0 ). Panel B indicates the same results for a

lower social security benefit replacement rate of 50 percent. We report patterns for five

decades of life from age 45 to 85.

Table 2 here

           Comparing Panels A and B for all three levels of labor income risk, it is evident that

the Panel B individual (with lower old-age benefits) accumulates more liquid assets (row 6 vs

row 1) by saving more early in life (row 7 vs row 2) but she draws down her assets more

quickly after retirement, so as to preserve her consumption stream. Now, moving horizontally

across the table, irrespective of social security benefit levels, as labor income risk rises, so too

do liquid assets. For example, even by age 45, the high labor income risk individual has

amassed assets five times more due to a much higher saving rate (17.4 percent vs 8.5

percent).10

          Moving horizontally across the table, it is clear that more labor income risk reduces

the demand for equities (rows 3 and 8), irrespective of the social security replacement rate.

Similarly, higher income risk makes annuities more attractive at younger ages, in all cases

(rows 5 and 10). As seen above, a declining equity glide path with age is appropriate for both

10
     In the medium labor income case, the saving rate is always lower than for the low income

risk case, though liquid assets are higher in all cases. This is due to the fact that this medium

income risk individual saves from a younger age, and at a higher rate (in results available on

request).
                                                                                                   10



low and middle income risk workers, while, for the high income risk worker, equity exposure

optimally rises until retirement. Moving down the table, we note that lower replacement rates

prompt lower equity holdings for both low and middle income risk workers, while bonds and

annuities become more desirable. For those facing high labor income risk, asset allocation

patterns are less sensitive to old-age benefit levels, though the direction is similar.

       Next we investigate the sensitivity of our results with respect to the investor’s level of

risk aversion. In addition to the base case risk parameter ( = 5) analyzed above, Table 3

tabulates results for low ( = 3) and high ( = 8) relative risk aversion levels, assuming the

worker has a medium labor income volatility (so she is exposed to risk other than through the

capital market). As before, Panel A presents patterns of liquid saving and saving rates, as well

as allocations to equities, bonds, and annuities for the high social security replacement rate;

Panel B provides results for the lower value.

Table 3 here

       Here, as risk aversion rises (moving horizontally across the table), liquid assets and

expected saving rates again rise (rows 1, 2, 6, and 7), irrespective of the social security

replacement rate; that is, higher risk aversion enhances the appeal of saving. Moving down

the table, when social security benefits are reduced at a given level of labor uncertainty,

higher saving rates and liquid assets are observed at younger, but not at older, ages. Also, as

we move to the right in the table, as risk aversion rises, it is evident and unsurprising that the

fraction in equities falls in favor of bonds and annuities. Going down a column, when the

replacement rate drops, again the equity fraction falls – though it is interesting that at age 85,

the least risk averse consumer still holds 15 percent of her portfolio in equities. In all three

cases, bonds dominate at younger ages, while annuities crowd out bonds at older ages.



Conclusions
                                                                                                11



       Retirement risk management is likely to become increasingly important with global

demographic aging, a phenomenon already requiring social security benefit cuts in some

developed nations such as Japan. This paper illustrates how increasing labor income risk and

reductions in social security replacement rates could influence saving, life-cycle portfolio

asset demand, and purchases of payout annuities. Our model shows that higher labor income

risk and lower social security replacement rates boost saving rates early in life and liquid

assets accumulated for precautionary purposes. A more uncertain and less generous

environment also induces greater demand for protection in the form of stable income – early

in life and in retirement. The enhanced need for safety is met not only with bonds, but also

with payout annuities whereas the demand for equities falls. Also, individuals who are more

risk averse save more early in life, and hold fewer equities.

       Our analysis offers several useful implications. For instance, financial advisers might

seek to consider possible future social security benefit cuts as they design optimal lifetime

asset accumulation paths and portfolio allocations for younger clients. Also, the financial

services industry and pension sponsors would benefit by taking careful account of labor

income risk when formulating recommendations for client portfolios. Thus in the context of

our model, low and middle income risk workers will favor an equity glide path which declines

with age, but for those facing high income risk, equity exposure would optimally be low early

in life and rise until retirement. Moreover, for those with uncertain labor income, it would be

desirable to purchase immediate payout annuities early in life so as to build up a second more

stable stream of income. Our work underscores the need for workers to have a way to create

their own defined benefit plan equivalents with privately purchased payout annuities.

Source: Authors’ calculations. Notes: The Figure embodies a retirement age of 65;
replacement rate of 68%; annuity loading of 7.2%; moderate risk aversion (ρ = 5); volatility
of transitory income shock = 7.5%; volatility of permanent income shock = 5%; and
correlation of permanent labor income shock with equity returns= 0 (see text). Labor income,
consumption, liquid assets, annuity purchases, and annuity payouts, are expressed as a
multiple of first-year labor income.

Source: Authors’ calculations. Notes: Model assumes a retirement age of 65; annuity loading of 7.2%; moderate risk aversion (γ = 5). For the case
of low labor income risk, the volatility of transitory income shock is 7.5%; of the permanent income shock is 5% and the correlation of the
permanent shock with equity returns is 0. For the medium labor income risk case, the volatility of transitory income shock is 15%, of the permanent
income shock is 10%; the correlation of the permanent shock with equity returns is 0. For the high labor income risk case, the volatility of transitory
income shock is 30%, of the permanent income shock is 20%; the correlation of the permanent shock with equity returns is 0.25. Investment
weights are computed as a fraction of total wealth (liquid assets + present value of annuity claims); liquid assets are computed as a multiple of initial
labor income; saving rates are the percent of labor plus annuity income saved.
