The Income and Tax Share of Very High Income Households, 1960-1995
Daniel R. Feenberg and James M. Poterba
NBER Working Paper No. 7525
February 2000
JEL No. H2, D31
                                         ABSTRACT

        This paper presents new information on the fraction of adjusted gross income, and of wages and
salaries, that is reported by taxpayers in the top one half of one percent of the income distribution. This
corresponds to roughly five hundred thousand households in the late 1990s. This paper relies on data from
the Treasury’s Individual Income Tax Model for the period 1960-1995. The definition of adjusted gross
income is standardized, so that changes in the tax law do not affect the measured concentration of AGI.
The results suggest that the share of AGI reported by the highest income households increased significantly
between the early 1980s and the mid-1990s, withmost of the increase taking place in the years immediately
following the Tax Reform Act of 1986. While we find some evidence of transitory changes in the
concentration of income around major tax changes, which may be the result of income retiming by high
income taxpayers, re-timing does not seem to explain most of the changes since 1986.
