                                            ABSTRACT

       This paper investigates the design of an exchange rate policy for an economy where the
domestic capital market is segmented from the global financial market, producers rely on credit to
finance working capital needs, and the labor market is characterized by nominal contracts. We show
that the choice of an exchange rate regime is intertwined with the financial structure -- greater
reliance on working capital to finance input needs, and greater segmentation of the domestic capital
market increase the desirable exchange rate stability. This result follows from the observation that
greater exchange rate stability is likely to reduce the real interest rate facing the producer, thereby
increasing output. Hence, greater reliance on working capital increases the welfare gain attached to
the lower interest rate associated with lower flexibility of the exchange rate, thereby increasing the
desirability of a fixed exchange rate. Similarly, greater integration with the global capital market
reduces the real interest rate benefits from exchange rate stability, increasing thereby the optimal
flexibility of the exchange rate, and reducing the demand for international reserves.

       The diverse experience with various exchange rate regimes renewed the
policy debate regarding the costs and benefits of exchange rate flexibility. 1
Advances in modeling nominal rigidities in an open economy have renewed the
research interest in these topics.2 While the new models provide a fresh
perspective, there remains a gap between salient features of emerging market
economies and exchange rate determination models. For example, most emerging
markets are characterized by a shallow capital market, where producers do not
have access to a well functioning capital market. These producers rely solely on
credit to finance their working capital needs. This credit is frequently financed by
the domestic capital market, which is segmented from the international market due
to country specific risks, like exchange rate uncertainty, discretionary policy bias,
etc.
       The purpose of this paper is to analyze the costs and the benefits of a
greater exchange rate flexibility for an emerging market economy. Specifically, we
consider an economy characterized by a discretionary policy bias [as in Barro and
Gordon (1983)], where risk averse consumers have access to a limited menu of
assets (domestic and foreign bonds), the domestic capital market is segmented
from the global financial market, and where producers rely on credit to finance
working capital needs. We follow the tradition of the optimal exchange rate
flexibility literature, characterizing the index of exchange rate intervention, where
fixed exchange rate and pure float regimes are special cases of the intervention
index. We prefer this methodology as most countries manage actively their

Mexico's return to a flexible exchange rate. See Frankel (1999) and Eichengreen
and Hausmann (1999) for recent overviews of exchange rate regimes.

exchange rate, and rarely do we observe a pure float or a sustainable, unmanaged
fixed exchange rate regime.
       In section 1 we characterize the benchmark model, where labor is employed
subject to nominal contracts that pre-set wages. The policy maker determines the
"optimal" degree of exchange rate flexibility in order to minimize the losses
stemming from sub-optimal employment, production and inflation, in the presence
of a discretionary bias. Next, we identify the implications of the choice of
exchange rate regime on the asset market equilibrium. We show that exchange
rate stability is more desirable the greater the loss associated with inflation, the
greater the volatility of nominal shocks relative to the real shocks, and the higher
the discretionary policy bias. We also show that the optimal flexibility of the
exchange rate is not minimizing the real interest rate - reducing exchange rate
flexibility is likely to reduce the real interest rate.
       In section 2 we extend the benchmark model, assuming the presence of a
quasi fixed input (like materials, or some type of capital or specialized labor). This
input should be purchased and paid for ahead of the actual employment and
production decisions. We assume the lack of equity financing, hence the producer
relies on credit to finance this input. In such an economy, the choice of an
exchange rate regime is intertwined with the financial structure. Specifically,
greater reliance on working capital to finance critical inputs reduces the optimal
degree of exchange rate flexibility (i.e., increases the desirable exchange rate
stability). This result follows from the observation that greater exchange rate
stability is likely to reduce the real interest rate facing the producer, increasing
output. Hence, greater reliance on working capital increases the welfare gain
attached to the lower interest rate associated with the lower flexibility of the
                                            -3-



exchange rate, thereby increasing the attractiveness of a fixed exchange rate
regime.
      In section 3 we show that with a greater integration of capital markets, the
gains from lower exchange rate flexibility are smaller, hence the equilibrium degree
of exchange rate flexibility is higher, leading to a smaller use of reserves, and to a
greater flexibility of the exchange rate. These results provide an interpretation to
the findings reported by Hausmann, Panizza and Stein (1999).3


1.    The benchmark model
      To simplify, we focus on a two period example, where the second period
output is determined by the expectation-augmented Phillips curve [as in Gray
(1976) and Fischer (1977)], and where there is incomplete information about the
second period real and nominal shocks [as in Aizenman and Frenkel (1985)].4


1.1   Output and employment
      Assume a Cobb-Douglas production function,


      (1)     logY2 =   log L2 +   2   ;   0<   <1 .



where Y2 ; L2 are the second period output and labor, respectively, and    2   is the real
productivity shock, assumed to be normally distributed with mean zero. Producers

3     They found that greater ability to borrow internationally in own currency is
associated with a decrease in international reserves, and with higher degree of
exchange rate flexibility.
4     For overview of these models see Turnovsky (1995, Chapter 8), and the
references there.

maximize expected profits, in an economy where the second period employment is
determined by nominal contracts that pre set the wage at the end of the first
period, at a level that is expected to clear the labor market. In these circumstances
the reduced forms of the second period log output and employment are:

               logY2 ≅ log( Y2,0 ) +   [ p2 + E2 ( )] +     2   ;
       (2)     log L2 ≅ log L2,0 + [ p2 + E2 ( )] ;                 ;
                                1
               where       =      ,    p2 = log P2 − E1 log P2
                               1−


where Y2,0 is the output if all second period shocks are zero, P2 is the second
period price level, E1 log P2 is the expected level of the second period log price level
conditional on the information at the first period, and E2 ( ) is the expected second
period productivity shock conditional on the second period information. Hence,

               y2 ≅    [ p2 + E2 ( )] +   2   ;
       (2')                                       .
               l2 ≅ [ p2 + E2 ( )]



where y2 = log(Y2 ) − log(Y2,0 ) , and l2 = log(L2 ) − log( L2,0 ) . We assume a small, open
economy, where PPP holds, and the foreign price level is normalized to 1, and
thus the exchange rate determines the price level -- P = S , where S corresponds
to the nominal exchange rate.


1.2    The money market
       The money market equilibrium is given by5


5      The assumption that the velocity is not affected by the interest rate can be
modified without impacting on the key results.

        (3)       2   + m2 = log Y2 + log P2 ;       m2 = m2,0 −   s2 ;            s2 = log(S 2 ) − E1 log(S 2 ) ,



where    2    is the liquidity shock, and m2 is the part of the supply of money subject
to the central bank's control. We assume that both                            2   and   2   are normally
distributed, uncorrelated, with mean zero. For simplicity of exposition, we
suppress henceforth the time index of these variables.
        We follow the information assumptions of Aizenman and Frenkel (1985) -
the exchange rate, the exchange rate intervention policy and the price level are
public information. The central bank follows a managed float regime, where m2 is
public information. The values of                    and m2,0 are pre-set by the policy maker at the
end of period 1. A pure floating exchange rate corresponds to                                    = 0. A fixed
exchange rate regime is approached when                       →∞ .

        These assumptions imply that the exchange rate reveals the value of                                          − .6

        E2 ( ) = ( − ) ;            =            .

1.3     Optimal exchange rate policies
        The policy maker is determining the monetary policy in order to minimize
the expected value of a Barro-Gordon loss function

                                                           )
        (4)      H = E1   (                                               )
                              [log P2 − log P1 ]2 + [k log L2 − log L2 ]2 ; k ≥ 1;              ≥ 0.


6       The money market equilibrium implies that − s2 = y2 + s2 . Applying PPP
                                                                                            −   −       E2 ( )
and (2') to the money market equilibrium we infer that s2 =                                                      . Hence,
                                                                                                    +
the exchange rate is a linear function of − , revealing the value of                                      − .

and the value of k -1 reflects the gap between the desirable and the 'natural rate' of
employment. Applying the above, it follows that the value of the loss function is


(4')     H = E1    (                                                                                   )
                       [log P2 − log P1 ]2 + [(k − 1)log L2,0 − (1− k ) ( − ) − (log P2 − E1 log P2 )]2 .



The monetary authority set at the end of period 1 the monetary policy for period 2
-- it determines m2,0 and             at a level that minimizes (4'). This is equivalent to
                                                                  MIN[H ]
finding the second period price level that solves                         , for the case where the
                                                                  log P2

maker in the second period. The solution is8


7        The value of          is        , where        is the labor supply elasticity, and
                                    +

    = 1/ (1− ) is the elasticity of demand for labor [see Aizenman and Frenkel

(1985) for further details].
8        The F.O.C. of the central bank problem is
    [logP2 − log P1 ] − [(k −1)log L2,0 − (1− k ) ( − ) − (log P2 − E1 log P2 ) = 0 .

The private sector anticipates the central bank's optimal behavior, setting E1 log P2
by taking the expected value of the above F.O.C., conditional on the information at
the end of period 1 --
E1[ [log P2 − log P1] − [(k −1)log L2,0 − (1− k ) ( − ) − (log P2 − E1 log P2 )] = 0 ,
                                           −1
implying that E1 log P2 ≅ log P1 +              [k − 1] log L2,0 . Equation (6) is obtained by

substituting this result for E1 log P2 in the original F.O.C..

       (6)     log P2 ≅ log P1 +          [k − 1] log L2,0 − Θ     ( − ); where Θ =          [1− k ],
                                                                                      + ( )2



hence the unanticipated depreciation rate in time 2 ( s2 , s2 = log(S 2 ) − E1 log(S 2 ) ), and
the expected inflation from period 1 to period 2 (denoted by s = E1 log S2 − log S1 ) are

               s2 = −Θ ( − );

Equation (6') implies the presence of an inflationary bias, proportional to                      .

Applying (2') and (3) we infer that, given the exchange rate policy, the
unanticipated depreciation rate in period 2 is

                          −    −       E2 ( )       1+

       Comparing (6') and (6"), we find that setting the price at the optimal level is
equivalent to setting the "optimal exchange rate policy," * , at

discretionary bias and the elasticity of supply of labor are not very large.9 The

assume that this bias is not too large to prevent the unrealistic result of 'leaning
with the wind.' This assumption is plausible for reasonable parameter values (e.g.,

optimal index of exchange rate management can be solved directly, by minimizing
the loss function H with respect to . 10 Inspection of (7) leads to the following
claim


Claim 1
Exchange rate stability is more desirable the greater the loss associated with
inflation ( ), the greater the volatility of nominal shocks relative to the real shocks
( V / V ), and the higher the discretionary policy bias [as measured by the
perceived gain from output manipulations, k].


1.4     Portfolio choice
        The consumer allocates his wealth between 2 assets - domestic and foreign
nominal bonds, with nominal interest rate of it ,it* , respectively. We denote the
share of domestic assets at time t by               t   . Preferences are characterized by an
intertemporal version of the mean-variance framework, where the utility of the
consumer is

if the elasticity of the supply of labor is 1, and the labor share of the GDP is 2/3,
k <1/           is equivalent to k < 4 ).

We denote domestic borrowing by B , and the ex-ante domestic real interest rate
by r . Due to risk considerations, domestic borrowing is done only in domestic
currency.11 Note that r = i − s ; and B = B(r); B' < 0 . The equilibrium domestic real
interest rate is determined according to



11    This would be the case if the foreign currency bonds component of the
domestic saving is held overseas, and is not available for domestic intermediation.
Fear of future taxes and the possibility of financial instability frequently
encourages domestic savers to hold their savings overseas, as is assumed in this
paper. We also assume that producers can borrow only in domestic currency, as
will be the case if foreign agents find it too risky to lend directly to domestic
producers.

Hence, the domestic real interest rate increases with volatility ( V ), and with

domestic borrowing needs.


Claim 2
The optimal flexibility of the exchange rate, * , is not minimizing the real interest
rate. Reducing exchange rate flexibility (i.e., increasing                       above   * ) is likely to
                                 dr

Discussion
      Equation (11') implies that the risk premium r − i* is determined by 2
factors -- the direct destabilizing effect of exchange rate volatility [= domestic
borrowing times the volatility of the exchange rate], and the indirect effect due to
co movements of output and the real value of domestic saving [= minus the
expected future real output times the covariance between the real output and the
exchange rate]. Starting with a fixed exchange rate as a benchmark, both effects
operate in the same direction -- greater exchange rate flexibility would increase the
real interest rate. First, the greater volatility of the exchange rate would increase
the direct risk premium due to the volatility of the exchange rate. Second, the
flexibility of the exchange rate will magnify the negative co variation between
                                           - 13 -



output and the exchange rate, requiring a greater risk premium.12 This adjustment
is needed to compensate for the destabilizing effect of exchange rate depreciation
on income -- the depreciation of the domestic currency in bad times magnifies the
drop in income due to capital losses proportional to the domestic saving [for
further discussion of this effect see Hausmann, Gavin, Pages-Serra and Stein
(1999)].
          Consequently, higher risk premium induced by greater exchange rate
flexibility will increase the cost of funds, potentially impacting adversely future
output. Claim 2 suggests that the loss function applied in Section 1 overlooks the
welfare effects associated with modifying the real interest rate, as it focuses on an
economy where the expected real output is not impacted by the real interest rate.
We turn now to an extended model, where these financial linkages are taken into
account.


2.        Exchange rate flexibility and capital market imperfections
          We extend the above model to allow for capital market imperfections, in the
form of using credit to finance working capital needs. Consider the case where
there is a "quasi fixed" input, like materials or capital goods, denoted by Zt . This




12        Recall that a fixed exchange rate corresponds to        →∞ . Equation (19)

implies that the co variation between the exchange rate and the real output is
                                         V
negative for managed float as long as [ −1]< [implying that it is negative for
                                             V

all 0 ≤     as long as the volatility of nominal shocks exceeds that of the real
shocks]. Greater exchange rate flexibility would reduce cov(s2 , y2 ) for a wide range
                                     d cov(s2 , y2 )                          V
of managed float [applying (19),                     > 0 as long as   > 0.5     +   −1 ].
                                         d                                    V

input should be purchased and 'installed' before employment and production take
place. The modified production function is


       (1')    logY2 =   log L2 + log Z2 + ;       + <1


the "quasi fixed" input Z2 is purchased at time 1, at price PZ ,1 , prior to the actual
employment decision that will take place in period 2. Assume that the producer
finances the purchase of Z2 using bank credit. In these circumstances, the real
cost of input Z2 is PZ ,1 (1+ r) . It can be verified that the elasticity of the supply of
the final product with respect to the real interest rate is −            ,
                                                                   1−

                                dr      1− 1 + r



Equation (21) implies that policies that reduce the real interest rate would increase
the expected output, at a rate proportional to the use of credit to finance working
capital ( in our specification). Hence, this financial linkage would be of greater
importance to emerging market economies, where producers lack access to a well
functioning equity market. Instead, they rely on bank credit to finance working
capital and for capital investment needs. In these circumstances, the choice of an
exchange rate regime would impact on both the first and the second moment of
output. Hence, we modify our loss function (4) to reflect these considerations,13


13     The loss function in (4') corresponds to the case where the policy maker
sets the monetary policy in order to maximize the expected GDP, adjusted
downwards by the cost of inflation and the cost of employment deviations from
the desirable level -- E( logY2) − E( [ p2 − p1]2 + [log L2 − k log L˜2 ]2 ) . Note that if the

Claim 3
Greater capital needs lead to a greater desirability of a fixed exchange rate.
Proof
The optimal flexibility of the exchange rate is the solution to

                   dH˜ dH dE (logY2 ) dH dE (log Y2 ) d r dH                                Y2,0 (r) d r

Recall that the optimal exchange rate flexibility in section 2, * , was the solution
   dH
to    = 0 . Hence, at = * ,
   d


                            dH˜                Y2,0 (r ) d r

                            d | = * 1−          1+r d | = *



where the sign of (23) follows from Claim 2. Thus, at                         =    * , lower exchange

rate flexibility would increase welfare due to the favorable interest rate effect. Let




expected output is independent of the real interest rate (as was assumed in Section
1), this loss function is equivalent to the one used in Section 1. See Aizenman and
Frenkel (1985) and Aizenman (1994) for further discussion about the use of such
a loss function to approximate the expected utility.

needs by ˜ * . Consequently, ˜ * > * , and

                                                       .
Discussion
       In economies where producers rely on credit to finance working capital
needs, there are gains from a lower exchange rate flexibility (higher ). These
gains are proportional to the importance of the working capital needs. Hence, the
gains from a fixed exchange rate may be higher for emerging market economies
than for the OECD countries. This would be the case if developing countries are
characterized by greater capital market imperfections, higher relative importance
of monetary shocks, and greater discretionary bias.


3.     Exchange rate flexibility and capital market integration
       One of the findings reported in Hausmann, Panizza and Stein (1999) is that
a greater ability to borrow internationally in own currency is associated with a
decrease in international reserves, and with higher degree of exchange rate
flexibility. Our framework provides the rationale for this result. Applying a
stochastic version of the Baumol-Tobin approach, past literature pointed out that
the demand for international reserves depends positively on the standard deviation
of international reserves. Recalling (3), the standard deviation of international
reserves is proportional to

                 d˜*      ∂ 2 H˜ / ∂ ∂ ˜ *
14   Note that        =− 2 ˜                . Applying the second order condition for

Hence, circumstances that would increase the index of the fixity of exchange rate
( ) would increase both the variance of reserves, and the demand for reserves.
We assumed that the domestic capital market is segmented from the international
capital market -- foreigners are not willing to supply or demand credit
denominated in domestic currency. This is reflected in (17), where the only
supply of saving are domestic residences. One may modify (17) to account for
the more general case, where the international capital market is willing to provide
loans in the currency of the emerging market. This would corresponds to the
cases where


      (26)    B = A + S*        where S* = S0* (r − c * −i*) ;     > 0 and r − c * −i* > 0 .



The term S * is the supply of foreign saving facing the economy, c * measures the
disadvantage facing foreign savers in the domestic market, and                  is the foreign
saving elasticity with respect to the yield differential.15 In these circumstances,




15    The cost c * reflects the cost disadvantage due to distance, or any
regulations inhibiting foreign banks from domestic operations. To make the

greater integration with the global financial market would modify the foreign
saving in several ways -- higher        (more elastic supply of foreign saving), higher
S0* , or lower c * . All these modifications would reduce the equilibrium risk

premium associated with domestic credit. It can be verified that greater integration
with the global financial market would also diminish the impact of reducing
exchange rate flexibility on the real interest rate --

               d d        dS0 d      dc d



Therefor, with greater integration with the capital market, the gains from lower
exchange rate flexibility are smaller, hence the equilibrium degree of exchange rate
flexibility is higher, leading to smaller use of reserves.16


4.     Concluding remarks
       This paper illustrates that the optimal flexibility of exchange rate is affected
by the degree to which capital markets are integrated. This may be of special
concern for emerging market economies, where the capital market is not well
developed. To simplify, we focused on the case where all goods are traded. A
useful extension of the model would consider the effects of non-traded goods, and



problem meaningful, we assume that these costs are not prohibitive [ r − c * −i* > 0 ],
hence the potential supply of foreign saving is positive.

currency, at endogenously determined premiums. These extensions are left for
future research.
