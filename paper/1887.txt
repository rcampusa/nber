         Compensating Wage Differentials and the Duration of Wage Loss




                                    ABSTRACT


         Several reasons are offered why workers will receive larger

  compensating wage differentials for increases in the duration of wage losses

  than for increases in the probability of loss that produce the same expected

  loss. A formal model of occupational choice is developed that shows the

  extent to which the compensation for increased duration exceeds that for

  increased risk.

         Using Panel Study of Income Dynamics data linked to industry data on

  injuries and unemployment, we find:   1) Nearly all the compensating wage

  differential for losses due to workplace injuries is compensation for

  increases in the duration of loss; 2) Similarly, nearly all the compensation

  for losses due to cyclical unemployment is compensation for increases in

  duration, especially for increases in duration beyond the 26 weeks of

  unemployment that are usually compensated by unemployment insurance. The

  compensating differentials for risk of injury are larger for union than for

  nonunion workers, while those for cyclical unemployment are smaller for union

  workers.

I. Introduction


     A substantial and rapidly growing body of research has examined the

relationship between wage levels and the likelihood of wage loss. With its

roots in Adam Smith, (1937 Book 1, Chapter 18), this literature has studied

the effect of the risk of work—related fatal accidents (Thaler—Rosen, 1975;

Srr,ith, 1979); work—related nonfatal accidents <Viscusi, 1979; Olson, 1981);

and the risk of unemployment (Abowd—Ashen-felter, 1981; Topel, 1984; Li, 1986).

The entire genre of research examines how wages among otherwise identical

individuals differ as their expected wage losses vary.

     Though the literature clearly stems from Adam Smith, the 0hardy device0

in the Wealth of Nations has not, we believe, been fully exploited to generate

all the 0fruitful hypotheses0 in this area that it might. An>' expected wage

loss is made up of two components: The incidence of the loss——the probability

that the loss will occur; and the duration of loss conditional on its

occurrence. Two otherwise identical workers can face the same expected loss,

yet face sharply differing incidence and duration of loss. For several

reasons we should not expect these two workers to receive identical

compensating differentials for' the same expected loss. A worker's preferences

wifl not be symmetric in frequency and duration, unless the worker is risk

neutral: A doubling of duration will provide greater disutility to a

risk—averse worker than will a doubling of -frequency, because such a change
i1l broaden the distribution of possible Wage losses.                     nso-far as borrowing

to 4 narce   consurupt or is   di If i CUI t     and     the worker   s   ill qu   d, this

difference   wifl be especially pronounced. Similarly, as Hurd                     (1980) and

Layard <1982: argue, upward—sloping labor supply curies guarantee that the

expected utility loss arising from enforced leisure of a given expected length

is greater if the loss    is a    long—duration, low—probability event than if it is

a brief, high—probability occurrence.

     The strongest indication in the empirical literature on waQe losses that

duration plays an especially important role is the evidence that compensation

for risk of death is much greater than that for finite losses (Smith, 1979).

Such a strong aversion to the risk of death is the limiting case of the

phenomenon that we propose: An aversion to the risk of large losses, holding

the expected loss constant.1

     In this study we develop a model that derives the effects cf variations

in the incidence and duration of wage loss on workers expected lifetime

utilities. The relationships implxalocusolequilibriumcombinationsof

wages and expected wage losses that depends on the duration of loss

conditional upon a loss occurrirg. The model is then compared to the standard

model that ignores the distinction between incidence and duration and also to

less structured estimating equations. Data from the Panel Study of Income

Dynamics are used along with published data by industry on the incidence and

duration Of various types of loss. Our purpose is not to suggest that one

particular mechanism produces unequal wage responses to incidence and duration

of loss; rather, it is to suggest one such model, then to examine whether in

fact the responses are unequal


II. The importance of   Duration
    The expected duration of wage loss from an event of given severity is the



                                               —j;,.-.
product of the duration of wage loss and the frequency c-f the event. Let jobs

vary according to the risk of wage loss, pararneterized as follows: Let the

per—period probability of a loss occurring be P, and the duration of the wage

loss be V periods. Assume also that the wage w is a differentiable -function c-f

fr and )',   and that wages ar-c replaced in proportion (1—a) by social insurance

during periods o-f wage loss. Let the worker's career be c-f fixed length T.

Given V -for a job choice, we can redefine the career to consist of T/Y periods

of length V; during each such period the probability o-f wage loss is PY. For

each period t, define a random variable L(t) such that:

                        0 if no wage loss occurs
(1)          L(t) =
                        1 otherwise

L(t) is binornially distributed, with mean PV and variance PV(1—Pfl.

      Suppose that workers are risk averse with respect to lifetime

consumption. In particular, assume the following utility function:
                                      T    —                _1-
(2)           U(c1, c2,...., CT
                                  )   =
                                          i= t1
                                          1          c(t)

                                                    L1—P]1
where P is the rate of time preference and           is. the degree of relative risk

aversion. We avoid the unnecessary complications o-f borrowing and lending by

assuming a constant marginal rate c-f substitution across periods and a rate c-f

time preference that is equal to the interest rate. A simple consumption plan

in which each period's consumption equals current income then maximizes

utility, since the worker is indifferent between all consumption plans that

exhaust lifetime income. We are thus free to -focus on workers' choices with

respect to the distribution c-f possible discounted lifetime incomes.

      Given these assumptions, each period's consumption is:




                                              —3—
(3)            c(t)      = y[z[1—L(t)] + [1—a.]wL(t)]
                         =

The distribution of c(t) is              therefore:

(4)            c(t)          B(yw[1—ay], i2w2c2i[1—])

The worker's problem is then to maximize expected lifetime utility by choosing

job characteristics P and I' which in turn determine the wage and the

probabil ity       of   wage loss.

       If we assume the L<t) are independently and identically distributed then

      mean and variance of 1 ifetini                  rnption are easily determined. For

convenience, define the asymptotically normal variable:



(5)                              c(t)
                                            n(
                                                   iw[1y1
                         t1 (1p)                 t=1 El+p]      t=i         [1÷J2t

For P small and Tn' large, the mean and variance can be approximated by:


(6)            C        (W[1$Y}         1w2a28i[1—iJ)
                             p



Note that mean lifetime consumption is symmetric in P and ),                  but that the
variance of C is not: Potential losses of longer duration make lifetime income

and consumption more uncertain, even if frequency is lowered by an equal

propor t ion.


      Each worker chooses among Job characteristics . and              )'    in order to

Note that substitution for                          in the final term renders expected utility

asymmetric in P and Y. aximizing E(U) with respect to P and V is equivalent

to maximizing:



(11)         ln(1—6)E(IJ) = [1—61                   [mw + 1n[1—c']        —   inpI

14 we assume PY to be small, ignore second— and higher—order terms in P), and

approximate ln(1+x] by x for small values of x, we can write (11) as:


(12)        ln(1—6)E(U) =              [1—6][1nw—i—1np] — .. 6[1—6Jpa2fy2

The first—order conditions for maximization with respect to P and r are:
(13)              =   -' +
and:

            1nw   =      +
(14)
                              2



 Equations (13) and (14) describe the point chosen by the worker from the

available frontier w(P,r)     of   job opportunities.2 The following function, which

satisfies both (13) and (14), therefore describes the wage frontier in the

neighborhood of any chosen job:



(15)        mw = mw ÷         +


where w is the worker's wage III an occupation in which =V=O.3 Wages should

be a log—linear function of Y, the expected fraction of earnings lost and

not replaced, and of a risk—aversion term in which duration plays a more

important role than does incidence.

       A simplified graphical exposition can illustrate the main points of our

argument. Following Abowd—Ashenifelter' (1981), let V(W) be the indirect

util it>' of wage W per period. Arbitrarily assume that P=1 and )=). Then     i-f


the full—time per—period wage is 14*, the per—period indirect utility is

V(W*(1—3),    point   B in Figure 1. Assume there is another industry such that

       and fr=1/2, so that the expected wage loss remains constant across the two

industries at ?w*. Then the indirect util ity in the second case is at point

in Figure 1. To attract workers to this second industry a wage sufficiently

higher than 14* must be paid. The required wage is W**>W*, such that the

expected indirect utility, the average of the indirect utilities obtained when

no loss is incurred and when the loss is of duration 2), is equal to that

       Attempts    to estimate the ccirriperssatirig           differential   due to possible wage

loss typically are of the same form as (15), less the final term. By forcing

nciderice arid duration to have symmetric effects, this specification subjects

the perceived costs of wage loss to measurement error, and results in a

tendency to underestimate the effect of these perceived costs on wages.


III. An Application to Occupational Injuries

       In this sect icr, we apply the model to data on the incidence and duration

of workplace injuries. One study——Dorsey (1983)——did include measures of both

the frequency and severity of injury in equations "explaining" wage

differentials, but gave no reason for doing so and paid no attention to their

separate effects. This particular application is thus the first test of the

notion that risk and duration of loss will produce unequal compensating wage

differentials for workplace injuries.

       Equation (15) must be modified for estimation. An empirical version of

the model in <15) is:

(16)        mW =
                    ct1LW
                            +     LW
                                       •
                                           DUR   +   X   + c

where DUR is the duration of loss; LW=DUR•INC is the expected loss, the

product of incidence and duration; X is a vector o-f other variables, and E is

a disturbance term. The difficulty with this estimating equation is that it

specifies the separate effects of duration and incidence quite restrictively.

Accordingly, we also estimate:

(17)        mW =                                          X    +
                    a1'     [1nDUR +
                                       u2'lnINCj +                 c


       Equations   (16) and (17) are estimated by ordinary least squares. The
data on which the estimation is based describe heads of households in the

Panel Study of Income Dynamics who were between the ages of 22 and 65 in 1981.




                                                     —7-
This set of data provides no information on workers' assessments of risks on

the job. Instead, we link the PSID data to published injury data, with the

link based or; industry affiliation in 1981, since that is the only year for

which detailed industry data are provided.4 The equations are estimated

separately for 1980 and 1981.

     The three—digit code identifying the industry to which the worker's

employer belonged was used to link the record for the worker to Bureau of

Labor Statistics data on workplace injuries.5 While the correspondence between

the two codes was not perfect, departures from a perfect match disqualified

relatively few observations. This problem and the lack of complete

information on all the variables required for the vector X resulted in a

sample of 1689 household heads for 1981, and 1497 for 1980. Insofar as workers

report their industry affil iation incorrectly, estimates of the compensating

differentials will be biased toward zero, with a bias that Mellow—Sider (1983)

show can be fairly large.6

     The means of the BLS injury data in this sample of individuals are shown

in Table 1. The figures on incidence and expected days lost (LW) are per 100

worker—years. The incidence data imply that roughly five percent of the

workforce experiences at least one da>' of    lost   worktime each year due to

injury on the job. The duration figures can be interpreted as days lost per

nonfatal injury that results in any loss of worktime of one day or more. s

the data make clear, most of the variation in expected days lost across

industries results from   differences   in the incidence of injury: Incidence and

duration have similar variances, even though duration has a much higher mean.

Nonetheless, there is substantial variation in the duration of injuries among

industries,   and thus substantial room for that variation to allow us to test

the hypotheses we have discussed.7 Incidence and duration are also far from

rate on the worker's main job. For salaried workers the PSID bases this

measure on the worker's salary divided by some standard working hours. The

vector X in (16) and (17) is specified to include a number of measures that

have become quite standard in the literature. Thus linear and quadratic terms

in total full—time experience since age 18, and in years of tenure with the

employer, are included in the equation1 as are years of schooling completed.

Demographic variables——race, sex, and marital status——are also included, as

are indicators of the worker's union rneffibership, region (South) arid city

size. Also included are weeks worked and hours worked per week in the

previous year (1979 or 1980), measures designed to control for the different

average rates of pay produced by overtime premia, lower wage rates for

part—time workers, etc. Finally, in some of the estimate; dummy variables for

five major industries——durable manufacturing, nondurable manjfacturing,

agriculture and mining, transportation, communications and public utilities,

and wholesale and retail trade——are also included.8

     Table 2 presents the parameter estimates for the sample observed in 1980,

and Table 3 shows the estimates for 1981. In each table the results are

presented without and with the inclusion of the vector of one—digit industry

dummy variables. The results of estimating (16) with c2O, and <17) with

c=1, are quite consistent with those produced by a number of earlier

studies. Since some control for industry differences not attributable to

differences in injury rates is probably desirable, most of the remaining

discussion refers to parameters estimated in the presence of the industry

dummy variables. Even when industry is controlled, though, there is a

noticeable positive effect   of   increased expected lost workdays on va     rates.

     The estimates o-f (16) in which        is   fr-ce to vary do not Qive very

satistactory results. The increase in the R2 is very small         and neither

coefficient is significant at conventional levels when       the industry dummy
variables are included. Apparently the collinearity between LW and LW•DUR is

causinQ problems.9 When the less restricted equation (17) is estimated we see

striking evidence that duration and incidence of injuries do not produce the

same compensatinQ waqe differentials. The effect of increased duration, c,

is highly significant and positive in both years; that of increased

incidence,       is positive one year, negative the other, and insignificant

in both.10 Reestimates of    (16) and (17' on samples of blue— and white—collar

workers separately yield slightly weaker results; but the same qualitative

result, a significantly greater impact of duration than of incidence on wages,

exists in each of these subsamples too.

     One might argue tb The conpJ;g differential will be affected by

the extent to which workers are insured against the wage loss by socia1

legislation. Thus while many studies ignore this issue, sorne---Arnould—Nichols

(1983), Butler—Worrall (1983) and Ruser (1985)——include replacement rates

under workers' compensation benefits in equations like those presented in

Tables 2 and 3. Accordingly, the equations were reestimated with various

replacement rates included.11 Adding these measures had no significant effect

on the other parameter estimates. Also, the replacement rates usually did

have the expected negative coefficients, but these were never significantly

negative.12 Our focus on injuries may explain the departure of these results

from those of Arnould—Nichots (1983) on workplace fatal ities. Workers'

compensation is not an entitlement proqram; it has lor,q waiting periods, and

its receipt is uncertain in the case of most injuries)3 Thus it perhaps




                                          10 —
should not be surprising that it does not affect the size of cornpensatng
differentials for workplace injuries.

       There is some evidence <Duncan—Stafford, 1980) o-f a link between

compensating wage differentials for        workplace hazards and the union relative
wage effect. That study indicates that part of the union wage advantage

represents compensation -for exposure tc' risks in the workplace. To examine

whether the obverse is true, as Viscusi (1979) indi.cates, and, in particular,

whether unions have different impacts on the compensating differentials for

 incidence and duration of risk, we respecify (17). One respecificatiori, which

constrains the effects of duration and incidence to be equal, replaces the

terms in 1nDUR and lnINC in (17) with:

(18)       a3 1nLW +          UN    1nLW
                       a3

where t.i=1 if the worker is a union member. 14The second especi4ication

allows duration and incidence to have different effects on wages in union and

nonunion employment by respecifyinq (18) as:

(19)       cc4 1nDUR +   a,    UN    1nDUR +
                                               cc5

       The results of estimating equations based on the specifications in (18:>

and (19) are shown in Table 4 -for both 1980 and 1981. The estimates of (18)

indicate that, in our linked micro——industry data as in Viscusi's (1979)

estimates based on self—reported risks, unionized workers receive an extra

compensating differential -for risks on the job. This can be interpreted as

showing that the informational effects of unions produce increased

compensation for what would not be as clearly perceived by workers negotiating

individually. The estimates of (19) demonstrate that this compensation is

almost entirely for increases in the incidence of the loss: The interaction

term between union status and duration is very small, while that between union

status and !ncldence is lar-g€. and signficant.           Our- findings   suggest that
changes in the incidence of losses are not well perceived by worker-s, while
changes in their duration are; if this is so, then the            different impacts      of

unionism on these compensating wage differentials are consistent with the view

of unions as organizations that increase workers' awareness of, and rewards

for, poorly perceived, generally applicable risks in the workplace.

     Ms another way of examining the differential impacts of incidence and

duration of workplace injuries on wages, we calculate the wage—incidence and

wage—duration elasticities for both samples. These estimates, based on the

unconstrained versions of (16:) and (17) that include one—digit industry dummy

variables presented in Tables 2 and 3, are listed in Table 5. They show very

clearly that the positive effect of injury rates on wages is produced by the

duration of the injury. An increase          in the    risk of injury, holding duration

constant, produces only a very slight compensating wage differential. An

increase in duration, holding the risk of injury constant, produces a much

larger effect on wages. This is especially true if the elasticities are based

on (17), which allowed the effects to vary more freely and which produced the

higher        in both years.
     Dc'rsey's (1983) estimates using esabl ishment data show significant
impacts of both the incidence and duration of nonfatal injuries. However,

using his published means and estimated equation describing lnW, we calculate

from his     equation a duration elasticity of         .28, and an incidence elasticity of

.11. The similarity of these         elasticities to those based on equaticin (17)        is

remarkable given their totally different underlying sources of data and
econome tr   Ic spec if i cat ion.
     To examine the importance of the differential effects of incidence and

duration on wages, consider what would happen if the average duration of

nonfatal injuries dropped by two standard deviations! wiule the mean expected
time lost remained unchanged because of an offsetting increase in incidence.

Using estimates based on (17:) arid on data -from 1980, we calculate that the

average worker would pay 15 percent of the current average wage to obtain a

change in working conditions that would alter outcomes in this manner; using

the 1981 estimates, the wage—equivalent of the utility gain implicit in this

change is 14 percent. Clearly, there are potentially substantial gains in

welfare from reducing the duration of workplace injuries.


IV. An Application to Unemployment

     There are two distinct strands in the literature on compensating

differentials for the risk of unemployment. One (Hall, 1972; Topel, 1984),

examines how wages differ across high— and low—unemployment industr-ies and

regions at a point in time, and thus presumably measures the extent 0-f

compensating differentials for long—ter-m (structural) differences in

unemployment. The other (Abowd—shenfelter, 1981) examines tow wages differ

across industries and occupations with varying probabilities of cyclical

unemployment. Clearly, the two strands are distinct in terms o-f empirical

specification (though Li, 1986, provides an initial attempt to estimate both

in the same model). In terms of their relation to the underlying theory,

though, no such distinction exists. Both types of differential presumably

arise out of workers' awareness that there are occupational and industrial

differences in the risks of both types of unemployment. That being the case,

our theory suggests that we should observe compensating differentials for both

risks, and that in each case the differential should be greater, given

identical expected iOSSCS, for increases in the duration of loss than for

increases in its incidence.

    To examine the hypothesis in this context, we again use data from the




                                     —   13 —
Panel Study of Income Dynamics, in this case only from the 1981 iriterviewinc1

wave. The wage and background data are as in Section III; however, because we

did not require that wage data be available 4cr two consecutive years, and

because the link to unemployment data was possible for all industries, 2625

observations are available for this part of the study.

     The unemployment data are based on supplementary questions on work

experience appended to the March Current Population Survey. Because we wish to

examine compensating differences for both structural and cxci ical

unemployment, we use data for both 1979 (a cycl ical peak) and 1982 (a cxci ical

trough), data from the March 1980 and March 1983 CPS. For workers

intervetued in March of the subsequent year, data are provided on the fraction

experiencing some unemployment and on the distribution of weeks of

unemployment among those individuals. Workers' affiliations by two— or

three—digit industry are based on where they worked the longest during the

calendar year (not where they worked at the date of the interview).

     Because the duration data are categorical, it was necessary to aggregate

them using some assumptions about their distributions within the categories.16

We assumed that the hazard rate of leaving unemployment was constant within

each category, and that the fraction of workers remaining unemployed at the

er,d of an interval equalled the published fraction remaining unemployed. This

technique produced the data on duration and incidence for 1979 and 1982 and

for the peak—to—trough variation, all of which are presented in Table 6.

    There is much greater variation across industries in the incidence of

unemployment than in its duration. This is true in both a peak year, 1979,

and at a business—cycle trough, 1982. Moreover, even though the decomposition

of the cyclical increase in unemployment into cyclical changes in duration and

incidence shows that both increased roughly equally, the variance in the

A. Unemployment in 1979

      The re:':s cf es:atinig        variants    of   equatiors     (16) and (17) over the
1981 PSID data linked to the 1979 work—experience            data are presented        in the
first four rows of   Table 7. In this table           and in Table 8 only estimates based
on equations that include the vector of one—digit industry dummy variables are

presented. (The results do not differ qualitatively when this vector is

excluded.) The results are very disappointing. There is a negative and

significant relation between the wage rate and the unernplc'yrnent rate of

experienced workers in the industry (as shown in the constrained versions o-f

equations (16) and (17)). Indeed, as the unconstrained version of (17) shows,

it is differences in the duration of unemployment in 1979 that are most

strongly linked to (lower) wage rates; the effect of incidence                 is   smaller and

not significant.

      Two   explanations for these    unexpected results were explored. e saw in

Section III that interstate differences in worker's compensation benefits did

not affect compensating differentials paid to workers in different

industries. However, unemployment insurance is a more widespread transfer

than is workes compensation; and more important, it is. a transfer that will

be received with near—certainty should a particular loss occur. Thus, if

interindustry differences in duration arid incidence are correlated with the

wHi bias estimates of compensating differentials for the risk of

uriernployrnert. To examine this possibility we linked the state average

potential duration of regular UI benefits to the data on household heads from
the 1981 PSID.

     The result o-f adding the potential duration of reQular UI benefits in the

state in which the worker resides to (17:) are shown in the fifth row of Table

7. LJcurkers. in states that offer UI benefits with longer potential duration do

receive lower wages, with each extra week of potential duration reducing wages

by .6 percent. However, inclusion of the UI measure does not qualitatively

affect the estimated impacts of duration and incidence. By inference there is

little correlation across workers between interstate differences in the

generosity of UI and interindustry differences in unemployment duration and

inc i dence.


     The second explanation is that inter industry differences in the mean loss

are unimportant, and that workers require compensation only for the risk of a

long—duration loss (since only that loss will not be at least partly

compensated by UI benefits). This view is consistent both with the derivation

in Section II and with the notion that the value of leisure during the first

part of a spell of unemployment is quite high. To examine this possibility we

also added the percentage of experienced workers by industry who were

unemployed more than 26 weeks to the estimating equations.

     This addition produced some interesting changes in the results.          Looking
at the sixth row of Table 7, one sees that increases in the average duration

of unemployment produce the expected positive effect on wages, while greater

incidence still reduces wages (though only sl ightly). However, the largest

effect ts the very significant negative impact of increases in the percentage
of icing—term urernployed. The results thus still confound the predictions of

our'   simple   model.

       The estimates indicate clearly that longer—duration unemployment,

especially increases in the fraction o-f the unemployed in an industry in the

upper tail of the distribution of spells by length, is associated with lower

wage rates. One explanation for this apparent anomaly is that some

individuals move frequently between employment and nonparticipation, much of

the latter of which is recorded as unemployment1 because they have reservation

wages that are high relative to their market wages. Unless differences in

market wages are associated in the population with even larger differences in

reservation wages, these individuals will tend to be those with below—average

market wages. Thus an industry recording a large amount of long—duration

unemployment may also employ workers who command lower—than—average wages.

The spells of long—duration unemployment in such industries will not be

compensated by wages because they represent leisure that is valued. This view

is supported by inspection in the data we use: The industries having the

largest percentages of long—term unemployed among experienced workers attached

to the industry in 1979 were private household services, welfare and religious

services, and agriculture. The lowest percentages were in automobile

manufacturing, apparel manufacturing, and stone, clay and glass

manufacturing.

incidence and duration of unernplo:,ment that are remarkably like those that we

demonstrated jr Section II] exist for workplace injuries.. The estimates of

the unconstrained version of (17) indicate that the compensatinQ dLfferential

is paid only for differences in cyclical changes in duration; cxci ical changes

in incidence have no impact on wage differentials once changes in duration are
                 18
accounted for.        This conclusion is underscored by a comparison of the   in

the regressions in the third and four rows.19

     As in Section IV.A., we added a measure of the qenerosity of unemplc'yrnent

benefits, the potential duration of benefits, to the equations. Also, the

cyclical change in the percentage of long—term unemployed workers by industry

was added. Examining the fifth row in Table 8, we again find that workers

living in states with a longer average potential duration of UI benefits

receive lower wage rates. The results of including the cyclical change in the

percentage of long—term unemployed are striking. One notes from the last row

in the table that there is no independent impact either of the change in the

average duration or of the change in incidence. Rather, there is a very

significant positive effect of the change in long—term unemployment. The

positive compensating differential that exists for larger cyclical changes in

the duration of unemployment is entirely due to differentials that are paid in

industries where the risk of long—duration unemployment increases most during

recessions. Since it is precisely the cyclical increase in long—duration

unemployment that is not automatically compensated by unemployment insurance,

this result makes sense.

     Since we know unions affect cyclical changes in employment (see Medoff,

1979), it is worth examining how they affect the compensating differentials

that we have demonstrated exist for cyclical changes in unemployment

duration. The results of estimating (18) and (19), the versions of (17)




                                         - 18   -
respecif led   to   include interactions of union status with expected loss, and

with duration and incidence separately, are shown in Table 9. The most

striking result :s that the interaction term involving InDUR is highly

significant arid negative. Indeed, the estimates of (19) demonstrate that the

large positive effect of greater cyclical changes in unemployment duration on

wages arises solely in nonunion employment; among unionized workers the

effects are rieQativE' and insignificant. (A test of the Joint significance of

    and c yielded F(2, 2598) = 4.69, significant at the 99 percent level of

confidence.) The results of estimating 19 show that a failure to understand

that workers react more strongly to differences in duration than in incidence

would have prevented one from seeing how unions affect these compensating

differentials: If changes in duration and incidence are constrained to have

the same effect, the interaction term with union status is not significant.

     The lack of a compensating wage differential in unionized employment for

differences in the cyclicality of the duration of unemployment is consistent

with several models of union behavior. One standard analysis assumes that

unions seek to maximize the utility of the median member (voter). Assume also

that demand is not so highly variable over the cycle that the worker with the

median amount of seniority will be laid off during a recession. That being

the case, the existence of larger variations in the cyclicality of

unemployment will not affect union bargainers' wage policy, as the median

union member will be unconcerned about such variations.

     Table 10 presents estimate; of the elasticity of wage rates with respect

to interindustry differences in cyclical changes in the average duration and

incidence of unemployment. The elasticities are based on the estimates of the

unconstrained versions of equations (16) and (17) (excluding the measures of

potential duration of UI benefits and of long—term unemployment). The

presented in Table 5; they suggest a huge compensatin differential for

chanQes ir duration, with essentially rio corriperisaticir for cyclical changes in

the incidence of unemployment. Using these estimates, we calculate that a
two—standard—deviation decrease in the cyclicality of duration that is

accompanied by an offsetting increase in the cyclical variability of incidence

would induce an 8 percent decrease in waae rates. As with workplace injuries,

there is evidence that there would be substantial welfare gains to reducing

the cycl ical variability of unemployment duration.


V. Conclusions

     We have derived a model of compensating differentials for wage losses

which recognizes the importance of risk aversion. The model predicts that

wage differentials will respond more strongly to an increase in the duration

of the wage loss than to a rise in its incidence that produces an equal

increase in the expected loss. This prediction was first verified using two

cross sections of data on individuals' wages and characteristics linked to

aggregate data on the injury experience of the three—digit industries in which

they work. We found that most of the compensating differential for higher

nonfatal workplace injuries stems from the large negative effect of ar

increase in the expected duration of an injury on the wage. The hypothesis

was then examined in the context of compensating differentials for

unemployment, both structural and cyclical. There was no support for it in

cross—section data, perhaps because of unmeasured differences across

industries in reservation wages. However, we found that the compensating wage

differential for differences in the cyclicality of unemployment is mainly a

result of compensation for differences in the cyclical ity of unemployment

duration. Moreover, the elasticities of wage rates with respect to these



                                      —   20 —
differences are quite close to those with       respect to differences in the
duration of injuries.

      L.4e have also shown   that   union intervention in the process that Qenerates

compensating differentials -for wage losses differs by the type of loss. In

the case of losses due to injuries unions raise the compensation for increases

in the expected incidence of the loss and have little impact on compensation

for increased duration. This contrasts to our finding that unionized workers

receive little compensation for the risk of cyci ical unemployment, especially

cyci ical increases in unemployment duration. Upon first glance these results

appear quite contradictory. If one considers the nature of the losses

involved, though, the two sets of results are completely consistent. Unlike

the risk of cyclical unemployment, which is borne in most cases by junior

workers, the risk of injury affects all workers in a plant; there is very

little unions can do to shift the risk away from the median member. Thus we

should expect that unions will bargain for higher wages to compensate the

median member for the risk of injury, while they are less concerned with the

effects cif a higher risk of cycl ical unemployment, especially longer—duration

cyclical unemployment, that do not affect most members.

       In a world of complete information and certain receipt of

employer—financed insurance for wage losses there is an equivalence between

the cost of compensating wage differentials to induce workers to accept risks

and the cost of social insurance. That equivalence breaks down if, as our

results indicate, workers2 risk aversion leads them to demand extra

compensation for increases in the duration o-f       loss   beyond that which

compensates them for the expected loss. The cost of insurance would merely

equal the expected loss, while compensating differentials will vary depending

cri   the relative sizes of the two components of     that expected loss.       In
general, then, the rnarqcnal benefit to the employer of greater safety will

depend upon the absence or presence of legal insurance requirements. Our

results therefore indicate that, because o-f the special roles of duration and

risk aversion, welfare depends upon the insurance regime assumed.

     While the empirical research on workplace injuries and cyclical

unemployment offers evidence supportinQ our predictions about the importance

of duration of loss in producing compensating wage differentials, it is only

the beginning of research on this issue. Additional work on alternative sets

of data is needed. Also, further work should test the various explanations

for the existence of especially large compensating differentials for the

duration of loss.

curves are possible, even if indifference curves are all identical, because
the wage frontier is responsive to market demands for products requiring
varying risks of wane loss.

3. If the worker perceives that wages are reduced by a fraction E of the
xpected loss P in order to help to finance wage replacement, and if w
represents the worker's true marginal product, then the second term in (15)
becomes PY[ +3

4. One would also like to test the equations using job changers, those for
whom fixed effects can be removed. This would, as Duncan—Hoimlund (1983)
point out, reduce biases in the estimates of compensating differentials,
though the reduction is less in our data than it would be if we used
self—reported risks. Unfortunately, 1981 was the first year the necessary
detail on industry affiliation was given iii the PSID.

5. The data are from BLS, Occupational Injuries and Illnesses in the United
States by Industry, 1980, 1981, Bulletins 2130 and 2164.

6. Clearly, since the data cover- industries and the observations are on
individuals1 there is no simultaneity problem. There is, however, a potential
prc'blem o-f truncation of the duration data, as only days lost during the
particular year are included in the calculation of DUR for an industry.
Unfortunately, without additional information it is impossible to tell whether
this measurement problem produces different biases on the estimates of the
separate effects of duration and incidence.

7. The ranges of L4 in 1980 and 1981 are from 3.2 to 338.9, and 2.3 to 289.3;
the ranges of INC are from .2 to 14.9, and from .2 to 14.4; those of OUR are
from 9.0 to 35.75, and from 9.0 to 37.57.

8. One could specify a finer breakdown by industry. However, a complete set
of dummies, one for each three—digit industry, would wipe out the coefficients
on the injur-y variables, since these are available only at that level of
disaggreqation. There is thus an inherent problem in this and all other
studies of compensating differentials for risk of workplace injury or fatality
that use micro data linked to industry or occupation statistics: One cannot
completely distinguish the effects of other industrial or occupational
characteristics that are correlated with the incidence and duration of injury
and that affect wage differentials from those of the injury hazards

9.   'ht       is producing the difficulty is suggested by the relative lack of



                                         — 25 —
variation in DUR that we noted above.

10. While we have used logarithmic forms of DUR and INC here, qualitatively
similar results are produced when linear forms are included in a respecified
versic.ri cit (17).

11. Richard Butler kindl::i provided the data used in his study. For
observations in the 35 states with adequate data1 equations including
replacement rates under workers' compensation were estimated.

12. Our finding of little effect of workers' compensation benefits on the
comperisatinQ differentials parallels that of Ruser (1985). The difference
between our results and those of Butler—Worrall (1983) may stem from their use
of aggregate wage data.

13. Although disturbingly little information is available on actual benefits
paid, as opposed to benefit schedules, the evidence does suggest the haphazard
nature of income replacement. Thus Interdepartmental Workers' Compensation
Task Force, Research Report1 Volume VI, 1981, shows that actual replacement
rates for varying degrees of permanent partial disability ranged from .45 to
1.53 in Wisconsin, and from 1.85 to 13.85 in Florida.

14. Llnion membership rather than collective bargaining coverage is also used
in studies of compensating differentials by Viscusi (1979), Olson (1981) and
Duncan—Stafford (1980).

15. The March 1980 data are unpb shed and were kindly provided to us by Paul
Flairn; the March 1983 data are presented in Table 8—121 BLS, Work Experience
of the Population in 1981—82, Bulletin 2199, 1984.

16. The data are divided into durations o-f 1—4 weeks, 5—10, 11—14, 15—26, and
27 plus. The duration data measure the total weeks of unemployment
experienced during the previous year. Thus an individual with two ten—week
spells would be recorded as having unemployment with a duration of twenty
weeks,. Also, as with the injury data used in Section III, reported spell
duration may be truncated because spells that overlap calendar years are not
fully reported. Without knodng more detail about their distribution, though,
we cannot tell what are the relative biases to the separate estimates of
incidence and duration effects on compensating differentials.

17. The UI data are for 19E:0, the most recent available, and are taken from
Employment and Training Administration, Handbook of UI Financial Data, ET
Handbook 394. Topel (1984) found that adding a measure of the replacement rate
(the weekly benefit relative to the individual's wage) to equations that
shcied no ccimperisating wage differential for unemployment changed those
results drastically and made the differential significant and positive.
However, the replacement measure included the dependent variable in its
denominator. Moreover, since our theory is based on aversion to the risk of a
long—duration loss, a measure of interstate differences in the extent to which
long—duration losses are covered is more appropriate for our purposes.

18. The double recession from 1980—82 was reputed to be especially heavily
concentrated in hiqh-wage industries. If this is true, and if the variables
in the vector X and the vector of one—digit industry dursmy variables do not
account for all other factors, it may be that the peculiarities of that




                                    — 26 —
recession are producing our results. Thus the high—wage industries wou'd be
those in which duration rose the most, not because high waaes represent
compensating differentials, but because high wages were associated with and
may even have induced, above-average cyclical increases in unemployment.
Without data from additional recessions this possibil it>' cannot be
distinguished from our explanation.

19. The result does not depend on our use of logarithmic forms of the measures
of duration and ir,cierece: When linear forms were added the results changed
little (though the R were slightly lower). Similarly, the results differ
little when the sample is restricted to blue—collar workers.

20. The equations presented in the table do riot include the measure of
cyclical changes in long—term unemployment.
