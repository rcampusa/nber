This paper analyzes prudential controls on capital flows to emerging markets from the perspective
of a Pigouvian tax that addresses externalities associated with the deleveraging cycle. It presents a
model in which restricting capital inflows during boom times reduces the potential outflows during
busts. This mitigates the feedback effects of deleveraging episodes, when tightening financial constraints
on borrowers and collapsing prices for collateral assets have mutually reinforcing effects. In our model,
capital controls reduce macroeconomic volatility and increase standard measures of consumer welfare.

        This paper analyzes prudential controls on capital flows to emerging markets from
    the perspective of a Pigouvian tax that addresses externalities associated with the
    deleveraging cycle. It presents a model in which restricting capital inflows during
    boom times reduces the potential outflows during busts. This mitigates the feedback
    effects of deleveraging episodes, when tightening financial constraints on borrowers and
    collapsing prices for collateral assets have mutually reinforcing effects. In our model,
    capital controls reduce macroeconomic volatility and increase standard measures of
    consumer welfare.
        A number of emerging market economies have recently imposed or considered im-
    posing controls on capital inflows in the face of fierce capital flow bonanzas.1 For
    example, Brazil imposed a 2 percent levy on on foreign investments in Brazilian stocks
    and fixed-income securities on Oct. 24, 2009 after experiencing a 36 percent appreci-
    ation of its currency earlier during the year, and Taiwan followed suit with a similar
    measure in November.2 However, while policymakers around the world are clearly
    concerned about the effects of volatility in capital flows, the theoretic welfare case for
    such intervention has been less clear. The existing literature has studied how capital
    flow volatility can trigger feedback cycles that work through the depreciation of the
    real exchange rate. See e.g. Javier Bianchi (2010) and Anton Korinek (2009, 2010).
    This paper contributes to the debate by presenting a model based on a more general
    mechanism that involves asset price deflation.



    1     Model
    We describe a small open economy in a one-good world with three time periods t =
    0, 1, 2. The economy is populated by a continuum of atomistic identical consumers,
    with a mass normalized to one. The consumer issues debt in period 0 and repays it in

    Capital controls had also been imposed by Chile over the period of 1991-98, amid mixed reviews. See
    e.g. Francisco Gallego et al. (2002) for a discussion.

    periods 1 and 2. In period 1, his ability to roll over debt may be affected by a collateral
    constraint. Period 2 represents the long term. Optimism about the future may lead to
    a large volume of debt inflows in period 0, making the economy vulnerable to a sudden
    stop/credit crunch in period 1.
         The utility of the representative consumer is given by

                                           u(c0 ) + u(c1 ) + c2 .

    The riskless world interest rate is normalized to zero. Thus the first-best level of
    consumption is the same in periods 0 and 1 and is given by c∗ satisfying u0 (c∗ ) = 1.
         Domestic income involves two components, an endowment e that is obtained in
    period 1 and is not pledgeable to foreign creditors, and the return y on an asset that
    materializes in period 2 and can be pledged as collateral on loans from foreign investors.
    (We assume that the asset is not acquired by foreign investors because residents have a
    strong comparative disadvantage in managing it). Each domestic consumer owns one
    unit of the asset, and the price of the asset at time t is denoted by pt . For simplicity,
    we assume that the asset return y and the endowments are deterministic, except for e,
    which is revealed in period 1. Because of a credit constraint, low realizations of e may
    trigger countercyclical capital outflows or ”sudden stops”.3
         Under these assumptions the budget constraints of a domestic consumer are given
    by                                   

                                          c2 + d2 = y,

    where dt is the debt to be repaid at the beginning of period t. The interest rate is equal
    to zero because there is no default in equilibrium. Each consumers faces a collateral

    We could also assume that y is stochastic, leading to a model in which booms and busts in capital
    flows are driven by the price of domestic assets (see Olivier Jeanne and Anton Korinek, 2010).

    constraint of the form
                                                d2 ≤ θ1 p1 ,                                         (1)

    where θ1 is the quantity of domestic collateral held by the consumer at the beginning
    of period 1. Domestic consumers can buy or sell the asset in a perfectly compet-
    itive domestic market but in a symmetric equilibrium we must have θ1 = 1. The
    micro-foundation for constraint (1) is that a consumer could walk away from his debt,
    following which foreign creditors could seize his asset and sell it to other consumers in
    the domestic market.4



    2     Laissez-faire equilibrium
    We solve for the equilibrium going backwards.5 Decentralized agents first solve for the
    period-1 equilibrium, taking initial liquid net worth m1 = e − d1 as given:


                             Vlf (m1 ) = max {u(c1 ) + c2 } s.t. d2 ≤ p1 .
                                           d2

    In equilibrium, the period-1 price of the asset is equal to its expected return times the
    marginal utility of period-2 consumption (1) divided by the marginal utility of period-1
    consumption,
                                                           y
                                                p1 =                .                                (2)
                                                       u0 (c   1)

        The first-order condition to the period 1 maximization problem is

                                            u0 (c1 ) = 1 + λlf ,

    where λlf is the shadow cost of constraint (1). If the equilibrium is unconstrained, then
    c1 = c∗ and p1 = y. The equilibrium is indeed unconstrained if and only if the value
4
    As we show in Jeanne and Korinek (2010), the constraint can also involve the end-of-period collateral
    and be written d2 ≤ φθ2 p1 with φ < 1. The only thing that matters is that the collateral constraint
    depend on the current price of the asset, p1 .

of collateral is sufficiently high to cover d2 = c∗ − e + d1 , that is, if net worth is higher
than a threshold
                                        m1 ≥ m∗ ≡ c∗ − y.

   If this condition is violated, the equilibrium is constrained and is characterized by

                                                            y
                                           c1 = m1 +                  .                   (3)

   Both sides of equation (3) are increasing with c1 . When the constrained value of
c1 reaches c∗ , the equilibrium is unconstrained. In figure 1 we illustrate the resulting
equilibrium. Since both lines are upward-sloping in the constrained region, small shocks
to liquid net worth can lead to large movements in consumption and asset prices.
The zigzag line in the figure illustrates how the economy reacts to a small change
in the endowment e by −∆, as indicated by the downward shift in the dashed line:
For the original level of consumption, the borrowing constraint would be violated,
hence consumption has to decline. But this reduces the asset price p1 = y/u0 (c1 ) and
therefore tightens the borrowing constraint, leading to a downward spiral of declining
consumption and dropping asset prices. This is the the general mechanism behind
standard models of financial acceleration or debt deflation. In the unconstrained region,


                                                     5
    by contrast, a change in endowment by +∆ (as illustrated by the upper dashed line)
    does not affect consumption c1 .
        We restrict our attention to the case where equation (3) is satisfied by at most one
    c1 because the derivative of the r.h.s. with respect to c1 is strictly smaller than 1,
                                          d(1/u0 (c))
                                      y               < 1 ∀y, ∀c ≤ c∗ .                      (4)
                                              dc
    If this condition is not satisfied there might be multiple equilibria, in which a fall in the
    price of the domestic asset is self-fulfilling because it depresses domestic consumption.6
    Equation (3) has a solution c1 if and only if the debt coming to maturity can be repaid
    with the available liquid net worth (m1 > 0), and this solution is unique. In reduced
    form, we can write the period-1 level of consumption and the price of the asset as
    increasing functions of net worth, c(m1 ) and p(m1 ).
        In the unconstrained regime, capital inflows are decreasing in e as a higher en-
    dowment shock reduces the need of consumers to borrow abroad. Conversely, if the
    economy is credit-constrained (in the ”sudden stop regime”), capital flows become pro-
    cyclical, i.e., a lower endowment shock e leads to a lower value of the collateral asset,
    reduced borrowing from abroad.
        In period 0, decentralized agents solve the maximization problem max u(c0 ) +
    E0 Vlf (m1 ). Using Vlf0 (m1 ) = u0 (c1 ), this yields the first-order condition

                                            u0 (c0 ) = E0 [u0 (c1 )] .                       (5)

    The left-hand-side and right-hand-side of this equation are respectively decreasing and
    increasing in d1 . The equation uniquely determines the equilibrium level of d1 under
    laissez-faire.



    3     Social planner equilibrium
    We compare the laissez-faire equilibrium with the allocations chosen by a constrained
    social planner who internalizes the asset pricing equation in the economy (2) and
6
    In the following we abstract from multiplicity for the sake of simplicity.

                                                        6
realizes that changes in aggregate consumption entail changes in asset prices, which in
turn affect the borrowing constraint. In period 1, the social planner chooses the same
allocation as under laissez-faire. The social planner sets d1 in period 0 to maximize
expected welfare u(c0 ) + E0 Vsp (e − d1 ) where the planner’s measure of period-1 welfare
is given by
                    Vsp (m1 ) = max {u(c1 ) + c2 + λsp [p(m1 ) − d2 ]} ,
                                  d2

where p(m1 ) = y/u0 (c1 ), and λsp denotes the shadow price on the credit constraint for
the social planner. The first-order condition with respect to d2 remains u0 (c1 ) = 1+λsp .
The difference with laissez-faire is that the social planner internalizes the endogeneity
of the price to the aggregate level of liquid wealth, m1 , which decentralized agents take
as given. By implication the social planner recognizes that the marginal value of liquid
wealth in period 1 is
                            Vsp0 (m1 ) = u0 (c1 ) + λsp · p0 (m1 ) .

In the constrained regime, the social marginal value of liquid wealth is larger than its
private marginal value because it includes the impact of aggregate wealth on the price
of collateral.
   The planner’s first-order condition with respect to first-period debt d1 is therefore

                           u0 (c0 ) = E0 [u0 (c1 ) + λsp · p0 (m1 )] .                 (6)

Whenever there are states in which the borrowing constraint is binding in period 1,
both the shadow price λsp and the derivative p0 (m1 ) are positive, and hence the social
planner makes the economy consume less and issue less debt in period 0 than under
laissez-faire (compare with (5)). This can be interpreted as a macro- (or systemic)
precautionary motive: the social planner internalizes the impact of aggregate debt on
the probability and severity of a sudden stop.
   The optimal level of debt could be implemented in a decentralized way by a tax τ
on debt inflows that is rebated in lump sum fashion. The first-order condition on d1



                                               7
    under such a tax u0 (c0 ) = (1 + τ )E0 (u0 (c1 )) implies that the optimal tax is given by

                                               E0 [λsp · p0 (m1 )]
                                          τ=                       .
                                                  E0 [u0 (c1 )]


    4     Illustration
    We assume that utility is logarithmic (u(c) = log c) and that e is uniformly distributed
    over the interval [ē − ε, ē + ε]. The logarithmic utility implies c∗ = 1. As shown in the
    technical appendix, under those assumptions the model can be solved almost entirely
    in closed form. We assume m∗ = 0.2 and ē = 1.3.
        Figure 2 shows how the probability of a sudden stop (under laissez-faire and with
    the social planner) and the optimal tax τ vary with the maximum size of the endowment
    shock ε. For ε < ē − m∗ − 1 = 0.1, the economy is never constrained under laissez-faire
    so that the optimal tax is equal to zero. If ε > 0.1, the probability of a sudden stop is
    positive and increasing in the downside risk—it reaches almost 20 percent for ε = 0.3
    under laissez-faire. Meanwhile the expected consumption gap (c∗ − c1 )/c∗ conditional
    on a sudden stop increases from zero to about 28 percent (not shown on the figure).
        The figure illustrates the extent to which the social planner insures the economy
    against the risk of a sudden stop. For ε ' 0.13, the probability of sudden stop is
    reduced from 10 percent under laissez-faire to 6.8 percent by the social planner with
    a rather moderate tax of τ ' 1.3 percent.7 The optimal tax increases more than
    proportionately with the probability of a sudden stop because large sudden stops are
    costly in terms of domestic welfare. If ε = 0.3, the social planner imposes a hefty tax
    of 11.4 percent on debt inflows so as to reduce the probability of a sudden stop from
    19 to 12 percent.



7
    The social planner reduces not only the probability but also the average size of the sudden stops. The
    expected consumption gap conditional on a sudden stop is lowered from 6.8 percent to 4.6 percent by
    the tax.

5     Discussion
Contingent Liabilities If other forms of liability are available, the amplification dy-
namics in the economy are mitigated, and so are the resulting externalities. However,
in practice risk markets are often incomplete due to problems such as asymmetric in-
formation, and international debt flows are pervasive. Even if decentralized agents
have access to ex ante complete insurance markets, there may be reasons why they
choose to expose themselves to binding constraints and trigger inefficient financial ac-
celerator dynamics in some states of nature. This is the case for instance if lenders are
risk-averse, as discussed in more detail in Korinek (2009, 2010).

    Investment    If we introduce risky investment decisions into the model, we find
similar distortions. Decentralized agents undervalue the social costs of losses in low
output states, and therefore expose themselves excessively to risky projects that fail
when aggregate output is low. By the same token, they undervalue insurance and
invest insufficiently in counter-cyclical projects that would yield positive payoffs in
states with low aggregate endowment shocks.

    Bailouts Our analysis above assumed that the only intervention available to a social
planner was the imposition of ex-ante taxes on borrowing. In the real world, another
common policy instrument is bailouts that aim to loosen binding constraints by directly


                                                    9

    log-utility example.
           However, there are two important limitations to bailouts: First, a self-financing
    bailout, i.e. a bailout that does not involve a permanent resource transfer from outside
    the economy, is only possible if the planner has either accumulated resources ex ante
    or has a superior capacity ex post to collect repayments after the bailout.8 Secondly, to
    the extent that bailouts are anticipated, they create significant moral hazard concerns,
    i.e., they induce decentralized agents to increase their borrowing ex ante, making it
    more likely that constraints will be binding and crises will occur.



    6        Conclusion
    This paper presents a simple model of collateralized international borrowing, in which
    the value of collateral assets endogenously depends on the state of the economy. When
    financial constraints are binding in such a setup, financial amplification effects (sudden
    stops) arise as declining collateral values, tightening financial constraints and falling
    consumption mutually reinforce each other.
           Such amplification effects are not internalized by individual borrowers and consti-
    tute a negative externality that provides a natural rationale for the Pigouvian taxation
    of international borrowing. In a sample calibration we found the optimal Pigouvian tax
    on foreign debt to be 1.3 percent per dollar borrowed for an economy that experiences
    sudden stops with 10 percent probability. A fuller characterization of the externalities
    stemming from financial amplification effects in an infinite-horizon DSGE framework
    as well as the resulting optimal Pigouvian taxes are presented in Jeanne and Korinek
    (2010).

    In other words, the bailout loan will only be repaid if lending by the planner is not subject to constraint
    (1).

       A1. Derivation of first-order conditions
       The budget constraints of a domestic consumer are given by
                            
                             c0 = d1 + (1 − θ1 )p0 ,

                                 
                                 
                                  c + d = θ y,
                                    2    2    2


    where θt is the quantity of the domestic collateral asset held by the consumer at the
    beginning of period t and dt is the debt to be repaid at the beginning of period t. The
    budget constraints in the text assume θt = 1, which is true in equilibrium.9 However
    to derive the asset pricing equation (2) we need to take into account the fact that θt
    could be different from 1 at the individual level.
       Utility is maximized under the collateral constraint (1). In period 1, thus, the
    representative consumer solves the problem,

                  max u (e + d2 + (θ1 − θ2 )p1 − d1 ) + θ2 y − d2 + λlf (θ1 p1 − d2 ),
                  d2 ,θ2


    where λlf is the shadow cost of the constraint. The first-order condition for θ2 is
    u0 (c1 )p1 = y, which gives equation (2). The first-order condition for d2 is u0 (c1 ) =
    1 + λlf .
       A2. Numerical illustration: the log-utility-uniform-distribution case
        If u (c) = log c, then c∗ = 1. Condition (4), which ensures equilibrium uniqueness,
    is satisfied iff y < 1.
        We assume e is uniformly distributed in [ē − ε, ē + ε]. Equation (3) has a solution
    c1 ≥ 0 if and only if m1 = e − d1 ≥ 0. Since this inequality must be satisfied for any
    realization of e we must have d1 < min e = e − ε. This is true provided that

                                               ε < ē − d1 .

    The equilibrium level of consumption is the min of c∗ = 1 and the constrained level of
    consumption given by equation (3), c1 = m1 + yc1 . This implies
                                               m 
                                                    1
                                    c1 = min 1, ∗ ,
                                                  m
    where m∗ ≡ 1 − y > 0.

    In our model consumers are in fact indifferent between holding the collateral asset or bonds between
    periods 1 and 2 so long as they are unconstrained in period 1. As a result, their portfolio composi-
    tion may be indeterminate. For simplicity and without loss of generality, we limit our focus on the
    symmetric equilibrium where the asset and bond holdings of all agents are identical.

                                                    12
   Equation (2) implies that the price of collateral is given by
                                                m 
                                                      1
                             p1 = yc1 = y min 1, ∗ .
                                                   m
    The calibration will be characterized in terms of three parameters: m∗ , ē and ε.
First, let us derive a condition that is necessary and sufficient for the economy to be
constrained with some probability. If the economy is never constrained then c1 = 1
and condition (5) implies c0 = 1 so that d1 = c0 = 1. The economy is then indeed
unconstrained in period 1 iff d2 = c∗ + d1 − e = 2 − e is smaller than y for all possible
realizations of e, that is if
                                    ē > 1 + m∗ + ε.
Conversely, if ē < 1 + m∗ + ε there is a nonzero probability that the credit constraint
binds in period 1. The constraint is binding in period 1 if and only if m1 < m∗ , that is

                                        e < m∗ + d1 .

   We will consider calibrations such that the economy would not be constrained in the
absence of uncertainty but may be constrained for sufficiently large negative shocks,
that is
                               1 + m∗ < ē < 1 + m∗ + ε.
   Let us assume ε > e − m∗ − 1, so that the economy is constrained in period 1 with
a nonzero probability. With a uniform distribution for e, the equilibrium condition (5)
can be written

This equation determines the level of debt under laissez-faire, dlf      1 . One can show
that this equation determines a unique level of d1 through the following steps. First,
note that E0 [u0 (c1 )] > 1 (since c1 < 1 in the constrained state and c1 = 1 in the
unconstrained state). This implies that the rhs is above the lhs for d1 ≥ 1, and that
dlf                                                            lf           ∗
  1 must be strictly lower than 1. Second, note that d1 > ē − m − ε: otherwise
the economy is never credit constrained and the first-order condition above cannot be
satisfied (the lhs is above the rhs, so that the consumer would increase its debt until the
constraint becomes binding with some probability). Third, one can show that the rhs
is strictly increasing with d1 in the interval [ē − m∗ − ε, 1] by taking the first derivative

                                                 m∗
                                                            
                                ∂rhs     1
                                      =                 −1 .
                                ∂d1      2ε e − ε − d1

                                             13
Thus it follows that the rhs and lhs are equal for one unique dlf
                                                               1 , which satisfies

                                 ē − m∗ − ε < dlf
                                                1 < 1.

   The fixed-point equation for d1 can be solved numerically to find the laissez-faire
equilibrium level dlf                                  ∗
                   1 given the exogenous parameters m , ē and ε.
   To derive the equations with a social planner note that

and that                             (
                                         1/m∗ − 1      if m1 < m∗ ,

   It follows that the social planner first-order condition (equation (6 )) can be written

   The optimal tax rate on debt inflows satisfies

                            E0 [u0 (c1 ) + λsp p0 (m1 )]        1

   One would like to calibrate the model so as to obtain ”reasonable values” for the
probability and size of a sudden stop. We now explain how to derive the underlying

must be lower that 1/2.

                                         m
which implies, if we denote by ∆c the expected consumption gap c∗ − c1 conditional
on a sudden stop,
                                          επ
                                    ∆c = ∗ .                                  (11)
                                          m
Thus from π and ∆c we can derive the ratio m∗ /ε,
                                       m∗   π
                                          =    ,
                                       ε    ∆c
and a relationship between e, d1 and ε,
                                                        
                               ē − d1              1
                                       =1+π            −2 .
                                  ε                 ∆c
We can then compute the level of debt under laissez-faire,
                     m∗             m∗ /ε           1 ē − d1 m∗
                                               
                1
                   =     log                      +   +      −    ,
               dlf
                1
                     2ε        (ē − d1 )/ε − 1     2    2ε    2ε

which, substituting out the terms in (ē − d1 )/ε and m∗ /ε, gives
                              h           π                i−1
                        dlf
                          1 =   1 − π −        log(1 − 2∆c)    .
                                         2∆c
   Given a value for ē, the values of ε and m∗ can be derived using

                                           ē − dlf
                                                 1
                                 ε=                    ,
                                      1 + π (1/∆c − 2)
                                              π
                                       m∗ =      ε.
                                              ∆c

                                           15
The condition 1 + m∗ < ē is satisfied iff

                                               π 1 − dlf
                                                       1
                                 ē > 1 +                .
                                             1 − 2π ∆c
One can choose ē arbitrarily subject to this condition.
    Section 4 of the paper presents the following numerical illustration: e = 1.3 and
y = 0.8 (or m∗ = 0.2). Thus the constraint is binding with nonzero probability if
ε > e − m∗ − 1 = 0.1. Figure 2 was constructed as follows. For ε between 0 and 0.3
(we use an evenly spaced grid with 50 points) we compute:
    • the levels of dlf     sp
                     1 and d1 by solving for the fixed-point equations (7) and (8);
    • the probability of sudden stop under laissez-faire and the social planner, π lf and
 sp
π , using equation (10);
    • the expected consumption gaps under laissez-faire and the social planner using
equation (11);
    • the optimal tax on capital inflows τ using equation (9).
    Figure 2 shows the variation with ε of π lf , π sp and τ .
