Output-based Pay: Incentives or Sorting?
Edward P. Lazear
NBER Working Paper No. 7419
November 1999
JEL No. J3


                                                ABSTRACT


        Variable pay, defined as pay that is tied to some measure of a firm’s output, has become more
important for executives of the typical American firm. Variable pay is usually touted as a way to provide
incentives to managers whose interests may not be perfectly aligned with those of owners. The incentive
justification for variable pay has well-known theoretical problems and also appears to be inconsistent with
much of the data. Alternative explanations are considered. One that has not received much attention, but
that is consistent with may of the facts, is selection. Managers and industry specialists may have information
about a firm’s prospects that is unavailable to outside investors. In order to induce managers to be truthful
about prospects, owners may require managers to “put their money where their mouths are,” forcing them
to extract some of their compensation in the form of variable pay. The selection or sorting explanation is
consistent with the low elasticities of pay to output that are commonly observed, with the fact that the
elasticity is higher in small and new firms, and with the fact that variable pay is more prevalent in industries
with very technical production technologies. It does not explain why some firms give stock options even
to very low-level workers.
