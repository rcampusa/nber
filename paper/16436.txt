                                           ABSTRACT

Using data from multiple-period math competitions, we show that males outperform females of similar
ability during the first period. However, the male advantage is not found in any subsequent period
of competition, or even after a two-week break from competition. Some evidence suggests that males
may actually perform worse than females in later periods. The analysis considers various experimental
treatments and finds that the existence of gender differences depends crucially on the design of the
competition and the task at hand. Even when the male advantage does exist, it does not persist beyond
the initial period of competition.

1     Introduction
In their influential paper, Gneezy et al. (2003) show that males and females respond differ-
ently to competition. The authors conduct experiments in which college students are paid to
solve mazes, either on their own or in competition with others. They show that competition
causes males to increase their performance relative to females. Gneezy and Rustichini (2004)
study footraces between fourth graders and find a similar result: boys respond favorably to
competition, while girls do not. It has been argued that these results help explain the gender
gap in achievement and pay in the work place, higher education, and other settings.
    Our paper works to provide a better understanding of gender differences in response to
competition. Its main goal is to determine how well the earlier results hold up against changes
in experiment design and participant experience. At the heart of our analysis are a series
of in-classroom experiments that we conducted with 505 primary school students. In each
of the 24 classrooms that participated, students were randomly paired with an opponent
and then competed against their opponent to complete an age-appropriate math quiz as
quickly and accurately as possible. We then repeated the process, rematching opponents
and assigning a new set of questions. Each classroom participated in up to five sequential
rounds of competition, resulting in 2171 total individual-period level observations.
    Our experimental approach has four primary advantages over past analyses. First, where
past experiments identify gender differences in a single competitive interaction, we observe
how the results change over sequential periods of competition as participants warm up and
gain experience. Second, we are able to run a variety of treatments in which we vary the
design of the competition. Third, we focus on math competitions, which are academic in
nature and clearly relate to one’s ability to succeed in academic and professional settings.
Fourth, we have data on state assessment test scores for our participants, giving us a formal
measure of ability that is absent from earlier analyses. Since the questions used in our
competition also come from the state assessments, we can directly compare how a given
student’s behavior changes as the environment changes. Not only are test scores an outcome
of substantial interest in the education literature, they also are a relevant input to explaining
why males and females with similar academic qualifications may experience different levels
of success in a competitive workplace.
    In the most common of our experimental treatments—the “race treatment”—the math
competitions were framed as races. Participants were told to complete as many questions
as possible before the five-minute time limit. The winner was the one who solved the most
questions. If someone finished the quiz before the time limit, then the quicker time won in
the event of a tie. The race results provide significant insight into the gender differences


                                               2
in reaction to competition. In the first period of competition, males perform significantly
better than females of the same ability. This result is consistent with the previous literature
(e.g., Gneezy et al. 2003, Gneezy and Rustichini 2004), which is not surprising since the
first period of competition in our experiments closely resembles the one-time competitions
in past papers. The main contribution of the paper comes when we look at later periods of
competition. In the second period of competition onward, we find absolutely no evidence
that males perform better than females of similar ability. Although gender has a significant
effect on performance in the initial period of competition, the male advantage vanishes almost
immediately. In fact, we find some evidence that males perform worse than females in later
periods.
    A closer look at performance in the math races reveals some additional insight into
the results. First, we show that the initial male advantage is more likely due to males
overperforming in the first period relative to their trend in later rounds, rather than due
to female underperformance. Second, we subdivide the race treatment data by quiz length
to analyze separately short-quiz competitions in which many participants finished the quiz
early, and long-quiz competitions in which few participants submitted answers before the
time limit. All subdivisions of the data told the same story: an initial male advantage
disappears before the second period of competition.
    After presenting the results for the race treatment, we present three smaller experimental
treatments designed to provide a better understanding of the gender differences. The “not-
a-race treatment” was identical to the race treatment except that the competition was not
framed as a race. That is, participants did not benefit from submitting answers before the
time limit, and they were explicitly told that the competition was “not a race.” It remained
clear to the participants, however, that they were competing against their assigned opponent
to answer the most questions correctly. The “reading-race treatment” was identical to the
race treatment, except that each quiz was made up of reading (i.e., language arts) questions
rather than math questions. Finally, for the “repeat treatment” we returned to some of the
race treatment classrooms two weeks after first running the experiments and reran the same
experiment with new questions.
    In these alternative treatments we don’t even find evidence of a first-period male advan-
tage. In both the reading-race and not-a-race treatments, we find no evidence of the gender
effect in any period of competition, including the first. This suggests that both the task at
hand and the design of the competition affect the initial gender effect. The result for the
reading treatment is merely suggestive, as we do not have the same ability measures as we
do for the math treatments. The result for the not-a-race treatment is relatively robust,
suggesting that males initially react more positively than females to competition when they


                                              3
view the competition as a race, but not otherwise. Taken together, these alternative treat-
ments show that the existence of the initial gender effect depends crucially on the nature of
the competition. Furthermore, in the treatments where we find an initial male advantage,
the advantage is always short-lived, vanishing after the first period.
    The repeat treatment speaks to the importance of the results for the literature. If once
the male advantage vanishes it is gone forever, then there is little reason to think that the
initial advantage could have any substantial effect on long-run achievement. On the other
hand, if the male advantage reappears at the beginning of every new competition, then it
may still help explain long-run achievement differences between males and females in com-
petitive environments. When we return to the classrooms two weeks after first conducting
the experiment and re-run the competitions, we find no significant evidence of a male advan-
tage in any period of competition including the first. Although the relatively small sample
size in this treatment prevents us from being certain of these results, the evidence points to
the male advantage not returning even weeks after the initial competition.
    Throughout the paper, the evidence calls into question the claim that performance dif-
ferences in competition may explain long-run achievement differences between males and
females. We show that the existence of the male advantage is highly dependent on the type
of competition. It exists in math races, but does not exist if the races involve reading ques-
tions, or if the competition is not framed as a race. Very few competitive interactions in
the workplace are viewed as races. Furthermore, the male advantage (when it does exist)
vanishes completely after the initial period of competition and we see no evidence that it
returns even after a two-week break from competition. Because of this, we see little reason to
believe that the male advantage, identified in the first period of our math races and in other
one-time competitions, could drive significant differences in long-run achievement. However,
the same behavioral trait that causes males to increase their initial performance during a
competition—whether it is increased initial excitement about competing or an initial in-
crease in testosterone in the face of competition—may also make it more likely that males
choose to compete in the first place. This alternative explanation of long-run achievement
differences is consistent with Niederle and Vesterlund (2007), who show that males are more
likely to enter competition compared with similarly able females.


2    Literature Review
A number of past articles assess whether males and females react differently to competition.
Gneezy et al. (2003) run a series of experiments on college students and show that males
respond more favorably than females to competition when solving mazes. Gneezy and Rus-

                                              4
tichini (2004) produce similar results when they have primary school students run footraces.
Günther et al. (in press, 2010) also identify a male advantage in maze competitions, but then
find no significant difference between male and female performance in competitions involv-
ing word games. In these papers’ experiments, the competitions lasted only one period, and
were framed as races. Our results are consistent with these earlier findings. We identify a
male advantage in the first period of the math races, but do not find any evidence of a male
advantage in the first round of our reading races. In none of these earlier experiments did
competitors participate in more than one competition.
    Another branch of this literature considers the impact of opponent gender on perfor-
mance. Inzlicht and Ben-Zeev (2000) find evidence that one’s performance on difficult verbal
and math tests may depend on the gender composition of the group of people sitting in close
proximity, even when they are not directly competing. Antonovics et al. (2009) showed that
males were more likely to answer trivia questions correctly when a larger fraction of their
competitors were female. Price (2008) shows that competitive funding can affect time to
candidacy in graduate school, with both males and females responding more positively to
the competition when more of their peers are female. In the present analysis, we focus on
whether males perform better than females in competitive environments; we are less con-
cerned with whether performance depends on the opponent’s gender. We do, however, find
suggestive evidence that males perform slightly better when competing against females.
    Compared to much of the previous literature, our analysis benefits from having access to
state assessment test scores. Most other papers that measure gender differences randomly
divide their subject pool into two groups for each gender. One of the groups race to complete
a task, and the other group completes the same task in a non-competitive setting. The
analyses then compare the distribution of performance in each group to see if there are
significant differences. In our analysis, we are able to directly control for each participant’s
past performance on the math section of state assessment tests. Furthermore, our focus on
math competitions lends real world appeal to the analysis, as math ability has a significant
affect on career success (Joensen and Nielsen (2009)).
    Other articles consider whether males and females have different preferences for com-
petition. Niederle and Vesterlund (2007) and Wozniak (2009) show that, given a choice,
males are more likely to compete than females. Similarly, Sapienza et al. (2009) claim that
at Northwestern University, 36% of female versus 57% of male MBA students choose com-
petitive finance careers.1 We find these results particularly interesting in the light of our
   1
     Booth and Nolen (2009) and Gneezy et al. (2009) show that preferences towards competition may be
due to past exposure and experience. Specifically, Booth and Nolen (2009) show that females who attend
all girls schools are more likely to choose competition (even competition against males) than are females in
coed schools. Gneezy et al. (2009) show that in a matrilineal society, women prefer competition more than


                                                     5
analysis. Although we find no evidence of long-run performance differences between males
and females within competition, males do perform better in the very first period of com-
petition. This initial performance boost experienced by the males may be related to their
eagerness to compete in the first place.


3     Research Design
3.1     Experiments and Test Score Data
Working with school officials and teachers, we went into 24 elementary school classrooms to
run a series of in-classroom, curriculum-based competitions. In each period of competition,
student participants were randomly paired with another classmate. The students were given
a quiz with questions selected from past state-assessment tests for the appropriate grade
level. They had five minutes to answer as many of the questions as they could. At the end
of five minutes, a winner was determined for each pair of students, and the winner received
two raffle tickets. If a pair of students tied, each received one raffle ticket. In each classroom,
we repeated this process up to five times, each time pairing students with new opponents.
There was a minimum amount of delay between each competition, with the entire activity
taking about an hour. At the end of the final competition, we randomly selected three raffle
tickets, and the students who won the raffle in each classroom received a candy bar or other
prize.
    Our tournaments took place a few weeks before the state assessment tests and were
used as a way of preparing the students for those tests. In total, we worked with 657
elementary school students, including 86 third graders, 297 fourth graders, and 122 sixth
graders. Twenty-one of our classrooms participated in five periods of competition. Due
to time constraints, one classroom participated in only four periods, and two classrooms
participated in three periods. We returned to four of the classrooms two weeks after first
conducting the experiment and reran the competitions a second time. 239 of the participants
are female, and 266 are male. The school districts in which we conducted the experiments
had little ethnic or racial diversity (approximately 90 percent of the area residents are white,
non-Hispanic), so we are not concerned about the racial mix of the competitions. In total,
we have 2171 observations.
    In addition to the data collected during the experiments, the school district provided us
with the previous year’s state assessment test scores for each of the participants in our math
males. Kleinjans (2009) presents evidence that differences in taste for competition may help explain some of
the sorting of males and females into different professions.



                                                     6
competitions. The state where the school district is located uses its own criterion-referenced
test for its end-of-year assessment. All students are required to participate, and the tests
are not timed. Access to this test score data is one of the primary advantages our analyses
has over past competition experiments.
    We first describe the race treatment with which we begin the analysis. Then, we describe
three alternative treatments that we use later in the analysis.

Race Treatment

After being introduced to the students by the teacher, we read the students the rules of
the competition. The description was thorough, informing them of the number of rounds of
competition, the number and origins of questions, procedure for determining their opponent
each period, the rules for determining each period’s winner, and the raffle and prize structure.
After explaining the rules, we answered any questions about rules, prizes, or procedure.
    In each period of competition, the students were randomly assigned an opponent, then
raced against their opponent to complete as many math questions as possible within a five-
minute time limit. The questions in the standard treatment were selected from previous year
state assessment tests for math, and each period’s quiz consisted of 5, 10, or 15 questions.
Within each classroom, the length of the quiz was held constant. The questions given in
each round were randomly selected and differed between classrooms, but were the same for
all students within a class. Five sample questions for fourth-grade participants are provided
in the appendix. In each two-person competition, the participant who answered the most
questions within the time limit won. Participants had the option to submit their answers
before the time limit. If both competitors had the same number of correct answers, then the
one who submitted his or her answers first won. The winner received two raffle tickets. If
both had the same number correct and no one submitted answers early, then the participants
tied, and each received one raffle ticket. After the final period of competition, three raffle
tickets were randomly selected and the students with those tickets received a candy bar or
other prize.
    Eight of the classrooms in the math races involved the participants moving to sit next
to their opponent in each round. In the four other classrooms, participants stayed in their
own desk the whole time but were told who they were competing against in each round. We
find no evidence that participants performed differently based on whether or not they were
sitting next to their opponent.
    In total, the race treatment was conducted in 12 classrooms with a total of 253 students.
The quizzes were five questions long in four classrooms, 15 questions long in three classrooms,
and 10 questions long in five of the classrooms. Section 4.2 considers the impact, if any, that

                                               7
the quiz length has on the results. To be able to compare performance across treatments
and quiz lengths, the scores are normalized by round and class to be mean zero and standard
deviation one. We present the average normalized and unnormalized scores for all treatments
in Tables 1 and 2.

Alternative Treatments

Following the results for the race treatment, we present results from three smaller experimen-
tal treatments. First, a not-a-race treatment was identical to the race treatment with one
major exception: we did not frame the competition as a race. Although participants knew
they were competing to perform better than their opponent on a quiz, we never referred to
the competition as a race. Consistent with this change, we also eliminated the faster-finish
tie-breaking rule; participants could finish their quizzes early, but doing so did not provide a
competitive advantage. In total, we conducted the not-a-race experiment in six classrooms
with a total of 122 students. Second, a reading-race treatment was identical to the race
treatment except that each period’s quiz was comprised of questions selected form the read-
ing section of the state assessment test. In total, we conducted the reading treatment in six
classrooms with a total of 130 students. Both the not-a-race and reading treatments involved
10-question quizzes. Third, a repeat treatment involved returning to four of the five-question
math race classrooms two weeks after first conducting the experiments and re-running the
competitions with new questions and new opponent matching.
    The presentation of our results follows the same outline as our investigation. We first
present results from the race treatment. Then, we consider the alternative treatments, and
what they can tell us about gender differences in response to competition.


3.2     Empirical Strategy
Let yi,r be student i’s score in round r, where all scores are normalized by round and class
to be mean 0 and standard deviation 1.2 We run regressions of the following form:

                                   yi,r = α + βθi,r + δGi,−i,r + i,r ,

where θi,r is a measure of the student’s innate ability and Gi,−i,r is a scalar or vector of
dummy variables that captures gender effects based on the student’s gender and potentially
   2
    We normalize scores for the regressions to make results easily comparable to the education research on
tests scores and to remove potential classroom idiosyncrasies. Regressions using percentage correct produce
the same substantive results.




                                                    8
that of his or her opponent. In the simplest specification, Gi,−i,r is a dummy variable for
boys. We also consider specifications that interact gender and opponent gender.
    We observe two variables related to participant ability, θi,r . The first is simply the
average performance of the student in the other rounds of competition, which we can write
as ȳi,−r . On its own, ȳi,−r would be problematic for two reasons. First, ȳi,−r has a fair bit
of measurement error in it, biasing β down and thus meaning we would have incorrectly
controlled for innate ability. Second, student performance in the other rounds will vary
both because of students’ innate ability and due to their competitive ability or preferences.
In which case it will control for competitive differences across gender, biasing δ towards
zero. We deal with both these problems with our second ability measure—the student’s
score on the prior year’s state assessment. Since we use state assessment questions in our
competitions, these are an ideal measure of how the student performs on the same material,
but in a relatively non-competitive environment.
    Because measurement error in the two variables is uncorrelated, we use the state assess-
ment score as an instrument for the student’s average performance in the other rounds. The
state assessment score only contains variation in ability from a non-competitive environment,
so it is a valid instrument for innate ability uncontaminated by direct competitive pressure.
We use the average in-competition score to purge any measurement error concerns. β then
consistently estimates how innate ability helps students do better in competitive environ-
ments.3
    If there were no measurement error in the state assessment, we could use OLS regressions
with the state assessment as the sole measure of ability, θi,r . Since this reduced form is a
more transparent methodology, Section 4.6 presents the results for the OLS analysis, which
provides similar results as the IV analysis.


4       Results
4.1     Race Treatment
Table 3 presents the results for the race treatment using state assessment scores as the
instrument for ability as described above. Regressions (1) and (2) use data from the first
period of competition; (1) controls for the participant’s own gender, while (2) also controls for
opponent gender. Regressions (3) and (4) do the same for the second period of competition,
    3
    In unreported results we allowed β to vary by gender in our baseline race treatment. We saw no evidence
that such an interaction was important as the estimated β was the same for males and females. Furthermore,
allowing the interaction had no effect on our point estimates or standard errors for δ.



                                                    9
and regressions (5) and (6) do the same for the combined data from periods two through
five. (Tables 1 and 2 report on average scores by round for all rounds.)

4.1.1   First Period of Competition

We first identify significant gender differences in performance during the first period of
competition. This gender gap is consistent with the literature that looks at one-period
competitions.
    In Table 3, the first period results clearly show that in competition, males perform sig-
nificantly better than females of similar ability. In the first regression, the male coefficient is
a highly significant 0.34. This means that if we take a male and female with identical past
test scores, we expect the male to score 0.34 standard deviations higher than the female in
the first period of our math competitions. The male coefficient is significantly different from
zero, with p-value of 0.004.
    When controlling for opponent gender in regression (2), it remains clear that males
perform better during the first round of competition compared with similarly able females.
Opponent gender, however, does not have a significant impact on performance. Both male
coefficients (i.e., MvM and MvF) are significantly different from the FvM baseline (p-values
of 0.01 and 0.03), and MvM is also significantly different from FvF at the ten percent
level (p-value = 0.06). Although we cannot reject equality between the MvF and FvF
coefficients (p-value=0.17), the coefficient is consistent with a male advantage. Males may
perform somewhat better when competing against other males, but this difference is far from
significant (p-value = 0.56). Similarly, females may perform slightly better when competing
against other females, but the difference is also not significant (p-value = 0.59). Therefore,
although females perform significantly worse than males, there is no evidence that first-period
performance is influenced by the gender of one’s opponent.
    These results are consistent with the main findings in past research: in the first period
of competition, males perform significantly better than females of similar ability.

4.1.2   Multiple Periods of Competition

After the first round of competition, the male advantage disappears. In the second period
of competition and in all subsequent periods, we find no evidence that males perform better
than females of similar ability. Even more surprisingly, in later periods of competition, males
may actually perform worse than females of similar ability.
    Regressions (3) and (4) in Table 3 provide results for the second period of competition.
Comparing regression (3) to regression (1), a few things are apparent. Most importantly, the


                                                10
male advantage vanishes by the second period of competition, with the second-period male
coefficient equal to -0.01. Equality between the first- and second-period male coefficients is
rejected with a p-value of 0.05. Additionally, the ability coefficient and the R-squared are
both larger in the second-period regression. That is, in the second period of competition,
gender no longer matters and ability becomes a better predictor of performance.4 When the
second period analysis controls for opponent gender in regression (4), the results are similar.5
    Later periods of competition look a lot like the second period of competition. Instead of
presenting separate results for each period of competition, we pool the data from the later
periods of competition in regressions (5) and (6). The results when we pool the data are
similar to the results from the second period by itself. They suggest that males perform
significantly worse than females in later rounds of competition. After the first round of
competition, males tend to perform 0.10 standard deviations worse than females of similar
ability, which is not only statistically different from zero (p-value = 0.014) but also from the
first round gender effect (p-value = 0.007)
    A few other patterns in the multiple round data are worth mentioning. Table 2 shows that
female performance drops slightly between the first and second periods of competition, then
improves over the later rounds of competition. Male performance falls drastically between
the first and second rounds of competition, then increases steadily over the later rounds
of competition. For females, performance in the third through fifth periods is significantly
better than performance in either of the first two periods (p-value < 0.001). We can reject
the hypothesis that male performance in the first two periods is the same (p-value < 0.001).
Male performance in the second period is also significantly worse than male performance in
the fifth period (p-value = 0.001). That is, male performance decreases significantly after the
first period, and then—like female performance—gradually improves over the later periods
of competition. Taken together, these results suggest that the male advantage in the first
round of competition is due to males overperforming compared to their trend in later periods,
rather than from females underperforming.
    These results are quite surprising. Although we find a male advantage in the initial period
of competition, the male advantage promptly disappears. In later rounds of competition,
we find no evidence that males outperform females of similar ability. In fact, we present
some evidence that males perform worse than females in later periods of competition. These
findings suggest that the gender differences in reaction to competition may not be as robust
   4
     The difference between the round one and round two ability coefficients is insignificant with a p-value
equal to 0.3. As we’ll see below, though, the regression grouping all the later rounds has a much more precise
estimate that allows us to reject that round one has the same ability coefficient as other rounds.
   5
     In round two, males now tend to perform worse when competing against another male than when
competing against a female; however, this difference between the MvF and MvM coefficients is not significant.

as previously thought. However, before drawing conclusions about the importance of our
findings, we provide work to better understand our results in the following subsections.


4.2     Impact of Quiz Length
The race treatment includes quizzes of different length. Four of the classrooms were given
five questions in each period, five of the classrooms were given 10 questions each period, and
three of the classrooms were given 15 questions each period. In the 15-question classrooms
21 percent of the competitions had at least one participant finish early; this rises to 34
percent in the 10-question classrooms and to 100 percent in the five-question classrooms.
With shorter quizzes, the students could more easily finish the questions within the allotted
time and so were much more likely to ring in early.
     Table 4 seperates our analysis of the math races by quiz length and round. It shows
that for all quiz lengths, males tend to perform better than females in the first round but
not in later rounds. The first-period male coefficient is largest in the competitions with 15
questions; although none of the first period male coefficients are significantly different from
one another. When we subdivide the standard treatment, the smaller subsamples are less
precise, such that the first period male coefficient is only significantly different from zero in
the 15-question classification (p-value = 0.038). We cannot reject that the male coefficients
are zero in the five- and ten-question classifications as the p-values are 0.334 and 0.134,
respectively. However, the magnitude of the coefficients is consistent with the first-round
gender difference found elsewhere in our analysis. Furthermore, if we combine the data from
the five- and ten-question classifications, the first-round male coefficient becomes 0.27, which
is significantly different than zero with a p-value of 0.052. These results show that the gender
difference does not persist beyond the first round for any quiz length.6
     One possible explanation of the changing gender gap is that students may perceive that
early completion was not as frequent as they thought it would be. If, after one round, they
decided that the competition was not really much of a race, they might change behavior
to a non-competitive mode where no gender gap exists. In that case we would expect to
see a gender gap in all rounds for the five-question subsample, where some student in each
pair always buzzed in early, along with the first round of the longer question classifications.
Table 4 suggests that this“revised beliefs” explanation does not fit the data, as the gender
premium disappears just as readily in the five-question subsample as in the others. Indeed
we can formally reject the hypothesis that the later rounds of the five question subsample
   6
    We easily reject that all six gender coefficients are the same (p-value = 0.02). We can further reject
the three-restriction test that the first round coefficients are separately each equal to their later round
counterparts (p-value = 0.08).


                                                    12
exhibit the same gender effect as the first round of all three classifications (p-value = 0.01).


4.3     Not-A-Race Treatment
The not-a-race treatment is identical to the race treatment except that the competition
was not framed as a race, and there was no benefit to finishing the quiz quicker than one’s
opponent. Participants were told that they would be rewarded for getting more answers
correct than their opponent. Although it was clear that the competition involved answering
as many questions correctly as possible in a limited amount of time, the participants were
explicitly told that the quiz was “not a race.” That is, the participants understood that
they were competing against their opponents, but we made an effort to downplay the racing
aspect of the competition.
    Regressions (1) and (2) in Table 5 provide the results for this treatment. Surprisingly, we
find no evidence of gender differences in any period of competition, including the first. This
finding is particularly interesting since Section 4.2 found a significant first-round gender
effect that persisted even with long quizzes that made the time limit binding. Since few
participants finished the long quizzes early, the only substantial difference between the long-
quiz race treatment and the not-a-race treatment was whether the competition was framed
as a race. The results imply that competition does not generally result in a male advantage.
Rather, it is perception about the type of competition (e.g., whether it is a race) that causes
the gender differences.7 In our setting, when the participants perceive the competition as a
race, the gender differences exist; when they are told that the competition is not a race, the
initial male advantage does not exist.
    Unlike in the race treatment, the ability measure in the not-a-race treatment is not
increasing across rounds of competition. This means that ability is just as good of a predictor
of performance in the first period as it is in later periods. The R-squared is also much higher
in this regression than the previous ones—close to 0.45 compared to 0.15 to 0.20 in the race
treatment—suggesting that there is less variance in performance when the competition is
not viewed as a race. This is consistent with the idea that the perception of racing may
affect nerves, making performance less predictable.
   7
    We reject with a p-value of 0.04 that the first round gender effect here is the same as the one in the race
treatment. We can further reject with a p-value of 0.055 that these not-a-race results are the same as the
15 question subsample of the race treatment.




                                                      13
4.4     Reading-Race Treatment
The reading treatment is similar to the standard treatment except that quizzes are made up
of reading questions, rather than math questions. A weakness of the analysis here is that the
reading treatment was conducted in a different (but neighboring) school district from the
math treatments.8 Because of this, we were unable to get individual-level assessment test
scores for the participants in this treatment, and are therefore unable to control for ability
with this treatment. We do, however, observe the distribution of reading state assessment
scores by gender, which allows us to compare the relative distribution of male and female
scores in our experiment with the distribution of scores on the assessment test.
    Regressions (3) and (4) in Table 5 present the results from the reading treatment. These
regressions, which do not control for ability, show that in the first period of competition,
males tend to perform 0.17 standard deviations lower than the typical female, and in later
rounds of competition, this male disadvantage is 0.19 standard deviations. The difference
between the first-round and later-round male advantage is highly insignificant (p-value =
0.91).9
    These results show that any gender differences in the reading treatment do not change
across periods of competition. They do not, however, rule out the possibility that there
exist persistent gender differences in response to reading competitions. To rule this out,
we compare the distribution of male and female normalized scores in the reading treatment
with the distribution of normalized scores from the reading section of the state assessment
tests for a sample of students for whom we do have data. In the noncompetitive sample, the
female advantage is slightly more pronounced, at 0.27, but we are unable to reject the null
hypothesis that both competitive and noncompetitive scores have the same mean (p-value
= 0.92).
    We find no evidence of any gender differences in response to competition when using
reading questions. Males consistently perform worse than females, and the performance gap
appears consistent with the male-female performance gap seen on the reading portion of state
assessment tests. Combined with the results from Section 4.3, this suggests that both the
design of the competition (e.g., whether it is a race), and the task (e.g., math versus reading
quizzes) affect whether there exist initial gender differences in response to competition.
   8
    There is very little difference in the school population compared to that used for the math treatments.
   9
    We can reject that the first round gender premium is the same as what we found in the math treatment
(p-value = 0.02). In unreported results, we controlled for reading ability using the student’s reading scores
in the other rounds of the competition, which will have the consistency problems we discussed in Section
3.2. Nevertheless, we again saw no significant difference between male performance in the first round and
male performance in later rounds (p-value = 0.70).




                                                     14
4.5    Repeat Treatment
The analysis above provides substantial evidence that the male competitive advantage de-
pends on the nature of the competition, and when it does appear, it vanishes almost im-
mediately. If once the male advantage vanishes it is gone forever, then there is little reason
to think that the initial advantage could have any substantial effect on long-run achieve-
ment. On the other hand, if the male advantage reappears at the beginning of every new
competition, then it may still help explain long-run achievement differences between males
and females in competitive environments. To test this, we return to four of the standard
treatment classrooms two weeks after first conducting the experiments and reran the same
experiment with new partner matching and new questions.
    Columns (5) and (6) in Table 5 provide the results for this repeat treatment. We see no
significant evidence of a gender difference in competition in any period. Although the first-
period male coefficient (i.e., 0.10) is positive, we cannot reject equality with zero (p-value =
0.610). Furthermore, it is less than half the value of the first-period male coefficient in any
of our race treatment regressions. For later periods, the male coefficient falls to 0.00. These
results are consistent with the male advantage not reappearing for at least a couple weeks
after the initial period of competition.
    We hesitate to push this conclusion too far, however, as we are also unable to reject equal-
ity between the first-round male coefficient in the repeat treatment and the same coefficient
in the initial race treatment (p-value = 0.29). We can’t reject, and it seems perfectly plausi-
ble, that there may be an attenuated gender gap in the first round of the repeat treatment.
Unfortunately it is difficult to pick up such fine gradations in experimental data. Future
research may provide either sufficient data or a more powerful statistical test for exploring
this particular effect.


4.6    OLS Analysis
Until now, the analysis presents the results from the IV analysis. We prefer the IV methodol-
ogy’s robustness to measurement error in our ability variable, as discussed in Section 3.2. We
also recognize that an OLS analysis is more straightforward. Table 6 provides the male coef-
ficients for the various regressions when we use OLS. The results are substantively unchanged
from the IV analysis above, although the unreported ability coefficients are all noticeably
lower, presumably due to the downward bias of measurement error.




                                              15
5      Discussion
In the first period of our math races, we identify a significant male advantage compared to
females of the same math ability, a result that is consistent with the literature. Our analysis,
however, did not stop there. We repeated the initial competitions multiple times, and ran
alternative treatments in which we changed the task and rules of competition. These addi-
tional rounds of competition and alternative treatments greatly improve our understanding
of gender differences in reaction to competition.
    The main findings of our analysis are as follows. Males perform significantly better than
females in the first period of math races, but the male advantage quickly disappears and
is not found in any subsequent period of competition. Some evidence suggests that males
may perform worse than females of similar ability in later periods. After a two-week break,
we find no evidence that the initial male advantage returns. Furthermore, the initial gender
difference only appears when we frame the competition as a race; it does not appear when
we tell participants that the competition is “not a race.” We also find no evidence of a
male advantage when the competitions involve reading rather than math questions. These
findings suggest that the existence of an initial male advantage depends crucially on the
design of the competition and the task at hand, and when the male advantage does exist it
does not persist beyond the initial period of competition.
    All of these results call into question the argument that the male advantage in reaction
to competition may drive long-run achievement differences in the workplace. Workplace
competitions are rarely perceived as races, and success usually depends on performance across
many periods—two aspects of competition that, according to our analysis, minimize the male
advantage. Gender differences in long-run career outcomes (Bertrand and Hallock (2001))
may still be driven by differences in taste for competition. If males become more excited
about the prospect of competition (or experience an initial increase in testosterone, etc.),
they are both more likely to choose to compete in the first place (Niederle and Vesterlund
(2007)), and will put in more effort at the beginning of competition before the excitement
of competition wears off.
    We recognize a number of questions that should be addressed by future research. For
example, although our focus on math competitions makes sense when looking to explain
career outcomes (as math ability has been linked to career success, e.g., Joensen and Nielsen
(2009)), we are uncertain whether the male advantage disappears as quickly in other settings
such as footraces.10 One may also ask whether an initial male advantage vanishes as quickly
  10
     It is possible that males perform better in the first period because they view the competition as a race,
but then their excitement subsides after the first period because they start to think of the competition as a
series of quizzes rather than a series of races. We maintain that our use of math competitions for the analysis


                                                      16
when there is more at stake (e.g., a promotion rather than a candy bar), or with participants
of other ages (e.g., professionals rather than students).
