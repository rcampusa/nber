To Borrow or Not to Borrow? An Analysis of University Leverage Decisions

                                             ABSTRACT

This paper investigates the decisions of universities to issue debt. We test whether the expected value
and uncertainty of a university’s nonfinancial income (the income generated by sources other than
its endowment) affect its leverage (the ratio of the value of an institution’s liabilities to the value of
its assets). We find that leverage is negatively related to both the expected value and the uncertainty
of nonfinancial income. On average, increasing the expected value of nonfinancial income by one
standard deviation decreases a university’s debt by about $5.1 million, while increasing the uncertainty
of nonfinancial income by one standard deviation decreases debt by about $2.7 million. This behavior
is consistent with the pecking order theory of capital structure, which posits that managers deplete
available internal funds before issuing debt. We also show that the leverage decisions of universities
have become less sensitive to expected nonfinancial income but more sensitive to its uncertainty since
the Great Recession.

Introduction

         According to Moody’s rating agency, university debt levels doubled from 2000 to

2011 (Martin 2012). As the amount of debt issued by universities has grown, so too have

concerns about their borrowing practices. The Moody’s study, for example, argues that

the “Law of More,” the collective movement by universities to build lavish facilities in

order to attract students, has driven this trend. Indeed, several commentators have

suggested that some schools have been borrowing so much that “bond investors have

grown wary of their debt” (Korn and Kuriloff 2015). A Forbes article finds fault with

debt for another reason, arguing that it is detrimental to the mission of higher education,

as public schools with higher debt levels are forced to raise tuition and to admit a greater

percentage of wealthy, out-of-state students (Freedman 2014).

         Not all the commentary on increased debt has been negative, however. The

University of Chicago borrowed nearly $3 billion between 2002 and 2013, but one

municipal fund manager saw nothing particularly wrong with it: “It’s an environment

where debt is relatively cheap for [the university] to issue, so I’m not sure it’s that much

of a negative … I don’t find it too alarming” (McDonald and Chappatta 2014). In this

light, increased debt is simply a rational response to low interest rates.

         Before making normative judgments regarding universities’ use of debt, it is

important to understand how universities decide whether and how much to borrow.

Despite concerns about universities’ borrowing practices, the determinants of the debt

decisions of universities are largely unexplored in the literature on the financing of higher

education. 1 This paper aims to fill that void.


1
    For an exception, see Hansmann (1990) who discusses universities’ use of debt in the context of their
    tax-exempt status. Additionally, Bowman (2002), Denison (2009), and Calabrese (2011) analyze capital

                                                                                                       1
        We view the problem through the lens of the rich literature on the capital structure

of for-profit enterprises. Two approaches dominate this literature – the static trade-off

and the pecking order theories. We argue that, with suitable modifications, the two

theories can be applied to universities, and that they generate empirically testable

predictions about how the expected value and uncertainty of a university’s nonfinancial

income (i.e., income from sources other than the university’s endowment, including

tuition, government funding, and private donations) affect its demand for debt. We use

panel data on a sample of 3,703 universities from 2003 to 2013 to test these models.

Because our data extend through 2013, we are able to examine whether the experience of

the Great Recession has affected universities’ approach to taking on debt.

        Section 2 provides background information comparing the financial decisions of

universities with those of for-profit corporations, a discussion of the leading theories of

capital structure, and a review of the pertinent empirical literature. In Section 3, we

describe the data and present summary statistics. Section 4 details the empirical

methodology, including how the expectation and uncertainty of university nonfinancial

income are calculated. Section 5 presents and discusses the findings. Our main results are

as follows: (1) Leverage – the ratio of total debt to total assets – is negatively related to

both the expected value and uncertainty of nonfinancial income. A one standard deviation

increase in expected income decreases the debt of a university with the average asset

value by $5.1 million. A one standard deviation increase in the uncertainty of

nonfinancial income decreases debt by $2.7 million. These findings are consistent with

the pecking order theory of capital structure. (2) Since the Great Recession, university


   structure for nonprofit organizations in general, and their datasets include some observations on
   universities.

                                                                                                       2
leverage decisions have become less sensitive to expectations of nonfinancial income but

more sensitive to uncertainty in these income flows. This is consistent with the notion

that universities have become more concerned with the possibility of financial distress.

(3) The leverage choices of public and private universities respond similarly to changes

in the expected value of nonfinancial income and its uncertainty. (4) Universities with

relatively small endowments are more sensitive than universities with larger endowments

to both the expected value and uncertainty of nonfinancial income. (5) All of these

findings are robust to the inclusion of various controls that have been included in

previous analyses of nonprofit leverage decisions. We conclude in Section 6 with a

summary and suggestions for future research.



2. Background and Literature Review

2.1. Corporate versus University Finance 2

         The term “capital structure” refers to an organization’s set of financing methods.

Three major sources of capital are available to for-profit firms: equity, debt, and retained

earnings. Because the theoretical literature on capital structure was originally developed

for corporations, we discuss the key differences between universities and for-profit firms

as they relate to each of these three sources of capital. 3

         Equity. Perhaps the most salient difference between universities’ and

corporations’ capital structures is that universities do not use equity at all, simply

because they cannot issue stock. Unlike corporations, universities do not have

2
    See Bowman (2002) for a more in-depth discussion of the differences in the finances of for-profit and
    nonprofit organizations.
3
    Although for-profit universities do exist, we omit them from our analysis because their capital structure
    decisions likely differ substantially from nonprofit universities. When we refer to “universities” as a
    group, we are referring only to public and private not-for-profit universities.

                                                                                                            3
shareholders (owners). The individuals responsible for operating the university (for

example, entering into contracts and even dissolving the university, activities performed

by private owners in for-profit firms) are its trustees. Since universities are not privately

owned, there is no way to sell partial ownership of the university in the form of equity.

         Debt. The main difference between universities and corporations with respect to

debt arises from the fact that universities enjoy tax-exempt status. That is, universities (1)

do not have to pay corporate income taxes 4 or taxes on the returns to their investments

and (2) can issue tax-exempt debt. Because lenders to universities do not have to pay

taxes on the interest they receive, universities can borrow at lower rates than taxable

entities. 5 Tax-exempt debt combined with the ability to generate tax-free returns on

resources stored in endowments creates the possibility of tax arbitrage – that is,

borrowing at low interest rates instead of paying for projects with available funds in order

to invest those funds at higher interest rates. 6 These considerations suggest that

universities would tend to take on more debt than for-profit firms, other things being the

same. However, one important benefit of corporate debt is less applicable to nonprofits.

Interest payments on debt are tax deductible, so debt service reduces corporate income

taxes, creating a “tax shield” for for-profit firms. Since universities do not pay tax on the

majority of their income, by definition, a tax shield is not much of a benefit for them.


4
    Even if an organization is considered tax-exempt, it still has to pay taxes on its unrelated business
    income. This is income received from a trade or business that is “not substantially related to the
    charitable, educational, or other purpose that is the basis of the organization’s exemption” (Internal
    Revenue Service, 2015).
5
    The law regarding the use of tax-exempt debt has varied over the years. Prior to 1986, all nonprofit
    (IRC code 501(c)(3)) organizations, including universities, could sell an unlimited amount of tax-
    exempt bonds. In 1986, Congress placed a $150 million cap on outstanding non-hospital tax-exempt
    bonds, but repealed this limitation in 1997. Because this study only covers years since 2003, tax-exempt
    financing is not limited at any time in the analysis sample.
6
    Gentry (2002) explores this type of tax arbitrage in a sample of nonprofit hospitals.

                                                                                                             4
         Retained earnings. A corporation’s profit is the difference between its revenues

and expenses. Profits can be distributed to shareholders as dividends or added to retained

earnings. Because universities do not have owners, the terms “profit” and “retained

earnings” are not meaningful. However, nonprofit organizations do generate substantial

amounts of money from their operations and investments. The difference is that, in order

to be legally considered a nonprofit entity and to attain tax-exempt status, nonprofits must

abide by a “nondistribution constraint” which mandates that this income stay within the

organization as a source of financing. In effect, from this standpoint, a nonprofit

organization functions like a for-profit firm that reinvests all of its profits into the

business.

         We define several terms to avoid confusion when it comes to distinguishing

between for-profit firms and universities. First, available funds are a university’s stock of

accumulated resources from positive net income in prior years. Available funds can be

used to fund new projects or pay off debt. In this sense, available funds are analogous to

retained earnings for corporations. Second, because there is no analogue to a university

endowment in the corporate world, we distinguish between income generated by the

investment of endowment assets and income generated by all other university operations.

The latter is referred to as nonfinancial income. Finally, the “profitability” of a

corporation is often defined as its net operating income divided by the value of its assets. 7

We call a similar measure for universities normalized nonfinancial income, which is the

university’s nonfinancial income for a given year divided by its assets at the beginning of

that year.


7
    See, for example, Titman and Wessels (1988) and Rajan and Zingales (1995).

                                                                                             5
           External support. There is an additional difference between universities and for-

profit firms that may affect capital structure. Although universities cannot access the

equity markets, they do have a source of income that is generally unavailable to for-profit

firms – funds from federal, state, or local governments, or from private donors. Such

support constitutes an average of 44 percent of nonfinancial income in our sample of

universities. 8

2.2. Theories of Capital Structure

           The two leading theories of capital structure are the static trade-off theory and the

pecking order theory. The static tradeoff theory posits that a firm’s leverage decision is

determined by optimally trading off the costs and benefits of debt finance, while the

pecking order theory argues that firms always prefer to use internal funding rather than

debt or equity. Empirical tests of the two theories have yielded mixed results so neither

one has gained universal acceptance. 9

           Because of the aforementioned institutional differences between corporations and

universities, much of this literature deals with issues not relevant to the capital structure

decision for universities (or, more generally, nonprofit organizations). 10 Thus, it is

helpful to reinterpret the two theories in the nonprofit context.




8
     Some authors (e.g., Wedig (1994)) draw parallels between donors and stockholders, in that both
     provide capital to an organization and both wield the power to influence certain decisions of an
     organization’s executives and managers. However, unlike stockholders, donors to nonprofits do not
     have a legal claim to the financial return to their contributions.
9
     See Harris and Raviv (1991) for a survey of the theoretical literature on corporate capital structure, and
      Parsons and Titman (2008) for a more recent overview of the empirical capital structure literature.
10
     For example, universities do not have to consider how their leverage should be affected by corporate
     income taxes (Graham 1996) or by equity market timing (Leary and Roberts 2005).

                                                                                                                  6
          Static trade-off theory. The static trade-off theory, developed to explain leverage

decisions for for-profit corporations, 11 suggests that managers choose an optimal level of

leverage by weighing the costs and benefits of debt. According to this approach, debt has

a number of benefits: It allows an organization to pursue investment opportunities beyond

what is feasible using retained earnings and cash flow; it can serve to reduce the firm’s

tax liability (because interest is deductible in the computation of taxable income); and it

can attenuate agency problems (Jensen 1986). However, as debt increases, so too does

the probability of financial distress. Borrowing generally imposes fixed, rigid payment

schedules. If a firm experiences a pronounced reduction in revenues, it may not have

enough funds to make debt payments. Furthermore, to the extent that lenders believe that

the risk of default rises with the amount of debt, the more debt that the business incurs,

the higher the interest rate it must pay. The optimal level of debt, then, balances off these

advantages and disadvantages.

          As Bowman (2002) and Calabrese (2011) point out, managers of nonprofit

organizations confront the same tradeoffs when it comes to the use of debt. Even the tax

shield benefit carries over, albeit to a lesser extent, because interest payments can be used

to reduce the tax on unrelated business income (Denison 2009). Hence, the predictions

about leverage decisions generated by the static tradeoff theory apply to nonprofits,

including universities, as well.

          Pecking order theory. The pecking order theory says that businesses finance

projects with internal funds before taking on debt, and with debt before issuing equity. 12

The reason is that informational asymmetries between the firm and investors regarding

11
     See Kraus and Litzenberger (1973) for the classic exposition of this theory.
12
     See Myers and Majluf (1984). Klein et al. (2002) provide a review of this literature.


                                                                                              7
the firm’s prospects lead investors to undervalue its debt and equity. The hypothesis

states that the relatively high costs of debt and equity dominate any potential benefits so

that a firm uses all of its retained earnings before seeking funds from the bond or equity

markets.

        Analogously, in this view a nonprofit organization prefers to finance new projects

internally with available funds, and issue debt only if it depletes its supply of available

funds. Bowman (2002) suggests another reason why nonprofits might want to avoid debt,

reputational concerns. A potential cost of debt for the managers of any organization is

the possibility that financial distress will tarnish their reputations or the reputations of

their organizations. Bowman argues that such reputational concerns are particularly

important for nonprofit organizations because of their reliance on funds from the

government and/or private benefactors. These donors might see financial distress as a

sign of mismanagement and consequently reduce future contributions.

        It follows that to the extent elevated income levels in a given year generate more

available funds, the organization’s demand for debt falls, other things being the same.

Furthermore, just as in the static trade-off model, the greater the financial risk of an

organization, the more averse it will be to using debt (Bowman 2002).

2.3. Empirical Tests of Capital Structure

        The two theories suggest several empirical predictions regarding the determinants

of leverage, as described by Fama and French (2002) in the for-profit context and

Bowman (2002) and Calabrese (2011) in the nonprofit context. Importantly, the theories

have opposite predictions with respect to the impact of expected nonfinancial income on

leverage, ceteris paribus. The static trade-off hypothesis implies a positive relationship



                                                                                               8
between normalized nonfinancial income and leverage. To the extent that a higher cash

flow reduces the likelihood of financial distress, lenders will be willing to accept lower

interest rates, reinforcing this positive effect. The pecking order hypothesis, in contrast,

implies that leverage will decline as nonfinancial income increases, other things being the

same. Given that the organization wants to use available funds before debt whenever

possible, increased income (leading to more available funds) reduces the demand for

debt.

          On the other hand, both theories have the same prediction when it comes to the

relationship between leverage and the uncertainty of a nonprofit’s income flows.

Increased uncertainty leads to a higher probability of financial distress, which increases

the costs of borrowing and leads to decreased leverage, other things being the same.

          Studies of the debt decisions of nonprofit organizations have used a variety of

proxies for the two key variables, income relative to assets and uncertainty in income

flows. Bacon (1992) and Calabrese (2011) represent the former as the percentage change

in total assets from the previous year. As pointed out by Bowman (2002), however, while

an increase in an organization’s assets could reflect an increase in its cash flow, it could

just as well reflect increased debt, leading to an endogeneity problem. Bowman instead

uses the average value of the ratio of a nonprofit’s net income to its assets over a four-

year period. However, this measure is problematic for two reasons. First, net income

includes endowment income. If certain variables affect leverage and endowment

investment strategies simultaneously, 13 investment income is endogenous to the leverage



13
     One variable that might affect both leverage and endowment strategies is the volatility of endowment
     income. Dimmock (2012) and Rosen and Sappington (2015) show that the volatility in university
     income affects the proportion of an endowment invested in alternative assets, which, in turn, affects the

                                                                                                             9
decision and should be excluded from the regression equation. Second, the four-year

average includes the contemporaneous value of income. Borrowing decisions likely are

made at the beginning of or throughout the course of a fiscal year, and income

information is not fully available until the end of the year. Therefore, a manager deciding

how much debt to take on in the coming fiscal year can only observe data from the past

and use them to develop expectations about income in the current year. In our empirical

analysis, then, we examine how expected normalized nonfinancial income of a university,

based only on information from prior years, affects its leverage ratio.

          The literature presents an even wider variety of measures for the income

uncertainty of a nonprofit organization. Following Chang and Tuckman (1994), several

studies, including Yan et al. (2009) and Calabrese (2011), construct a Hirschman-

Herfindahl Index measure of the diversification of the organization’s revenue sources,

including government funding, donations, program revenue, and investment income. 14

These papers argue that revenue diversification is the most controllable component of the

uncertainty of an organization’s revenues, making the diversification index a sensible

proxy for uncertainty.

          However, basic portfolio theory suggests that this approach is problematic. The

uncertainty of the portfolio of revenue sources depends not only on the proportion of

income coming from each source, but also on the variances and covariances of the

sources. To address this shortcoming, studies that include a diversification index



     size of the endowment (Lerner et al., 2008). At the same time, volatility also affects the leverage
     decision, as documented by Bowman (2002) and Bacon (1992).
                                                          1−∑4    2
                                                             𝑖=1 𝑅𝑖
14
     The formula for the diversification index is: 𝐷𝐼 =               , where 𝑅𝑖 is the fraction of total revenue
                                                            0.75
     generated by each of the four revenue sources.

sometimes control for the proportion of revenues from each source. 15 The idea is that a

higher proportion of income coming from government sources and program revenues

(such as tuition, in the case of universities) leads to increased leverage, as these sources

are relatively stable. In contrast, a high proportion of income from donations, which are

more volatile, results in lower leverage. However, any correlation between these

variables and leverage is open to alternative interpretations. Bowman (2002), Denison

(2009), and Fama and Jensen (1983), for example, argue that suppliers of external funds

might want nonprofit managers to be very risk averse regarding the use of debt, so a

negative sign on the proportions of income from governmental and private donations

might simply indicate that external agents influence the organization’s financial

decisions.

          Bacon (1992) and Bowman (2002) suggest an alternative proxy for financial

uncertainty – the variability in earnings as measured by the standard deviation of net

income. 16 Unlike a revenue diversification index, this measure implicitly takes into

account the covariances among income channels, providing a more complete measure of

an organization’s financial risk.However, as Bowman (2002) observes, a drawback of

using the standard deviation is that two very different income processes, one with steady

growth year after year and the other with alternating ups and downs, could have the same

standard deviation. 17 The organization with fluctuating income flows would likely be in


15
     For example, see Yan et al. (2009) and Calabrese (2011).
16
     This parallels the techniques generally used in the for-profit literature. For example, see Bradley et al.
     (1984) and Kale et al. (1991).
17
     This is the case because the standard deviation reflects variation from the mean. Suppose, for example,
     that income increases steadily each year of six consecutive years. Then income in the first three years
     will lie below the mean whereas income in the second three years will lie above the mean. A substantial
     standard deviation could result, even though income growth is entirely predictable in this setting.


                                                                                                              11
greater danger of financial distress, even though the standard deviation would classify

them as equivalent in this respect.

       Turning now to the results of previous empirical studies of capital structure for

nonprofit organizations, it appears that no consensus has been attained. Much of the

early literature focused on hospitals. Wedig et al.’s (1989) study, based on a sample of

investor-owned, government, and nonprofit hospitals, provides support for the static

trade-off theory. Bacon (1992) also analyzes a sample of nonprofit hospitals but comes to

the opposite conclusion, finding strong support for the pecking order theory. More

recently, researchers have analyzed datasets that pool different types of nonprofits

together, including in their samples hospitals, arts and cultural organizations, human

services organizations, and universities. Using the IRS’s Statistics of Income data,

Bowman (2002) finds evidence in support of the static trade-off theory with a positive

coefficient on his expected income variable and a negative coefficient on his uncertainty

variable. On the other hand, using data from the National Center for Charitable Statistics

to study the same wide range of organizations, Calabrese (2011) argues for the pecking

order theory on the basis of a finding that expected income has a negative coefficient in a

model of leverage decisions. Unlike earlier papers, Calabrese’s specification includes

organization fixed effects.

       The fact that different data sources (coupled with relatively minor methodological

differences) produce very different conclusions is discouraging, and suggests that pooling

together institutions from the entire nonprofit sector may not be the best approach. After

all, different types of nonprofits might have different objectives and constraints, and

hence exhibit different financial behaviors. This is one reason why we focus on the



                                                                                           12
higher education sector. Further, even with a sample consisting of only a single type of

nonprofit, care should be taken to allow for some heterogeneity with respect to capital

structure decisions. Hence, our empirical work explicitly allows leverage decisions to

vary by type of university.



3. Data

          Our data come from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System

(IPEDS), which provides a variety of information on a large set of colleges and

universities in the United States. It contains institutional characteristics (such as whether

the school is public or private and the highest degree offered) and financial data,

including detailed information on revenues, expenditures, endowments, liabilities and

assets.

          Although IPEDS has been collecting information from higher education

institutions continuously since 1987, university accounting practices have changed over

the years, and this has changed the information collected by IPEDS. In particular,

comparable values of two variables that are important in this paper, total assets and total

liabilities, are available for both private and public universities only since 2003. Our

analysis sample therefore begins in that year, and extends to 2013. 18 These data are more

recent than those used in previous studies, and allow us to examine how the financial

crisis and Great Recession of 2008-2009 impacted debt use.

          Unlike assets and liabilities, revenues and expenditures have been reported on a

consistent basis since 1987. This is helpful because, as explained below, we construct the

18
     Private not-for-profit institutions adopted FASB in 1997, and public institutions adopted GASB in
     2003. See Goldstein and Menditto (2005) for an overview of these accounting systems.

                                                                                                         13
expected value and uncertainty of nonfinancial income using autoregressions estimated

with up to six years of data. If income data began only in 2003, we would lose

observations from 2003-2009 for the estimation of these autoregressions. Instead, we are

able to use income data prior to 2003 to construct observations for 2003-2009, allowing

for a longer panel.

          The exact number of institutions in the dataset varies from year to year as new

schools are created or as schools cease to exist. However, this figure is quite stable over

time. In the 2010 fiscal year, the dataset included 1,750 public institutions, 1,855 private

not-for-profit institutions, and 2,668 private for-profit institutions. We exclude for-profit

schools from the analysis because as discussed above, for-profit organizations face

different considerations when making leverage decisions. Thus, when we refer to “private

institutions” below, we mean only private not-for-profit schools.

          To avoid undue influence by outliers, we drop observations that have a value of

leverage, expected nonfinancial income, or uncertainty (measured in a fashion described

below) in the top or bottom one percent of their respective distributions. 19 This leaves a

sample of 34,309 observations over 3,703 institutions from the years 2003-2013.

Summary statistics for the analysis sample are provided in Table 1. The first panel in the

table reports the proportion of public universities in the sample and the proportion of

schools offering each of the four primary types of degrees (doctoral, master’s, bachelor’s,

and associate’s). Previous research shows that these characteristics are significant

correlates of financial behavior (Lerner et al., 2008).

19
     Since the construction of these variables involves ratios, some observations with numbers close to zero
     in the denominator can become unreasonably large. Also, in a few cases, an institution’s nonfinancial
     income increased or decreased by extraordinary amounts in a short period of time. The Chronicle of
     Higher Education (2013) reports large private gifts that, in some cases, generated increases in
     nonfinancial income of more than 1000 percent in a single year.

                                                                                                        14
          The second panel in Table 1 presents total nonfinancial income and the

proportions derived from each of its primary components: government support, private

donations, and tuition. On average, universities receive 85 percent of nonfinancial income

from these three sources; the remaining 15 percent is derived from sources such as

auxiliary enterprises, hospital revenues, and independent operations. The large difference

between the mean ($127 million) and the median ($37 million) values of nonfinancial

income reflects the well-documented fact that resources across universities are highly

unequal (Desrochers and Wellman 2011).

          Finally, the third panel in Table 1 presents balance sheet data. Leverage is

displayed first and then followed by its numerator and denominator, total liabilities and

total assets. 20 Endowment value, which has been shown to be an important correlate of

the leverage decision (Bowman (2002)), is presented last. Summary statistics mask

considerable variation in these variables over time. Figure 1 shows how the average

values of both total liabilities and leverage change over the sample period. Even when

adjusted for inflation, the average amount of university debt has risen steadily since 2003

(only declining slightly in 2011). The graph of average leverage, which incorporates

movements in total asset value as well as liabilities, tells a somewhat different story.


20
     The National Center for Education Statistics defines these variables as follows: (1) “Total assets is the
     sum of the following amounts: cash, cash equivalents and temporary investments; receivables (net of
     allowance for uncollectible accounts); inventories, prepaid expenses, and deferred charges; amounts
     held by trustees for construction and debt service; long-term investments; plant, property, and
     equipment; and other assets.” (2) “Total liabilities is the sum the following amounts: accounts payable;
     deferred revenues and refundable advances; post-retirement and post-employment obligations; other
     accrued liabilities; annuity and life income obligations and other amounts held for the benefit of others;
     bonds, notes, and capital leases payable and other long-term debt, including current portion;
     government grants refundable under student loan programs; and other liabilities.” Further details are
     provided in FARM, the Financial Accounting and Reporting Manual.




                                                                                                            15
While leverage increased slightly from 2003-2007, it shot up dramatically in both 2008

and 2009, which reflects a combination of increased debt as well as declining asset values

associated with the financial crisis and the Great Recession. Average leverage then

declined and appears to have stabilized from 2011-2013, but at a higher level than in the

early and mid-2000s. The Great Recession also disrupted the rapid rise in endowment

values, as the average endowment value fell dramatically in 2009 but by 2013 had

recovered to near pre-crisis levels.



4. Econometric Strategy

       In this section we construct a model to estimate how the expected value and

uncertainty of nonfinancial income affect the leverage decisions of universities. The

theoretical considerations discussed above indicate that the expected value of

nonfinancial income and its uncertainty play key roles. Given that these two variables

are not observable to the econometrician, they must be constructed. This suggests a two-

step procedure that is quite common in the field of finance, although it has not been used

to study nonprofit organizations’ capital structure. First construct the expectation of

nonfinancial income and its uncertainty, and then use them as regressors in an equation

with leverage as the dependent variable. We now discuss these two steps in turn.

       Estimating the expected value and uncertainty of nonfinancial income. Following

Vissing-Jorgensen (2002), we decompose nonfinancial income into two components –

the “permanent” component, which follows a random walk with drift term 𝛼, and the

“transitory” component, which is a shock to permanent income in a given year. The

resulting income process can be modeled as follows:



                                                                                          16
                                     ln 𝑌𝑖𝑡 = 𝛼 + ln 𝑌𝑖,𝑡−1 + 𝛽𝑋𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡 .                           (1)

𝑌𝑖𝑡 in equation (1) is inflation-adjusted nonfinancial income for university 𝑖 in year 𝑡, 𝛼

is a parameter to be estimated, 𝜀𝑖𝑡 is a normally distributed and independent error term

that represents the transitory component of university income, 21 𝑋𝑖 is a vector of fixed

institutional characteristics, consisting of dichotomous variables indicating whether the

school is public or private and its degree-granting status (doctoral, master’s, bachelor’s,

or associate’s), and 𝛽 is the associated parameter vector. The 𝑋𝑖 variables allow for the

possibility that different types of institutions have different income processes. The key

qualitative findings are robust to including additional institutional characteristics in 𝑋𝑖

and to omitting 𝑋𝑖 entirely. Note that although this specification imposes a coefficient of

one on ln 𝑌𝑖,𝑡−1, the results are essentially unchanged when we estimate its value along

with the other coefficients.

          This model assumes that the only information managers have about the

nonfinancial income of a university is the inflation-adjusted value of these flows for all

past years. Some debt decisions might be made throughout the year as information on

contemporaneous income is collected and expectations are adjusted. However, the timing

of the arrival of this information is not available in the data, so we assume managers do

not rely upon realizations of current period nonfinancial income when determining the

extent of the university’s leverage.

          We also assume that university managers generate their expectations by looking

back at a window of a fixed number of years of income data, which captures the idea that

21
     The idea of modeling a shock as the residual in an equation is quite common in the literature and has
     been used in a variety of contexts. For example, the procedure is employed by Jurado et al. (2015) to
     study macroeconomic uncertainty, Blinder and Deaton (1985) to study how consumption varies with
     income, and Attanasio et al. (2015) to study family insurance issues.

                                                                                                             17
the income realizations of relatively recent years have the greatest impact on the

expectations of decision-makers. The selection of a window length involves a tradeoff: a

window that is too short will not provide sufficient observations to generate meaningful

parameter estimates, whereas a window that is too long will result in estimates based on

information that university financial officers likely do not consider very relevant to their

current decisions. We choose a window of six years, but our substantive results are robust

to the use of other reasonable window lengths. 22 In short, we estimate equation (1) with

data from years 𝑡 − 6 to 𝑡 − 1. 23

          With the parameter estimates of equation (1) in hand, we calculate the expected

value of the log of nonfinancial income for each university and each year given the prior

year’s income and characteristics of the university, and denote this value as Μ𝑖𝑡 . We also

compute the residuals (i.e., the difference between the actual value of the log of income

and its expectation) in each year for each university and calculate the variance of these

residuals (denoted 𝜐𝑖𝑡 ) over the six years used to estimate the model. It can be shown 24

that the expected value of nonfinancial income is:
                                                        𝜐𝑖𝑡
                                                  𝑒 Μ𝑖𝑡+ 2 .

          Following the convention used in analyses of both for-profit and not-for-profit

enterprises, we normalize the expected value of income by the institution’s assets at the

beginning of the period. Hence, our (normalized) measure of the expected value of

nonfinancial income, 𝜇𝑖𝑡 , is:
22
     Specifically, we also used window lengths of 5 years and 7 years, and the substantive results were not
     affected.
23
     With this algorithm, universities with fewer than six years of operating income data are excluded from
     the analysis, which is why the number of schools reported in the regressions differs from the number
     included in the IPEDS dataset.

where 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠𝑖𝑡 is university i’s total assets at the beginning of year t.

       Our measure of the uncertainty of nonfinancial income is the coefficient of

variation, defined as the standard deviation of a random variable divided by its mean. It is

a particularly useful measure when one wants to compare the dispersion of some variable

across different groups and the mean of the variable varies considerably across the

groups. As mentioned above, this is certainly the case for income flows across

universities. A Taylor series expansion indicates that, for any random variable Z, the

square of the coefficient of variation is approximately equal to the variance of the log of

Z. Therefore, the coefficient of variation of university i’s nonfinancial income in year t

is:

                                𝐶𝑉𝑖𝑡 = �𝑉𝑎𝑟(ln 𝑌𝑖𝑡 ) = �𝜐𝑖𝑡 .                           (3)

       The leverage decision. The next step is to incorporate the estimates of normalized

expected nonfinancial income and the coefficient of variation into a model of the

leverage decision. Such a model should account for the fact that universities may differ in

many dimensions, including their objective functions, their tolerance for risk, and the

institutional constraints under which they operate. The panel nature of the data allows us

to include university fixed effects to control for all such university characteristics that

remain constant over time. We also include time effects to account for factors that affect

the debt decisions of all universities in a given year, such as stock market performance,

government regulations, interest rates, and the macroeconomic environment. The

resulting baseline specification for the model of leverage decisions is:

                 𝐿𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝜇𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽2 𝐶𝑉𝑖𝑡 + 𝛾𝑡 + 𝛿𝑖 + 𝜔𝑖𝑡                      (4)

                                                                                              19
where 𝐿𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑖𝑡 is the ratio of total debt to total assets for university 𝑖 in year 𝑡, 𝛾𝑡

represents the time effects, 𝛿𝑖 represents the university fixed effects, and 𝜔𝑖𝑡 is a random

error.

         Because the expected nonfinancial income and coefficient of variation variables

used in equation (4) are constructed using a first stage regression, the OLS standard

errors will not be correct. Furthermore, the standard errors must be clustered to allow for

correlated errors within institutions. To deal with this issue, we employ the method of

clustered bootstrapping (Efron and Tibshirani 1986).

         Other than the two variables of primary interest, 𝜇𝑖𝑡 and 𝐶𝑉𝑖𝑡 , equation (4) has no

variables that vary both across time and across universities. Some of the econometric

specifications used in previous papers on nonprofit finance have such variables, so it is

useful to consider whether they should be included. For example, as discussed above,

some models include the sources of nonfinancial income. Another variable that varies

across time and universities is the value of the endowment. Its estimated coefficient in a

model of leverage could shed additional light on which of the two theories of capital

structure is more consistent with the data (Calabrese 2011). To see why, note that

universities make a certain percentage of their endowments available for spending in a

given year (see Brown et al. (2014)). The sums paid out from the endowment provide a

source of revenue that supplements a university’s nonfinancial income. Hence, to the

extent that the amount paid out from an endowment varies with its size, the impact of

endowment size should have the same directional impact as expected nonfinancial

income. Thus, an increase in the ratio of the value of the endowment to total assets would




                                                                                             20
increase leverage under the static trade-off theory and decrease leverage under the

pecking order theory.

          The problem is that decisions that affect the size of the endowment (such as asset

allocation and endowment payouts) are likely made simultaneously with leverage

decisions. Indeed, the sources of nonfinancial income could also be endogenous, because

the amount of money that donors (such as governments or alumni) are willing to put up

may depend on how much debt the institution has accumulated. 25 Nevertheless, to allow

comparisons with earlier studies, it is of some interest to see how these variables affect

leverage, and whether their inclusion affects our results with respect to the coefficients

on 𝜇𝑖𝑡 and 𝐶𝑉𝑖𝑡 . Hence, while recognizing that the results must be interpreted with

caution, we estimate a variant of equation (4) that is augmented with: (1) the ratio of the

value of the endowment to total university assets; and (2) the proportion of nonfinancial

income from each of three major sources – tuition, government funding, and private

donations. 26 This leads to the following model:

 𝐿𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝜇𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽2 𝐶𝑉𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽3 𝐸𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑤𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽4 𝐺𝑜𝑣𝑡𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑖𝑡

                     + 𝛽5 𝐷𝑜𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽6 𝑇𝑢𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑖𝑡 + 𝛾𝑡 + 𝛿𝑖 + 𝜔𝑖𝑡 .                             (5)

          We have discussed the expected signs on the various coefficients in equation (5)

earlier. For convenience, they can be summarized as follows:

      •   𝛽1 (+/–): The static trade-off theory predicts a positive sign on expected

          nonfinancial income, while the pecking order theory predicts a negative sign.



25
     An additional independent variable included in several papers is the total asset value of the organization
     (see Bowman (2002) and Calabrese (2011)). However, because asset values increase with debt by virtue
     of an accounting identity, this variable is mechanically endogenous, so we do not include it.
26
     As noted above, these three sources make up 85 percent of nonfinancial income, on average. A fourth
     category, consisting of all other nonfinancial income, is omitted to avoid multicollinearity.

                                                                                                           21
      •   𝛽2 (–): Both the static trade-off and pecking order models predict a negative sign

          on the uncertainty variable, as both suggest that a more unpredictable stream of

          nonfinancial income increases the likelihood of financial distress.

      •   𝛽3 (+/–): The static trade-off model predicts a positive sign on the endowment

          value relative to assets, as schools backed by large endowments may be able to

          secure debt at lower costs; the pecking order model predicts a negative sign

          because higher endowment payouts reduce the demand for debt.

      •   𝛽4 , 𝛽5 (–): According to Bowman (2002) and others, the government and private

          donors look askance at institutions that accumulate large amounts of debt. If so,

          this would tend to induce university decision makers to reduce leverage, other

          things being the same.

      •   𝛽6 (0): Incoming students are unlikely to care about the capital structure of a

          university. 27



5. Results

5.1. Basic Findings

          We first estimate the baseline specification, equation (4). The results are reported

in the first column of Table 2. The coefficient on 𝜇𝑖𝑡 is negative and statistically

significant, indicating that universities take on less debt when the expectation of

nonfinancial income relative to assets rises, ceteris paribus. This finding is consistent

with the pecking order theory of debt determination. The next entry in the column


27
     Note that to the extent revenue volatility varies inversely with the share of revenues from tuition
     (because tuition payments are relatively stable), this will be taken into account by the coefficient of
     variation.

                                                                                                               22
indicates that as 𝐶𝑉𝑖𝑡 increases, the amount of leverage decreases, which is consistent

with both the pecking order and static tradeoff theories. Hence, taken together, the

negative coefficients on both expected nonfinancial income and the coefficient of

variation provide support for the pecking order theory – universities choose not to take on

debt whenever they can use cash from available funds instead. 28

           To assess the quantitative implications of the coefficient estimates, we use the

coefficient on 𝜇𝑖𝑡 to simulate the effect of a one standard deviation increase in normalized

expected nonfinancial income. 29 This generates a decrease in the leverage ratio of 0.017.

While this effect appears small, the change in the dollar amount of debt taken on by the

university can be quite large. For a university that has the average value of total assets in

our sample, a 0.017 decrease in the leverage ratio equates to a reduction in debt of $5.1

million.

          An analogous exercise using the coefficient on 𝐶𝑉𝑖𝑡 indicates that a one standard

deviation increase in the coefficient of variation results in a decrease in the leverage ratio

of 0.0088. For a university with the average value of total assets, this implies a decrease

of $2.7 million of debt.

          The baseline specification implicitly assumes that the incremental effect of a

change in the expectation of nonfinancial income does not depend on the level of

28
     As noted above, the signs and significance of the coefficients in the baseline model are robust to a
     number of changes in the specification of the first-stage equation (equation (1)). When we do not
     enforce the assumption of a random walk, allowing the coefficient on lagged income to differ from one,
     the coefficient on 𝜇𝑖𝑡 is -0.047 (s.e. = 0.0099) and the coefficient on 𝐶𝑉𝑖𝑡 is -0.083 (s.e. = 0.0217).
     When we use a window of 5 years rather than 6, the coefficient on 𝜇𝑖𝑡 is -0.037 (s.e. = 0.0092) and the
     coefficient on 𝐶𝑉𝑖𝑡 is -0.055 (s.e. = 0.0149). When we use a window of 7 years, the coefficient on 𝜇𝑖𝑡 is
     -0.057 (s.e. = 0.0101) and the coefficient on 𝐶𝑉𝑖𝑡 is -0.089 (s.e. = 0.0244). When we omit the control
     vector of institutional characteristics, the coefficient on 𝜇𝑖𝑡 is -0.048 (s.e. = 0.0092) and the coefficient
     on 𝐶𝑉𝑖𝑡 is -0.080 (s.e. = 0.0221).
29
     For reference, the standard deviation of normalized expected nonfinancial income is 0.36. The standard
     deviation of the coefficient of variation is 0.11.

                                                                                                               23
uncertainty, and vice versa. Perhaps, however, when expected income rises so that the

likelihood of financial distress falls, then the incremental effect of more uncertainty

looms less large in the minds of financial administrators. Alternatively, when revenues

are highly unpredictable, university managers might be less responsive to changes in

expected nonfinancial income because greater fears of financial distress attenuate the

effects of an incremental increase in expected nonfinancial income.

       To allow for these possibilities, we add to the baseline specification the

interaction of the expectation and uncertainty of nonfinancial income, 𝜇𝑖𝑡 ∗ 𝐶𝑉𝑖𝑡 . The

results, presented in the second column of Table 2, indicate that the coefficients on

expected nonfinancial income and the coefficient of variation remain negative and

statistically significant, and the interaction term is positive and significant. Thus, when

either 𝜇𝑖𝑡 or 𝐶𝑉𝑖𝑡 increases, the impact of changes in the other variable on leverage

becomes smaller in absolute value, a finding that is consistent with the scenarios

described above.

       Columns (3) and (4) of the table indicate that the baseline findings are

qualitatively unchanged when the model is augmented with several variables that have

been used in previous papers. In particular, expected income and uncertainty both remain

negatively related to leverage, and their interaction remains positive. The point estimates

on 𝜇𝑖𝑡 and 𝐶𝑉𝑖𝑡 do change, however. Comparing the results in columns (1) and (3), the

absolute values of the negative effects of increased expected nonfinancial income and

increased uncertainty are greater and smaller, respectively. A one standard deviation

increase in 𝜇𝑖𝑡 now results in a decrease in debt of $10.0 million, while a one standard

deviation increase in 𝐶𝑉𝑖𝑡 results in a decrease in debt of $1.4 million.


                                                                                              24
        The coefficients of the other variables in the column are also of interest. The sign

on the ratio of endowment value to total assets is negative and statistically significant,

which is consistent with the pecking order model of leverage. Universities prefer to

finance projects using payouts from the endowment as a supplement to nonfinancial

income, rather than taking on debt.

        Turning now to the percentages of nonfinancial income generated by each of the

university’s three primary income sources (government funding, private donations, and

tuition), previous work has viewed these variables as proxies for the uncertainty of the

university’s revenues. In our model, however, such uncertainty is explicitly captured by

the 𝐶𝑉𝑖𝑡 variable. The significant, negative coefficients on the shares of revenue from

government funding and private donations, then, might be better viewed as reflecting the

external pressures that come with collecting money from these sources. As theorized by

Bowman (2002), Denison (2009), and Fama and Jensen (1983), both government and

private donors prefer to support nonprofit institutions that carry less debt, other things

being the same. This notion gains empirical support from Weisbrod et al.’s (2008)

finding that donations to universities increase with endowment size, as donors prefer to

give their money to institutions that appear fiscally responsible.

        Another observation relating to the augmented models in columns (3) and (4) is

that an increase in the share of nonfinancial revenue from tuition has no statistically

significant effect on leverage. This contrasts with Yan et al. (2009), who find a positive

and significant coefficient. They attribute this to the fact that tuition is a relatively stable

source of revenue and therefore reduces the risk of increasing debt, other things being the

same. Interestingly, when 𝜇𝑖𝑡 and 𝐶𝑉𝑖𝑡 are removed from the equation, the coefficient on



                                                                                              25
the share of revenues from tuition becomes positive and significant; that is, we are able to

replicate Yan et al.’s result. This suggests that because the 𝐶𝑉𝑖𝑡 variable accounts for the

stability of nonfinancial income, the share of tuition is left with no additional role to play

in the determination of leverage.

          As a reminder, while the results in columns (3) and (4) provide a basis for

comparisons to previous research, they must be regarding with caution. The regressors

that supplement 𝜇𝑖𝑡 and 𝐶𝑉𝑖𝑡 in the augmented model might be endogenous.

5.2. Impact of the Great Recession

          The financial crisis and subsequent Great Recession of 2008 affected universities

in many respects, including fundraising, hiring, enrollment, and financial aid. 30 It is

therefore of interest to determine if the Great Recession also changed how universities

make their leverage decisions, and in particular, if it made them more sensitive to risk. To

address this issue, we re-estimate equations (4) and (5) separately for the years prior to

2008 and for the years 2008 and after. 31 The findings are presented in Table 3. The first

two columns report the results when the baseline model is estimated using data from

before and after the financial crisis, respectively. The negative coefficient on expected

nonfinancial income before the recession is more than twice as large (in absolute value)

as its counterpart after the recession. Furthermore, the coefficient on 𝐶𝑉𝑖𝑡 prior to the

recession is not significant, but the corresponding coefficient after the recession is highly

significant and twice the size in absolute value. An F-test indicates that the two models


30
     See, for example, Turner (2015) on faculty labor markets, Long (2015) on student enrollment, and
     Bettinger and Williams (2015) on federal and state financial aid.
31
     The number of schools in the analysis sample is smaller in the period before the Great Recession than in
     the period after the Great Recession. This is because some schools did not begin contributing data to the
     IPEDS survey until the 2000’s, so they did not have the requisite 6 prior years of data available until the
     post-Recession period.

                                                                                                            26
are statistically different with a p-value less than 0.001. The same general findings hold

in the augmented models in columns (3) and (4). While the absolute value of the

coefficient on 𝐶𝑉𝑖𝑡 does not increase as dramatically after the Great Recession in the

augmented specification, one can still reject the hypothesis that the before- and after-

recession models are the same.

          These results are consistent with two related but distinct phenomena. In the period

leading up to the Great Recession, when university endowments were growing rapidly

and reliably (so it seemed), universities put a lot of faith in their expectations of future

income, and adjusted their leverage substantially along the lines suggested by the pecking

order theory. Specifically, the negative sign on expected nonfinancial income implies that

universities anticipating high earnings paid off debt and trusted they would receive

sufficient revenues to cover new projects. At the same time, though, the relatively small

(in absolute value) coefficient on the coefficient of variation indicates that universities

were not very risk averse in the sense that they did not respond much to changes in the

uncertainty of their nonfinancial income.

          In contrast, after the crisis of 2008, schools adjusted their leverage less on the

basis of changes in expected nonfinancial income, possibly due to a decreased trust in

earnings predictions after the shock of the financial crisis. At the same time, universities

became much more sensitive to the uncertainty of their revenues. We conjecture that the

deleterious consequences of possible negative shocks to (say) alumni donations and

government grants became more salient to endowment managers after the Great

Recession when news of struggling universities swept through the country. 32 This


32
     For example, Antioch College nearly had to shut down in 2008 due to financial distress (Lerner, 2008).

                                                                                                        27
translated into a greater reduction in leverage in response to increases in the uncertainty

of nonfinancial income, other things being the same. In this context, it is important to

recall that our model includes time effects. Hence, one cannot attribute our findings with

respect to the coefficients on 𝜇𝑖𝑡 and 𝐶𝑉𝑖𝑡 to (say) general credit tightening or any other

aspects of the macroeconomic environment that would tend to lead to reductions in debt.

5.3. Alternative Specifications

          By using the entire sample of universities to estimate the various models, we have

implicitly assumed that every type of school responds to the expected value and

uncertainty of nonfinancial income in the same way. While the inclusion of university

fixed effects allows each individual institution’s leverage to vary, it does not allow for the

possibility of different responses to changes in 𝜇𝑖𝑡 and 𝐶𝑉𝑖𝑡 . Given that different types of

institutions exhibit different spending and budgeting patterns (Lowry 2004), it seems

reasonable that decisions about leverage might differ across types of universities as well.

To explore this possibility, we estimate equations (4) and (5) separately for various

subgroups of the sample.

          Public vs. private. The first characteristic is whether the university is public or

private. The distinction is potentially interesting because leverage decisions appear to be

made quite differently by public and private institutions. While both types of schools

benefit from tax-exempt debt, public universities require state government approval to do

so, although the degree of state involvement varies across states and depends on the

project that the institution is seeking to finance (Kiley 2012). 33 The reason for relatively

strict government oversight of public universities’ leverage decisions likely relates to the

33
     The university fixed effects in our model account for any unchanging differences in government
     policies across states that affect leverage decisions.

                                                                                                      28
close ties between a state university and the state government itself. Some bonds issued

by public schools are issued by the state on behalf of the school, so that bond-rating

agencies (like Moody’s) include the debt as part of the state’s overall debt. Furthermore,

even if debt is issued by a public university without government assistance, some bonds

“carry an obligation that means that if the university were to fail, the state would pay off

the bonds” (Kiley 2012). A reasonable conjecture is that more limited internal control

over leverage decisions would affect how public schools respond to the expected value

and uncertainty in nonfinancial income. More specifically, one might predict that because

of the higher degree of government concern about their debt behavior, the coefficient on

𝐶𝑉𝑖𝑡 would be larger in absolute value for public than for private universities.

        The results when the basic model is estimated separately for public and private

institutions are reported in columns (1) and (2) of Table 4, respectively. A glance at the

coefficients on 𝜇𝑖𝑡 and 𝐶𝑉𝑖𝑡 across the columns suggests that the point estimate on 𝐶𝑉𝑖𝑡 is

larger in absolute value for public than private universities. However, an F-test indicates

that the public and private estimates are not statistically discernible from each other (p =

.264). For the augmented specification, the models are significantly different, but that

difference is driven by the right hand side variables other than 𝜇𝑖𝑡 and 𝐶𝑉𝑖𝑡 . In short,

while the difference in the point estimates is intriguing, the conjecture that public and

private schools differ systematically in the way they react to changes in the expected

value and uncertainty of nonfinancial income is not supported by the data. As an aside,

note that both types of universities exhibit behavior consistent with the pecking order

theory, indicating that the results in support of this approach in Table 2 are not driven by

a single sector.


                                                                                            29
          Size of endowment. We next examine whether schools with relatively large

endowments respond to nonfinancial income differently than schools with smaller

endowments. For these purposes, we divide the sample into two groups based on whether

the value of their endowment in 2010 was above or below the median of those included

in the baseline regression (which was about $25 million). Given that the size of the

endowment may be endogenous to the leverage decision and stratifying on an

endogenous variable can lead to inconsistent estimates, these results must be viewed with

caution. Still, it is interesting to see what tendencies emerge.

          The results are presented in Table 5. In the baseline specification, the coefficients

on the expected value and the coefficient of variation of nonfinancial income have the

expected signs for both subsamples, but are substantially larger in absolute value and

statistical significance for the smaller endowments. 34 That is, universities with relatively

small endowments are more sensitive to nonfinancial income flows. This is reasonable

because the nonfinancial income of a university with a large endowment is likely

supplemented with substantial endowment income, making the expectation of

nonfinancial income less important in the leverage decision. Furthermore, a given

increase in the coefficient of variation puts a university backed by a large endowment in

less danger of financial distress than a university with a small endowment. Put another

way, universities with substantial endowments can afford to be less sensitive to

nonfinancial income streams, leading to smaller (in absolute value) effects of increased

uncertainty on leverage decisions.




34
     An F-test rejects the hypothesis that the two sets of coefficients are equal (p < 0.001).

                                                                                                 30
       Given the skewness in the distribution of endowments across universities, the

above-the-median group includes an enormous range of values, from about $25 million

to Harvard’s $28 billion. We investigated whether the results from Table 5 continue to

hold when the cutoff for classification as a relatively large endowment is higher, so that

the set of universities in it is somewhat more homogeneous. When we re-estimated the

model with a cutoff of $100 million, the point estimates were quite similar to those in

Table 5, but the coefficients were estimated imprecisely for the large-endowment sample,

presumably because it was substantially smaller than the sample used to estimate the

counterpart in Table 5.



6. Conclusions

       One author has noted, “Understanding the financing decisions made by nonprofits

helps us understand not only their capital choices, but also how nonprofits can provide

the maximum sustainable provision of goods and services” (Calabrese 2011). This

observation is particularly relevant to higher education. Universities face a perennial

tradeoff between providing benefits to current stakeholders (students, faculty,

administrators, and staff) and preserving the institution’s resources for future generations.

A university’s debt policy is one important component of the solution to this complicated

intertemporal choice problem. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to analyze

econometrically the determinants of universities’ leverage choices. Our analysis focuses

on whether either of the leading theories of corporate capital structure can help explain

universities’ borrowing decisions. The answer hinges on how universities respond to




                                                                                            31
changes in the expected value and uncertainty of their nonfinancial income flows (such as

tuition, government grants, and alumni donations).

       To investigate this issue, we analyze panel data on the leverage decisions of 3,703

public and private not-for-profit universities from the years 2003 to 2013. Our findings

support the so-called pecking order theory of capital structure, which posits that

universities prefer to finance projects using available funds rather than debt whenever

possible. In our preferred specification, a one standard deviation increase in normalized

expected nonfinancial income results in a decrease in debt of $5.1 million for a university

with the average asset value, while a one standard deviation increase in the uncertainty of

nonfinancial income (measured by the coefficient of variation) is associated with a $2.7

million decrease in debt. These findings are robust to the incorporation of various

variables that have been included in previous research on nonprofit capital structure.

       We also find that the Great Recession seems to have structurally changed how

universities’ leverage decisions respond to changes in their economic environment. Since

the recession, universities’ leverage decisions have become more sensitive to the

uncertainty associated with nonfinancial income and less sensitive to its expected value.

This behavior may have arisen because the financial crisis and ensuing recession made

university decision-makers less confident in their projections of nonfinancial income and

more aware of how downturns in their revenues can lead to financial distress.

       Finally, while there is some heterogeneity across institutions in how leverage

decisions are affected by various factors, especially between universities with small and

large endowments, the point estimates on the key coefficients consistently lend support to

the pecking order theory. Particularly noteworthy is our finding that, despite the



                                                                                           32
apparently different institutional structures that govern private and public universities’

financial decision making, they respond similarly to changes in the expected value and

uncertainty of nonfinancial income. Thus, our result that universities’ leverage decisions

are consistent with the pecking order theory is not driven by any one type of institution.

While it would be incautious to use these results to draw any inferences about the

determinants of capital structure in for-profit organizations, it is interesting to note that,

as Smith (2010) points out, nonprofits are ideally suited for empirically testing theories of

capital structure because their financial mechanisms are, in many ways, simpler than

those of for-profit firms.

           Several issues remain to be explored in future research. For example, our model

does not account for the possibility that universities issue debt for purposes of tax

arbitrage. 35 A promising way to explore this issue would be to take advantage of the

regulatory changes in the cap on tax-exempt debt enacted in 1986 and 1997, a strategy

that was not open to us because our analysis sample begins in 2003. In addition, as time

moves on and the Great Recession fades from the minds of university managers, it would

be interesting to examine whether the manner in which leverage decisions are made

reverts to its pre-2008 mode. .

   The first panel shows the distribution of universities in the sample by institution type
 and the four largest categories of degree type. The calculations in this panel are not
 weighted by the number of observations in the analysis sample. The second panel shows
 information relating to flows of income from various sources, computed over all
 observations in the analysis sample. The third panel reports balance sheet data for
 universities computed across all observations in the analysis sample. All dollar figures
 are in millions of 2010 dollars; the adjustment is made using the Higher Education Price
 Index.

  This table shows the estimates of the baseline model of the university leverage decision
estimated separately for public (column 1) and private (column 2) universities. The
estimates of the model augmented with additional controls are presented in columns 3
and 4. 𝜇𝑖𝑡 is the university’s forecast of nonfinancial income normalized by the value of
the university’s assets, as estimated by equation (2). 𝐶𝑉𝑖𝑡 is the coefficient of variation of
nonfinancial income estimated by equation (3). Clustered and bootstrapped standard
errors are in parentheses. Significance levels are indicated by: *10%, **5%, ***1% level.
