     Investment Incentives and the Discounting of Depreciation Allowances




                                  ABSTRACT




     This paper examines the discounting of depreciation allowances both

theoretically and empirically. Economic theory suggests that depreciation tax

shields should be discounted at the after tax riskless rates. However, a

survey of 200 major corporations indicates that they employ much higher

discount rates to depreciation allowances. Typical discount rates are in the

15 percent range. This finding suggests that "frontloaded" incentives like

the ITC provide maximal stimulus to corporate investment.

      The importance of depreciation and investment tax credit provisions in

 determining the level and composition of investment is widely recognized.

 Economists have long understood that the present value of depreciation tax

 shields along with the investment tax credit determines the effective purchase

price of new capital goods, which in turn determines the cost of capital.

Measures of the cost of capital are widely used in evaluating the likely

effect of proposed tax reforms on the total level of investment and in

assessing the distortions across capital goods caused by tax rules.

     The cost of capital depends on the present value of depreciation

allowances permitted by the tax system. This raises the question of what

discount rate should be used in calculating this present value and
                                                                     determining
the cost of capital.   The choice of a discount rate is of considerable

importance in assessing investment incentives. For example, the much

discussed adverse effect of inflation in conjunction with historic cost

depreciation on investment results from the increased discount rate that must

be applied to future nominal depreciation allowances. At a zero discount rate

all depreciation schedules which permitted assets to be fully depreciated

would be equivalent. It is only because of discounting that depreciation

schedules affect investment decisions, and their effects depend critically on

the assumed discount rate.

     Tax reform proposals often change the extent to which depreciation tax

benefits are "backloaded". For example, the proposal of Auerbach and

Jorgenson (1981) would have given firms all of their depreciation benefits in

the year that invest——ts were made. On the other hand, the recent p":rosal
                                     —2-


of the President (1985) stretches out the tax benefits associated with

investment outlays by indexing depreciation allowances and abolishing the

investment tax credit. A comparison of either of these proposals with

current law will depend critically on the discount rate applied to future tax

benefits in computing the cost of capital.

     Despite its importance, the choice of an appropriate discount rate for

depreciation allowances has received relatively little attention from tax

analysts. This paper examines both theoretically and empirically the

discounting of depreciation allowances and its implications for tax policy.

conclude that economic theory suggests that a very low and possibly negative

real discount rate is appropriate for calculating the present value of future

tax benefits. But empirical evidence from a survey of 200 major corporations

suggests that most companies in fact use very high real discount rates for

prospective depreciation allowances. This conflict makes the analysis of

alternative tax policies difficult. It surely suggests that there is little

basis for confidence in tax policy assessments based on specific assumed

discount rates which are constant across companies.

     The paper is organized as follows. Section 1 argues that given the risk

characteristic of depreciation tax shields, a very low or negative real

discount rate should be applied. Section 2 reports survey results on the

actual capital budgeting practice of firms and discusses possible reasons for

the apparent conflict between the recommendation of theory and firms' reported

behavior. Section 3 concludes the paper by discussing the implications of the

analysis for the assessment of alternative tax policies.

 I.   HOW SHOULD DEPRECIATION ALLOWANCES BE DISCOUNTED?


      This paper begins by reviewing the theory of capital budgetting and its

application to the discounting of depreciation allowances. The theory has

clear implications. Because prospective depreciation allowances are very

nearly riskiess, they are more valuable than other prospective sources of cash

flow. The appropriate discount rate for safe cash flows like the stream of

future depreciation deductions is lower than the rates applied to risky

physical investments. An argument is made that the appropriate discount rate

for depreciation deductions is the same rate applied to the after-tax coupon

payments on a safe bond. The present value of depreciation deductions so

computed can then be used in assessing potential investment projects. At

current levels of inflation and interest rates, it appears that only a

negligible real interest rate is appropriate for assessing alternative tax

policies.

      In theory (and in practice as demonstrated below), firms decide whether

or not to undertake investments by computing the present value of the net cash

flows they generate, using a discount rate corresponding to their cost of

funds.1 In a frictionless world of certainty, this process is completely

straightforward. There is only one available rate of return and firms invest

to the point where the marginal project earns just this rate of return. Or put

more precisely, the net present value of the marginal project evaluated at the

required rate of return is zero.

      Once the possibility that a project is risky is recognized the problem of

capital budgeting becomes much more difficult.   The theoretically

appropriate procedure is to find the certainty equivalent of each period's
                                     -4—


cash flow and then to discount the certainty equivalents at the return pa-id

by riskiess assets. In reality it is difficult to assess certainty

equivalents because the certainty equivalent of the cash flow payable in a

given period generally depends on the distribution of cash flows in

preceding and subsequent periods. Hence the normal procedure is to use a

"risk adjusted discount rate" appropriate to the project under consideration.

This rate in general will depend on the covariance of its returns with

aggregate returns in the economy. In the special case where a given

project's returns will mirror the returns of the entire firm, it is often

suggested that the appropriate discount rate be inferred from the firm's stock

market beta.

     A fundamental principle in finance is that of superposition. The

valuation of a stream of cash flows is the same regardless of how it is broken

up into components. This insight makes it clear how depreciation allowances

should be treated at least to a first approximation. Consider an arbitrary

investment project. The project will after an initial outlay generate a

stream of uncertain future operating profits which will then be taxed. It

will also generate a stream of future depreciation deductions which can be

subtracted from the firm's income to reduce its tax liabilities. These two

streams can be valued separately for analytic purposes. The valuation of the

profit stream is difficult absent a satisfactory way to gauge its riskiness.

But the valuation of future depreciation tax shields is much easier since they

are close to being riskless.2 They therefore should be evaluated by

discounting at a riskiess rate. Since depreciation tax shields represent

after tax cash flows, they should be discounted at an after tax rate of
                                      —5—


return. Their present value can then be added to the present value of the

profit stream evaluated at an appropriate risk adjusted discount rate to

evaluate the total return on an asset.

     The same conclusion may be reached using an arbitrage argument as in

Ruback (1985). Consider a set of prospective depreciation deductions which a

firm is entitled to utilize. Imagine that the firm instead possesses a

portfolio of treasury bills designed so that the after tax coupon payments in

each period equal exactly the value of the tax deductions. It should be

obvious that the firm has an equally valuable asset in either case. It

follows that the appropriate discount rate for valuing depreciation deductions

is the same as that for the treasury bill portfolio --   the after tax nominal
interest rate on safe assets. Note that the after-tax nominal interest rate

is likely to be much lower than the appropriate discount rate for a project's

operating cash flows.

     At present nominal interest rates on safe assets are less than ten

percent. With a forty six percent corporate tax rate, it follows that

the appropriate discount rate for future depreciation allowances is no more

than a five percent nominal rate. This means a real rate very close to zero,

contrary to the four percent real rate assumed in many calculations of the

effects of tax incentives.

     The assumption that prospective depreciation deductions represent a

riskiess asset has been maintained so far.   In fact future depreciation

deductions are subject to some risks. Depreciation deductions will be useless

for firms that make losses and become nontaxabie and are unable to make use of

carryback and carryforward provisions. The results of Auerbach and Poterba
                                     -6-


(1986) suggest that this is not an important factor for most large firms.

There is also the possibility of changes in tax rules. Since depreciation

deductions represent a hedge against changes in tax rates, this source of

uncertainty may drive the appropriate discount rate down rather than up.

Finally there is always the possibility that the, depreciation rules will be

changed with respect to assets already in place. This has never occurred in

the United States. On balance, it seems fair to conclude that depreciation

tax shields represent an essentially riskless asset.

     The arguments made so far indicate that firms should separately discount

at different rates expected operating profits and depreciation deductions. It

might be thought that firms could use a common discount rate for all the

components of cash flow on a given project that reflected their average degree

of riskiness in some way. But this is not correct because there is no way to

know how much weight to give each component of cash flow until its value is

determined which in turn requires the choice of a discount rate. Even if an

appropriate rate could be found, it would vary across projects depending on

the value of prospective depreciation deductions. Moreover, a weighted

average rate is unlikely to be varied when tax rules changes and alter the

share of a project's value represented by depreciation tax shields.

     Before turning to an examination of tax policies, the next section reports

evidence on firms' actual capital budgeting practices. They do not in

general conform to those recommended in this section.

 II. HOW ARE DEPRECIATION DEDUCTIONS DISCOUNTED?


      In order to learn how depreciation deductions are discounted by actual

 major corporations in making their investment decisions, a brief questionnaire

 was sent to the chief financial officers of the top 200 corporation5 in the

 Fortune 500. A copy of the questionnaire and covering letter a-e provided as

 an appendix to this paper. Usable replies were received f'om 95 corporations.

 No effort was made to raise the response rate by following up on the initial

mailing but there is little reason to suspect systematic differences in

capital budgeting procedures between responding and nonresponding firms.

The questionnaire was designed to find out whether capital budgeting

procedures embodied the principles suggested in the preceding section and to

find out what discount rates firms actually apply to depreciation deductions.

     The survey results are reported in Table 1. As the table indicates, the

vast majority of corporate respondents stated that they had capital budgeting

procedures and that these procedures were of "considerable" but not

"overriding" importance in corporate investment decisions. Only 7 percent of

the companies responding indicated that they discounted different components

of cash flow on a given project at different rates, and even several of these

companies did not distinguish operating profits and depreciation allowances.

Many of the responding companies indicated that they dealt with risk issues by

discounting projects emanating from different divisions or locations at

different rates, but that they discounted all the cash flows from a given

project at the same rate. It is clear that the practice of separately

discounting safe and unsafe componet.. of a project's return as suggested by

theory is a rarity in American industry.

     The lower part of the table indicates the distribution of the rates used

by companies to discount depreciation allowances. In most cases the figure

refers to the common nominal discount rate applied to all cash flows. The

reported discount rates for depreciation allowances were surprisingly high

with a median of 15 percent and a mean of seventeen percent --   far   in excess

of the after tax nominal interest rate. Given that depreciation tax shields

have very similar risk characteristics across firms, it is also noteworthy

that the rate at which they are discounted varies widely. The discount rates

reported by firms varied from 8 to 30 percent. This variability is almost

certainly the result of firms applying a common discount rate to all cash

flows.

     It is not easy to account for the level and variability of depreciation

discount rates. One possibility is that managers do not understand the

financial theory outlined in the preceding section or find it too complex to

implement. Another possibility is that shareowners represent the locus of

irrationality. If they apply a common discount rate to all components of cash

flow, value-maximizing managers will do so as well. It is also conceivable

that some of the variations in discount rates across firms result from

different conceptual definitions of the required rate of return.

     Before turning in the next section to the implications of these results

for tax policy, there is an important methodological question to be

addressed.3 Economists continue to assume that consumers maximize utility

even though it is clear that they never actually solve explicit optimization

problems and indeed would reject the idea that they are maximizing anything.
                                       -.9-



Firms rarely admit to knowing their marginal costs yet economists frequently

assume they equate price to marginal cost. The reason is the power of "as if"

modeling. There is a great deal of evidence that firms and consumers behave

"as if" they were maximizing profits or utility functions, even if they do not

do so consciously. Can a similar point be made with respect to evidence that

firms use inappropriate discount rates in making investment decisions?

     In a case like the discounting of depreciation allowances,the usual

arguments for "as if" reasoning do not seem compelling. Evolutionary

pressures against firms who do not optimize are likely to be weak. And the

linkages between what managers say they are doing and what they actually do

seem reasonably straightforward. Capital budgeting is a tool developed to

help managers make more rational investment decisions than their unaided

intuitions would permit. When it yields the "wrong" answer it seems

excessively Panglossian to assert that managers are unconsciously doing what

is right anyway. The next section therefore focuses on the implications of

these survey results for tax reform.



III. TAX POLICY IMPLICATIONS


    This section treats two aspects of the relationship between the

discounting of depreciation allowances and tax policy. First, I illustrate

the sensitivity of judgments about the effects of alternative tax policies on

incentives to the discount rate applied to future depreciation allowances.

Second, I argue that the high and variable depreciation discount rates used by

firms may themselv- reate important distortions, which the tax st. ture may
                                      —10-


 either mitigate or exacerbate.

      Table 2 presents estimates of the sum of the present value of

 depreciation allowances and the deduction value of the investment tax credit

 under current tax law, the President's proposal of May 1985 and the House of

Representatives' 1985 tax bill using alternative discount rates for

depreciation. The possibility of churning assets discussed by Gordon, Hines

and Summers (1986) is ignored.

     Calculations indicate that the effects of alternative tax rules are quite

sensitive to the assumed discount rate for depreciation allowances. At the

theoretically appropriate zero real discount rate only the House bill is less

generous than a policy of immediate expensing of investment outlays. Current

law provides a substantial subsidy to the purchase of new equipment because of

the availability of the investment tax credit. On the other hand, with a 10

percent real discount rate applied to depreciation allowance as the survey

results suggest all three tax laws provide benefits significantly less

generous than expensing. Especially for long lived equipment in asset class

IV, both the Treasury bill and the House proposal would lead to a substantial

increase in the effective purchase price. It is interesting to notice that

while the President's proposal is more generous at a zero discount rate, it

appears less generous at a 10 percent discount rate.

     The choice of a discount rate is especially important in evaluating the

incentives provided for long lived structures investments. At a zero discount

rate the President's proposal provides far more incentives to structures

investment than does current law. On the other hand, at a 10 percent rate

current law is much more generous than the President's proposal. In both

cases the House bill is intermediate between current law and the President's

proposal.

     The fact that firms use very high discount rates in evaluating projects

suggests that the investment tax credit is likely to be a very potent tax

incentive per dollar of government revenue foregone. The government will

presumably want to trade off tax revenue at present and in the future using

its borrowing rate.   If firms discount future tax benefits a rate higher than

the government borrowing rate, tax incentives can be enhanced with no increase

in the government's permanent cost by restructuring tax incentives to move the

benefits forward, without changing the present value of the revenue foregone.

The investment tax credit is frontloaded in this way. Still greater

frontloading of tax incentives is possible through accelerating depreciation

allowances, since this policy keeps the sum of the deductions that can be

taken on an investment constant while increasing their present value. On the

other hand, indexation of depreciation allowances tends to increase the

duration of tax benefits.

     The fact that firms use widely varying and inappropriate discount rates

f or depreciation allowances suggests that patterns of investment may be very

substantially distorted in ways not considered in standard analyses of the

effects of tax incentives. Certainly the returns demanded on marginal

projects vary by much more across firms than do conventional measures of the

cost of capital.

     The reasons for these patterns are a potential subject for future

research. One possible clue is that corporations and individuals seem to

apply very different discount rates to depreciation allowances. The frequency
                                     —12—


with which individuals churn structures suggest that they apply a much lower

(and more appropriate) discount rate than do corporations. This raises the

possibility that agency' issues may help to explain observed patterns of

corporate capital budgetting. If so they may have an important bearing on the

linkage between tax policies and investment decisions.

Dear _______

     As part of its ongoing program of research on the economics of capital

formation, the National Bureau of Economic Research is studying the effects of

proposed reforms in the investment tax credit and tax depreciation schedules.

The effects of alternative proposals depend critically on how taxes are

factored into companies' capital budgeting procedures. I am therefore

attempting to systematically gather information on major corporations' capital

budgeting techniques.

     I would be very grateful if you could fill in the enclosed questionnaire

regarding your company's capital budgeting procedure, and return it in the

enclosed envelope. Information identifying individual companies will not be

presented in any of our research reports.   I will of course furnish you with

the results of the study when it is completed.

     Thank you for your consideration.

                                            Sincerely,
