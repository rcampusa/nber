          The process of capital accumulation plays a central role in the growth

of every economy. As a consequence, capital accumulation has been a major focus

of economic theory and of empirical research throughout the history of modern

economic analysis. In recent decades, the rate and form of capital accumula-

tion has been substantially influenced by prevailing systems of taxation. The

papers in this volume1   analyze   the ways in which capital taxation alters the pro-

cess of capital accumulation and affects the rewards to capital and labor.

          The emphasis in these studies is on the behavioral response of house-

holds and businesses to changes in tax rules. The first section deals with the

overall rate of saving and analyzes the separate effects of taxes on personal

saving and on corporate saving as well as the interaction between the two types

of saving. The papers in the second section examine the effect of tax rules on

the composition of household portfolios and on the process of portfolio adjust-

ment. In the third section, I turn to corporate investment in plant and equip-

ment and in inventories. The studies in these three sections focus on the indi-

vidual components of the capital accumulation process rather than on the process

as a whole. In contrast, the fourth section presents general equilibrium analy-

ses that look at the system as a whole in order to determine who bears the taxes

levied on capital and capital income. The studies in this section differ from

earlier treatments in the literature by emphasizing a growing economy and port-

folio diversification.


1This paper is an introductory chapter to a book entitled Capital Taxation
 that brings together 22 of my papers written between 1965 and 1981. A list of
 papers and their original publication information is presented as an appendix to
 this paper. Because much of the research in the volume predates my NBER
 association, the volume will not be published by the NBER but by Harvard
 University Press.

          A common theme throughout these chapters is that tax rules have a

substantial effect on economic decisions. Both the theoretical analyses and the

empirical research in the present volume support this theme. In contrast, much

of the writing on taxation during the period since World War II implicitly

assumed or explicitly asserted that the relative price changes implied by dif-

ferent types of capital taxation would have little or no impact on capital for-

mation. The view that taxes do not influence capital formation followed from a

general Keynesian presumption that the responses of individuals and businesses

to price changes are small and from the more specific beliefs that saving

reflects income rather than the rate of return and that investment is determined

by capacity utilization or anticipated sales rather than by the relation between

the net—of—tax cost of funds and the net-of-tax return that firms can earn on

those funds. The present studies contradict this presumption of low price

elasticities and show that tax rules significantly alter economic behavior.

          These behavioral responses imply that tax rules distort both the

amount of capital formation and the distribution of capital and of risk bearing

in the economy. Such distortions imply a loss of economic efficiency and thus a

lower level of real economic income.   I have, however, limited the papers in

this volume to the positive analysis of the effects of capital taxation and have

not included papers that discuss the efficiency costs of altrnative tax rules

or that prescribe systems of optimal taxation.

          This volume is thus not a book about economic policy as such but an

attempt to understand how an important aspect of government policy influences

the functioning of a modern economy. Moreover, the individual papers do not
                                      —3—


represent a comprehensive treatment of all aspects of capital taxation but focus

on those questions that have appeared to me to be both economically important

and analytically tractable. Although the empirical studies deal almost exciusi-.

vely with the United States, I believe that much of the empirical work as well

as the analytic papers will be of more general relevance.

          The papers that are collected here were published in a variety of aca-

demic journals during a period of more than a dozen years. Not surprisingly, I

would no longer agree with everything that I wrote in all of them. More iinpor-

tant, if I were doing the studies now I would in several cases use somewhat

different theoretical models or statistical methods. I have nevertheless resisted

the temptation to make substantial changes because, if I once started, there

would be no natural place to stop. I do moreover still believe the basic

conclusions of each of the papers included here.

          The present chapter summarizes these specific conclusions and indicates

the structure of the overall analysis that links the individual papers.


Household and Corporate Saving

          A nation's rate of capital accumulation is governed by the amount of

saving that is done within its borders. Although international capital flows

can supplement or reduce the funds available for investment, in practice net

international capital flows have been quite small relative to domestic savings

and investment. Moreover, long—run differences among industrial countries in

the fraction of income that is saved are matched by approximately equal dif.-

ferences in the ratio of domestic investment to national income (Feldatein and

Horioka, 1980). The present study therefore focuses on domestic saving by indi-

viduals and businesses.
                                      —4—


          In the simplest textbook picture of national saving, all saving is

done by individuals who save during their working lives for consumption during

retirement. This life cycle model has shown itself to be a powerful tool for

thinking about saving and capital accumulation and provides the framework for

the analysis in Chapter 1 of this volume. A more realistic picture, however,

recognizes that not all individual saving is for retirement and that a very

large part of saving is done by corporations. The subsequent chapters in this

section therefore look beyond the simple life cycle model and consider expli-

citly the role of corporate saving and its interaction with personal savings.

          An economy's tax rules can affect the process of saving in a variety

of ways. Any tax that drives a wedge between the pretax marginal product of

capital and the net—of—tax return that savers receive will distort the saving

decisions. Chapter 2 shows that under existing law that tax wedge is very

large, with federal, state and local taxes taking more than two—thirds of the

real pretax return on nonfinancial corporate capital. The effect of changing

this wedge by increasing the taxation of consumption or labor income and

decreasing the taxation of capital income is the subject of Chapter 1.

          The tax laws also affect the extent of corporate saving by altering

the return on corporate capital and by inducing companies to reduce dividends in

favor of retained earnings. Chapters 3 through 5 examine the effect of tax

rules on corporate dividend behavior. The theory suggests and the evidence con-

firms that existing tax rules significantly distort the corporate financial

decisions in favor of a higher level of retained earnings. The effect of this

increase in corporate savings on total private savings depends on the extent to

which shareholders "see through the corporate veil" and reduce their own savings

in response to the higher level of corporate saving. The reaction of share—
                                           —5—




holders   and therefore of total saving is the subject of Chapters 6 and 7.

            The final chapter of this section uses the estimates of the earlier

chapters to examine the effect of alternative corporate tax integration propo-

sals on aggregate capital accumulation. The impact of integration depends on

the effect of the resulting higher net rate of return to savers and on the

effect of the increase in dividends on personal savings. The evidence suggests

that although corporate tax integrations could do much to reduce the distortions

in corporate finance and resource allocation that currently exist, the net

impact of integration on aggregate savings is likely to be small.

           The first chapter, "The Rate of Return, Taxation and Personal

Savings," examines how the tax wedge between the pre—tax and after—tax rates of

return affects the level of saving. The results are surprising and contrary to

conventional wisdom. The analysis shows that replacing a tax on capital income

with a tax on labor income can actually decrease private saving. However, even

when this anomalous result is true, such a tax change will raise national

saving, i.e., the sum of private and public saving.

           The analysis uses a simple life cycle model in which an individual

works in the first period of life and saves to finance consumption in the second

period when no work is done. Substituting a payroll tax or consumption tax for

an income tax of equal present value lowers the price of second—period consump-

tion relative to present consumption (because capital income is not taxed) and

therefore unambiguously causes an increase in future consumption and a decrease

in current consumption.

           The   rise   in future consumption does not, however, imply that first—

period saving must rise. Future consumption can rise even if current saving
                                         —6—




falls   because the change in tax rules raises the net rate of return that con-

verts present saving into future consumption.

            A   fall in both current saving and current consumption appears at first
to   be inconsistent with the individual's budget constraint. In fact, a fall in

both only implies that the individual's current taxes have risen, i.e., that

taxes have been moved forward    from retirement years to working years. This
obviously   happens when a payroll tax is substituted for a tax on capital income

since none of the payroll tax is paid during retirement years. It also happens

when a consumption tax is substituted for a tax on capital income.

            The crucial implication of this analysis is that the substitution of a

consumption tax or a payroll tax for the tax on capital income reduces current

consumer expenditure and therefore frees resources for investment even if per-

sonal savings are not increased. Since current consumption falls, the sum of

private saving and tax payments must rise. This in turn implies that if govern-

ment spending does not change, national saving will rise even if private saving

falls. The response of the government surplus or deficit to the tax change is

therefore of substantial importance. Maintaining a balanced budget when substi—

tuting a payroll tax for an equal-present-value capital income tax must imply a

rise in government spending and therefore may imply a fall ih national saving.

            The analysis of chapter one also shows the importance of the tran-

sition from one tax regime to the next. In a simple two—period life—cycle model

with overlapping generations, the older generation that already exists when the

tax law changes (and has paid tax under the old regime) must be treated dif—

ferently from all future generations to avoid imposing a windfall tax loss or

gain and a corresponding change in national saving.

          Before turning to the empirical studies in subsequent chapters, it is

useful to establish what has been happening to effective tax rates on capital

income. Because of the complexity of the tax rules, the statutory tax rates are

a very poor indication of actual effective tax rates. Moreover, in recent

years, the combination of high rates of inflation and the conventional

accounting procedures have substantially exacerbated this problem.

          The second chapter, "The Effective Tax Rate and the Pretax Rate of

Return," (written with Louis Dicks—Mireaux and James Poterba) examines empiri-

cally the effective tax rate paid on the earnings of capital in the nonfinancial

corporate sector of the United States in the quarter century ending in 1979.

The total tax paid by the corporations, their shareholders and their

creditors in 1979 to governments at all levels was 69 percent of the real capi-

tal income of the corporations, including both debt and equity income. This

effective tax rate fluctuated between 53 percent and 85 percent during the

previous quarter century. It is clear that such high tax rates deserve careful

attention in any attempt to understand the process of capital accumulation.

          The analysis in Chapter 2 stresses the importance of looking beyond

the tax paid by the corporations themselves to include also the taxes paid by

shareholders and creditors. The evidence also shows that an important share of

the total tax is paid to state and local governments; these taxes exceed 17 per-

cent of real pretax capital income.

          Failure to look at all the relevant taxes gives a misleading picture

of the trend as well as of the level of capital taxation. The
                                                                taxes paid directly

by the corporations themselves, i.e., corporate tax payments to all levels of

government plus state and local property tax payments, fell from 59 percent of

real capital income in the first five years of the sample period (1953 through
                                        -8-




1957) to 47 percent in the five years ending in 1979. Much of this fall

reflects the impact of inflation which raised the nominal interest expenses that

companies could deduct in calculating taxable income. But this reduction in

corporate tax liabilities was offset by increases in the taxes paid. by creditors

and shareholders. The total tax rate paid by corporations, creditors and share-

holders was nearly as high in the five years from 1975 to 1979 (68 percent) as

it had been from 1 953 to 1 957 (70 percent).

          The total effective capital income tax rate remained high despite a

series of reductions in the statutory tax rates paid by corporations and indivi-

duals and despite the introduction of the investment tax credit and the use of

accelerated depreciation. The effective and statutory tax rates behaved so dif—

ferently because the interaction of inflation with the historic cost methods of

tax accounting caused an understatement of the costs of production and therefore

an increasing ratio of taxable income to real income. This is particularly

clear in the period since inflation began to accelerate in the mid-1960's.

Between 1963 and 1967, the total effective tax rate was 55 percent; a decade

later, it averaged71 percent and ended the 1970's at 69 percent.

          The analysis in chapter 2 also provides estimates of the pretax rate

of return to capital in the nonfinancial corporate sector for each year since

1948. For this calculation, the usual national income account measure of

profits is adjusted by adding back in the property taxes paid by these cor-

porations. Between 1948 and 1979, the total pretax return averaged 11.5 per-

cent. The 1960's were a decade of greater than average profitability; even

after adjusting for cyclical fluctuations in profitability, profitability in the

1960s was about 1.5 percent higher than in the 1970s.
                                      -9--




          The combination of lower pretax profitability in the 1970s and a

higher effective tax rate caused the net—of—tax rate of return to decline

sharply between the 1960s and the 1970s. The average real net rate of return

was 5.2 percent in the 1960s but only 3.1 percent in the 1970s. The statistical

analysis shows no evidence that the broad fluctuations in the effective tax rate

over the past 25 years induced offsetting changes in the opposite direction by

the pretax rate of return. Changes in the effective tax rate were therefore

associated with correspondingly large changes in the net rate of return.

          These figures are indicative of the very substantial magnitude of

capital income taxes as a share of real capital income. They do not, however,

provide an estimate of the marginal tax rates on income from different types of

capital or of the marginal tax rates that apply to individual savers in dif-

ferent situations. For example, to the extent that the depreciation rules for

new investment are more generous than they had been at an earlier time, the

effective marginal tax rate is below the average tax rate. Conversely, if the

typical individual receives some capital income in an untaxed pension but does

all marginal saving in forms that are taxed, the effective marginal tax rate

will be above the average rate. The extent to which low tax options are and are

not marginally available and attractive requires more study.

          Corporate saving plays a major role in the process of capital accumu-

lation. In 1979, for example, corporate retained earnings were $59 billion

while personal saving was $86 billion; corporate saving thus accounted for 41

percent of total net private saving. Moreover, this figure substantially under-

states the relative size of corporate saving because it ignores the fall in the

real value of the net debt of nonfinancial corporations caused by inflation.
                                      -10-




The 10 percent inflation in 1979 (as measured by the personal consumer

expenditure deflator) reduced the value of corporate debt by $ 73

billion, thereby transferring that amount from personal saving to a corrected

measure of corporate saving and raising corporate saving to 91 percent of total

private saving.

          The nearly universal policy of paying substantial dividends

is the primary puzzle of corporate finance. During the past 15 years, dividends

have averaged 45 percent of real after—tax profits. Before 1982, dividends were

taxed at rates varying up to 70 percent and averaging nearly 40 percent for

individual shareholders. In contrast, retained earnings imply no concurrent tax

liability; the rise in the share value that results from retained earnings is

taxed only when the stock is sold and then at least 60 percent of the gain is

untaxed. Why then do corporations not eliminate or sharply reduce their divi-

dends and increase their retained earnings? And how do alternative tax systems

influence the way in which corporations divide their income between dividends

and retained earnings? These questions are the subject of chapters 3, 4, and 5.

          In the third chapter, "Why Do Companies Pay Dividends?", Jerry Green

and I develop a simple theoretical model in which firms choose to pay dividends

in order to maximize the value of their shares. The analysis emphasizes the

heterogeneity of shareholder tax rates and the desire of shareholders to

diversify their investments.

          We consider an economy with two kinds of investors: taxable indivi-

duals and untaxed institutions (like pension funds and nonprofit organizations).

Firms can distribute profits currently or retain them and thereby raise the

value of the firm's capital stock. Shareholders can sell their shares and

realize this increased value in the form of capital gains. In the absence of
                                          —11—




uncertainty, these assumptions would lead to a segmentation of the market and

specialization of share ownership, with the share price per dollar of retained

earnings less than one. In the equilibrium, the taxable individuals would

invest only in firms that pay no dividends even though, ceteris paribus, they

would prefer an immediate payment     while   untaxed investors would buy only the

shares   of firms that paid all profits out immediately as dividends. If untaxed

investors did otherwise, they would reduce the income they earned per dollar

spent on purchasing shares. The taxable individuals, in contrast, willingly

accept the lower pretax income because it corresponds to greater after-tax

income. This type of segmented equilibrium is not observed because of uncer-

tainty. Because investors regard each firm's return as both unique and uncer-

tain, they wish to diversify their investments. Chapter 3 shows that each firm

can, in general, maximize its share price by attracting both types of investors

and that this requires a dividend policy of distributing some unique fraction of

earnings as dividends. Only in the special cases of little or no uncertainty or

of a limited ability to diversify risks (because of a high enough correlation

among the returns of different companies) can the equilibrium be of the

segmented form.

           The simple model of section 3 cannot be applied directly to an economy

with a large number of firms. Since the riskiness of a portfolio decreases as

the number of securities increases, a segmented equilibrium could be established

with two groups of securities, one of which pays out all earnings and the other

of which retains all of is earnings. We believe, !Joever,        that the s1nple
model could be extended to prevent such segrcintatioii and preaerve the optimal
dividend result by   introducing   some diversity of expectations among the two
groups of shareholders with   respect to the prospects for each firm.
                                        —12—




         Within the simple framework, the model of chapter 3 can be used to

examine the comparative statics of how the dividend payment rate would respond to

changes in tax rules. The analysis shows that a rise in the tax rate on divi-

dends unambiguously raises total retained earnings although the dividends of any

particular company may actually be decreased. This model thus provides an

explicit rationale for the earlier empirical research for the United Kingdom

that is reported in Chapters 4 and 5.

          Between 1950 and 1958, the British government operated a corporate

income tax system that taxed dividends more heavily than retained earnings. The

relative rates of tax within this framework were changed several times.

Beginning in 1959, the differential taxation was ended and a pound of retained

earnings had an opportunity cost of a pound of dividends. Chapter 4, "Corporate

Taxation and Dividend Behavior," uses quarterly financial data to estimate the

effect of the changing tax rules on the dividend payout rate. Chapter 5 extends

this analysis by considering more general functional specifications.

          The evidence in these chapters indicates that increasing the oppor-

tunity cost of retained earnings (measured in terms of the foregone net dividend

income to an individual shareholder who paid the 'standard rate' of British per-

sonal income tax) raised dividends substantially. The elasticity of the

equilibrium dividend—income ratio with respect to tax—induced changes in the

opportunity cost of retained earnings is approximately 0.9 and the first year

impact elasticity is approximately 0.4. The abolition of the differential tax

in 1958 raised the opportunity cost of retained earnings by nearly 50 percent

and therefore raised the equilibrium dividend payout rate by some 40 percent.

          Although the parameter estimates are quite robust with respect to a
                                          —13-



variety of different specifications and estimation methods, the constant elasti-

city    specification should be regarded as only an approximation. As the analysis
of    chapter 3 implies,   a tax system that penalized retained earnings for
investors    it-i all tax situations would lead to a 100 percent payout and not to

the behavior implied by a constant elasticity relation. It is clear however

that, in the range of tax rates in which a 100 percent payout is preferred by

some investors but not by others, the actual payment rate is quite sensitive to

the    structure of taxation.
             The sensitivity of the dividend payout rate to relative tax rates

implies that the current U.S. system of corporate income taxation substantially

increases the retained earnings of existing corporations. The higher level of

corporate saving does not, of course, imply an equal net increase in the total

private saving of individuals and corporations. To the extent that shareholders

"see through the corporate veil" and take the corporate saving into account in

making their own saving decisions, the higher level of corporate saving need not

change total private saving at all. Similarly, the greater retained earnings of

existing corporations does not necessarily mean that they invest more or that

new businesses have a harder time raising capital. The established corporations

that retain more earnings may as a result borrow less and issue less equity,

thereby leaving more external funds for new businesses and fOr other firms with

a greater net demand for capital. Under an appropriate set of simplifying

assumptions, the greater retained earnings would be exactly offset by reduced

personal saving and a lower level of external finance, leaving all significant

aspects of capital formation unchanged.

            The economy may not, however, correspond to those simplifying assump—
                                        —14—



tions. Individuals may not "see through the corporate veil" or may feel

constrained by capital gains tax rules and estate taxes not to offset increased

retained earnings by selling shares. Corporations may treat retained earnings

differently from external funds. New business may have a harder (or easier)

time raising money when other and more established firms are not raising equity

capital. Moreover, to the extent that the greater retained earnings raise the

total saving rate, those firms that are seeking external capital may find it

easier to obtain. The impact of increased retained earnings on total capital

accumulation and on its distribution among sectors and firms is thus an empiri-

cal issue.

             Chapters 6 and 7 address one aspect of this issue, the effect of

retained earnings on total private saving. Chapter 6 deals with the U.S.

experience from 1929 through 1965 while Chapter 7 deals with the British postwar

experience. Both studies examine the effect of corporate retained earnings on

household consumer expenditure. The conventional Keynesian consumption function

that relates consumer expenditure to disposable income implicitly assumes that

reducing dividends by a dollar and increasing retained earnings by an equal

amoint will lower consumer expenditure by nearly one dollar, i.e., by the margi-

nal propensity to consume. In this common specification of behavior, households

do not see through the corporate veil at all and a tax—induced rise in retained

earnings raises private saving nearly dollar for dollar. In contrast, the less

common specifications of consumer expenditure behavior associated with Irving

Fisher that relates consumer spending to labor income and the real rate of

interest implies that shifts of funds between retained earnings and dividends

have no effect on consumer spending.
                                      —15—




          The analysis of chapters 6 and 7   considers   a more general specifica-

tion of the consumer expenditure function that includes retained earnings as a

separate variable and therefore within which the impact of the dividend payment

decision can be estimated. The specification extends the permanent income

hypothesis by emphasizing that consumer spending responds to different com-

ponents of observed income according to the relation between current observed

income of that type and expected future income. Thus, an increase in dividends

has a substantial impact on consumer expenditures because shareholders believe

that such changes are relatively permanent, a view that correctly corresponds to

the distributed lag relation between dividends and corporate profits. In

contrast, an increase in retained earnings that is caused by a transitory rise

in profits does not induce a substantial rise in consumer spending. It would be

wrong, however, to conclude (as the Keynesian specification implicitly does)

that every increase in retained earnings would have a small impact on consumer

spending. A rise in retained earnings that represents a tax-induced switch from

dividends should be regarded as "permanentt' and should therefore have a positive

impact on consumer spending that is comparable to the negative impact of the

reduced dividends. The implication is that, since observed changes in retained

earnings reflect both temporary and permanent changes, the estimated effect of

retained earnings on consumer spending will understate the effect of the relati-

vely permanent changes in retained earnings that result from tax-induced changes

in the dividend payout ratio.

          The statistical evidence in both chapters shows that an extra dollar

of retained earnings raises consumer spending substantially, although by less

than an extra dollar of disposable income. For the United States in the period
                                       -16—


 from 1929 through 1965,1 the estimates indicate that an extra dollar of retained

 earnings raises consumer spending by 50 cents while an extra dollar of dispo-

 sable income raises consumer spending by 75 cents. This difference can well be

due to the future tax that must be paid when the retained earnings are even-

 tually converted to spendable dividends and to the transitory component of

variations in retained earnings. This evidence thus implies that households see

 through the corporate veil and adjust their personal savings to changes in cor-

porate savings. The current system o'f corporate income taxation, although

inducing corporations to retain a higher fraction of earnings than otherwise,

therefore appears to have little if any effect on the total volume of private

saving.

          The estimates based on the British experience in the postwar period

("Taxes, Corporate Dividend Policy and Personal Savings: The British Postwar

Experience," done jointly with George Fane) is also contrary to the extreme

Keynesian specification but does imply that the that the dividend payout rate

may influence consumption. The long—run propensity to consume out of disposable

income is estimated to be 0.77 while the long run propensity to consume retained

earnings is only 0.23. The British evidence thus suggests that a tax policy

that reduces dividends by one pound and increasQs retained earnings by an equal

amount may raise total private saving by as much as 0.5 pounds. It is not clear

whether the difference between the U.S. and British estimates are the result of

real differences in behavior or only reflect problems of measurement and estima-

tion of such things as the foreign ownership of British shares. Subsequent stu-

dies with more recent U.S. data confirm the result for the United States.

Additional studies for the United Kingdom remain to be done.

    Chapter 6

          The estimated effectes of corporate tax rules on dividend behavior and

of dividend behavior on aggregate private saving can be used to evaluate the

effect of corporate tax integration proposals on capital formation. In Chapter

8, "Corporate Tax Integration: The Estimated Effects on Capital Accumulation

and Tax Distribution of Two Integration Proposals," Daniel Frisch and I conclude

that corporate tax integration could eliminate or reduce some of the distortions

in the allocation of capital without significantly reducing overall private saving.

          The two alternative corporate tax integration proposals that we con-

sider are: complete integration by the partnership method and a partial

integration method that keeps the tax burden on corporate income unchanged. The

chapter discusses how integration would reduce distortions in the allocation of

resources between the corporate and noncorporate sector, between present and

future consumption and between different types of corporate finance. The analy-

sis then examines the claim of integration advocates that it would raise the

aggregate rate of capital accumulation.

          The evidence of Chapters 4 through 7 is used to assess the decrease

in corporate saving that would be likely to result from integration and the

extent of the offsetting increase in personal saving. Since the complete

integration scheme represents a net reduction in the taxation of capital income,

we also consider the implication of the increased net rate of return on aggre-

gate saving. As the analysis of chapter one emphasized, this effect is ambi-

guous. If other taxes are not increased, there is a positive income effect that

may induce an increase in current private consumption as well as in future con-

sumption. If other taxes are increased, the effect on national saving depends

on the responses of both individual and government spending. In particular, if

the present value of tax revenue is unchanged and government spending does not
                                     -18-


rise, the rate of return effect implies an increase in national saving. On

balance, it seems best to give little weight to any possible change in aggregate

saving in assessing the effect of corporate tax integration.


Portfolio Investment Behavior

          The tax system affects not only the flow of saving and the size of the

capital stock but also the allocation of capital among alternative activities.

Several previous studies have examined how tax rules influence the demand for

housing and the share of housing in the total capital stock.1 The research pre-

sented in the current section focuses on the non—housing portion of individual

portfolio investment behavior.

          The analysis here shows that tax considerations substantially distort

the portfolio investment decisions that individuals make under existing tax

rules. Differences in the tax treatment of different kinds of capital income

influence the composition of portfolios and the realization method of taxing

capital gains reduces investors' willingness to revise portfolios in response to

new information.

          These distortions in portfolio behavior imply that capital is misallo—

cated among industries and firms. The result is that the wrong products are

produced and that production occurs with inefficient ratios f capital to labor.

In addition, distorting the demand for portfolio assets also alters the mix of

financial assets that firms supply (e.g., the ratio of debt to equity) and the

allocation of risk—bearing in the economy. A full evaluation of the welfare

costs of taxes on portfolio income should evaluate the welfare losses that



  1See, for example, Laidler (1969), Aaron (1971) and Feldstein (1981).
                                     -19-


result from the misallocation of risk as well as from the distortion of produc-

tion decisions.

          Economists first became interested in the effects of taxes on port-

folio behavior when individual income tax rates began rising in World War II.

The very sharp increase in tax rates caused a widespread concern that the tax

system would reduce the willingness of individual portfolio investors to take

risks and that this in turn would raise the market price of risk and induce

firms to make investments with lower risk and therefore lower expected return.

In an important early article, Evsey Domar and Richard Muagrave (1944) argued

that the opposite was more likely to be true: because a tax implies that the

government shares the risk as well as the return on investments, the tax need

not change the net return per unit of net risk but does reduce both risk and

income. In their particular parameterization, this implied that individuals

would unambiguously increase their demand for the risky asset. Subsequent ana-

lysis by Tobin (1958) showed that the same conclusion could be obtained in a

model with expected utility maximization.

          By the mid—1960s (when I wrote the paper that appears as chapter 9,

"The Effects of Taxation on Risk-Taking"), professional economists generally

accepted the proposition that a proportional tax with full loss offset increases

personal risk—taking. My paper showed that previous demonstrations relied on

a variety of restrictive and implausible assumptions and that, when these

assumptions are relaxed, the previous conclusion is no longer true. The key

point of the analysis is that even in a restricted world in which a mean—

variance analysis is appropriate, the proportional tax can be shown to increase

risk taking only when there is a riskiess asset with zero yield. When all assets

are risky, or even when the safe asset has a non—zero yield, the effect of a
                                       -20-




proportional tax on the demand for risky assets is ambiguous and can only be

resolved by further restrictions on the utility function. Subsequent papers by

Mossin (1968), Stiglitz (1969) and others identified the restrictions on

utility functions and asset structures that could produce different results

but confirmed that no general theoretical conclusion about portfolio choice

could be obtained.

            The theory of portfolio choice thus identifies the basic ways in which

taxation affects portfolio composition without providing any clear answer about

its net effect. Moreover, the actual tax rules that affect portfolio investment

in the United States are quite different from the simple proportional tax with

full loss offset that has been the subject of the theoretical analyses. The

United States taxes nominal capital gains but only on realization and at a

lower rate than other types of capital income. The law also exempts from taxa-

tion the income of state and local government bonds and the implicit income on

owner—occupied housing. Because of the theoretical and institutional complexi-

ties, evaluating the likely effect of the actual progressive tax requires direct

empirical research.

            The study presented in chapter 10, "Personal Taxation and Portfolio

Composition: An Econometric Analysis", uses household survey data (the

Federal Reserve Board's survey of income and assets) to study the effects of

taxes on portfolio composition. The first stage of the analysis relates the

composition of each individual's financial wealth to the individual's tax

bracket, wealth, and other relevant variables. The parameter estimates from

these equations are then used to assess the impact of tax rates on asset demand.

            The evidence indicates that tax effects are quite important. The

estimates   imply that, with the special features of the U.S. tax system (like
                                     —21 —




 the method of taxing capital gains), higher marginal tax rates increase the

demand for common stock and municipal bonds and decrease the demand for other

types of financial assets. A simple model relating asset demand to the relative

net—of—tax asset yields is capable of explaining why different income classes

hold different fractions of their portfolios in each type of asset. The rela-

tive net yield differences can also account for much of the variation among

asset proportions for each income classes. By construction, the differences in

relative net yields reflect only the tax rules and tax rates. The analysis thus

provides strong evidence of the importance of taxes in determining portfolio

composition and asset demand.

          The basic question that originally motivated research on the effect of

taxation on risk—taking was whether the tax law discouraged high income indivi-

duals from making investments with high pretax yields and high risks. To answer

this question directly, I calculated an estimated mean pretax yield for the

portfolio of each individual in the sample and a corresponding variance based on

the historic covariance matrix of the individual asset yields. I then related

these measures to the individuals' tax classes, wealth and demographic charac-

teristics. The results indicate that both pretax yield and risk rise with

taxable income. The basic reason for this is the increasing share of equities

in the portfolios of higher income individuals. This in turn was the result of

very progressive tax rates on ordinary income (reaching a maximum rate of more

than 90 percent in the 1962 survey year) and a maximum capital gains tax rate of

25 percent. Thus, the combination of very progressive tax rates on other income

and low tax rates on capital gains encourage an allocation of portfolio wealth

into investments with higher pretax yield than would otherwise have occurred.
                                     —22—



          Capital gains are not only taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income

but are subject to tax only when an asset is sold. Moreover, the capital gains

tax is avoided completely when an asset is bequeathed, since the recipient takes

the asset's value at the time of transfer as a new basis for calculating sub-

sequent taxable gains. The likely result of this method of taxing capital gains

is to discourage the sale of assets and the realization of taxable gains. To

the extent that investors are "locked into" previous investments in this way,

the asset markets are less efficient at allocating risks arid resources. The

demand for share of companies whose prices have risen in the past are artifi-

cially inflated while new companies and those whose share prices recently

declined have a harder time attracting buyers.

          This potential lock—in problem assumed growing importance in the 1970s

as changes in tax rules raised the maximum tax rate on capital gains. The so—

called "alternative tax" rule that limited the capital gains rate to 25 percent

was modified to restrict its application to the first $50,000 of capital gains.

Other rules governing the "minimum tax" and the "maximum tax" raised the total

marginal rate on capital gains to more than 40 percent for many individuals

before the 1978 reduction in the tax rates on capital gains.

          Chapters 11, 12 and 13 report three studies that were designed toeva—

luate the effect of capital gains taxation on the selling of corporate stock and

the realization of capital gains. All three studies indicate that investors are

quite sensitive to tax consideration in their decisions to sell common stock.

          An important feature of the first of these studies, "The Effect of the

Capital Gains Tax on the Selling and Switching of Common Stock", which was done

jointly with Shlomo Yitzhaki, was the use of survey data that permitted
                                       —23—




 separating "switches" of stock (i.e., stock sales followed by purchases of dif-

 ferent stock or other financial assets) from "net sales" in which proceeds are

not reinvested. The distinction is useful because the lock-in effect applies

only to switch sellers. Although higher capital gains tax rates should unam-

biguously reduce switch—selling, the effect of high tax rates on net selling is

ambiguous. A higher tax rate may discourage an individual from selling

stock in order to buy a consumer durable or to make some other large purchase,

but an individual who wishes to sell in order to obtain some given net amount of

after—tax cash will have to sell more if he is in a higher tax bracket than if

he is in a lower tax bracket. The net balance of these two factors determines

whether net selling is an increasing or decreasing function of the capital gains

tax rate.

            The survey data examined in Chapter 11 implies that 56 percent of

those who sold stock during the year also purchased other stock and that 58 per-

cent of the pretax value of common stock sale proceeds were reinvested in com-

mon stock by the end of the calendar year. The parameter estimates conform to

the theoretical prediction and indicate that the portfolio reallocation deci-

sions ("switches") are particularly sensitive to tax considerations while net

selling does not appear to be influenced by the tax rate on capital gains.

            The second study, "The Effects of Taxation on the Selling of Corporate

Stock and the Realization of Capital Gains", done jointly with Joel Slemrod and

Shiomo Yitzhaki and reported in Chapter 12, extends the first analysis by exa-

mining a large sample of individual tax returns that report sales of corporate

stock. With the tax return data, we were able to estimate the effect of taxa-

tion on the realization of gains as well as on the sale of stock. The   evidence
                                     -24-



supports the earlier finding that corporate stock sales are quite sensitive to

tax rates and then shows that the effect on the value of the net capital gains

that are realized is even stronger. As an indication of the strength of these

effects, the study reports a simulation of lowering the 1973 maximum tax rate on

capital gains to 25 percent. The simulation indicates that, on the basis of the

cross—section differences in realization at different tax rates, this change

would cause nearly a doubling of stock sales and would increase realized gains

by enough to increase tax revenue despite the lower tax rate.   In practice, the

actual effect of a lower capital gains tax rate would depend on the extent to

which individuals had realizable gains. Since only a small fraction of accrued

nominal capital gains are actually realized, a very substantial increase in

stock sales and tax revenue is quite possible.

          The analyses of Chapters 11 and 12 use cross—section data to estimate

the likely effect of a change in tax rates. These samples permit studying large

numbers of individual taxpayers and making quite precise estimates of their

capital gains tax rates and their sales of corporate stock. Although cross—

section data can in principle provide valid estimates of how individuals would

respond to a change in rules, it is reassuring to have evidence based on a com-

parison of behavior under different tax regimes.

          Chapter 13, "The Lock—In Effect of the Capital Gains Tax: Some Time

Series Evidence", written with Joel Slemrod, presents such a "before and after"

comparison. Before 1969, all taxpayers were subject to a maximum capital gain

rate of 25 percent. During the 1970s the capital gains tax rate remained essen-

tially unchanged for moderate income taxpayers but rose substantially for those

with very high incomes and large potential gains. The evidence on capital gains
                                         —25—




by income class presented in Chapter 13 shows that the ratio of net capi-

tal gains to other income was actually higher in 1975-76 than in 1967—68 among

taxpayers with incomes under $100,000, but fell substantially among higher

income groups. Although it is not possible to make precise parameter estimates

on the basis of these data, they clearly support the sensitivity of capital

gains to tax rules that is implied by the cross-section data.

             Consideration of individual portfolio behavior suggests a significant

modification of the conventional analysis of the corporate income tax and of

other partial factor taxes. The conventional analysis follows Harberger (1962)

and assumes that capital is allocated among alternative uses in a way that

equalizes the after—tax rate of return on capital in all of its uses. The port-

folio perspective implies that this conventional analysis should be modified to

recognize that the net rates of return on capital in different uses are not

generally equal but reflect the risk—return preferences of investors and their

equilibrium portfolio compositions.

             The portfolio approach explains why different types of taxpayers

ranging from high tax rate individuals to untaxed pension funds all hold mixed

portfolios despite the differences among taxpayer groups in the relative net

rates of return on different types of assets. If risk considerations were irre-

levant to these investors, each type of investor would specialize in the par-

ticular type of investment which had the highest net yield for his tax

situation.

             The lack of specialization is significant because it implies that dif-

ferent groups of portfolio investors may respond differently to tax—induced

changes in the net rates of return. In contrast, the conventional analysis
                                     —26—




assumes that there are no differences in response but that all capital owners

respond with an "infinite" asset adjustment to any divergences of net rates of

return.

          Chapter 14, "Personal Taxation, Portfolio Choice and the Effect of the

Corporation Income Tax" (written with Joel Slemrod), shows that the portfolio

approach can radically change the implied effect of the corporate income tax on

the sectoral allocation of capital. Corporate income is subject to tax at a

corporate rate of 46 percent; when some fraction of that income is paid as divi-

dends, it is subject to an additional tax at the shareholder's rate of individual

income tax. Before 1982, investment income on noncorporate activities was taxed

at individual rates of up to 70 percent and this same rate was applied to divi-

dend income; since 1982, the maximum individual rate has been reduced to 50 per.-

cent.

          Recognizing the differences in personal income tax rates significantly

changes the appropriate analysis of the effect of the corporate income tax.

Although the corporate income tax represents an additional tax for lower income

individuals and untaxed institutions, the corporate tax system can also shelter

retained earnings from high rate of personal taxation. When personal tax rates

were as high as 70 percent and the corporate rate was 48 percent, the total taxa-

tion of corporate income could easily be below the tax rate applicable to the

income of unincorporated businesses. In this situation, the corporate income

tax induces investors with low individual tax rates to shift investments from

the corporate to noncorporate sector but induces investors with high marginal

tax rates to shift resources into the corporate sector.

          The net effect of the corporate tax system therefore depends on the
                                     —27—


distribution of wealth among investors in different tax classes and on the rela-

tive sensitivity of their adjustments to changes in yields. If the portfolios

of high income individuals are more responsive to yield differences than

the portfolios of low income individuals, the corporate tax system can actually

result in a net flow of capital from the unincorporated sector to the corporate

sector. Chapter 14 presents a two—sector model calibrated to U.S. data for 1973

and shows that the corporate tax system could increase the size of the cor-

porate capital stock with feasible differences in the portfolio balance elasti-

cities. More generally, with portfolio balance elasticities that are more

realistic, the disaggregated portfolio analysis of the U.S. corporate tax system

implies a very substantial reduction in the extent to which the corporate tax

system shifts the capital stock.

          The reduction of the maximum individual income tax rate to 50 percent

as of 1982 makes it virtually impossible for anyone to pay a lower tax on cor-

porate income (subject to a 46 percent rate plus a tax on dividends) than on

unincorporated business income.1 This implies that the corporate tax system un-

equivocally reduces the flow of capital to the corporate sector. The lower rate

of individual income tax does not, however, change the general analytic point

that only a disaggregated portfolio analysis can explain the absence of complete

specialization and indicate the likely quantitative response of asset allocation

to changes in tax rules.




     1Very small corporations do pay tax rates below 46 percent but these firms
account for a minute fraction of all corporate capital and income.

 of investment to tax—induced changes in the cost of capital, this sensitivity

was not estimated independently but was the result of the Cobb-Douglas specifi-

cation that constrained the elasticity of the desired capital stock with respect

to the cost of capital to be minus one. The statistical estimation only

indicated the time path of the adjustment of inveutinent to chaneu in the coui—

posite variable that reflected both output and the user cost of capital. Even

after Jorgenson's pioneering work, skeptics could still easily believe that all

of the explanatory power in his statistical model came from changes in sales and

that tax policies have no effect on investment.

          Only by relaxing the constraint implied by the Cobb-Douglas specifica-

tion can the effect of the tax rules be estimated explicitly. In chapter 15,

"Tax Policy, Corporate Saving and Investment Behavior in Britain," John Flemming

and I estimated a more general specification in which the effect of tax policy

can be examined directly. The natural generalization of the Cobb-Douglas speci-

fication is a constant elasticity of substitution technology in which the

elasticity of substitution is not constrained to be one; this in turn implies

that the elasticity of the desired capital stock with respect to the cost of

capital may also be greater or less than minus one. We adopt this constant

elasticity of substitution specification and then go even further and allow dif-

ferent responses to the different components of the cost of dapital: the depre-

ciation rules, the corporate tax rate, and the net rate of return. In

principle, such response differences might be the result of differences in the

extent to which firms understand these factors arid take them into account or of

differences between permanent and transitory effects.

          During part of the sample period that we examined (1954 through 1967),

the British government had used tax policy to encourage greater corporate
                                        -30-




saving. The evidence presented in Chapters 4 and 5      indicates   that these poli-

cies were successful in achieving this particular aim. The purpose of

encouraging increased retained earnings was of course to raise the rate of

investment.     Chapter 15 also examines the extent to which tax—induced chaiies in
retention affect the rate of investment.
              The statistical evidence implies that both the accelerated depre-
ciation provisions and the differential taxation of dividends and retained ear-
nings had substantial and significant effects on investment. The data imply
that the responses                              user cost of capital (the tax
                       to the other components of the

rate and the net cost of funds) are weaker and may not have existed at all. The
evidence that tax inducements to increase retained earnings raised investment is
consistent with the finding for Britain (Chapter 7) that higher retained ear-
nings raised total national savings. In short, both types of policies appeared
to be successful in raising capital formation before the differential taxation
of   dividends and retained earnings was abandoned in 1958   and the value of acce-
lerated   depreciation was eroded by inflation in the late 1960s and 1970s.

              A defect of the Feldetein—Flemming study, as well as of the work of

Jorgenson and his collaborators, is the assumption that     replacement investment
is   a fixed fraction of the capital stock. In chapter 16, "Toward an Economic

Theory   of   Replacement Investment", Michael Rothschild and I   show that   replace-

ment investment is likely to be quite sensitive to changes in tax laws in both

the short run and the long run. Since replacement investment is approximately

the same magnitude as net expansion investment, this influence of tax rules is

potentially quite important.

              A tax change that alters the optimal ratio of capital services to
                                       —31—



 labor is also likely to alter the optimal planned durability of capital and

therefore the initial amount of capital stock per unit of capital service.

If a particular depreciation change both raises the optimal capital—labor ratio

and favors more durable investment, it will raise investment outlays for both

reasons. Econometric models that ignore changes in durability will attribute

all of the increased.investment to the higher capital—labor ratio and will

therefore overestimate both the sensitivity of the optimal capital stock to the

user cost of capital and the iongrun effect of the tax change on investment.

          In addition, a tax change may induce firms to accelerate or delay the

scrapping and replacement of existing equipment by changing the optimal age of

replacement. Chapter 16 shows that under certain conditions, the introduction

of accelerated depreciation increases the optimal replacement age. In

principle, all replacement investment would then be postponed until the oldest

equipment reached the new optimal age. Investment would eventually rise because

of the increase in the optimal capital—labor ratio but would fall temporarily

because of postponed replacement. An econometric analysis that ignores the

delay in replacement would therefore underestimate the response of the optimal

capital intensity to the tax change.

          These examples illustrate that the simplified specification of repla-

cement investment that still characterizes econometric studies of investment may

be an important source of bias in estimating the way in which tax rules affect

investment. More generally, the analysis of chapter 16 implies that the impact

of tax rules on replacement investment may be very significant and deserves more

careful econometric analysis than it has received.

          As I noted in discussing the effective tax rate calculations of

Chapter 2, the increasing rate of inflation that began in the mid-1960s has had

a major effect on the taxation of capital. This occurs because the taxable

income of businesses and individuals is calculated by conventional accounting

methods that evaluate nominal rather than real capital income. The use of

historic cost depreciation and first—in/first-out inventory accounting cause an

understatement of the costs of production and therefore an overstatement of

taxable income. The use of nominal interest rather than real interest causes an

overstatement of the borrowers' costs and an overstatement of the lenders'

income. And the taxation of nominal capital gains causes a rise with inflation

in the effective tax rate on individual equity investors. The net result of all

three forms of capital income misrneasurement is to raise the effective tax rate

on the income from business investment as inflation rises.

          This interaction between inflation and tax rules implies a substantial

non—neutrality of inflation and shows the importance of an economy's fiscal

structure as a determinant of its macroeconomic equilibrium. Chapter 17,

"Inflation, Tax Rules and Investment: Some Econometric Evidence," focuses on

the primary effect of the tax—inflation interaction; its impact on non-

residential fixed business investment.

          There are a number of complex channels by which the inflation-tax

interaction affects business investment. The higher effective tax rate on capi-

tal income changes the incentive to save and directs more of aggregate saving

into owner—occupied housing. The incentive for business investment is depressed

by the lower real net-of—tax return that can be earned on any given investment

but is encouraged to the extent that firms use debt finance and face a lower

real net—of—tax cost of debt.
                                     —33—




          Chapter 17 begins by acknowledging that the effect of the tax-
inflation interaction on investment is too complex to be described accurately by

any single econometric model. Although models like that of Chapter 15 can be useful,

they represent a substantial simplification in their specification of tech-

nology, of the market environment of firms, of financial behavior, etc. Because

any econometric specification is therefore a "false model", it is useful to

estimate alternative specifications in which the potential biases are likely to

be different. Because all inference is necessarily based on false models, the

robustness of results is the best indication of economic reality.

          Three quite different models are presented in Chapter 17. The most

explicit specification is an extension of the generalized C.E.S. capital stock

adjustment specification of Chapter 15 in which substantial care is given to the

measurement of the effects of inflation. An alternative model of investment

behavior that avoids some of the restrictions of the capital stock adjustment

process relates investment to the difference between the net return on invest-

ment and the net cost of funds. Finally, there is a model that is more of a

reduced form, relating nonresidential investment to the real net return that is

earned by those who provide the capital.

          All three models indicate that net nonresidential fixed investment is

quite sensitive to tax rules and that the interaction of inflation and the U.S.

tax rules that prevailed in the 1960s and 1970s can account for much of the

nearly 40 percent decline in the net investment share in GNP that occurred

between the second half of the 1960s and the 1970s. Although the chapter does

not deal explicitly with the 1981 tax legislation that significantly shortened

the depreciation lives of plant and equipment, the analysis implies that this

change should raise investment substantially and should reduce the sensitivity

of effective tax rates and of investment to changes in inflation.



Tax Incidence in a Growing Economy

          The   five final chapters in this volume look at capital taxation in a
general equilibrium framework. The analyses are theoretIcal and examine econ
mies in steady state equilibrium growth. A principal focus of each chapter is

the impact of some tax on the returns to capital and labor but the analyses go

beyond the issue of tax incidence to examine the more general effects of the tax

on the behavior of economic agents.

          The first of these studies, "Tax Incidence in a Growing Economy with

Variable Factor Supply" (Chapter 18), shows that the long-run incidence of a tax

depends only on its effect on the share of national income that is saved. The

effect of the tax on the supply of labor is irrelevant in the long—run because

changes in the supply of labor induce corresponding changes in the supply of

capital that make the capital—labor ratio (and therefore the factor returns)

independent of the labor supply. The irrelevance of the labor supply response

very clearly distinguishes the implications of long—run growth incidence from

the implications of static analyses of tax incidence.

         The specific analysis of Chapter 18 deals with the effect of a general

"payroll tax" on labor income. If the tax does not alter the fraction of

national income that is saved, the entire burden of the tax is borne by labor

and the return to capital remains unchanged. If, however, some fraction of the

taxed income would have been saved while the government saves none of the tax
                                        —35--




revenue, the effect of the tax is to lower the national saving rate and there-

fore to reduce the economy's equilibrium capital—labor ratio. This in turn

raises the rate of return to capital and lowers the pretax return to labor.

In this case, labor bears more than 100 percent of the payroll tax. More

generally,    the effect of the tax depends on the redistribution of income   among

groups with different saving rates and the sensitivity of saving to the rate of

return.

             Chapter 19, "Incidence of a Capital Income Tax in a Growing Economy

with Variable Savings Rates," extends the analysis of tax incidence in a growing

economy to the case of a tax on capital income. The results of this analysis

are again very different from the implications of a static general equilibrium

model. In a static general equilibrium model with a 'fixed capital stock, owners

of capital would bear the entire burden of a. general tax on capital income.

When the capital stock is instead made endogenous, a substantial fraction of the

burden of a general tax on capital income may be borne by labor. The precise

incidence depends on the elasticity of the saving rates of different types of

taxpayers with respect to the net rate of return.

          The contrast between the irrelevance of the labor, supply elasticity

and the sensitivity of the results to the savings elasticities is striking.

This difference reflects the fact that capital is a derived factor of production

and is thus a function of the labor supply and labor income while the opposity

is not true. It implies that the providers of capital may ultimately avoid some

of the burden of any tax in a way that is not available to the providers of

labor services.

          Although the analysis of chapter 19 refers to a general tax on capital
                                     —36—

income rather than a partial tax like the corporate income tax, it suggests that

the implications of the traditional static analysis of the corporate income tax

would not remain valid if the very long—run incidence were examined explicitly.

          In an economy with more than one type of capital asset, changes in the

taxation of a particular type of capital income cause an immediate change in the

price of the corresponding asset and may cause changes in other asset prices as

well. These asset price changes capitalize the changes in future net incomes.

Such capitalization effects are an important aspect of the distributional effect

of a tax change and can also play a key role in the reallocation of assets.

          Chapter 20 extends the traditional theory of capitalization and of tax

incidence by using a model of a growing economy with overlapping generations.

The analysis is applied to a tax on pure land rent, the classic case of a tax

that has been assumed to be unshiftable and therefore to be fully capitalized in

the price of land. This study, "The Surprising Incidence of a Tax on Pure Rent:

A New Answer to an Old Question," shows that even a tax on pure rent can be

shifted to other forms of capital.

          This surprising conclusion comes from recognizing that land is a store

of value as well as a factor of production. When a tax on rent destroys some of

the market value of land, savers must hold more reproducible capital as part of

their life cycle saving. The tax on rent thus increases the stock of reprodu-

cible capital, thereby raising the capital—land ratio and the capital-labor

ratio. The result of this is a higher pretax rent and higher wages. Chapter 20

presents an explicit model of this process and shows how the value of land might

even be raised by a tax on rental income.

          Although this analysis is limited to the case of pure land rents, it

has obvious implications for the corporate income tax, for taxes on natural
                                      -37-


resources and for all other partial taxes on particular types of capital incorrie.

It shows the importance of describing explictly the way in which any tax change

alters existing capital values and the accumulation of capital.

          In Chapter 21, "Corporate Financial Policy and Taxation in a Growing

Economy." Jerry Green, Eytan Sheshinski and I use the framework Of an economy

in equilibrium growth to examine how a system of profits taxation affects cor-

porate financial decisions and the net returns to individual investors in debt

and equity. The framework of equilibrium growth is important in this context

because it constrains the debt—equity ratio and the dividend-payment rate to

combinations that are consistent with the exogenously given growth of each

firm's capital stock. The corporate—type tax system that we study favors both

borrowing and retained earnings but a firm cannot maintain both a high debt—

equity ratio and a low dividend payment rate without generating an excessive

growth rate for its capital stock.

          The effect of the corporate—type tax system on the debt—equity ratio

depends on the portfolio balance behavior of individual investors. If an

increase in the net yield on debt relative to equity causes a rise in the

desired debt—equity ratio, the corporate tax system raises the equilibrium debt—

equity ratio.

          Changes in the ratio of debt to equity complicate the analysis of the

effect of tax rules on asset yields because part of any change in asset yields

is their compensation for the change in risk. To clarify the analysis, we

assume that the individual portfolio equilibrium requires a constant debt—equity

ratio. In this context, we obtain the rather surprising result that an increase

in the corporate tax rate reduces the net yield to debt even though interest
                                           -38-



payments are deductible by the corporation. Similarly, a higher tax rate lowers

the net yield on equity and reduces the dividend       payment rate.
            The analysis shows     that the current structure of corporate and   per
sonal   taxes is significantly non—neutral and can significantly distort the

financial   behavior of firms and the returns to the provider of capital.

Extending our analysis to a two—sector model with an endogenous stock of capital

would   indicate further aspects of non—neutrality.
            The final chapter, "Inflation, Income Taxes, and     the Rate of Interest:
A   Theoretical Analysis," returns to the interaction of inflation and tax rules

that provided the basis for the econometric study in Chapter 17.        In an economy

without income taxes and in which money demand is not a function of the interest

rate, a change in the equilibrium rate of inflation has no effect on the real

economy. This is the "superneutrality" implied by Irving Fisher's original ana-

lysis of inflation. More recently, James Tobin (1965) has        emphasized that the

observed inverse relation between inflation and money demand implies that an

increase in the rate of inflation causes a portfolio substitution that raises

the equilibrium capital intensity of the economy.

            In   reality,   this portfolio substitution effect must be very small.

Even a relatively broad definition of the relevant monetary balances implies

that the maximum effect is less than two percent of total wealth. An economy's

tax rules are therefore likely to have a much more substantial effect by

influencing the total supply of saving and its allocation among alternative

uses.

            The analysis of Chapter 22 considers a particularly simple tax struc-

ture that illustrates how fully anticipated inflation can change the real return
                                      —39—




to   savers and therefore the rate of saving. The model focuses exclusively on

the difference between the tax rate of corporate borrowers and the tax rate of

the individual savers who lend to the corporation. The effects of inflation on

depreciation, on inventory profits and on capital gains are all ignored and all

investment is assumed to be financed by debt. In this context, an increase in

the rate of inflation raises the net return to savers if the corporate tax rate

at which interest payments are deducted exceeds the personal tax rate that is

paid on interest receipts. Moreover, since savers in high tax brackets will

generally see their rate of return depressed by inflation (because their per-

sonal tax rates exceed the corporate rate) while savers in low brackets receive

higher rates of return, the net effect on aggregate saving will depend on the

relative sensitivity of saving in the different groups.

           Although the analysis of Chapter 22 shows the importance of the

interaction between taxes and inflation, the model is too simple to give even a

qualitative picture of the likely effect of changes in inflation. In a series

of subsequent papers, I have examined the effects of depreciation and capital

gains taxation, the roles of government debt and of owner occupied housing, and

other aspects of the way in which an economys fiscal structure affects. its

macroeconomic equilibrium. These papers and related empiricl research appear

in a separate volume, Inflation, Tax Rules and Capital Formation (University of

Chicago Press, 1983).




           The studies included in the current volume have dealt with only some

aspects of the broad subject of capital taxation. These analyses are suf-

ficient, however, to show that the tax system does have substantial and varied
                                     -40-



effects on the process of capital accumulation. They are an indication also of

the need for continuing research, both theoretical and empirical, on the ever-

changing system of actual tax rules and on the possibilities for better alter-

natives.
