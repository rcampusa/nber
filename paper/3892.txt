                                      ABSTRACT


       We   present evidence     on   the cyclical behavior of small versus
large    manufacturing firms, and on the response of the two classes
of firms to monetary policy.           Our goal is to take a step toward

quantifying         the role of credit market imperfections in the
business cycle        and in the monetary transmission mechanism.       We

find that, following tight money, small firms sales decline at a
faster pace than large firm sales for a period of more than two

years.      Further, bank lending to small firms contracts, while it

actually rises for large firms.            Monetary policy indicators tied
to the performance of banking, such as M2, have relatively

greater predictive power for small firms than for large.

Finally, small firms are more sensitive than are large to lagged
movements in GNP.         Considering that small firms overall are a
non-trivial component of the economy, we interpret these results

as suggestive of the macroeconomic relevance of credit market

imperfections.

1.   Introduction
       This paper presents evidence on the cyclical behavior of small versus

large manufacturing firms,     and on the     differential response of the two kinds
of firms to various indicators of monetary        policy.   Our objective is   to

provide some empirical insight into the role of credit market imperfections
in the monetary transmission mechanism and in the business cycle, more

broadly. Subject to the usual caveats of interpreting time series results,
our principal findings are that small firms react more sharply and typically

quicker both to movements in GNP and to movements in conventional
indicators of monetary policy.       As   we will argue, our empirical findings, in

conjunction with the fact that small firms are        a non-trivial component of
GNP,   are suggestive of the   macroeconomic relevance       of credit market
frictions.
       There   is a large body of   evidence consistent with   the idea that
monetary policy has been an important factor in postwar business
fluctuations (e.g., Sims (1980), Eckstein and Sinai (1986), Romer and Romer

(1989), Bernanke and Blinder (1990)).        There remains, however, considerable

debate over the exact nature of the monetary transmission mechanism. One

element of this debate is whether credit market imperfections may enhance

the potency of monetary policy (e.g., Blinder and Stiglitz        (1983), Romer and

Rorner (1990), Bernanke and Blinder (1990), Kashyap, Wilcox and Stein

(1991)).   Efforts to resolve this issue have concentrated      on analyzing    the

response of various money and credit aggregates to shifts in monetary

policy.    Though this approach has been informative, one limitation is that
the competing theories are often capable of generating similar predictions

about the movement of money and credit. This observational equivalence
problem arises because     it is typically difficult to distinguish between
demand versus supply-induced movements of each financial aggregate.' We try

to shed light on the issue    in   an alternative way,   by comparing the cyclical

behavior of small versus large firms. Our approach exploits the idea           that
small firms are more likely to confront credit market frictions.2

        Section 2 presents a simple model designed to illustrate how credit

market imperfections may introduce a kind of risk aversion on the part of

firms, making their behavior 'excessively sensitive' to earnings flows and
to interest rates.3 The     model also predicts   that these magnification
effects are likely to   be proportionately   greater the smaller the firm. The
model     thus suggests, everything else equal, that small firms should      be more

sensitive than large firms to macroeconomic conditions. Macroeconomic
conditions include both the state of the business cycle and the stance of

monetary policy, under the interpretation that changes in the short term
interest rate encapsulate shifts in monetary      policy.   It is worth adding
that our story is complementary but not isomorphic to the "credit         view' of




'There have been some creative approaches to solving the identification
problem. Kaahyap, Wilcox and Stein (1991), for example, try to identify
shifts in credit supply by examining the behavior of the division of short
term credit between bank loans and commercial paper, and then demonstrating
the relationship of this "mix" variable to real activity.

2Differential effects on small versus large firms has been an important theme
of the empirical literature on credit market imperfections and investment.
See, for example, Fazzari, Hubbard and Peterson (1928) and Evans and Jovanovic
(1989). The macroeconomic consequences are discussed in Gertler and Hubbard
(1989).
3This kind of excess sensitivity result is a key feature of the literature
on the macroeconomic consequences of credit market imperfections. See, for
example, Farmer (1985), Williamson (1987), Greenwald and Stiglitz (1988),
Bernanke and Gertler (1989) and Gertler (forthcoming).

monetary policy, as articulated by Blinder and Stiglitz (1983) and Bernanke
and Blinder (1988); this is because our theory relies on magnification

effects owing to credit market imperfections rather than          on the ability   of

monetary policy to directly regulate bank lending.4
       We   check the general implications of our model by analyzing the time
series behavior of small versus large firms.        Section 3 describes the data

set we use. It consists of a time series of sales by manufacturing firms,
divided up by size class. We present some summary Statistics to indicate
how   relative importance   and cyclical behavior   varies   by size   class. Section
4   presents an analysis of this data within a set of time series models that
include GNP and one or more indicators of monetary policy. The models allow

for interactive effects between large and small firms in order to help
identify the true independent impact of the macroeconomic variables.
       Perhaps our main empirical result   is that small firms are indeed more
sensitive to shifts in monetary policy.    We employ two       different methods to
capture exogenous shifts    in monetary policy, and find      that the result holds
in both cases. We     first use innovations in the federal funds rate, as
5uggested by Bernanke and Blinder (1990); and then consider the dummy
variables for shifts to tight money that Romer and Romer (1989) constructed.

The   differential response of small firms is particularly striking when the
Romer dummies      are used. Relatedly, we find that in the wake of tight          money,



4Romer and Romer (19901 have criticized the credit view, arguing that
because reserve requirements on CDs are low (now they no longer exist),
monetary policy cannot effectively regulate the flow of bank lending. (The
argument presumes that banks are able to elastically issue CD5, which is
open to debate.) Whether our theory is right, however, is not tied to the
question of whether open market operations directly control bank credit.
bank lending   to small firms contracts, while it rises for large firms.
Additionally, small firms are more sensitive to lagged movements in GNP,
which is Consistent with our theory.
     We also explore       the partial correlations of small and large firms with
the various monetary policy indicators. Several results here deserve
highlighting: Small firms are more Closely related than large firms to                   M2

and to the ratio of bank loans to commercial paper (the 'mix' variable

constructed by Kashyap, Stein and Wilcox (1991) to capture the tightness of

monetary policy); Conversely, the commercial paper/ T-bill risk-spread is a
better predictor of large firm behavior. Financial aggregates connected
with banking     —
                     M2 and the mix variable    —   are   thus relatively more
informative about small firm behavior, while the financial aggregate most

directly connected with conditions in the commercial paper market the risk           —



spread is most informative about large firm behavior. We show further
          —




that the current recession conforms to this pattern (and indeed exhibits
symptoms of involving a credit crunch on small firms).               Concluding      remarks
are in section    5.



2. Theory

     In   this section we present a simple model designed to illustrate how

credit market imperfections may amplify the impact of macroeconomic
disturbances, including shifts in interest rates, technology and demand.                 An

important prediction      is   that the magnification effect    is   stronger   in

percentage terms the smaller the firm. The basic framework is a variation of
Townsend's (1979) costly state verification model.            The key difference is the
addition of a variable input which may be thought of either as labor, or
perhaps as an intermediate input.6 This modification allows us to study
fluctuations in firm output.
      There are two periods: 0 and                        l.'   A       risk-neutral firm has a technology
which takes input x in period 0 and yields a random quantity of output y in

period     1.   It   Costs (1/2)x2 to obtain               x units of input. Output in period                 1   is
given by y           2Ox.           The random variable w is                   distributed continuously
and uniformly over              the unit interval. Therefore:                    E(       x) =   Ox;   pr (       a   w

a   H(w)             and   5H(d/& =       1.        The    realization of         w is   independent of
events elsewhere in the economy;                     that is,           w   is idiosyncratic to the firm.

      The parameter 0                is a composite of a technology factor, i, which is                           common

across firms and a scale parameter, A, meant to reflect the size of the firm:

                                                           0    =


A reflects the stock of fixed factors; a larger value of A raises the
expected marginal product of the variable factor. 0 may thus vary across
firms      owing     to differences in         A.     Time      series        movements in 0, however,         are
due to the common shock, and are therefore perfectly correlated across

firms. Think of the                 common productivity shock                   as a random variable with a
realized value        , that becomes           known prior               to the choice of x.      We may

therefore treat            '   as   parameter in the firm's optimization problem, and may

macroeconomics, see Gale and Hellwig (1985), Williamson (l987b), Bernanke and
Gertler (1989), and Gilchrist (1990). The model of this paper is most closely
related to Gilchrists.

borrowers and lenders may enter rnultiperiod arrangements, see Gertler,

                                                                    5
interpret shifts   in    as a technology or      demand                      For

parsimony, we will suppress l' and       A,   and instead   carry around the composite
parameter 8. Shifts in      6   therefore encompass       technology shocks, while the

relative level of 8 reflects firm size.

      Because there exists a lag in the production process, the firm must
finance its input expenditure. In period 0, it borrows funds from a

risk—neutral competitive intermediary. The size of the loan, b,               is   given by

                                        b = (1/2)x2                                              (1)

The   intermediary's opportunity cost     of funds equals        the gross riskless
interest rate, r, which we take as      given.       As with 8,    r   may be random so long

as its value is known before the firm's        choice    of x.
      As   in Townsend (1979), we     assume the intermediary may not              freely observe
the firm's output.      To do so,   it must pay a fix cost        y.   One may     interpret
more generally as the cost of default.         We     incorporate scale economies
in default costs by assuming that y is fixed even though the firm's size of

operation is variable.8     We assume    further that the        ex post bankruptcy cost is

less than the size of the loan the firm would obtain if there was                  no   credit



7That is, UI could either be a productivity parameter or a relative price.
           i
Shifts in are technology disturbances under the former interpretation and
are demand shocks under the latter.
8The key assumption is that the expected average product is higher for large
firms than for small firms (which makes the debt of the large firm safer).
Having any kind of fixed cost will suffice. To minimize algebra, it is
simplest to embed the scale economies in the bankruptcy costs, which in
itself does not seem unreasonable.
      Two alternative ways to obtain our predictions would be to assume that
small firms face proportionately more idiosyncratic risk or to assume they
have proportionately less collateral than large firms. Either assumption
would generate a proportionately larger premium for external funds for small
firms.

credit market friction induces under—investmentrelative to the                           first best.9
        As Townsend (1979), Gale and Hellwig (1985) and Williamson (1987a)

show, under certain assumptions, the optimal financial contract is risky

debt.'0      Define d as the payment the         firm      promises     to the   intermediary.

Whenever         realized output, 2ex, is greater than or equal to d, the

intermediary receives this payment and the                 firm    gets     to keep the     residual,

w2ex    -   d.    If w2Ox   is less than d, the      firm defaults.          The lender pays          and

gets to keep all the realized output.               The    firm   is   left with     nothing.

        Since w     is distributed uniformly        over the unit interval, the probability

of   default, p, equals the ratio      of   the promised payment              to the     maximum

feasible value       of output, d/28x.      Conditional on the choice              of   input x, p

must satisfy


                              20x'lp(I - p)     +   fu'du] -       p    =   rb                              (3)


Equation (2) requires that the intermediary's expected return (the                          left   side)

equal   its opportunity cost of funds, rb.

        The      firm's contracting/investmentproblem             is   to   choose   x, b   and    p to



9Without condition (2), it may pay for the firm to over—invest relative to the
to the first—best optimum in order to exploit the scale economies in
bankruptcy costs. This will become apparent in the subsequent analysis.
'°The two required assumptions are: (i) only deterministic auditing schemes are
feasible; and, (ii) the intermediary can commit to an auditing policy.
Relaxing either of these assumptions does not affect our basic conclusions
regarding the impact of the credit market distortions on firm variability.
However, we maintain them in order to preserve tractability.

           There are two kinds of       outcomes.              We   call the    first the "basic" case, and
    the second, the "rationing" case.              In both situations,          the credit market
    imperfection enhances the sensitivity of output to shifts in 8 or r. Because
    the latter    only emerges when the fixed bankruptcy cost                      is exceptionally large
    relative to the size of the firm, we concentrate most of our attention on the

    former. The case of rationing is deferred to the appendix.

    ensure that the intermediary receives a competitive return.'1 The credit



    11(ap/8x) is obtained by differentiating equation (3), the constraint that the
    intermediary must receive a competitive return. The denominator,
    2(l—p)  —
             (/8x), is the change in the intermediary's expected return given a
    rise in the non—default payment, divided by Ox. In any optimum, this value
    must be non-negative. Otherwise the firm could gain by reducing d, and

      Figure    1   illustrates the outcome.       The dd curve           portrays the expected
marginal product of x, which is fixed              at    6.    The   ss curve portrays the
expected marginal cost.         The dotted line plots            the function rx, the marginal
cost curve the firm would face in the absence of credit market frictions. The

intersection of the dd curve with the dotted line accordingly defines the

first best value of x      ——   call   it x.     The    firm's optimal choice of x, however,
is given by the intersection of the dd             and       ss curves.    The expected bankruptcy

      It is   now    apparent how the impact            of    the credit market distortion depends

inversely on the size of the firm.             Inspection of eqs. (5) and (6) illustrate
that the expected bankruptcy costs become relatively less important with
increases in 6. There is a direct effect; the expected marginal product of                        x

rises relative to the cx post bankruptcy cost, There is also an indirect
effect. The rise in the average product reduces the marginal probability of
bankruptcy. (Notice in eq. (6) that                    varies inversely with 6, ceterus

value is positive at the optimum. The basic case arises, therefore, if the
bankruptcy cost is not extremely large relative to mean output, and/or if the
bankruptcy probability is not unreasonably large.
      Condition (2) guarantees that the numerator is positive when x equals its
unconstrained optimal value (0/rI. This ensures that the resulting
constrained optimum lies below the first best. See the analysis below.
'21t may be verified that it is always profitable cx ante for the firm to
 operate in the basic case; i.e., expected profits are positive.

in 8 not only lifts the dd curve- The supply curve also rotates outward, as

the expected marginal bankruptcy costs decline. The        key idea is   that input
choice depends not only on the net msrginal product, but also on the average

product which influences the expected average bankruptcy coats.          A   rise in
the interest rate similarly has a magnified effect, as Figure      3

illustrates.'3   The decline in average product raises   the marginal bankruptcy
costs, which enhances the inward shift of the supply curve.        It   may be
verified formally that credit market imperfections raise the elasticity of x
with respect to both 8 and r. Since expected output is proportionate to
input, the higher input elasticities translate into higher output
elasticities.
      Monetary policy enters the picture to the extent      it may be responsible
for shifts in the riskless interest rate r.     We may   conclude, therefore, that
the credit market imperfection magnifies the ultimate impact of monetary
policy on firm borrowing decisions, and particularly so      for small firma.


      Zb.   Additional Considerations

      Thereare several other avenues through which credit market imperfections
may produce "excess volatility' of email firma. Each involves a fairly

straightforward extension of the basic    model.   First, appending the framework
to include variation in internal funds introduces   an   accelerator effect on



'3See Farmer (l9g5), who also emphasizes how incentive problems in the credit
market magnify the impact of interest rate ahifta on output.




                                           10
input demand, as in Hernanke and Gertler (1989)14            This occurs because credit

market frictions introduce    a    wedge between      the cost of internal and external
finance.    In   terms of Figure   1,   a rise in internal funds shifts the ss curve
outward, expanding input demand. This effect is stronger for small firms

since, ceterus parabus, the required premium for external finance is

proportionately higher for these kinds of firms.
     Second, risk averse behavior by         intermediaries is possible, which would

impact largely on small firms. If an intermediary is unable to perfectly

diversify, then its capital position may constrain the quantity of loans it
supplies [see Bernanke and Gertler, (1987)1. This          is true since the
intermediary's depositors confront an incentive problem in lending to the
intermediary akin to the one the intermediary faces in lending to          its
borrower.'5                                                    its lending
                 The bank's capital position matters ultimately to
decisions because it affects the price it must pay depositors to attract

funds.     Fluctuations in bank capital therefore affect loan terms. The

so-called "credit—crunch" of the current recession essentially works through
this mechanism. The impact is greater on small firms since they are unable to
substitute to the open market to obtain credit (since the monitoring and
evaluation costs required to obtain "arms—length" credit are

disproportionatelylarge for these kinds of firms. )16


'4See Greenwald and Stiglitz (1988) and Calomiris and Hubbard (1990)             for
  discussion of of a related mechanism.
'5The inability to perfectly diversify idiosyncratic risk is critical to the
argument why bank capital influences bank lending. Diamond (1984) shows, as               a
matter of theory, that depositors never face an incentive problem with a
perfectly diversified intermediary. This is because any risk to depositors in
this case is systemic, and is therefore observable.
'6For related reasons, it seems that the recent liquidity effect models

3. Data Description
      Our empirical analysis investigates       the cyclical sensitivity of small
firms in comparison to large firms, and examines the differences in the
co—movements        of small and large firms with various indicators of monetary
policy. We therefore require a data set that contains time series
observations on firms by size class. To our knowledge, the only source for

such data with any significant time series dimension is the Quarterly

FtrLanctal Report     for Manufacturing Corporations (QFRI. Another advantage of
the   QFR   is that it is comprehensive; this permits us to assess the overall

significance of small firms in an important, cyclically sensitive sector.
      The     QFR   reports quarterly net sales revenue for all manufacturing firms
as well as net sales revenue disaggregated by eight different asset size
classes.    The asset size classes include all      firms with total assets under $5
million, all firms with assets between $5 to $10 million, $10 to $25 million,
$25 to $50 million, $50 to $100 million, $100 to $250 million, $250 to $1000

million, and all firms with total assets greater than $1 billion. The QER
therefore provides eight different time series of sales data. Each time
series represents the total sales     of all   firms within one     of   the eight size
categories.     The   data are available from    l958:Q4   to   l990:Q3.17

      Although we have eight potential time series, we reduce              the data to


which emphasize banks as a conduit of monetary policy (e.g., Fuerst (1990)
and Eichenbaum and Christiano 11991)) would also predict a small firm
effect.
'7Changes in QFR   data construction in 1974,1986, and 1989 lead to
slight breaks in the level series. We corrected the level series by
splicing the data, using the overlap period provided by QFR to create
correction factors.

just two series,       one     for small firms and   one   for large firms, by aggregating
across size categories.           We   aggregate for two reasons. First, this greatly
simplifies the empirical analysis and reduces the              VAR   systems to manageable
levels. Second, and perhaps more importantly, by aggregating across time

series, we can control for the bias that occurs in the data                  due to    the asset
cutoff levels being in nominal terms, as we will discuss shortly.
        The   cutoff   level    for small firms is $25 million dollars in assets.           We

selected this level since previous panel data studies (e.g., Fazzari,

Peterson, and Hubbard (1988), Gilchrist (1990)) suggest              that firms that are
liquidity constrained when making their investment decisions are
concentrated in the vicinity of this size class and below. Table                  1    reports
the cumulative percentage of all manufacturing sales accounted for by firms

with total assets less than the           QFR   cutoff.    From column 3 of this table,
one can see      that by choosing a cutoff level of         $2.5 million, we    maintain a
substantial percentage of total manufacturing sales in our "small firms"

category. At the start of the sample, small firms account for 387. of total

manufacturing sales. Because of the use of nominal categories, this figure

drops to      197. by 1990,     still a substantial percentage of total manufacturing.
        The   other columns in this table highlight the effect of using nominal

categories to classify firms, since all categories of firms, except the
largest, shrink     over     time as a percentage of total manufacturing sales. For
example, the smallest category of firms (assets less than S5m) accounted for
267.   of total manufacturing sales in          1960, but only 127. by 1990.          In

contrast, the largest category           of   firms accounted for    157.   in 1960 and    567.   in

1990.

     We   address the       size category" problem in three ways. First,
                         "nominal

we work with growth rates of real sales across size categories, rather than
levels, irs order to mitigate the impact of the trend effect on levels
induced by inflation.'8 Second, we aggregate up to two size categories to
control the direction of bias that remains in the growth rate series. This
aggregation induces     a bias that tends to understate the sensitivity of small
firms relative to large firms to the effects of monetary policy and other
macro shocks.    For example, suppose there is           a shift to expansionary
monetary policy that eventually raises inflation: The bias works towards
increasing the sensitivity of large firms, as the           rate of firms shifting
into the higher asset category increases. By inducing a bias that dampens

the relative reaction of small firms, we are more confident of the
robustness of findings that imply small firms may be more sensitive to

either cyclical or monetary    shocks.    Finally, in our empirical work, we



'8We also remove seasonal effects in the sales growth rate series by
regressing the data on seasonal dummies and using the residuals.



                                                14
allow inflation to enter as an independent variable in the equations for

firm behavior, in order to capture any remaining effect             on   sales of

category—shifting induced by inf1ation.9
     We   next report some descriptive statistics.          We   present two types:
measures of relative volatility between the sales of large and small firms;

and correlations between sales of large and small firms and GNP. We do not

report average growth rates for the manufacturing sales data, since these
measures are not comparable due to the trends in each series.

     To compare the volatility of sales growth for small firms to the

volatility of sales growth for large firms, we aggregate the sales data into
two size categories and compute standard deviations for the growth rate in

each category.     We   then construct   a ratio   of   the standard deviation of the
growth   rate   of small   firms to the standard deviation of the growth rate of
large firms. To account for the changing percentage of total manufacturing in
any given size category, we look at different sub—periods in the data,

computing 40 quarter standard deviations for each sub—period. To assess the

sensitivity of this relative volatility measure to changes in the cutoff used
to classify firms into small and large categories, we vary the cutoff               level

used to divide the firms, starting with the lowest QFR cutoff and steadily

increasing it. These results are reported in table 2.




'1t is also noteworthy that the QFR keeps a firm in a size class for eight
quarters before making any adjustment. This dampens considerably the number
of firms which shift categories in the wake of a macro shock.

        From table 2   it is clear that the smaller size categories exhibit as
much    if not more    volatility than the larger size categories.    For all cutoff
levels below $250 million, the standard deviation of sales growth for firms
below the cutoff is much greater than the standard deviation of sales growth

for firms        the cutoff for the time periods 1960—69, and 1970-79. Even
             above

in the 1980's, when the volatility of small firms appears to have decreased

relative to large firms, this ratio is at least 0.99 for the bottom three

cutoff levels.20
        While Table   2 concentrates on raw measures of sales volatility, Table        3

presents information about the cyclical volatility, measured         by   the
co—movement with GNP.         Specifically, it reports the correlation between real



20The  volatility of sales growth appears to be bimodal across size categories
however, since the largest size category also exhibits considerably more
volatility than other categories. The last column of table 1 shows that the
standard deviation of sales growth for firms with total assets greater than
$1 billion is considerably greater than the standard deviation of sales
growth for firms with total assets less than $1 billion. The variance of
the largest category tends to decrease over time, relative to the rest of
the sample, as one incorporates more of the less volatile intermediate size
firms in this category.

leads and     lags.   Overa11   small firms are in the          same league of     cyclical

volatility as large firms. Large firms             have a      slightly stronger

contemporaneous correlation, .55 versus .44.                Small   firms, though,    appear to

have   a slightly stronger lag and        lead   relationship with      GNP.   This pattern

is   confirmed by the Co—movement of the difference in the growth rates

4. Empirical Results

        We now examine the macroeconomicperformanceof small versus                        large

firms in the context of a        Set of VAR models.             Each model includes both small

and    large firms,   GNP, inflation and one         or more indicators of monetary




                                                    17
policy.     Inflation is included in part to control for the possible bias

owing to nominal       size classifications (see the discussion in section    3).    We

estimate each       model in two   different forms: the first allows the growth
rates of small firms and large firms to enter independently; the second
restricts them to enter in difference form (i.e., the relevant firm variable
is the difference in the sales growth rates of small and large firms). The

former approach permits us to control in a flexible way for interactive
effects between large       and small firms.     The advantage   of the second approach
is fewer parameters to estimate.
      We use a number       of different methods to assess the relative behavior of
small and large firms. First, we present a set          of exclusion restriction
tests to determine the qualitative importance of        GNP and       the monetary
variables for explaining the growth rates of small versus large firms. We
further assess the quantitative magnitudes of these partial correlations by
examining the size of the coefficients on various lags of the macroeconomic
variables.       Finally, we quantify the impact of an innovation in either GNP
or in the stance of monetary        policy on   the overall dynamic behavior of small
versus large firms, using impulse response functions.            We   follow two

different approaches      in   the literature to identify exogenous shocks to the
stance of monetary       policy.

      Because      there is no universally accepted indicator of monetary policy,
we consider a number of alternatives popular in the literature. The list

includes:    M2,   the Federal Funds rate, the spread between the six month
commercial paper and T-bill rates, the short term financing mix between

bank loans and commercial paper, and the dummy variables for shifts to tight

money     that   Romer and Romer (1989) constructed.      M2 is picked because       it is a


                                                18
traditional and     widely—used measure        of the stance of monetary policy. The
limitation of    M2 (and   indeed of most of these indicators)       is that a large
component of       its variation is   likely endogenous.   Although endogeneity

amongst the macro variables still permits us to analyze            the impact of
shifting macroeconomic conditions           on small versus   large firm behavior, it
constrains our ability to disentangle the impact of monetary versus real

shocks.
        The endogeneity problem leads us to two other indicators,          the funds rate
and the Romer dates. Bernanke and Blinder (1990) argue               that it is
reasonable to      treat a component of the contemporaneous innovation in the
funds    rate as   exogenous since     the Federal Reserve sets this variable
directly.     Romer and Romer (1989) instead rely on          the minutes of the Federal
Reserve Open Market Committee to identify dates when the Federal Open Market

Committee shifted the course of monetary policy to fight inflation.               They
argue that because these episodes reflect primarily responses to trend
inflation, they may be treated as exogenous with respect to the recent

behavior of output.
        We   consider the two other indicators, the spread and mix variables,

because they may reflect credit market conditions not captured by the other

measures.      Both Romer and Romer (1989) and Bernanke (1990) present evidence

suggesting that the spread is driven by monetary policy and.

correspondingly, that      it may     be   a good indicator of monetary tightness.

Intuitively, tight money leads to relatively greater issuance of commercial

paper and CDs (which are close substitutes for commercial paper), which

historically placed upward pressure on the commercial paper rate relative to
the T-bill rate. The attention the spread has received as a leading



                                                  19
indicator also makes it a desirable candidate for study. Similar
considerations lead us to the mix variable. Kashyap, Stein, and Wilcox

(1991) present evidence suggesting   that monetary       policy   affects the mix,
which reflects the relative importance of' bank loans versus commercial paper

in short term finance.2' Tight money constrains the ability of banks to issue

loans, this increases borrower's reliance on commercial paper. To the
extent that bank loans and commercial paper are imperfect substitutes, the
mix variable may be viewed as an indicator of credit tightness.

      We begin by examining VAR systems which include             the quantitative
monetary variables: M2 growth, the Federal Funds rate, the risk spread, and
the mix. Later we consider the   Romer dummies.            For each monetary variable

we estimate two VAR models. The       first   includes   four lags each of real sales

growth of small firms, real sales growth of large firma, real GNP growth,
inflation and of the particular monetary variable.22 The second differs by
replacing the two firm sales growth variables with a single variable, the
difference between the sales growth of small and large firms.23
      Table 4 reports the exclusion test results for whether or not GNP



21Short term business bank loans actually appear to rise following tight
money. The mix falls, therefore, because commercial paper rises faster.
Evidence from the QFR, which we report in section 4, shows that while bank
lending to large firma rises, bank lending to small firms actually contracts
following tight money. Thus, the behavior of the mix may be at least partly
explained by a compositional effect on small versus large firms.
22We also tried different lag lengths, none of which noticeably affected our
results.
All   equations are estimated over the period l960:Q2 to 1990:Q3, except for
the regression that includes the mix variable. Because the commercial paper
market did not develop unitl the mid—sixties, regressions using the mix are
estimated over the period 1965:01 to 1990:Q3.

growth and various monetary variables provide additional explanatory power
for the     sales growth rates     of small     and   large firms. Figure   5   plots the
individual coefficients on lags       1   to   4 of each macro   variable, as well as
the   sum   of the coefficients    and 957. confidence      intervals, for the
regressions with small and large firms as the dependent variables.                  Figure 6

does the same for the regressions with the difference between small and

large firm growth rates       as   the dependent variable. These figures also

report the R2     and   the standard error of the regression that resulted from
these regressions.      The exclusion tests we report for GNP growth are

obtained from the VAR system that includes the Federal Funds                    rate as the
monetary variable.24 For the exclusion tests of other monetary variables,
besides the Funds rate, we use the same regressions, replacing the Funds

rate with the monetary variable of interest.


24We focus on the VAR system with the Funds rate, since it is the monetary
variable likely to be least endogenous with respect to contemporaneous
movements in GNP.

        The   first column of Table 4 indicates that      GNP is a qualitatively more

important predictor for small firm behavior. One rejects the hypothesis
that lags of real         GNP growth do   not explain the sales growth of small firms.
But one cannot        reject it for large firms.     Figures 5 and6 suggest that
lagged GNP is also a quantitatively more important           predictor of small firm
behavior.      In Figure 5, all of the coefficients on lagged GNP are higher for

small firms than large firms. Figure 6 confirms this pattern, using the

difference in sales growth as the dependent variable; the coefficients on
lags    2   and 4   as well   as the sum are significantly positive.   We   interpret
these results       as   being consistent with the idea that credit market

imperfections make small firms more Sensitive to aggregate demand and



25The  regressions for the first two rows include four lags each of the real
growth   of small firms, the real sales growth of large firms, real GNP
growth, and the monetary variable listed on top of the column. For the
first column, which lists GNP at the top, the funds rate is the monetary
variable. The regressions for the third row replace the two sales growth
variables with the difference between the sales growth of small and large
firms.

technology shocks.26
     The monetary variables also      differ in predictive power for small and
large firms, mainly    in ways consistent with our theory.      The   results for   M2

are quite striking.    One overwhelmingly rejects   the hypothesis that all the
coefficients on lags of   M2   growth are equal to zero for small firms.
Conversely,   M2   growth does not appear to help explain the growth rates of

large firms, since    one cannot   reject the hypothesis that these coefficients
are zero.   M2 is    also a quantitatively more important predictor of small
firm behavior; and it is important to recognize     that this holds true after
controlling for the impact of GNP, inflation, and possible interactive
effects between large    and small firms.    The coefficient   patterns in Figures
5 and 6 indicate a stronger positive relation for small firms with lagged
movements in M2. than for large firms.

     The Federal Funds     rate is a significant predictor of both large and small
firm behavior, once again after controlling for GNP, inflation and

interactive effects between large and small firms.      One    interesting
difference is that small firms appear to react quicker to movements in the

Funds rate. The coefficient patterns in both Figures 5 and 6 suggest          that
small firm sales growth decline one quarter after a rise in the Funds rate,



2lf one   uses MZ growth instead of the Funds Rate, one cannot reject the
exclusion restriction on GNF for either large or small firms, however the
coefficients on GNP still tend to be larger, with the difference being
statistically significant for two of the four lags. If one uses the risk
spread instead of the Funds rate, GNP appears to matter for large firms but
not small firms. All the coefficients on GNP are negative for large firms
however, and either significantly positive or close to zero for small firms.
Further, the pattern on the GNP coefficients of small firms relative to
large firms is quite similar across the different specifications, with the
coefficients on the 1st, 2nd and 4th lag tending to be significantly
greater for small firms than large firms, and the third lag being equal.


                                            23
everything else equal.27    The decline is both in absolute terms and relative

to the sales growth of large firms, It takes large firms two quarters to
decline after   a rise in the Funds rate, again everything else equal.
Moreover, as we discuss shortly, the predictive power of the Funds         rate for
large firms appears to     be proxying   for the predictive power of the risk
spread.
     The risk spread produces a pattern nearly the opposite of       M2.    It is a
significant predictor for large firms but not for small firms. At the same
time, though, the coefficient patterns do not look much different between

large and small firma.28 It is also interesting that, when both monetary
variables are included, the risk spread eliminates the explanatory power of
the Funds Rate for large firms but not for small firms.25        Of all   the


270ne possible explanation  for the quick decline in small firm sales in the
wake of a rise in the Funds rate is that small firms may have to sharply
Contract the offering of trade credit finance their sales. In periods of
tight money, banks may be willing to supply loans to finance inventories
(since these loans are collateralized by the inventories.) They may be less
willing to finance firms' offerings of trade credit since the collateral
value of these kinds of loans is highly Uncertain. We are currently pursuing
evidence on these possibility. See Ramey (1991) for a discussion of the
widespread use of trade credit in business sales.
28
     Because the Fed did not start targeting the Funds rate until the mid
sixties, we reran these regressions using the sample period 1965:Q1-1990:Q3.
This did not change our results.
      We also considered dropping the last ten years of the sample since
Bernanke argues that the rate spread is a less effective explanatdr in the
SO's than earlier. Not surprisingly, this weakened the impact of monetary
policy across both small and large firms. Although M2 was no longer
significant, the p—value was much higher for the difference in growth rates
(0.15) and for the growth rate of small firms (0.27) than for the growth
rate of large firms large firms (0.57). The Funds rate followed a similar
pattern, with p—values of 0.05, 0.11, and 0.33 for the small and large firms
respectively. Similarly, the p-values for the risk spread were 0.6, 0.65
and 0.58; thus once one drops the 80's the spread does not appear to matter
more for large firms.
29Conversely, when included jointly, both the Funds rate and M2 are



                                             24
monetary variables, the behavior of large firms is most closely tied to the
risk Spread.

     The mix variable produces results quite similar to the impact of M2.3°

It is a much better predictor for small firms than for large firms.                     The

exclusion   tests indicate a significance      level of   less than   17.   for small
firms, as compared to better than       677.   for large firms, It is also true that
the first three coefficients on the     mix    are positive for small firms, as is
the sum. This is the pattern        one would expect, given      that a fall in the mix
reflects credit tightening. Conversely, the coefficients on the mix for
large firms are not significantly different from zero at lags 1, 2 and 4, as
is the sum.    Overall, the mix has very little independent explanatory power
for large firms.
     It is worth considering       why small    firms have a closer statistical
relationship with   M2 and   the   mix, but large    firms are in closer sync with
the risk spread.    Because each     of these monetary variables has a significant
endogenous component, any     structural explanations must proceed with caution.
It is interesting, though, that     M2 and the mix        are closely tied to movements
in bank credit, the primary source of external finance for small firms,

while the spread is most directly a barometer of conditions in                 the
commercial  paper market, where large firms participate. Part of the story,
therefore, may be that MZ and the mix better proxy credit conditions for



significant predictors of small firm behavior. Thus, it is probably safe to
say that the Funds rate and M2 are jointly informative about small firms,
while it is the risk spread that is informative about large firms.
30The mix variable we use is the growth rate of bank loans minus the growth
rate of commercial paper. We differ slightly with Kashyap, Stein and Wilcox
(1991) because we are studying growth rates rather than levels.




                                                25
small firms, while the spread better captures conditions for large firms.3'

We will      present some evidence shortly indicating that the current recession
appears to conform to this pattern.
        We   now compare the quantitative response of small and large firms to

innovations in monetary policy and GNP.          As    mentioned earlier, we use two

different methods existing in the literature to identify exogenous movements
in monetary policy.      We   first consider a   VAR   framework with the Funds rate

as the monetary variable, and treat as       exogenous the component of      the
innovation in the Funds       rate that is uncorrelatedwith the innovations of
the other variables in the system, following Bernanke and Blinder          (1990).

We subsequently use dummy variables        to proxy periods of exogenous shifts to
tight   money, following Romer and Romer 11990).           For parsimony, we present

results for systems where the difference         between small and   large firm growth
rates is the exclusive firm variable. Results for the systems          in which

small and large firms enter independently do not differ appreciably.

        Figure 7 plots the impact of a one standard deviation increase in the
Funds rate on the difference between small and large firm growth rates.32 It

also plots the response of GNP for comparison purposes. To obtain the

impulse response functions, we orthogonalized the shocks using the following



31As Hernanke 11990)  observes, the predictive of the spread has declined in
recent years, and the spread failed to widen significantly prior to the
current recession. Many economists, however, associate the current recession
with a credit crunch on small firms. This observation and the fact the spread
hasn't widened is compatible with our evidence, which suggest that small firm
behavior is not highly correlated with the spread.

3Lrhestandard error bands are computed using 1000 draws from the
Normal-inverse Wishart posterior distribution of the coefficient vector,




                                             26
ordering: GNP, inflation, small minus large firms,           the Funds rate33 The
Funds rate is placed last to allow for the possibility          that the Federal
Reserve may Set this variable based on contemporaneous information about any

of the other variables.        Also implicit in   this formulation is the assumption
that it takes at least one period for the Funds rate to affect the other
variables. The overall Structure closely parallels Bernanke and Blinder

(1990).

     Figure   '7   suggests that   a shock to the    Funds   rate has a greater
cumulative impact on small firms than on large. When gauged against the

overall impact on GNP, the effect appears nontrivial. For more than two

years following     a rise in the   Funds   rate the expected    gp   between small and

large growth is more negative than the expected absolute decline in GNP

growth.   It also appears that small firms react more quickly; nearly half the
overall decline relative to large firms occurs in the first two quarters.

     A one    standard deviation increase      in GNP growth also     has a relatively
greater impact      on small   firms, though the difference with large firms is
smaller than in the case of the Funds rate shock. This difference is also
not significantly different from zero due in large part to noise in the

contemporaneous relationship with CNP, as the width of the standard error
bands   at period zero indicate.      Indeed, as Table 4 and Figures 5 and 6 show,

lagged GNP has a significantly stronger impact on small firms. This is
reflected in Figure 8 by the fact that, after period zero, the mean growth



33The impulse response functions are insensitive to the ordering the Funds
rate third rather than fourth. Also, if the three macro variables
are placed first, the precise ordering of the three makes no significant
difference.



                                               27
in the difference rises on net for four quarters and the standard error bands

do not widen appreciably.     Simultaneity between the manufacturing sector and
GNP could explain    the absence of a small firm effect in the contemporaneous
correlation (i.e., at period Zero).    The weaker results for GNP in

comparison with the Funds rate experiment may also suggest that monetary

policy is an important dimension of the differential behavior of small
firms.

     To check the robustness of our results on the impact of a monetary

shock, we repeat the experiment, this time using the Rorner dummies as the
indicators of the stance of monetary policy.          We   augment the Romer dates by

including   the credit crunch of   1966:Q2   as another episode during which

monetary policy shifted exogenously. Kashyap, Wilcox, and Stein (1990)
discuss evidence from a rereading of the          FOMC   minutes that suggests this

episode may    fit the criteria used   by   the   Romers.34

     We     follow Romer and Romer by including three years of lags (twelve

since we use quarterly data) of the dummy variables in our VAR system. We

estimate two different models. The          first includes GNP, inflation, the
difference between small and large firms, and the Romer dummies.               The second

adds the Funds    rate to the system. The purpose is to address the problem
that the Romer dummy does not measure the intensity of the policy shift.              A

crude way of capturing the overall degree           of monetary   tightness is to
include a    quantitative measure of the stance       of monetary policy along with

the qualitative dummies.




34Excluding    the credit crunch   does not significantly     alter the results.



                                               28
        Figures 9 thorugh 12 plot the response of the difference between sales
growth of small and large firms to a Romer episode, along with the
coefficients on the      Romer dummies.    The impact     of a   Romer episode on small

firms relative to large is clearly negative        and prolonged.    This is true
whether or not the Funds rate is included.          All   the Romer dummy coefficients
are negative, with five out of twelve being significantly different from
zero.     The impact is substantial.35 For two and         a half years following a
Rorner shock small firms sales drop more than four percent per year faster

than large firm sales.       This exceeds the absolute drop in the GNP growth
rate.     Also,   for most of the period, a   two—standard deviation    error band for
small minus large firm sales lies below zero.

        The overall sharp decline in small firms relative to large       is
in part due to the direct impact of the Funds rate and in part to the
indirect, effect of the decline in GNP. Either channel           is compatible with
our theory. Credit market imperfections induce a magnified response of
small firms to aggregate demand and technology shocks, as well as to

monetary shocks. As we argue later, alternative theories do not easily

explain our variety of facts.
        To further explore the role of financial factors, we also examine the

behavior of bank lending for each class of firms following tight money.36 We



35me Romer shock is not exactly comparable to the Funds rate shock, since in
the latter case, the dynamics permit the Funds rate to revert back to trend.
Another possible difference owes to the fact that asymmetries may be
present, since the credit frictions are more likley to bind in bad times
than in good times. Since the Romer dates include only tight money periods,
they may capture an asymmetric response.
    The QFR provides balance sheet        data   on bank lending    for the same



                                              29
add the real growth rates of bank lending to large and small firms to the

VAR system    that includes the Funds rate (but not the        Romer dummies). Figure

13   reports the cumulative response of each       of these   variables to a     one

standard deviation rise in the Funds rate. Clearly, lending to small firms

declines, while   it rises for large firms.   In Figure 14 we      perform a similar
experiment, this time using the ratio of the growth of bank loans to the

growth of sales for each class of firms.       The cumulative impact on              this
ratio for small firms is never significantly different from zero.               On   the
other hand, this ratio for large firms rises sharply for the          first year
after the Funds rate increase. Both the results in Figures           13   and   14    are
consistent with the possibility that monetary policy has a stronger direct

impact on small firms; and, relatedly,     that small firms are less able than
large firms to borrow to smooth the impact of declining sales.
     An informal graphical description of the sales data provides further

insight into our results. Figure    15   plots the sales growth of small and

large firms along with a smoothed version of these growth rates. The
smoothed    data is the product of a non-parametric filter designed to pick up
broad movements.3' In particular, the filter dampens the impact of infrequent

large   movements in the data.38 The smoothed         data is thus able to
characterize the differential behavior between, large and small firm growth



size categories as sales. We adjusted for level changes due to
reclassification using the same method we used when correcting sales,
37We smoothed the data using an Splus program that robustly smooths a time
series by means of running medians.
38me lines reflecting the smoothed data should not be interpreted as low
frequency trends. In contrast to the Hodrick-Prescott filter, this filter
Hodrick..Prescott filter, this filter does not decompose the the data into a
trend of lower frequency than the business cycle and a cyclical component.


                                              30
rates in sharp relief. The pictures in Figure 15 are in harmony with our
formal regression results. Small firms appear to exhibit much steeper and

larger declines around both recessions and              Rorner episodes. The only

exception    is the   1974 Rorner date, which coincided with        an oil shock. Indeed
it is interesting to note that         small   firms react more strongly than large
firms, not    only during     major monetary contractions, such as          1979, but also

during the more moderate contractions such as 1968 and 1978.

     Finally,   it is interesting to extend the analysis to the current
recession.    Figure    16   plots the growth rates of small and large firms from

1988:Q1 through 1991:Ql.         A smoothed      version of the data is presented in the

panel below.39        For six of the seven quarters in the period leading into the

recession, 1989:Q2 to l990:Q4, the growth rate of small firms is

substantially below the growth rate of large firms. There is some evidence
to suggest that in the latter half of this period, 1990:02 to 1990:04, the
relative slow growth of small firms may             have been due    to a credit crunch,
defined as a disruption of credit owing to poor health of the banking

system. This interpretation is based on the behavior of the financial
aggregates over this period, as plotted in Figure             17.

     Gradual monetary tightening appears to have occurred over the                  first
half of the overall period, l988:Q1 to l989:Q2.             This is reflected by the

steady decline in      M2    growth, the steady rise in the Funds rate, the mild
rise in the risk-spread,        and   the decline in the    mix variable.    This monetary

contraction appears to produce a decline in both small and large firm growth



39me smoothed data is obtained from applying the Splus program to the entire
sample period (1959:Ql - l991:Ql), and not only the recent quarters.

rates throughout        1989,   with the small firm growth rate falling faster.              All

the monetary aggregates reverse course in 1989:Q3, reflecting a beginning of
monetary ease. Symptoms of a crunch begin in 1990:Q1. While the Funds rate
and the risk—spread continue downward, (possibly reflecting continued

monetary ease),        M2   growth begins to decline and the mix variable falls

sharply.    One would expect problems in banking to reduce M2 growth and

growth of the mix. They would also tend to place downward pressure on the
spread, owing to a decline             in the issuance of CDs.4°       The   credit crunch

interpretation is buttressed by the fact that for the three quarters
subsequent to 1990:01, small firms grow             at a rate considerably below large
firms.
      It is worth adding that            the overall picture is consistent with our

general finding that small firms have tended to move positively with both                      M2

and the mix (after controlling for GNP, inflation, and large firms), while

large firms       have tended     to   move inversely   with the risk spread (after

controlling for        ChIP,   inflation and small firms).       It   is also interesting to

observe how well small firm behavior tracks the mix, with a one period lag.

Indeed,    the   one   quarter in the interval 1989:02       —   1990:04 where small     firms

grew faster than large firms was preceeded by rapid growth of the mix. This
                                                                                               5
one period       lag also appears in the formal econometric work (see Figures


400ne differenceof the current recession from the previous ones is that the
growth rate of managed liabilities of financial intermediaries (large CDs and
Eurodollar deposits) declined in the period preceding the downturn.   In the
past, managed liabilities have grown sharply as financialareinstitutions have
tried to offset the effects of tight money. Since CDs        close substitutes
for commercial paper, the contraction in the supply of managed liabilities
may be part of the explanation for why the risk spread did not rise
appreciably this time around. See Bernanke (1990) for a general discussion.

5.    Concluding Remarks
       Macroeconomics has traditionally focused on    the behavior   of   large
firms. In our view, small firms deserve attention as well. Because they

are more likely to face credit market imperfections, small firms are

particularly sensitive to   macroeconomic disturbances, including    shifts   in

monetary policy. The evidence in this paper      is supportive of this view.         We

show, using several methodologies,    that monetary   policy has   a relatively
larger impact    on small firms.   Perhaps the most striking statistic     is that
for a period of two years      and a half following a Romer episode       of tight

money, the average annual growth rate of small manufacturing firms is more
than four percentage points below the average annual growth rate of large

manufacturing firms.
       Our coefficient estimates suggest   that the differential response of
small firms to tight money is due both to the direct impact of monetary

policy and to the- indirect impact working through the overall decline in

economic    activity (small firms are more sensitive to   movements in GNP).

Either channel is consistent with our emphasis on credit market

imperfections, since the model we developed predicts that small firms should
be excessively sensitive not only to to    interest rates, but also to demand
or technology shifts.    The   fact that bank loans to small firms decline
following a rise in the Funds rate, while they instead rise for large firms,
is further evidence compatible with our emphasis on financial factors.

       Could   a frictionless framework explain our results?   One possibility       is
that small firms are concentrated in industries that are both


                                            33
highly-interest sensitive and cyclical, implying that we are merely
capturing industry effects. The data required to fully resolve this issue
is currently incomplete. The available data, however, suggests            that a
simple industry effects story is unlikely; it indicates no particular

pattern in the distribution of small firms between cyclical versus
non—cyclical manufacturing industries.        A   second possibility is   that
technological factors make small firms more volatile, perhaps because they
are generally less capital intensive (e.g. Mills and Schumann (1985)).'
However, pure technological stories could easily lead to the opposite

predictions.     One could argue,     for example, that large firms should have

greater flexibility     in   responding to shocks because they are likely to have

greater excess capacity.         And being more capital intensive also should,

everything else equal, make large firms more sensitive to interest               rate
shifts. Explaining the differential response of bank lending for small                  and

large firms to Funds rate shocks also appears problematic in a perfect
markets setting.       Nonetheless, we agree that discriminating between these
various hypotheses is clearly an item deserving of further research.

        A   related objective, which we are currently pursuing, is expanding the
data set     beyond   the manufacturing Sector.     Because   the percentage      of small

firms in the manufacturing sector is well below the percentage for the
economy      as a whole (see Gertler and     Hubbard (1989)),   it is quite possible



410ur  results cannot be explained by the fact that small firms are typically
less diversified. This kind of story explains why small firms may have a lot
of idiosyncratic volatility, but is does not explain systematic volatility
(i.e., co—movement with the cycle). Nor, in the absence of informational
frictions, can it explain a greater sensitivity to monetary policy.



                                               34
that our analysis has understated the overall macroeconomic relevance of
small firms.

     Finally worth noting are the results that both    M2   and the mix between

commercial paper and bank loan financing contain considerably more

predictive power for small firms than for large firms (while at the same
time, the commercial paper/ T-bill spread is a better predictor for large
firms).   Both M2 and   the mix variable are financial aggregates that are tied
closely to the performance of banking.    And small   firms have traditionally
been heavily dependent on bank financing. These kinds of financial/real

regularities should not occur in a Miller/Modiglianiworld. Our results,
therefore, are sympathetic to theories emphasizing the behavior of banks
(and, relatedly, the behavior of small firms and other "small"
borrowers) both in the monetary transmission mechanism and in the business

cycle.

                        Appendix: The Case               of Rationing

     The impact of   a rise in the promised payment on the expected return to
the firm's debt is given   by (1    -    p)   - /28x     Ithe denominator in ap/8x        --    see

equation (6)1. In the text we implicitly assumed that this value is
positive, which guarantees   that the supply curve in Figure              1   is always
upward sloping. This hypothesis          is quite reasonable under plausible
outcomes for the bankruptcy probability p and for the ratio of the default
cost to output. It is conceivable that this condition is violated for very
small firms, in particular, for firms where              G   is quite small relative to    '.
For these kinds of firms, the supply curve bends backwards.                    The optimum          is
accordingly the maximum feasible value of x.                  Even though these    firms are
'rationed, however, shifts in e          and   r still   have   a magnified impact.            In

analogy to Williamson (1987), the solution under rationing is found as
follows: Conditional on x, the choice of p which yields the maximum

expected return to the intermediary            is given by the condition that the net
marginal rise in the intermediary's expected payoff equal zero:

                               (1   -    p)    - /2Ox     = 0                                       (Al)

This condition and equation (3), which requires that the intermediary receive

a competitive return, then jointly determine x and p.                 Further, by
incorporating (7), (3) may be simplified to
                                        2 =                                                         (A2)
                                    p       )1/2))r/&)x

     Figure   4 illustrates the equilibrium for the rationing case.                The supply

curve bends backward before it intersects the demand curve. The value of x at
which   it bends backward is the optimum. Equations                 (Al) and (A2) define        this



                                                   36
value.

         Relative to the benchmark of perfect markets, x                        is more responsive to
shifts in    B   and r.        A   percentage rise in    r   induces more than a percentage

decline in x.       (Recall        that this elasticity is     —   1   under perfect markets.)

The argument may be seen in two steps.                       Because in        this case raising the
promised payment reduces the intermediary's expected return, the rise in                             r
requires a       fall in   x   to reduce the size of the           loan.       The fall in x, however,

increases the average ex post bankruptcy cost,                         '/8x,   forcing a further
reduction in x, in order to bring down the default probability p.                           In   terms of
Figure 2, the rise in              r rotates the   supply curve upward, shifting the optimum
inward. For analogous reasoning,                   a shift   in e also has a magnified impact on

x.
