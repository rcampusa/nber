                                          ABSTRACT

We assess the importance of the precautionary saving motive by relying on a direct question about

precautionary wealth from the 1995 and 1998 waves of the Survey of Consumer Finances. In this

survey, a new question has been designed to elicit the amount of desired precautionary wealth. This

allows us to bound the amount of precautionary accumulation and to overcome many of the problems

of previous works on this topic. We find that a precautionary saving motive exists and affects

virtually every type of household. Even though this motive does not give rise to large amounts of

wealth for young and middle-age households, it is particularly important for two groups: older

households and business owners. Overall, we provide strong evidence that we need to take the

precautionary saving motive into account when modeling saving behavior.

1. Introduction

       One of the major innovations of the literature on consumers’ behavior has been the

theory of precautionary saving. This theory predicts that risk depresses consumption and

increases the accumulation of wealth. In some theoretical specifications, the precautionary

saving motive is the main reason to hold wealth. Is this true empirically? As illustrated in the

first sections of the paper, the empirical work on precautionary saving to date faces several

challenges, which ultimately make it very difficult to disentangle the quantitative importance of

this motive.

       In our work, we adopt a new approach to study the importance of precautionary saving.

We rely on a question from the 1995 and 1998 waves of the Survey of Consumer Finances

(SCF95 and SCF98 hereafter), where respondents are asked to report directly their desired

amount of precautionary wealth. This subjective measure of precautionary accumulation allows

us to bound the size of the precautionary saving motive and to overcome many of the problems

of previous work on this topic.

       We find that a precautionary saving motive exists and affects virtually every household.

Thus, models that rely on quadratic preferences or certainty equivalence are not a good

characterization of consumers’ behavior. But we also find that this motive does not give rise to

high amounts of wealth at the aggregate level. Desired precautionary wealth represents

approximately 8 percent of total net worth and 20 percent of total financial wealth in the

economy. However, we can identify two groups in the population for which the precautionary

saving motive is particularly important: older households/cohorts and business owners. These

groups alone account for the majority (65 percent) of total desired precautionary wealth. Close

examination of both groups suggests that not just income risk but also other risks should be

                                                 1
taken into account when modeling saving behavior. Because these groups play such a pivotal

role, analyses that include or exclude households close to or after retirement and/or business

owners are bound to deliver very different estimates of the precautionary saving motive.

       Our work provides additional results to assess more accurately households’ behavior

toward saving. For example, we find there is great heterogeneity in precautionary accumulation,

much more than has been reported in previous work. Existing theoretical models need to be

enriched to account for the large differences in wealth holdings we observe even within the same

observable economic group or class of risk. Furthermore, we find that measures of

accumulation, such as liquid or financial net worth, are too restrictive and provide a rather

inaccurate account of the stock of resources households have available to buffer themselves

against shocks. In addition, our findings help explain both the behavior of families at the bottom

of the wealth distribution, where risk interacts with the presence of welfare programs, and the

behavior of families at the top of the wealth distribution, where business owners are very

prominent.

       This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we review some of the previous

literature on precautionary saving and discuss the problems associated with measuring risk and

precautionary wealth. We also outline other pitfalls of the empirical estimates of precautionary

accumulation. In Section 3, we describe our alternative approach based on a subjective measure

of precautionary wealth and provide our estimates. In Sections 4 and 5, we discuss our findings

and provide concluding remarks.

 2. The Importance of the Precautionary Saving Motive: Review of the Previous Literature

 Theoretical intertemporal models of consumption/saving with income uncertainty predict that

 precautionary wealth can explain a large share of total wealth accumulation.1 For example,

 Skinner (1988) calculates that about half of household wealth can be explained by precautionary

 savings due to income risk. Caballero (1991), Cagetti (2000), and Gourinchas and Parker (2002)

 report similar results. However, the empirical evidence based on micro data yields mixed results.

 Here we identify three sets of papers, which provide widely differing estimates. The first set,

 which finds estimates in the lowest range, includes the empirical work of Skinner (1988) and

 Dynan (1993). Looking across occupation groups to assess the effect of occupation-specific

 risks, Skinner (1988) finds no evidence that households in riskier occupations save more.

 Similarly, Dynan (1993) argues the empirical estimates of the coefficient of relative prudence

 are too small to generate precautionary saving. The second set of papers, including Guiso,

 Jappelli and Terlizzese (1992), Lusardi (1997, 1998, 2000), and Arrondel (2002), uses subjective

 measures of income risk and find modest values for precautionary wealth–estimates range from

 2 to 8 percent of total household wealth accumulation. The final set of papers, including

 Dardanoni (1991), Engen and Gruber (2001), Hubbard, Skinner and Zeldes (1995), Carroll and

 Samwick (1997, 1998), and Kazarosian (1997), finds that precautionary savings can explain a

 sizable share of wealth. For example, according to Carroll and Samwick (1998), up to 50 percent

 of the wealth of the median household consists of precautionary wealth.

            This disturbingly large range of estimates makes it very hard to assess the importance



        1
          In our analysis, we concentrate mainly on wealth accumulation and we do not study the effect of the
precautionary saving motive on consumption, labor supply, or other aspects of economic behavior at the household or
aggregate level.

                                                         3
of the precautionary saving motive. Underlying these differences are various sources of data and

empirical methodologies. In addition, there are several conceptual issues that affect the ability of

the econometrician to estimate the precautionary saving motive as we discuss below. These

issues, particularly those related to the measurement of wealth and risk, led us to follow a

different approach to assess the importance of the precautionary saving motive, which is

reported in Section 3.



2.1 Pitfalls and Biases in Estimating the Importance of the Precautionary Saving Motive

       Most of the empirical work on precautionary saving has been focused on the estimation

of the following equation:




where Wh indicates wealth of household h, risk is a measure of the risk faced by household h, Yp

is permanent income, X is a set of controls for wealth including age, demographics, and other

household characteristics, and g and f indicate the functions to measure wealth and the

relationship between wealth and the right-hand-side variables respectively. The extent to which

wealth increases with risk forms the basis for estimating the importance of the precautionary

saving motive.

       Several pitfalls and potential biases limit the empirical work using this specification. In

this section, we address eight such issues and discuss how they are likely to affect the estimates

of the importance of the precautionary saving motive. They guide our approach in finding

alternative ways to estimate the size of precautionary savings.

1: The measurement of wealth and risk

                                                 4
       Which measure of wealth should be used in the estimation of precautionary

accumulation? This is one of the most critical issues in estimating precautionary savings. The

problem is that many components of wealth differ in terms of their liquidity, accessibility, and

suitability as collateral against borrowing, among other features. As mentioned in Browning and

Lusardi (1996), only under the certainty equivalence model, can we sum across components of

wealth. Thus, in a model with precautionary saving, different components of wealth are not

perfectly substitutable.

       Some authors, such as Engen and Gruber (2001), Hrung (2000) and Alan (2004), have

simply considered a measure of liquid wealth (which includes mostly savings and checking

accounts, bonds, stocks and short-term debt) when estimating precautionary wealth. However,

liquid wealth is a very restrictive measure of accumulation since the large majority of US

households hold other assets in their portfolios (Kennickell, Starr-McCluer, and Sundén (1997)).

Moreover, households hold relatively little in liquid wealth. Typically, the largest asset among

households is housing equity. Given the development of home equity lines of credit, housing

wealth has become much more liquid than in the past. However, this development does not mean

that housing equity or real estate wealth can be taken as perfect substitutes for liquid assets.

There are often transaction costs associated with setting up such loans. In addition, if the house

is liquidated quickly, the sales price may be well below a longer-term market value (which

approximates what households are asked to report in wealth surveys).

       Another large component of wealth, particularly for middle-age and older workers, is

designated retirement accounts, such as IRAs and Keogh plans and pension accounts like




                                                  5
 401(k)s.2 While there are tax advantages in investing in these assets, the investment is not fully

 accessible without incurring an early-withdrawal penalty until age 59½. Thus, one cannot simply

 use the current market value of these assets (Poterba, (2003)). One component of wealth, that is

 particularly hard to deal with is business equity. Although entrepreneurs are not a large portion

 of the population, they hold as much as 40% of total wealth (Gentry and Hubbard (2004)).

 Because such wealth is often hard to liquidate and may be difficult to leverage, it is not clear

 how much of it might be relevant as precautionary wealth. Another important issue is how to

 treat debt. Most households only need to service their debt. Thus, only the required loan

 payments over some period need to be netted from assets, rather than subtracting all the short

 and long term debt.

            To summarize: the practice of assigning a weight of one or zero to the individual

 components of wealth (the function g in the equation above) represents a crude and often

 inappropriate way to measure household resources. Most importantly, it may lead to misleading

 estimates of the extent of precautionary accumulation. The idea that precautionary savings may

 explain a large amount of liquid assets becomes less useful in light of the fact that liquid assets

 are only a small proportion of a potentially much larger pool of precautionary wealth for many

 families.

            As far as the measurement of risk is concerned, much of the empirical work on

 precautionary saving has concentrated on one source of risk: income risk. Researchers have

 modeled a household-specific stochastic process for income and estimated it using panel data.



        2
          See, among others, Poterba, Venti and Wise (1994). It is worth noting that such tax-preferred accounts
defer sometimes substantial amounts of taxes until the point when funds are removed from the accounts. Thus, as an
indication of future consumption possibilities, balances in these account are overstated.

                                                         6
The variance of earnings or non-capital income has then been used as a proxy for risk, as in the

third set of papers mentioned above that find evidence of sizable precautionary savings.

However, there are several shortcomings in this approach. First, it is difficult to distinguish

empirically between transitory income and measurement error. Second and more importantly,

workers may know more than the econometrician. What is calculated empirically as income

variation could potentially be well-known and insured against (Caballero (1991) and Browning

and Lusardi (1996)). In principle, subjective measures of income risk obviate many of the

problems with estimated income processes, but they often result in very low estimates of income

risk.

        In addition to income, other risks can also affect household accumulation. Two that have

been investigated thus far are longevity risk and health risk, as in Davies (1981), Leung (1994),

Starr-McCluer (1996), Hubbard, Skinner, and Zeldes (1995), and Palumbo (1999), among

others. These risks, in particular health, are also hard to measure directly, and we do not yet have

reliable subjective measures. This list does not exhaust the sources of risks that households can

face; interest rate or investment risk and also consumption risk (for example, the risk that

durable good break down and should be replaced quickly) can be important for households.

These risks are also very hard to measure.

2: Preferences

        The extent of precautionary accumulation depends not just on risk, but also on

preferences regarding risk (Caballero (1990, 1991), Cagetti (2000), and Attanasio, Banks,

Meghir and Weber (1999)). Another key factor is the rate of time preference (Deaton (1991) and

Carroll (1992, 1996)). However, very few data sets include information on such preferences and

those that do show, for example, substantial variation in the coefficient of risk aversion (Barsky,

                                                  7
Kimball, Juster, and Shapiro (1997)). Assuming the same preferences across the sample can

yield, at best, imprecise estimates of the importance of precautionary saving.

          Differences in preferences can have other important implications. Workers who are risk-

averse may self-select into occupations (or even specific types of employers within industries)

that offer job security. If risk aversion is positively correlated with prudence, these workers may

also save more.3 In this case, there is a likely downward bias in the estimates of the

precautionary saving motive, as reported by Lusardi (1997, 2000) and Fuchs-Schündeln and

Schündeln (2003). Such selection might explain why Skinner (1988) finds no evidence of

precautionary savings when examining workers across different occupation groups.

3: Liquidity constraints

          Precautionary accumulation is strongly affected by the presence of liquidity constraints.

To the extent that households can borrow, they may not need much wealth to shield themselves

against shocks. In fact, theoretical models of precautionary saving do not necessarily predict that

wealth will be (strictly) positive; it is possible that risk prevents households from going heavily

into debt, but they still do not hold positive amounts of wealth. In many models, there are

devices that implicitly or explicitly prevent such behavior. For example, some authors add

constraints that disallow negative wealth (Deaton (1992, chapter 6)). Others consider specific

characterizations of risk (Carroll (1992)). Differences in borrowing opportunities are very

relevant to assess the importance of the precautionary saving motive. However, individual

borrowing opportunities are largely unobservable in most data sets.

4: Other forms of insurance



      3
       See Kimball (1990), for an explanation of the role of prudence in models of precautionary saving.

                                                       8
      Models of precautionary saving rely on the assumption that insurance markets are

imperfect or do not exist. While markets can be imperfect, individuals can insure against risk not

only by accumulating wealth but also through a network of family and friends or other informal

channels. If agents can receive help when they are hit by shocks, they do not need to amass much

precautionary savings. Thus, it is critical to differentiate those individuals who have access to

sources of help and support (Lusardi (1998, 2000)). Similarly, there exists insurance offered by

the government (unemployment benefits, health and disability insurance, etc). One complication

with public insurance in the US is that many welfare programs are means-tested. This creates a

strong disincentive to hold wealth, (Hubbard, Skinner and Zeldes (1995)). Consequently, even

households facing high risk, particularly those with low permanent income, may find it optimal

to hold very little wealth. Thus, there may be severe non-linearities in the relationship between

wealth and risk, which highlight the importance of choosing the correct functional form as

discussed next.

5: Functional forms

       The relationship between wealth and risk (the function f) may display a non-linear shape

not only because of the behavior of households at the bottom of the wealth distribution, but also

because of the behavior of those at the top of the wealth distribution. Households at the top of

the distribution are disproportionately business owners, who may display different preferences

and face different risks or constraints than more typical households (Hurst and Lusardi (2004)).

       The functional form chosen in many studies involves the logarithm of wealth, a

transformation which excludes a substantial fraction of the population (9 percent of households




                                                 9
 had net worth of zero or below in SCF98).4 This exclusion is highly undesirable. That these

 excluded households hold no wealth or are in debt may be related to features of the welfare

 system, individual preferences, or a prior, substantial negative shock. It is hard to argue these

 characteristics are not correlated with the precautionary motive. Indeed, some of these excluded

 households are precisely those that may face high risks. As a result, samples with such

 exclusions are very likely to suffer from a selectivity bias.

 6: Macro and past shocks

            While there has been an extensive discussion of the importance of macro shocks in the

 estimation of Euler equations,5 this topic has been largely ignored in the estimation of

 precautionary saving. It is, nevertheless, important in this context as well. Simply, it is not

 possible to estimate the extent of precautionary accumulation using a single cross-section of

 wealth data alone. The problem may be best understood with an example. Suppose that, because

 of a national housing market bust, the wealth of homeowners was substantially reduced, but only

 temporarily (the housing market recovers in the future and goes back to the original

 equilibrium). Suppose further, as it is not unreasonable, that homeowners are less likely to face

 high earnings risk. Simple regressions of total net worth on income risk lead to biased estimates

 of the extent of precautionary accumulation. Similarly, during a recession, those households

 facing high unemployment risk are also those more likely to be hit by shocks that deplete their




        4
         See Carroll, Dynan and Krane (2003) for an alternative functional form that does not exclude the zero-
wealth observations.


        5
         See the discussion in Browning and Lusardi (1996) and the references therein.

                                                         10
resources. Thus, some high risk households may have temporary low wealth and it is important

to account for past shocks (Carroll, Dynan and Krane (2003)).

7: Precautionary saving and portfolio choice

       Risk affects not only wealth but also portfolio choice. Drèze and Modigliani (1972) show

that, unless income risk is perfectly insurable, consumption and portfolio decisions are not

separable. To date, however, most of the saving and portfolio choice models have been estimated

separately. A series of empirical papers has found that agents who face high earnings risk invest

less in stocks (Guiso, Jappelli and Terlizzese (1996), Haliassos and Bertaut (1995), and

Hochguertel (2003)). Additionally, business owners, although they hold large amounts of wealth,

are less likely to invest in publicly traded stocks (Heaton and Lucas (2000)). Stocks, however,

were one of the fastest growing components of wealth in the 1990s. Given the extraordinary

returns of the stock market in the 1990s, wealth is likely to be very high for households that have

invested in stocks. At the same time, many of these same households face low income risk.

Again, regressions of wealth on income risk may tell us little about the importance of the

precautionary saving motive. Estimates may be particularly sensitive to the inclusion or

exclusion of business owners in the sample.

8: Other motives to save

       In addition to the precautionary motive, there are other motives to save, and it may be

difficult to disentangle them. For example, entrepreneurs are likely to face very high risk, and

thus, would be expected to save more. These households do hold a lot of wealth and mostly in

their business(es). However, business wealth may be the reward for work in the business

(sometimes as a partial substitute for a salary or pension), a shield against shocks, a current

valuation of future profits, or simply the price of independence in work. Similarly, it may be

                                                 11
hard to disentangle the precautionary saving motive from the bequest motive using wealth data

for older households. These households may wish to leave wealth to their heirs, but they may

retain their wealth until the end of life in case shocks hit or possibly as an instrument to ensure

the attention of the heirs. While many theoretical models of precautionary savings abstract from

these and other motives to save, such motives can play an important role empirically. Moreover,

the data needed to control for such factors are often not available.

       A summary of the aforementioned issues and their effects on the empirical estimates of

precautionary wealth is reported in Table 1. Clearly, some of the problems are interdependent.

While their effects may not be equally important, almost all of them present problems for the

estimation of precautionary saving using current methods and existing data sets. As the last

column of the table outlines, the effects of these issues on the estimates of the precautionary

saving motive go in different directions. Thus, it is hard to determine whether current estimates

in the literature represent a downward- or upward- biased estimate of the true amount of

precautionary wealth.



3. An Alternative Approach: A Direct Measure of Desired Precautionary Savings

       As the previous section shows, it is at best very difficult—sometimes impossible—to

estimate the extent of precautionary accumulation using the methods and types of data that have

prevailed in the existing literature. In this paper, we follow a different approach. We rely on a

question about precautionary wealth that one of the authors participated in designing for the

SCF. Our theoretical frame of reference is the ‘buffer-stock’ model, which we summarize below

as the foundation of the theoretical predictions we exploit in our work.



                                                 12
 3.1 The “Buffer-Stock” Model of Saving

            The theoretical model that has guided our empirical work is the “buffer-stock” model of

 saving, as derived by Carroll (1996, 1997) and Deaton (1991). These authors consider an

 intertemporal model of consumption behavior under uncertainty and show that, in their

 specifications, consumers have a target wealth to income ratio. Consumers want to hold a

 “buffer-stock” of wealth to insure against risk; when wealth goes below the target, saving will

 increase, and when wealth is above the target, saving will decrease. As Carroll (1997) argues,

 this is an appealing feature of the model and may well be aligned with the predictions of many

 financial planners, who traditionally advise people to hold a certain ratio of wealth to long-run

 income as precaution against shocks. Similarly and most importantly, Deaton (1992, pages 202-

 203) shows the underlying maximization problem may be quite difficult to solve formally, but

 simple rules can closely approximate the optimal behavior. Thus, it is not unrealistic to expect

 households to be able to report the approximate size of the “buffer-stock” they wish to hold.

            The model delivers predictions that can be tested empirically. First, the size of the

 “buffer-stock” households want to hold is a positive function of risk. Not only is risk important,

 but also preference parameters, such as the degree of impatience play a pivotal role. According

 to the simulations of Carroll (1997), Carroll and Samwick (1998) and Deaton (1991), when

 households are impatient, precautionary savings can be relatively small, particularly for younger

 consumers and up to the age of 50. There is another important prediction: if there is no floor to

 income, the target level of wealth chosen by consumers is strictly positive; consumers will not

 let their wealth fall to zero, as there would otherwise be a chance that consumption goes to zero.6


        6
           This no-borrowing behavior has much to do with the assumption about preferences and the fact that the
utility function is of the CRRA form. If preferences were of the CARA form, consumers would be willing to let assets

                                                         13
             As reported in Sections 2 and 2.1, a great deal of empirical work has attempted to assess

 the importance of the precautionary saving motive. In this project, we follow a different

 approach and ask respondents directly about the size of the stock of wealth they would like to

 hold to shield themselves against shocks.



 3.2 A Direct Measure of Precautionary Savings

             The SCF95 introduced a new question intended to elicit the size of the “buffer-stock” that

 households would like to hold.7 The exact wording of the question is as follows:



             “About how much do you think you and your family need to have in savings for

             unanticipated emergencies and other unexpected things that may come up?”



 This question directly elicits the amount of desired “buffer-stock” savings and provides an

 alternative way to bound the extent of precautionary accumulation. Much work was devoted to

 pre-testing the question, assessing whether the question was understood, and identifying the

 difficulty in answering.8 The exact wording of the question also merits consideration. First, the

 reason for asking households what they “need to have in savings” rather what they have is that


be zero or negative.


         7
          This question has been retained in later waves of the SCF. This question has now been added to the 2003
Italian Survey of Household Income and Wealth.

         8
          This question is placed after a sequence of questions about saving and planning, and this context was
selected specifically to create the correct cognitive framework for respondents to focus on the intent of the question.
From the given responses, it appears that respondents did not have much difficulty with the question. In SCF95, only
about three percent of the respondents answered “don’t know” and were subsequently unable to provide even a range
of values upon probing by the interviewer.

                                                           14
 their wealth may be out of equilibrium due to negative or positive shocks. The fact that some

 households have zero or low actual wealth does not necessarily mean that they do not have a

 precautionary saving motive; rather they may have faced past shocks. Second, the

 phrase“unanticipated emergencies and other unexpected things that may come up” mirrors what

 households most commonly report in open-ended SCF questions concerning current motives to

 save. In SCF95, over 36 percent of participants gave such a response, as reported in the

 appendix Table A1. In other surveys that collect similar information on saving motives, such a

 “precautionary motive” is consistently the most frequently reported saving motive.9 “Unforeseen

 events,”and “emergencies” are the descriptions respondents most often put forward when asked

 about their motive to save. Third, this measure does not restrict attention to income risk only.

             There are several advantages to this method. First, it allows us to obtain a household-

 specific amount of desired precautionary accumulation directly, thus circumventing the problems

 of unobservable preferences, borrowing possibilities, and informal or formal insurance schemes

 (issues 2, 3, and 4 discussed in Section 2.1). Second, our method allows for risks beyond income

 risk. Third, it measures the amount of “desired” (or equilibrium) precautionary savings rather

 than the “actual” amount of savings. This is a substantial advantage, particularly in dealing with

 households that have depleted their precautionary buffer of wealth as a result of past shocks


         9
           See Kennickell (1995). Alessie, Lusardi and Aldershof (1997) examine the motives to save in the Dutch
Socio-Economic Panel and report that the most frequently indicated motive to save is for “unforeseen events.” The
proportion of respondents choosing this motive remains high and constant over the life cycle. Similar findings are
reported when using the Dutch CentERdata panel. In this case, households are asked to report on a scale from 1 to 7
the importance of several motives to save. Of the listed 13 motives, the one that received the highest score was “save
as a reserve to cover unforeseen expenses.” Similarly, in the new German SAVE survey, households have to rate the
importance of 9 saving motives using a scale from 1 to 10. The motive that was considered most important by nearly
all families is “saving as a precaution for unexpected events” (see Börsch-Supan and Essig (2003) for detail).
Looking at data for Japan, Horioka, Yokot and Miyaji (1994) find that of the listed 12 motives to save, respondents
have chosen most often the precautionary saving motive which is indicated as: “for illness, disasters, and other
unforeseen expenditures.”

                                                          15
(issue 6). Finally, we avoid the problem of defining what measure of wealth is the appropriate

one for gauging the variation in precautionary savings across households (issue 1).

       There are also disadvantages in working with such subjective questions. For example, the

question may turn out to be difficult for survey participants to understand and may be answered

imprecisely. In addition, respondents may consider only their preferences and not think of

budget constraints. They may also be led to think of current or small risks; alternatively, they

may consider every possible risk over their remaining life but fail to discount the future. Such

problems are not unique to our work; they also surface in the literature using subjective measures

of income risk. In the following sections, we provide a detailed evaluation of this question and

show that these data are not simply noise.



3.3 Some Descriptive Findings about Desired Precautionary Savings

       Figure 1 reports the density of desired precautionary savings in the total sample using

data from SCF95.10 We first note that the reported amounts are concentrated in the range of

$5,000 to $10,000. However, a small proportion of households also reports very high amounts

of precautionary wealth. Thus, the precautionary saving motive can potentially rationalize high

amounts of wealth holdings as well. Figure 1 also shows there is much heterogeneity in saving

behavior, even when focusing on the precautionary saving motive alone.

       In Figure 2, we overlap the densities of desired precautionary savings from the surveys in

1995 and in 1998 (in 1995 dollars). As the figure shows, the distributions of answers are

remarkably similar. This is what we expect empirically, given that it was a period in which



      10
           For a description of the SCF, see the data appendix.

                                                          16
 unemployment risk was rather stable, and there were no major changes, at least at the aggregate

 level, in health, longevity, or other risks. At the same time, household wealth increased

 dramatically due to the very high returns in the stock market and housing market, which should

 not have affected the amount of desired precautionary savings (as long as permanent income did

 not increase sharply in that short time period). As mentioned in Section 2.1 (issues 6 and 7),

 episodes in which increases in wealth are dominated by capital gains make it very difficult to

 evaluate precautionary savings indirectly and underscore the importance of using subjective

 measures of desired precautionary wealth. The distribution of this measure from two

 independent cross sections supports a view that the data are more than just noise. Given the

 close similarity of the two distributions, we pool the data from SCF95 and SCF98 in the

 remainder of this paper (all dollar figures are reported in 1995 dollars).

         To bring further credibility to our measure and to explain some of the heterogeneity in

 the whole sample, we examine the distribution of desired precautionary savings across age for

 each of three education groups: less than 12 years of education, 12-15 years of education, 16

 years of education and higher.11 The distribution of desired precautionary savings generally

 mirrors the distribution of wealth across education groups (Figures 3a-c). As reported by many

 authors (particularly Bernheim and Scholz (1993) and Hubbard, Skinner and Zeldes (1995)), the

 shape of the wealth distribution varies greatly by education; wealth is particularly low for those

 with low education. Figure 3a confirms this fact. The distribution of desired precautionary

 savings is low for the group with less than high school education, and the values remain low



        11
           In a simple cross-section, we cannot distinguish between age and cohort effects. Thus, when we consider
age we do not mean to characterize “age” versus “cohort” effects. To avoid confusion, we use both terms or simply
use the term “older sample” to characterize this group in the population.

                                                         17
 across age groups. However, values increase overall as we move to groups with higher education

 (Figures 3b-c). These values are much higher for households headed by people older than 50.

         To address further the heterogeneity exhibited in these plots and to isolate the effects of

 different types of risk, we split the population into three subgroups. A large fraction of

 households at the top of the wealth distribution are business owners (Kennickell (2000), Gentry

 and Hubbard (2004), Hurst and Lusardi (2004)). The risks such people face may often be quite

 different from those faced by other households. To allow for more detailed investigation of these

 risks, we consider a sample of business owners only, while we divide the remaining sample

 between those in working years and those who are retired or close to retirement. The precise

 definition of the groups is as follows: households that do not own a business and have an

 employed head aged 25 to 61 (hereafter, “main sample”), households that do not own a business

 and have a head aged 62 or older (hereafter, “older sample”), and households that own a business

 in which they have an active management interest (hereafter, “business sample”).12 An

 additional advantage of working with the SCF is that, since it over-samples wealthy households,

 all these sub-samples, including the business owners, are of relatively large sizes (the number of

 observations are 4,105, 1,634 and 2,236 for the main sample, the older sample, and the business

 sample respectively). Note that these three groups face not only substantially different risks, but

 also different types of constraints and preferences. These are important factors for assessing the

 empirical importance of precautionary saving and, as mentioned in in Section 2.1 (issues 2-4), it

 has been hard to account for them empirically. For example, business owners may be less averse



        12
           Three groups are omitted. First, we exclude households without business holdings and with a head under
the age of 62 who was not working at the time of the interview, and households with a head aged less than 25. These
groups were too small and heterogeneous to model with the available data.

                                                         18
to risk than respondents in other groups and may have self-selected into jobs with high risks,

while older households may be less likely to face liquidity constraints than young households or

business owners.

         As the densities in Figure 4 indicate, desired precautionary savings is much larger and

values are more dispersed for older sample and the business sample than for the main sample.

Particularly for the business sample, the distribution has a long fat right tail. While the median

member of the main sample desires to hold $5,000 (mean of $11,000) in terms of precautionary

savings, the median household in the older sample wants much more— $7,600 (mean of

$29,000). The median desired precautionary holding of business owners is the largest at $10,000

(mean of $33,000).

       To further underscore the differences in the three subsamples, we note that while the

main sample accounts for 50 percent of the population, it accounts for only 29 percent of total

desired precautionary savings. The older sample accounts for 24 percent of the population, but

41 percent of total desired precautionary savings; the business sample accounts for only 11

percent of the population, but 24 percent of total desired precautionary savings. Together, these

two latter groups account for as much as 65 percent of total precautionary savings. Overall, these

simple statistics indicate that the treatment of older households and business owners is likely to

play a pivotal role in estimating the precautionary saving motive. We return to this point in

Section 4.



3.4 Evaluating the Importance of Precautionary Savings

       In this section, we report a more formal evaluation of the predictions of the theory and try

to assess the importance of the precautionary saving motive. We first examine the size of the

                                                 19
“buffer-stock” relative to various measures of actual wealth and then show that the measure of

desired precautionary savings reported by SCF respondents correlates with risks and other

determinants of wealth.

        The comparison of desired precautionary savings and actual wealth is complicated by

the factors discussed in Section 2.1. First, some households may be away from their equilibrium

or target level of wealth because of prior shocks (issue 6). Second, the “correct” concept of

wealth to examine is dependent on a variety of preferences and institutional factors governing

the liquidity of various assets (issue 1). Because total net worth and financial net worth are the

two measures of wealth considered in the majority of the empirical studies on precautionary

savings, we begin by comparing these measures with desired precautionary savings.

       The amount of desired precautionary savings is frequently larger than financial assets

(defined as the sum of net savings and checking deposits, savings bonds, stocks net of margin

loans, bonds, mutual funds, and the net cash value of life insurance). We find that financial

wealth is less than desired precautionary savings in 48 percent of cases in the main sample, 39

percent of cases among the older sample, and 36 percent for the business sample. When

considering total net worth (defined as financial assets with the addition of IRAs, other

retirement accounts, housing equity, other real estate, business equity and vehicles minus

associated debts, and the net value of miscellaneous assets and debts), the figures change

considerably. Net worth is below desired precautionary savings in 17 percent of cases in the

main sample, 14 percent in the sample of the older, and 5 percent among business owners.

       Given all of the problems noted earlier in measuring wealth, we have also defined an

alternative measure of accumulation (“liquidable wealth” hereafter). We have summed financial

wealth and given a weight of 0.5 to home equity, other real estate, business equity, vehicles, and

                                                 20
 other miscellaneous assets, and a weight of 0.3 to IRAs and other retirement assets, and only

 subtracted 6 months of payments on loans except credit cards, and 0.2 of outstanding credit card

 balances. While these weights are ad-hoc, they represent an attempt to take account of the

 different liquidity and accessibility of household assets and liabilities. Desired precautionary

 savings are higher than this alternate measure of wealth for 17 percent of observations in both

 the main sample and among the older sample and 7 percent among the business sample.

         How much of current wealth is the result of precautionary accumulation? The ratio of

 total desired precautionary savings of all households over total wealth is 8 percent. The ratio

 increases to close to 20 percent when considering only financial net worth. However, as

 mentioned before, financial net worth represents a very limited measure of accumulation.

 Relative to liquidable wealth, the ratio is 12 percent. Thus, although some values of desired

 precautionary savings are quite large, the precautionary saving motive does not appear overall to

 account for a very large fraction of observed household wealth. Moreover, because actual wealth

 may be below its desired equilibrium level, the reported buffer-stock of savings may well

 represent an upper bound to the size of precautionary wealth at any given time.

         How large is the target that households wish to hold compared with permanent income,

 which is the measure considered in theoretical models? In Figure 5, we consider this distribution

 of the ratio of desired precautionary savings over permanent income in the full sample and

 across the sub-groups.13 The relative size of the buffer-stock is overall fairly small when we




        13
           Permanent income is taken to be a measure of “normal” income reported by SCF respondents. This
question follows a sequence of questions on actual income. Each respondent was asked whether the total of all
components of their income for the preceding year, as summed by the interviewer’s computer, was unusually high or
low compared to normal. In this case, the respondent was asked for the figure that would be more usual. See
Kennickell (1995) for more details.

                                                        21
look at the full sample, but similarly to the measure of savings in levels, the distribution of the

ratio has a long fat right tail. The mean value indicates that households desire to hold 64 percent

of their normal income as a “buffer-stock,” but the median value is 14 percent. However, values

vary widely when we examine subgroups. In the main sample, the median desired “buffer-stock”

is 10 percent of normal income. Households in the older sample desire to hold much more: The

median value is 35 percent of normal income. Households in the business sample also want to

hold more than those in the main sample; their median value is 16 percent of normal income.

       The evidence is also consistent with another prediction of the “buffer-stock” model. With

only very few exceptions, households desire to hold a positive stock of precautionary wealth to

insure against shocks. The fact that this stock is typically not very large–it ranges from 15 to 60

percent of permanent income for a large share of the population in working years that do not

own a business–is in line with the simulations of Caballero (1991). What our data further show is

that precautionary savings become sizable and important for two specific groups: business

owners and those older than 62. Other studies had emphasized the large wealth holdings of these

groups but without providing a link to the importance of the precautionary saving motive.

Clearly, it is hard to disentangle the size of precautionary accumulation, particularly for these

two groups, as wealth can serve more than one purpose. This is why it is important to ask

directly for the size of precautionary wealth.



3.5 A Multivariate Analysis of Desired Precautionary Savings

       The objectives of our empirical analysis are four-fold. First, we aim to explain in more

detail the amount of precautionary savings reported by SCF respondents. Second, we examine

whether the desired amount of precautionary savings correlates with risk, which is the most

                                                 22
 important prediction of the theory. Third, we aim to understand which types of risk people care

 about. Fourth, we want to evaluate the findings in the previous literature and assess the

 importance of the biases mentioned in section 2.1.

          What influences the amount of precautionary savings? As reported in previous sections,

 there are several factors. First, the main determinant of precautionary accumulation should be

 risk and, in our work, we do not restrict attention to only one type of risk, but consider several

 sources of risk (issue 1). Second, preferences are very important in shaping the amount of

 precautionary savings (issue 2). Finally, the economic environment a family faces, for example

 liquidity constraints or institutional factors such as the structure of the welfare system, can also

 affect precautionary accumulation (issues 3, 4, and 5).

          Our dependent variable is the log of desired precautionary savings. Since we have very

 few zero (and no negative) values, our sample does not suffer from meaningful selection

 problems. Rather than subtracting the log of permanent income (to express the ratio of desired

 precautionary wealth to permanent income), we include this variable on the right hand side to

 allow for the possibility that preferences might be non-homothetic. In order to explain desired

 precautionary savings, we use a rich set of variables, as reported below.

          Income risk and other controls

 As mentioned before, we cannot simply use the variance of income as this measure suffers from

 many problems. Most importantly, risk-averse workers can self-select into jobs with low income

 variance. To overcome these issues, we follow the work of other researchers and use the state

 level rate of unemployment as proxy for risk.14 Additionally, to capture income variation which


         14
            These are the variables used by Lusardi (1997) and Engen and Gruber (2001) in their instrumental
variables estimation. These instruments are valid insofar workers do not locate to states according to their degree of

                                                           23
 is more individual-specific, we use a dummy for whether the respondent has a good idea of the

 next year’s income. We control for macro shocks (issue 6) by adding to the regression a year

 dummy and also the absolute deviation of predicted wages from actual wages divided by

 predicted wages.15 We also use dummies for whether the income for the past year was above or

 below a level the survey respondent considered “normal.”

          Health risk and other controls

 As in the case of income, it is very hard to measure this variable properly. Furthermore, we

 cannot use information on whether households have health insurance since that variable is

 clearly endogenous and can be related to precautionary savings because it proxies for common

 preferences toward risk (Starr-McCluer(1996)). Studies such as Chandra and Skinner (2002)

 show there is very high geographical variation in health costs, possibly reflecting differences in

 utilization and quality of health care. Since even those who have health insurance have to pay

 some out-of-pocket costs, we proxy for this risk by using the state-specific level of out-of-pocket

 health costs. Those who live in higher-quality higher-cost states face a higher risk of paying for

 some of their health problems. This is similar to the approach used to measure income risk.

 Again, to use a measure which is more individual-specific, we also use information on whether

 respondents foresee expenses for health care in the next 5-10 years. These expenses are

 relatively far in the future; thus, they are likely to be uncertain. Since these variables could

 potentially capture mean costs, we add current health status among our controls.



risk aversion.

         15
          The predicted wage is estimated using data in the Current Population Survey at the level of three-digit
occupation codes. Models were estimated conditioning on age, education, self-employment, sex, and race. Values
were predicted for the SCF observations using the estimated parameters.

                                                         24
           Longevity risk and other controls

We proxy for this risk using the coefficient of variation of longevity. This variable is calculated

as the ratio of the standard deviation of life expectancy divided by the difference between

average life expectancy and the current age.16 The distribution of life expectancy is simulated for

each case using mortality probabilities conditioned on current age, race, and gender. In the

regressions, we also account for the reported value of expected longevity and current age.

           Business risk and other controls

The measure of business risk (used for the business sample only) we use is the failure rate of

businesses of the same general type and age matched by state. Because the problem of self-

selection can be particularly important for this group, the variance of income is not an

appropriate variable to use. We also consider whether the head and spouse work in the actively

managed business(es) owned by the family to proxy for lack of risk-sharing within the family.

Finally, we add to the regressions the number of businesses managed by the family as business

risk may be reduced by spanning different types of sectors and activities.

           Preferences

To highlight the importance of preferences and account for the vast heterogeneity in

precautionary accumulation, we use a large set of controls. We control for several demographic

characteristics, such as age, education, race, marital status, number of children, family size, and

wealth dummies. We use wealth dummies (dummies for approximate quintiles of wealth) to

account for tastes for saving. Since wealth can be endogenous, we also present results without

the wealth dummies. Because it is important to account for behavior toward risk, we use



16
     For a couple, we use the maximum value over the two people.

                                                         25
 information on respondents’ willingness to undertake financial risk to proxy for risk aversion. In

 addition, we use data on smoking behavior to proxy for impatience. Data on having a saving plan

 and shopping for returns on saving and investments are used to proxy for attitudes toward saving

 (Lusardi (2002)). To capture intertemporal substitution and prices, we also consider expectations

 about interest rates in the next 5 years. Finally, we account for the intention of leaving bequests,

 as this motive can interact with the precautionary saving motive (wealth accumulated for heirs

 can also be used to insure against shocks).

          Liquidity constraints

 Liquidity constraints are proxied by several variables expressing the possibility of borrowing.

 We follow the approach of Maki (2000) and Kennickell, Starr-McCluer and Surette (2000) and

 use the variables reported in their work: a dummy for whether households own bank-type credit

 cards, the ratio of annualized payments on all types of loans to total normal income, the ratio of

 credit limit on all credit cards to normal income, the ratio of credit card debt outstanding over the

 total credit limit on the family’s cards, and the interactions of these two latter variables with an

 indicator for whether families have low income (income lower than $25,000).17 To consider as

 well the supply of credit, we include the percentage of the local banking market (at the MSA

 level) held by the four largest depository institutions.

          Future expenses and other relevant variables

 We use dummies for other future foreseeable expenses (mainly education and home expenses) in

 the next 5-10 years to allow for variation in forward looking behavior and future commitments



         17
           The SCF reports information on whether households have been denied credit in the past or are discouraged
borrowers. We do not use these variables in our empirical work since we are interested in future rather than current or
past liquidity constraints.

                                                          26
 which can also be uncertain. Additionally, we include a dummy for whether pension benefits are

 considered to be adequate for retirement, since pensions can also insure against risk, particularly

 longevity risk. In addition, we include a dummy for whether at least one parent is alive. This

 variable may signal the possibility of receiving inheritances in the future, thus decreasing the

 need to save.

         We control for such an extensive set of variables for several reasons. First, our objective

 is to describe and explain the data as much as we can, and we do so by exploiting the richness of

 information offered in the SCF. Second, we aim to show that the proxies we use for risk are not

 necessarily capturing something other than risk. Third and most importantly, we aim to

 demonstrate that the data behave according to the predictions of the theory.

             Our empirical findings are consistent with the findings of other works on savings. Most

 importantly, we find that the reported measure of desired precautionary savings correlates with

 risk(s), even after accounting for a large set of controls. It is also correlated with other

 determinant of wealth in the expected way. These results are robust and do not depend on the

 chosen empirical specification. We report the empirical estimates for risk in Table 2; the

 complete set of estimates is reported in appendix Tables A2-A4. We summarize below the

 empirical findings for each subsample.18



 Main sample

         For the main sample, we find that all measures of risk–income, longevity, and health–are

 significant and correlate positively with desired precautionary savings (Table 2, second column).


        18
          Estimation was performed using robust regressions. All standard errors were corrected for the multiple
imputation of the SCF data (see Kennickell (1998)).

                                                         27
For example, those respondents who live in states with higher unemployment rates save more.

Those who have a good idea of next year income desire to accumulate less precautionary saving.

However, insofar as there is self-selection of workers into low-risk jobs that is not completely

addressed by our proxies for income uncertainty, the estimates are still biased downward

(Lusardi (1997, 2000) and Fuchs-Schündeln and Schündeln (2003)). Those who face higher

health and longevity risk also hold higher amounts of precautionary savings. We do not calculate

the economic significance of these estimates, as they may still suffer from the problems

discussed in section 2.1. Since we have a measure of precautionary savings already, we can look

at this measure directly to assess the size of precautionary wealth and we do not need to rely on

the coefficient estimates of risk.

          Other variables have the expected sign and significance, confirming that our variable has

economic meaning (Table A2). As expected, the amount of desired precautionary savings

increases with permanent income. Evaluated at the 1995 population mean for this sample, for an

additional $1,000 of permanent income, households want to hold about an additional $221 in

precautionary wealth. Moreover, precautionary accumulation increases sharply with education,

even after accounting for wealth dummies. Thus, differences in precautionary wealth across

education groups documented in Figures 3a-c and in other studies (Hubbard, Skinner and Zeldes

(1995), Lusardi (1998, 2000)) are still large even after accounting for many determinants of

wealth.

          Moreover, we find that if pensions are adequate, precautionary accumulation is

substantially lower (about 4 to 5 percent lower). Planning is also important. Respondents who

have a saving plan report higher precautionary savings and so do those that search for the best

conditions on investment; work by Lusardi (2002) and Ameriks, Caplin and Leahy (2003) shows

                                                  28
that planning is a major determinant of wealth accumulation. Not only preferences, but also the

economic environment matters for precautionary savings. Respondents who are more likely to

face constraints (they report high loan payments or live in areas with a low concentration of

large banks) accumulate higher precautionary savings.

        While most of the variables used in the empirical work move in the expected way, there

is still much unexplained variation. Again, this suggests that it is going to be difficult to find

evidence of precautionary savings in micro data by estimating the function reported in Section

2.1. First, there is a lot of heterogeneity in household behavior toward precautionary savings.

Second, people may care about many risks. Assessing the importance of the precautionary

motive by looking at only one source of risk can give a limited and perhaps misleading

assessment of the importance of the precautionary saving motive.



Older sample

        It is important to focus attention on this group which accounts for such a disproportionate

share of precautionary savings. Not many studies have examined this group in isolation and we

know relatively little about the importance of precautionary savings among older people.

However, this group is often included in the samples used to estimate the precautionary saving

motive.

        It is reassuring to note that, for this group, unemployment risk and income risk in general

are not significant (Table 2, third column). Many of these households are retired or on the verge

of retirement and, generally, income risk should not play an important role in explaining their

precautionary accumulation. As expected, two other risks are relevant: health and longevity risk.

Both variables are statistically significant.

                                                  29
       As for the main sample, precautionary savings for older households increase with both

permanent income and education (Table A3). As before, differences are sizable across education

groups and precautionary savings are high particularly among those with a college degree or

more education. Other variables show the expected results. For example, the liquidity constraint

variables are overall not statistically significant. Older people/cohorts who have a bequest

motive accumulate more precautionary savings. As we discussed earlier, households who have a

bequest motive may hold on to their wealth until the end of life to potentially offset negative

shocks. There is however, more variation in desired precautionary savings among older

households/cohorts than we can measure with our simple proxies. While the two risks mentioned

above play a role, there are potentially more sources of risk that the older famlies care about and

would like to insure against. Modeling the saving behavior of this group is, therefore, likely to be

quite complex and require more detailed information on the risk factors facing older families.



Business sample

       No one has studied this group in detail to assess the importance of the precautionary

saving motive, but according to our descriptive results presented earlier in this paper, this group

is very important for understanding wealth accumulation. To study business owners effectively,

we added several variables related to business risk. As mentioned before, we account for whether

both spouses work in the business and, thus, for lack of risk sharing within the household. We

also account for the number of businesses actively managed by the respondent or spouse (Table

2, fourth column). We also account for business size and type to account for the large

heterogeneity in business ownerships and whether the head or spouse has a MBA (Tables A4).



                                                 30
       Overall, it is very hard to decompose the variation in desired precautionary holdings for

business owners with the available data; even basic demographic variables are not statistically

significant. The risk measures, such as unemployment and income risk, are significant and so are

some proxies for health risk, but, for example, the business failure risk variables are not

significant (Table 2). A variable that is strongly significant is the number of businesses owned

by the family and actively managed. Contrary to initial expectations, the higher the number of

businesses, the higher the precautionary savings. This perhaps is due to the fact that there is little

risk diversification in running more than one business; often owners of multiple businesses have

businesses in closely related areas.

       Liquidity constraints matter for business owners and, consistent with theoretical

predictions, those that are more likely to face constraints hold higher amounts of precautionary

savings. Like the main sample, business owners that have adequate pensions report lower

precautionary savings.

       This group is very important but also very difficult to study, largely because it is

seemingly so heterogeneous. Previous works that concentrate on earnings risk can do only a

crude job of capturing the importance of the precautionary saving motive when business owners

are included in the sample. On the other hand, they play a pivotal role in empirical work since

they hold large amounts of wealth.



3.6 Another Look at the Quantitative Importance of Precautionary Savings

        In the previous section, we have shown that our measure of desired precautionary

savings is dependent on risk(s) and other expected factors. As mentioned in Section 2.1, it has

been difficult to measure risk other than income risk, often due to lack of data. Other studies that

                                                  31
have considered more than one source of risk have not clearly indicated the importance of

precautionary savings due, for example, to health or other shocks, perhaps with the exception of

Carroll and Samwick (1997). To provide insights on this matter, we exploit the information on

the motives to save reported in the SCF (the list of responses is reported in appendix Table A1).

The question about saving motives precedes that about desired precautionary savings (with a

number of questions about preferences and attitudes about saving in between). From the reported

saving motives, we are able to isolate four categories of precautionary savings related to

different types of risks:

1) Emergencies, “rainy days,” other unexpected needs, for “security” and independence;

2) Reserves in case of unemployment;

3) In case of illness, medical/dental expenses;

4) To have cash available on hand/liquidity; wise/prudent things to do.

        As a simple way of inferring the quantitive importance of different types of risk, we

simply regress the ratio of desired precautionary savings to permanent income on these four

dummies using robust regressions (along with dummy variables to control for wealth). What

emerges from these simple regressions is that, relative to other risks, it is health risk that gives

rise to the largest amounts of precautionary savings overall (Table 3). This finding is consistent

with what was reported earlier, in particular for the older sample. On the other hand, earnings

(unemployment) risk, which is the risk that has been considered in the majority of the papers on

precautionary savings, does not account for high amounts of precautionary accumulation in the

total sample but, as expected, is more relevant in the main sample. Only a very small number of

respondents in the older and the business owner sample reported this motive as either their first



                                                  32
or second most important reason to save.19 Estimates are consistent with the recent work of

Carroll, Dynan and Krane (2003), which also finds small amounts of precautionary wealth to

insure against unemployment risk. Overall, what emerges again from these simple regressions is

that we need to move beyond earnings risk when modeling precautionary accumulation, in

particular when evaluating the quantitative importance of the precautionary saving motive in

comprehensive surveys that include all types of households.



4. Discussion

         According to our findings a precautionary saving motive exists and affects the behavior

of households. However, the precautionary saving motive does not give rise to high amounts of

wealth, at least for the group of households who are in working years and do not own a business.

Simply stated, our data show that precautionary savings may account for as much as 8% of total

accumulation in the US. These estimates are similar to the upper range of values obtained in

studies of precautionary savings using subjective measures of risk. Our findings further indicate

that we need to move beyond earnings risk when modeling precautionary accumulation. Older

households play a very important role in explaining precautionary savings and for them, it is

very important to model health and longevity risks as well as other sources of risk (for example

“consumption” risk and other such emergencies). Health risk may also lead to sizable amounts of

precautionary accumulation. Thus, models that incorporate more than one source of risk are

likely to be better suited to modeling the behavior of households, particularly in samples that do

not concentrate on the young only.


19
  However, it may be that some part of the health saving motive indirectly signals saving for lost wages during times
of ill health.

                                                         33
       There is also another group that deserves close attention: business owners. Our work

shows that it is very hard to characterize their behavior well. There are several problems in

measuring properly the risk that these households face (not only income and business failure risk

but also, for example, interest rate risk). Most importantly, these households may self-select into

self-employment because of their risk tolerance or their perceptions of risk. Moreover, these

households are less likely to have pensions and to retire at age 62 or 65 (Hurst and Lusardi

(2004)). Our estimates suggest that it will be fruitful to study them in isolation. Alternatively,

models that include business owners should at least attempt to model more adequately their

differences with respect to other households.

       Our results provide insights into previous empirical findings using the regressions that

were discussed in Section 2. For example, we can better understand the findings of Kazarosian

(1999) and Lusardi (1998, 2000), which examine older workers. They find that a precautionary

saving motive exists even for older households and, as this study also shows, older households

display a strong precautionary saving motive. We can also explain the finding of the well-cited

paper by Carroll and Samwick (1998), which shows that precautionary savings tend to become

more, rather than less, important with the addition of older respondents (older than 50). Our

findings can also explain another and potentially puzzling result of Carroll and Samwick (1998).

When farmers and self-employed are excluded from their sample, not only do the coefficient

estimates on income risk drop by 50 to 60 percent, but they are also no longer statistically

significant. As reported above, precautionary wealth is relatively small in the main sample, but it

becomes large for business owners. This group surely plays a pivotal role in the estimates of

precautionary savings.



                                                 34
       Our results also provide insights into another important and puzzling finding: the lack of

annuitization among the older households. As many authors have shown, many retirees do not

annuitize their wealth. Furthermore, when given the option, many retirees choose lump-sum

payments rather than annuities for their retirement income (see Ameriks (2003) and the

references therein). If retirees face risks other than simply longevity, this behavior is reasonable.

Our data provide evidence that respondents in the older sample care about many sources of risk.

Similarly, it can explain why households do not use reverse mortgages (Venti and Wise (1991)).

If older households face the risk of incurring high expenses, for example large health expenses,

they may be reluctant to downsize or annuitize the value of their house. This result is consistent

with the work of Skinner (1996), which also emphasizes the importance of the precautionary

saving motive among older households.

       Our findings are also in line with the work by Hubbard, Skinner and Zeldes (1995),

which shows that low-income and low-education families have little precautionary savings. As

the authors argue, this may be due to the existence of welfare programs. While households at the

bottom of the wealth distribution may face high risk, this risk interacts with means-tested welfare

programs in a nonlinear way. Finally, our findings are consistent with the evidence regarding

motives to save. As reported in many data sets, the precautionary saving motive is consistently

the most important motive indicated by respondents, and, as reported by Alessie, Lusardi and

Aldershof (1997), Kennickell (1995) and Samwick (1998), it remains strong among older

cohorts. However, as reported by Horioka, Yokota and Miyaji (1994), households indicating a

precautionary saving motive do not hold large amounts of wealth.

       How important is the precautionary saving motive? Consistent with the findings of other

studies, our work shows that a precautionary motive exists and affects virtually every household.

                                                 35
Thus, models of savings that rely on certainty equivalence, preferences, or economic

environments that do not generate precautionary savings will not be able to characterize well the

behavior of US households. What this study further suggests is that this motive is very

heterogenous across the population, much more so than what has been found in previous work.

This difference may be because only a limited number of sources of risk have previously been

considered in the empirical literature and/or because it is hard to capture well empirically all the

complexities of precautionary accumulation, as discussed in Section 2. Income risk, in particular,

is likely to give rise to little precautionary accumulation, but other risks, such as health and

business risk, can lead to large amounts of precautionary accumulation.

       For a large part of the younger population, our findings are consistent with studies using

subjective measures of risk in that the precautionary saving motive does not give rise to a lot of

wealth (Guiso, Jappelli and Terlizzese (1992), Lusardi (1998, 2000), Arrondel (2002)). Thus, we

believe that some of the initial large estimates of precautionary savings coming out of simulations

for the aggregate economy do not characterize well the behavior of the average or the median

household in the economy. Similar findings are reported in the recent theoretical work and

simulation results by Irvine and Wang (2001, page 234), which also state that “the overall wealth

stock in the economy is less influenced by income uncertainty than the existing theoretical

literature suggests.” Similarly, Laitner (2004) finds that, for plausible calibrations, precautionary

saving only adds 5-6% to aggregate wealth. However, our findings are also consistent with some

of the simulations of Carroll (1992) and Cagetti (2000). Households in these models display low

degrees of patience or low risk aversion. This leads to low amounts of accumulation, particularly

for low educated and young households. Although consistent with those predictions, our findings



                                                  36
further suggest that there is much more heterogeneity in the precautionary saving motive than

usually generated by these stylized models.

       One of the novelties of our paper with respect to previous work is that we can identify two

groups in the population for which precautionary savings are really important: older households

and business owners. Consideration of business owners, a group that can account for a large

share of aggregate wealth, suggests that not just income risk, but also other risks should be taken

into account. The same holds for older households. In addition, it is likely that differences in

preferences and economic circumstances in these groups give rise to much of the observed

heterogeneity. Our subjective measure of precautionary savings can at least provide some bounds

to evaluate the importance of this motive among these distinct groups of households. Further

research on precautionary savings should give more attention to the behavior of these two groups

in the population.



5. Concluding Remarks

       The estimation of the precautionary saving motive is a very complex task. There exist

many pitfalls and difficulties in assessing the empirical importance of this motive. One of the

major problems is how to measure accurately the amount of reserves people use to shield

themselves against risk. The commonly used measures of wealth have many problems, and much

more attention should be devoted to this important issue.

       Our approach deviates from previous works and relies on a subjective measure of

precautionary savings provided in the SCF. This survey, by oversampling the wealthy, provides a

reasonably accurate account of the range of household wealth holdings. Beginning in 1995, the

SCF also provides a measure of desired precautionary savings, further enriching the information

                                                  37
currently available to study household behavior toward savings. We provide an extensive

evaluation of this measure. The underlying question was subjected to careful pre-testing as well as

post-survey evaluation. We show that the measure is consistent across time-periods; two

independent cross-sections in 1995 and 1998 give very much the same results. The decomposition

across groups shows that the features of the data accord with the theory. In particular, the shape of

the distribution of desired precautionary savings mimics that of wealth, but at a much lower level

than wealth. Finally, desired precautionary savings correlates with risk, permanent income,

liquidity constraints, and household preferences.

       Our findings shed new light on the importance of precautionary savings. The precautionary

saving motive continues to be strong even among older households/cohorts. Thus, we need to

move beyond earnings risk when studying the importance of precautionary accumulation.

Moreover, the precautionary saving motive is very important for business owners and, for this

group as well, we need a more careful modeling of sources of risk. Given that older households

and business owners alone account for 65 percent of total precautionary accumulation, further

research on this topic should focus on these two groups of the population. Because the

heterogeneity seen in our data is large, it may be particularly important to enrich the description of

the economic environment, including accounting for imperfections in the financial and insurance

markets and the institutions that are already in place to insure against risk (e.g., welfare programs,

sources of support from family and friends).

       The measure of desired precautionary wealth available in the SCF can substantially

enhance empirical work. For example, researchers interested in accounting for a measure of

precautionary accumulation can use this information rather than relying on traditional measures of

wealth. Furthermore, these data can be used to account for household-specific behavior toward

                                                  38
risk. There is little information in existing data sets on risk aversion, prudence, or the amount and

type of risks that households face; in principle, the subjective measure of precautionary wealth in

the SCF encompasses all such information. Thus, studies of portfolio choice, entrepreneurship, and

the labor market can benefit much from the availability of this information. These data can also

help yield better understanding of other questions concerning household saving behavior, such as

whether and how fast older households should decumulate wealth after retirement and what are the

most important motives for saving.

                                          Data Appendix


       The data used in this paper derive from the 1995 and 1998 cross-sections of the Survey of
Consumer Finances (SCF). The SCF is sponsored by the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System, and the data for the 1995 and 1998 surveys were collected by NORC, a national
organization for social science and survey research at the University of Chicago. The field period
ranged from approximately June through December of the survey years. All asset and liability
variables used in this paper are valued as of the time of the interview. All dollar values from the
1998 SCF have been adjusted to 1995 dollars using the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
       In each of the two years of the SCF we use, there are about 4,300 participants. The original
sample comprises two random sub-samples. The first is an area-probability sample, which
accounts for about two-thirds of the participants. This part of the sample provides broad national
coverage of the population. The second part contains an over-sample of wealthy households.
Non-response to the survey is a substantial problem which is addressed through the weighting
design (Kennickell and Woodburn, 1999). For individual questions, non-response, or partial
response in the form of range information, is also a problem. The survey deals with this type of
non-response through multiple imputation (Kennickell, 1998), a technique that allows one to
account for the variability associated with non-response in model estimation. The standard errors
of all models presented in this paper are corrected for the imputation of the originally missing data.
See Kennickell, Starr-McCluer, and Sundén (1997), and Kennickell, Starr-McCluer and Surette
(2000) for more information on the SCF in 1995 and 1998.

Note: This table reports the frequencies of the responses to the following question in the 1995 SCF: “People have
different reasons for saving, even though they may not be saving all the time. What are your family’s most important
reasons for saving?” Percentages sum to more than 100 because some respondents provided more than one reason.
