                                            ABSTRACT

In the U.S., analyses of poverty rates and the effects of anti-poverty programs rely almost exclusively
on income data. In earlier work (Meyer and Sullivan, 2003) we emphasized that conceptual arguments
generally favor using consumption data to measure the well-being of the poor, and, on balance, data
quality issues favor consumption in the case of single mothers. Our earlier work did not show that
income and consumption differ in practice. Here we further examine data quality issues and show
that important conclusions about recent trends depend on whether one uses consumption or income.
 Changes in the distribution of resources for single mothers differ sharply in recent years depending
on whether measured by income or consumption. Measures of overall and sub-group poverty also
sharply differ. In addition to examining broader populations and a longer time period, we also consider
new dimensions of data quality such as survey and item nonresponse, imputation, and precision. Finally,
we demonstrate the flaws in a recent paper that compares income and consumption data.

I.      Introduction

        Conceptual arguments generally favor consumption for measuring well-being.

Consumption is a better measure of the long run resources available to the family (their

permanent income) than annual income. Income measures fail to capture differences

across families and over time in the accumulation of assets or access to credit. Also,

consumption is more likely to reflect private and government transfers and the insurance

value of government programs. Nevertheless, poverty and inequality in the U.S. are

almost exclusively measured using annual income. Income is also the primary measure

used to study the effects of anti-poverty programs.1

        In earlier work (Meyer and Sullivan, 2003) we emphasized the conceptual and

measurement advantages of consumption over income. However, we did not show that

the choice between income and consumption matters in practice for important outcomes.

This paper shows that the choice between income and consumption matters when

measuring the well-being of the disadvantaged. We compare income data from the

Current Population Survey (CPS)—the official source of income and poverty data in the

U.S.—to consumption data from the Consumer Expenditure (CE) Survey—the most

comprehensive source of expenditure data. We find a substantial drop in income in the

bottom decile of single mothers while their consumption rises moderately.

The patterns are similar in two income and two consumption datasets. We find that CE

Survey and CPS income at the very bottom are remarkably similar in levels and changes.

These results are important because recent authors have emphasized these income

patterns and used them to evaluate welfare reform (Blank and Schoeni 2003; Murray and

Primus 2005). Also, for those 65 and older, income poverty over the past two decades

falls by 28 percent, while consumption poverty falls by more than half. Deep poverty

and poverty gaps for the U.S. fall sharply when measured using consumption but remain

flat or rise when measured with income.

       We present further evidence that consumption is measured better than income at

the bottom of the distribution. Our earlier work emphasized the case of single mothers

while here we show that the results are much broader. We also discuss new dimensions

to data quality including nonresponse, imputation, and the precision of estimates. The

bottom deciles of consumption exceed those for income, suggesting under-reporting of

income. There is a high and rising under-reporting rate for government transfers, a

source of income that is particularly important at the bottom. In addition, the

nonresponse and imputation rates are similar or higher in the CPS than in the CE Survey.

We also document the degree of under-reporting of consumption in the CE Survey, as

well as show that the speculation regarding possible bias due to attrition in the CE Survey

data is unfounded. Finally, low consumption for the worst off among the disadvantaged

seems to be more closely associated with other bad outcomes than is low income. On the

other hand, available consumption data sources have much smaller sample sizes than the

largest income datasets. These smaller samples limit the precision of estimates at the

state or city level, and may require the pooling of years to obtain precisely estimated

changes. As we show, the need for larger samples is significantly offset by the lower

variability and higher predictability of consumption, which reduce the standard errors of

estimates of changes in consumption relative to those for income.




                                             2
        The paper proceeds as follows. We first discuss previous studies that examine

income and consumption based measures of well-being of the worst off. We then

describe the CPS and CE Survey data that we use. Next, we document important

differences in recent years for income and consumption based measures of well-being.

We follow with an analysis of several dimensions of the relative data quality in the CPS

and CE Survey. We then examine whether income or consumption does a better job of

predicting measures of well-being at the bottom. Lastly, we offer conclusions and areas

for future research.



II.     Previous Research

        A number of studies have documented differences in both levels and trends

between consumption and income based measures of well-being for disadvantaged

families. Cutler and Katz (1991) show that consumption poverty rose more than income

poverty during the 1970s, that both of these poverty measures rose in the early 1980s, but

between 1984 and 1988 income poverty fell while consumption poverty changed little.

They also document differences across these measures within demographic groups.

Johnson (2004) also finds that consumption poverty increased more than income poverty

during the 1970s and then remained steady through 1995. Using alternative equivalence

scales, there is evidence that consumption poverty fell considerably more than income

poverty from 1980 through 1995 (Slesnick 2001). Meyer and Sullivan (2003) show that

expenditures exceed disposable income for disadvantaged groups such as single mothers,

and that the differences are particularly noticeable for those at the very bottom of the

distribution.




                                              3
        In contrast to these papers, Bavier (2007) argues that “there is no huge

discrepancy in federal surveys between income and expenditures near the bottom of the

distribution.” This broad conclusion is based on evidence that changes in consumption

poverty are similar to changes in an after-tax disposable income measure. Bavier makes

this strong conclusion even though his measures of income and consumption poverty

move in opposite directions in recent years and these measures diverge sharply for some

demographic groups.

        Differences between income and consumption have also been emphasized within

the inequality literature. In general, these studies find that the distribution of

consumption is substantially more equal than that of income (Cutler and Katz, 1991;

Krueger and Perri, 2006; and Johnson, Smeeding, and Torrey, 2005). Krueger and Perri

(2006) note that in recent years significant increases in income inequality have not been

accompanied by a substantial rise in consumption inequality. Similarly, Johnson,

Smeeding, and Torrey (2005) find that consumption inequality increased less than

income inequality between 1981 and 2001. They also show that conclusions regarding

the relative well-being of different demographic groups are sensitive to whether well-

being is measured using income or consumption.

        Some past work has argued that consumption data should not be used to analyze

the well-being of the worst off because patterns for income and consumption poverty are

similar and because consumption data are of low quality at the bottom of the distribution

(Bavier, 2007). We show that Bavier’s conclusions regarding differences between

income and consumption are based on a narrow set of results. Moreover, his analysis of




                                               4
nonresponse ignores item nonresponse, and his analysis of attrition relies on an

inappropriate, non-representative sample.



III.   Data

The Consumer Expenditure Survey

       Our main consumption data come from the Consumer Expenditure (CE) Interview

Survey, which is a rotating panel survey of approximately 7,600 addresses (5,000 prior to

1999) where spending is collected for four consecutive quarters. Expenditures are

reported for each consumer unit (CU), which consists of individuals related by blood or

marriage or who share resources. See the U.S. Department of Labor (various years) for

more details on the CE Survey.

       Our analyses will examine both expenditures and consumption. To capture total

out of pocket spending, we define expenditures as all spending reported in the CE Survey

plus principal payments on home mortgages and financed vehicles less the purchase price

for financed vehicles. This measure, sometimes called outlays, follows Rogers and Gray

(1994). To convert reported expenditures into a consumption measure, we make a

number of adjustments. First, to smooth lumpy vehicle expenditures, we convert vehicle

spending to a service flow, following the procedure outlined in Meyer and Sullivan

(2007). Second, we deduct spending on education, health care and outlays for retirement

including pensions and social security which are investments rather than consumption.

Third, we measure housing consumption as the reported rental equivalent of the home for

homeowners and use reported rent payments for non-homeowners. For CUs living in




                                            5
government or subsidized housing, we impute a rental value using geographic

information and the characteristics of the living unit (see Meyer and Sullivan, 2007).

The Current Population Survey

        Our main source of income data is the Annual Social and Economic (ASEC)

Supplement, formerly called the Annual Demographic File (ADF), to the CPS which

includes approximately 100,000 households (60,000 prior to 2002). With these data, we

construct two different measures of income: after-tax income plus food stamps and after-

tax income plus noncash benefits, which includes food stamps (See the Data Appendix

for more details). The first measure captures the resources available for spending, and is

therefore the measure we use when comparing income and expenditures. Our second

measure, which is more comprehensive, also includes imputed values for housing

subsidies and the school lunch program.2 We use this measure when comparing income

and consumption. The CPS also provides imputed values for other noncash benefits such

as health insurance and the net return on home equity. However, there are a number of

important limitations with these imputed values. For example, the procedure for

imputing Medicare and Medicaid implies that public health insurance has no value for

families with very low resources, which surely understates the value of public health

insurance for this group.3




2
  The CE Survey is better designed for imputing values for most noncash benefits. For example, with
detailed information on the characteristics of the living unit, the CE Survey is better suited to impute
housing subsidies. Also, the reported rental equivalent in the CE Survey better captures the value of owner
occupied housing than does the CPS’ imputed net return on equity, which is very sensitive to interest rate
changes (Meyer and Sullivan, 2006a).
3
  It is important to note that omitting the imputed value for health insurance cannot reconcile differences
between consumption and income measures because our consumption measure does not include the value
of health insurance.


                                                     6
Panel Study of Income Dynamics

         The Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) is a panel survey that has followed

a sample of families, their offspring, and coresidents annually from 1968-1997, and

biennially since 1997. The survey provides detailed economic and demographic

information for both families and individuals for a sample of about 7,000 families each

year. The PSID collects data on a number of different income sources as well as data on

food and housing expenditures at the family level.



IV.      Recent Changes in Income and Consumption at the Bottom

         Income and consumption reveal different pictures of how the well-being of the

worst off has changed. In some cases, income and consumption move in opposite

directions in recent years, and often this is the case for the most disadvantaged. Income

and consumption do not differ in all cases or in every time period. However, similarities

for aggregate measures can hide important differences for subgroups.

         Some of the sharpest differences in recent years are for families headed by a

single mother. Single mothers are an important group because they were the focus of

recent welfare reforms and tax credit expansions, particularly the Earned Income Tax

Credit (EITC). In addition, single mother families account for just under 30 percent of

the poor and nearly 50 percent of all children in poverty.4 Moreover, these families are

the primary recipients of many means-tested transfer programs.

         In Figure 1 we report the change in mean consumption and mean income for all

families headed by a single mother by decile between 1993-1995 (before welfare reform)


4
  These figures are based on the authors’ calculations using the official definition of poverty and data from
the 1994-2003 CPS ADF/ASEC Supplements.


                                                      7
and 1997-2000 (after welfare reform). We report consumption from the CE Survey,

after-tax income plus food stamps from the same survey, this same income measure from

the CPS, and after-tax income plus noncash benefits.5 Two patterns are evident in this

figure. First, there is a sharp difference between changes in consumption and changes in

income over time. In each decile, consumption rises between 6 and 10 percent. In

contrast, income falls sharply, however measured, in the first decile and rises by 5

percentage points more than consumption in deciles 3, 4, and 5. The differences between

the consumption and income changes (for all measures of income) are statistically

significant in deciles 1, 3, 4 and 5. These patterns show that the implications of

consumption and income in evaluating how material well-being changed after welfare

reform are sharply different. Second, there is a striking similarity between changes in

CE Survey and CPS income, measured on a comparable basis. The changes never differ

by more than a few percentage points, and usually the difference is quite a bit smaller.6

         These patterns are also evident when we examine changes at each percentile, as

shown in Figure 2. Again, we see that the patterns for CPS and CE income are

remarkably similar. They show the same negative pattern in the low percentiles and the

same peak at the 30th percentile.7 We should reiterate that these are from different

datasets. On the other hand, changes in consumption differ significantly from changes in

comprehensive income.

5
  We restrict our CE Survey sample to those designated as “complete income reporters” (see U.S.
Department of Labor, various years).
6
  Several studies note that income from the CE Survey is, on average, well below comparable CPS numbers
(Cutler and Katz, 1991; Bavier, 2007). A key reason for this is that a large share of CPS income is
imputed, whereas, prior to 2004, all missing CE Survey income components are set to zero. Figure 1
shows that even without income imputation in the CE Survey, changes in the percentiles of income line up
fairly closely for single mothers. While this is not a broad validation of CE Survey income, it indicates that
income data for certain subgroups of the population are reasonably comparable across surveys.
7
  These patterns for income are similar to those in Blank and Schoeni (2003) and Murray and Primus
(2005).


                                                      8
         We have performed extensive robustness checks that validate the findings in

Figures 1 and 2. We have shown that our conclusions about changes in income and

consumption during the 1990s for single mothers are not sensitive to the inclusion of

incomplete income reporters in the CE Survey; do not change if we use only the first

interview that an address is in the sample for the CE Survey; and are very similar for

broadly defined samples of single parents. The results in Figures 1 and 2 are calculated

using the NAS recommended equivalence scale, but we verify that these patterns are very

similar using the scale implicit in the official poverty thresholds.

         The characteristics of the single mother population are changing over time, and

these changes may affect both income and consumption. To address this concern, we

estimate quantile regressions of the following form:

ln(Ziq) = β1 + β21{year=(1997-2000)} + β31{year=(2001-2003)} + Xiq β4 + εiq                        (1)

where the dependent variable is the log of equivalence scale adjusted consumption or

income for family i in quarter q; 1{year=(1997-2000)} and 1{year=(2001-2003)} are period dummies;

Xiq is a vector of demographic characteristics including a cubic in the age of the head, the

number of children less than 18, the number of girls age 2-15, the number of boys age 2-

15, education and race of the head, and region; and εiq is a household-quarter error term.8

Columns 1 and 3 of Table 1, report estimates at various quantiles for β2 and β3 when no

demographic controls are included (β4 = 0). As expected, these estimates are in close

agreement with those plotted in Figure 2. The estimates for the specifications including

demographic controls are reported in Columns 2 and 4. Adding controls has little effect

on the trend for consumption, although changes between the 1993-1995 and 2001-2003


8
 We calculate bootstrap standard errors, resampling at the household level, rather than at the household-
quarter level in order to allow for within household dependence.


                                                     9
periods shift downward somewhat. Estimates for income that account for changes in the

characteristics of single mothers no longer exhibit large increases above the bottom

quintile. In fact, these income trends mirror those for consumption very closely above

the 15th percentile. However, the addition of demographic controls has little effect on

changes in income at the bottom. Income still falls between 1993-1995 and 1997-2000

by 19 percent at the 5th percentile and by 8 percent at the 10th percentile and the former

change is significant. We also estimated Equation 1 for the sample of single mothers in

the CPS (not reported). Consistent with the pattern for CE Survey income, in the CPS we

find that much of the significant rise in income above the bottom decile reported in

Figures 1 and 2 disappears with the addition of demographic controls. However, as in the

CE Survey, we still see a sharp drop in income in the bottom decile.

       Table 1 also presents estimates for changes in income and consumption relative to

two comparison groups: single women without children and married mothers. These

comparison groups provide an indication as to whether the changes we observe are part

of a larger pattern of change for other groups due to survey changes or macroeconomic

conditions, or other sources. In particular, for a sample including single mothers and a

comparison group we estimate specifications similar to Equation 1 that also include

interactions of a single mother indicator with each of the three period indicators.

Columns 5 through 8 report, for various percentiles, the difference between the

coefficient on this interaction with the first period and this interaction with each of the

later periods. These results are consistent with the pattern for the absolute changes. At

percentiles below the 25th, consumption for single mothers rises modestly, but in many

cases significantly, relative to both comparison groups. At percentiles above the 25th, the




                                              10
change in relative consumption is very small. Changes in relative income mirror those

for consumption above the 25th percentile. However, we again see noticeable differences

at the bottom, where relative income falls for single mothers at the 5th and 10th

percentiles, and this drop is significant for the all mothers sample.

        If recent macroeconomic changes affect these three groups similarly, then the

trends in Columns 5 through 8 suggest that recent changes in welfare and tax policy had a

modest positive effect on consumption for single mothers in the bottom quartile, and a

very small effect on both consumption and income at higher percentiles.9

        Figure 3 reports income and consumption measures from the PSID. PSID food

consumption exhibits little change during this period. This is similar to the pattern for

food consumption in the CE Survey, although for the CE Survey food falls in the bottom

half of the distribution. While the PSID does not provide data on total consumption, data

are available for housing spending. Together, food and housing account for more than

seventy percent of total consumption for single mothers (Meyer and Sullivan, 2006b).10

The trend for food and housing in the PSID is fairly similar to the trend for total

consumption in the CE Survey shown in Figure 2. These results show that the

consumption changes are not an anomaly due to some aspect of the CE Survey. The

trends for PSID income show increases over most percentiles. These trends are quite

similar to those for the CPS and the CE Survey except in the bottom quintile. Other




9
  These three groups of women have similar wages, and this similarity is especially strong for the two
groups of single women and when one conditions on educational attainment. Previous research has shown
that employment for single women without children responds in a similar way to changes in aggregate
unemployment as does employment for single mothers (Meyer and Rosenbaum, 2001).
10
   Housing in the PSID includes rent for renters, a service flow based on the market value of the home for
owners, and a reported rental equivalent for non-homeowners that do not pay any rent. Unlike the CE
housing measure, it does not include utilities. See Data Appendix for more details.


                                                    11
research indicates that this rise at the bottom in the PSID is due to unusually low levels of

reported income in the PSID during the 1993-1995 period.11

        In a separate study we compare the recent patterns for consumption and income

poverty (Meyer and Sullivan, 2006a). Differences in income and consumption trends are

less evident for measures of overall poverty. For example, the pattern for consumption

based poverty is quite similar to the pattern for poverty based on after-tax income plus

noncash benefits for the years from 1984-2000, although these measures move in

opposite directions in recent years. Similarities for overall head count poverty mask

important differences between income and consumption for key poverty statistics for the

entire population. For example, the fraction of people below half the poverty line (or

deep poverty) measured using income has risen in the last 20 years, while deep poverty

measured using consumption has fallen sharply. Sharp differences are also evident for

measures of the poverty gap, or the cumulative amount needed to raise the resources of

poor families up to the poverty line.

        For children we find that income poverty falls more than consumption poverty.

On the other hand, the fall in income poverty for those 65 and older in recent decades is

sharply smaller than the decline in consumption poverty (Meyer and Sullivan 2006a,

2007). 12 It is not surprising that some of the biggest differences between income and

consumption would appear for the elderly. For this group, current income is likely to be


11
   Gouskova and Schoeni (2002) compare PSID and CPS income between 1970 and 2001 for many points
in the distribution. They show that below the 20th percentile PSID income exceeds CPS income for the
years prior to 1990. In the early 1990s, however, PSID income at low percentiles falls sharply relative to
CPS income, and after 1997 PSID income at these low percentiles grows at a much faster rate than does
CPS income.
12
   This pattern is consistent with Bavier (2007) who shows that between 1984 and 2004, consumption
poverty for those 65 and over fell by more than sixty percent, while income poverty actually increased.
Despite these clear differences, Bavier concludes that “comprehensive income and consumption poverty
rates are similar for all age groups.”


                                                    12
a poor measure of the resources available for consumption, because the elderly are more

likely to be drawing down saving and enjoying the benefits of previous purchases of

homes and cars.

        The results presented here show that income and consumption measures often tell

very different stories about how the well-being of disadvantaged households has changed

over the past two decades. These findings are consistent with previous research that has

also shown that there are important differences (Cutler and Katz, 1991; Slesnick 1993,

2001; Johnson, 2004). However, these findings contrast sharply with Bavier (2007) who

argues that there are not large differences between income and consumption at the

bottom.



V.      Data Quality Issues

        In order to assess whether the patterns for income or consumption more

accurately capture the well-being of the disadvantaged, we investigate measurement

issues for income and consumption at the bottom of the distribution, examining under-

reporting, survey and item nonresponse, the precision of consumption estimates, and

attrition.

Under-reporting of Income and Consumption

        Concerns regarding income under-reporting are well documented (Moore et al.,

2000; Coder and Scoon-Rogers, 1996; Roemer, 2000; Meyer and Sullivan 2006b, Meyer,

Mok, and Sullivan, 2007). One concern that is particularly relevant for disadvantaged

households is the extent of under-reporting of transfer income. We compare weighted

micro-data from several national surveys to administrative aggregates for several transfer




                                            13
programs and the EITC. These ratios, which are reported in Figure 4, provide a

reasonable estimate of the fraction of dollars received that are reported in the CPS.13 This

analysis indicates that the reporting rate for most transfer programs is quite low, and for

some programs, such as AFDC/TANF and food stamps, the reporting rate has been

falling sharply over time. In the most recent year the share of TANF dollars reported in

the CPS was 54 percent, and the fraction of food stamps dollars reported was 57 percent.

The corresponding shares for unemployment insurance, Supplemental Security Income

(SSI), workers’ compensation, and the EITC were 63, 78, 48 and 74 percent. Meyer,

Mok, and Sullivan (2007) also report sharp under-reporting of transfers in the Panel

Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and the Survey of Income and Program Participation

(SIPP).

          The potential effect of changes in under-reporting on recent income trends is

unclear. On the one hand, sharp increases in under-reporting of transfer income could

lead to a significant downward bias in changes in measured income. On the other hand,

for some of these programs, such as AFDC/TANF, true receipt also declined significantly

in recent years. Consequently, the number of dollars not reported rose slowly between

1993 and 2000. Thus, at least for AFDC/TANF, it is possible that declining true receipt

could reverse much of the effect of a lower reporting rate. In addition, the shift from

welfare to work could bias income trends upward as labor market earnings replace

welfare income, because this change represents a shift from a source that is significantly

under-reported to one that is typically well-reported (Roemer, 2000). Nevertheless, in



13
  False positive reporting by nonrecipients would lead the ratio to overstate reporting by true recipients.
Some differences in the sample universe, such as the exclusion of those living abroad and in institutions,
leads to some understatement of reporting.


                                                     14
Meyer and Sullivan (2006b) we conclude that under-reporting of transfers can explain

more than half of the decline in income in the bottom decile that we report in Figure 1.

        Strong evidence that income is under-reported at the bottom of the distribution is

that expenditures exceed income. In Table 2 we report percentiles of the income

distribution from the CPS, and percentiles of the income and expenditure distributions

from the CE Survey. 14 We examine expenditures rather than consumption, because the

former should equal after-tax income in the absence of saving or dissaving. For all

families (Panel A), the 5th percentile of the CE Survey expenditures distribution is 44

percent higher than the 5th percentile of the CPS income distribution, which is close to the

mid point of the distribution for the poor. A difference is also evident, but much less

extreme, at the 10th percentile where CE Survey expenditures exceed CPS income by 8

percent. Average expenditures for families below the 5th percentile of expenditures are

more than three times greater than the average income for all families below the 5th

percentile of income (compare Rows 2 and 7).

        We should note that the CE Survey expenditure numbers that we report should

really be scaled up in comparison to the CPS numbers because they are four times a

quarterly number, whereas income is annual. The quarterly numbers will be more

variable compared to annual numbers leading low percentiles to be lower than they

would be with annual expenditure numbers. By examining observations where we have

both four quarterly numbers and annual numbers, we find that the 5th percentile should be




14
  We use after-tax income plus food stamps rather than a more comprehensive income measure, because
the former is more comparable to expenditures. See the data section for more details.


                                                 15
adjusted upward by 11 percent and the 10th percentile by 10 percent.15 Thus, the true

discrepancies between income and consumption at the bottom are even larger than those

reported in Table 2.

        By looking at income and expenditures within the CE Survey, we can compare

these measures for the same families in the bottom of the income distribution (compare

Rows 4 and 8) or the bottom of the expenditure distribution (compare Rows 5 and 7).

Expenditures exceed income by a factor of 7.12 in the bottom five percent of the income

distribution, while income exceeds expenditures by only a factor of 1.55 in the bottom

five percent of the expenditure distribution. Bavier (2007) is critical of such

comparisons, because they rely on CE Survey income, which he claims is inferior.

However, as evident from comparing Rows 1 and 3, the 5th and 10th percentiles of CE

Survey income are fairly similar to the corresponding percentiles of the CPS income

distribution. The 5th percentile differs by 3 percent and the 10th by 9 percent.16 CPS

income exceeds CE Survey income at higher percentiles which is not surprising given

that the CPS imputes missing values of income components while the CE Survey sets

them to zero.

        Similarities between CE Survey income and CPS income are even stronger for the

sample of all single mothers (Panel B). For this group, the percentiles of CPS income

exceed those of CE Survey income by only a few percent through at least the median.

The 5th percentile of CE Survey income even exceeds that from the CPS. Moreover, we



15
   These adjustment factors are based on the results in Appendix Table A.1 which compares the distribution
of expenditures based on annualized quarterly expenditures to that based on annual expenditures using
those observations where we have both four quarterly numbers and annual numbers.
16
   We do not interpret the similarity between CE Survey income and CPS income as indicating that CE
income is of high quality. Rather, these similarities suggest they we should be concerned about the quality
of income at the bottom in both surveys.


                                                    16
showed in Figures 1 and 2 that changes in income for single mothers are very similar

across the two surveys. For this group, expenditures exceed income by a factor of 3.8 for

those in the bottom income decile (Rows 12 and 16) and by a factor of 2.4 for those in the

bottom income quintile. Again, there is evidence that CE Survey expenditures exceed

CPS income (Rows 9 and 14). Expenditures are nearly 50 percent greater than CPS

income when comparing the 5th percentiles, and spending exceeds income by more than

25 percent at the 20th percentile.

       In addition to the reasons discussed above, we have focused on single mothers in

some of our previous work because it allows us to examine a disadvantaged group

without conditioning on low income or low consumption. For example, an alternative

interpretation of the finding that expenditure percentiles exceed income percentiles is that

households are able to draw down assets (that saving and dissaving explain the

difference). This pattern would be consistent with the permanent income hypothesis.

Based on the very low asset holdings of single mothers (Meyer and Sullivan, 2003,

2006b), we do not think the permanent income hypothesis is the key explanation for this

group. Thus, we conclude that for this large group of the poor, the explanation for the

difference is likely to be under-reporting.

       Another potential explanation for the differences between income and

consumption shown in Table 2 is that expenditures are over-reported. However, there is

little evidence of over-reporting of expenditures. Rather, past work (Gieseman, 1987;

Slesnick, 1992; Garner et al., 2006; Attanasio et al., 2006; Hassett et al., 2007) has

emphasized concerns about under-reporting of expenditures in the CE Survey. This

literature has compared CE Survey aggregates with Personal Consumption Expenditure




                                              17
(PCE) data from the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA), noting that the

CE/PCE ratio is about 0.62 in recent years. Some of this evidence is easily

misinterpreted and is less applicable to the current analyses than it may seem for several

reasons. First, many published comparisons are based on the integrated data that

combine CE Diary and CE Interview data rather than the Interview data used exclusively

here. Second, the poor consume a different bundle of goods than non-poor families, so

that aggregate analyses do not reflect the composition of consumption for the poor.

Third, the PCE numbers cover a different population, are defined differently from the CE,

and are the product of a great deal of estimation and imputation that is subject to error.

One should not expect expenditures weighted by the population to match PCE

aggregates. The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that in 1992 more than half of

the difference between PCE and CE Survey consumer spending was due to coverage and

definitional differences (summarized in GAO, 1996).

       In Table 3 we report comparisons of CE Interview Survey values weighted by

population to corresponding categories of PCE data, focusing on categories of

expenditures that are a large share of spending by the poor: food and rent. These

comparisons show that reporting rates for components of consumption that are

particularly important to poor families are higher and steadier than the rates for

expenditures as a whole. Between 1984 and 2002, the CE/PCE ratio for food at home

was, on average, about 0.80, and for rent plus utilities the ratio was about 0.95. The ratio

for rent plus utilities remained virtually unchanged between these two years.




                                             18
Survey and Item Nonresponse

         Measures of nonresponse are often used to evaluate the quality of data from a

survey (Atrostic et al., 2001; Atrostic and Kalenkoski, 2002). Nonresponse can bias

statistical analyses if those who do not respond are different from those who do.

Nonresponse is often divided into survey nonresponse and item nonresponse. Survey

nonresponse includes cases where no information is obtained for a sample household for

reasons such as inability to contact any person in the household or a refusal to respond by

those contacted. Item nonresponse occurs when a respondent provides some information,

but does not provide valid information on a given item. In the case of item nonresponse,

the CPS ADF/ASEC imputes values for income based on the individual’s or household’s

characteristics. Similarly, the CE Survey provides imputed values for expenditures.

         In Table 4 we report the survey nonresponse rate and the fraction of dollars

imputed for income in the CPS and for expenditures in the CE Interview Survey from

1993 through 2003.17 Survey nonresponse is similar in the early 1990s, but the survey

nonresponse rate for the CE Survey has risen to about 5 percentage points higher in the

most recent years. The evidence in Columns 3-6 indicates that imputation is much more

prevalent in the CPS. We calculate imputation rates as the fraction of income or

expenditures that are imputed. For pre-tax money income, CPS imputation rates start out

5 percentage points higher than CE Survey rates in 1993, and this difference has

increased in recent years. We also examine after-tax income plus Food Stamps, which is

a better measure of the resources available to the family and is more comparable to


17
  We have adopted the convention that when a person responds to the monthly CPS survey but not to the
ADF/ASEC supplement (the source of annual income data) we treat that situation as survey nonresponse
and do not include it in the imputation rates (even though all income data are imputed in this case). This
convention insures that we do not double count such cases as both survey nonresponse and imputation.


                                                    19
expenditures.18 We consider two ways of handling the tax imputations even though, in

fact, all taxes are imputed in the CPS. First, we consider taxes to be imputed if more than

half of pre-tax income is imputed. Second, we consider all taxes to be imputed. Under

the first assumption (Column 4), imputation rates for the CPS are between 15 and 27

percentage points higher than the CE Survey rates. Under the second assumption, when

all taxes are considered to be imputed (Column 5), imputation rates in the CPS range

from 34 to 47 percentage points higher than the CE Survey. While it is unclear which is

the preferred measure to use, it should be evident that imputation rates are much higher in

the CPS. A total measure of nonresponse can be calculated as: Total nonresponse =

survey nonresponse + (1-survey nonresponse)*imputation rate. Such a measure shows

much higher total nonresponse in the CPS than the CE Survey.19 A complete discussion

of nonresponse would analyze the nonrandomness of nonresponse and the accuracy of

imputations, but such analyses are beyond the scope of this paper.

        Our results for nonresponse are in sharp contrast to a recent study that argues that

nonresponse is more problematic in the CE Survey than in the CPS (Bavier, 2007). This

argument, however, ignores item nonresponse, which we have shown above to be greater

for CPS income than for CE Survey expenditures. In addition, the discussion of survey

nonresponse in Bavier (2007) is inaccurate and misleading.20


18
   Alternatively, one could compare consumption to a more comprehensive measure of income, both of
which include additional imputed components. Typically, these additional components are added to both
income and consumption, such as the value of owner occupied housing or the value of housing subsidies.
19
   This measure of total nonresponse treats survey and item nonresponse equally. A more sophisticated
measure would reflect the degree of nonrandomness in the two sources of nonresponse and the imputation
error in the case of item nonresponse.
20
   First, in choosing survey nonresponse rates for the CPS to compare to the CE, Bavier reports the rates
for the monthly CPS (which is a ten minute long survey that does not include the income questions) rather
than the rates for the ASEC (a lengthy survey which includes the income questions). Later, Bavier reports
a survey nonresponse rate for the CE Survey of 27.5 percent and a “comparable” rate for the CPS of 14.4
percent. As shown in Column 1 of Table 3, the latter rate is at the bottom of the range of survey


                                                   20
The Precision of Poverty Measures and the Lower Variability of Consumption

         One advantage of the CPS ADF/ASEC relative to the CE Survey as currently

designed is that the former survey has a much larger sample, which provides more

precise estimates of certain statistics. The CPS ASEC currently includes approximately

100,000 households, while the CE Interview Survey includes approximately 7,600

households. A given household in the CE Survey provides up to four consumption

observations over the year which narrows the gap in sample size. This smaller sample

size suggests that current survey data for examining consumption at the state or local

level, and changes from one year to the next may be fairly imprecise. For statistics such

as the head count poverty rate where precision is roughly proportional to the square root

of the sample size, this smaller sample size is especially important. For other statistics,

the lower variability of consumption may outweigh the small sample size.

         Past work has argued that smaller sample sizes in the CE Survey necessarily

imply that consumption is less precise (Citro and Michael 1995; Bavier 2007). These

arguments are overstated, because they omit the fact that the variance of income is much

larger than that of consumption and income is less predictable, which negatively affects

the precision of income based statistics. The lower variability of consumption means that

fewer consumption observations than income observations are needed to obtain a given

level of precision or significance in some common types of analyses.


nonresponse rates for the CPS between 1993 and 2003. More importantly, the nonresponse rate Bavier
reports for the CE Survey is incorrect. It is not the fraction of eligible interviews that are not completed.
Rather, this statistic counts as noninterviews those cases where an interview was not intended because the
residence was vacant, under construction, demolished, etc. (Reyes-Morales, 2005, Tables 1 and 2). These
ineligibles account for nearly half of all noninterviews used to compute the statistic that Bavier reports.
The true rate is much closer to the CPS rate. Comparing the average survey nonresponse rate in Table 3
across surveys we find that survey nonresponse for the CE Survey exceeds that for the CPS ADF/ASEC by
4.4 percentage points—or less than half the difference reported in Bavier (2007).



                                                     21
         To demonstrate this point, we estimated a typical regression that is used to

determine the change over time for one group relative to a comparison group. For

example, we regress income or consumption on time period indicators interacted with

demographic group indicators while controlling for other demographic characteristics.

Results from these regressions, reported in Table 5, indicate that consumption can

provide more precise estimates. The mean ratio of the income based standard errors to

the consumption based standard errors, depending on the dataset and comparison group

used, ranges from 1.66 to 2.07.21 The lower consumption based standard errors were due

to a sharply lower variance of consumption and a much higher predictability of

consumption (higher R2 ) as can be seen in the last two rows of each panel of Table 5.

Since the standard error is proportional to the inverse of the square root of the sample

size, these ratios indicate that each consumption observation is worth about 3 or 4 income

observations in terms of precision and the ability to test hypotheses. Thus, even a

relatively small consumption dataset may be as useful as a larger income dataset for

certain common analyses. Nevertheless, the sample size of the CE Survey would need to

be increased in order to obtain estimates of consumption based poverty rates for small

geographic areas or for very narrow demographic groups.

Attrition and Other Robustness Issues

         We verify that the consumption patterns for disadvantaged families from the CE

Survey, such as those presented in Section IV or Table 2, are not biased due to

nonrandom attrition in the CE Survey or sample restrictions such as the exclusion of

incomplete income reporters. We show in Table 6 that differences in spending between

21
  The number of observations with nonmissing income data is slightly smaller than those with
consumption data, but this difference accounts for only a tiny share of the difference in these comparisons.
Significantly larger standard errors for income are also evident in the results presented in Table 1.


                                                     22
complete income reporters and incomplete income reporters is not large enough to

change substantially the distribution of consumption for the bottom half of the

distribution (compare Rows 1 and 2 for each sample). For all families, the percentiles of

consumption for the samples that include only complete income reporters (our base

sample) never differ by more than 2 percent from the percentiles for the full sample. For

specific disadvantaged groups, the differences are typically less than 2.5 percent.22 None

of the analyses of consumption or expenditures that we present in this paper are sensitive

to the inclusion or exclusion of incomplete income reporters.23

         To examine how attrition might bias our analyses of consumption, Table 6 also

reports various percentiles for a sample that only includes data from second quarter

interviews. Second quarter interviews are the first for which the full survey is

administered for each sampling unit (the first interview just gathers baseline information).

The CE Survey is a sample of addresses, not consumer units (CUs). Those who move

away from their sample address between interviews are dropped from the survey, while

those moving into a sample address are included in the survey after being screened for

eligibility (U.S. Department of Labor, various years). These first full interviews for

housing units (second quarter interviews) are close to a random sample of housing units

as is intended in the survey. As is evident by comparing Rows 2 and 3 for all families,

and within each demographic group, the bottom part of the distribution for the second

22
   A similar analysis for expenditures indicates that the differences for these percentiles are never greater
than five percent.
23
   This contradicts claims by Bavier (2007) that “Expenditures of CE ‘complete income reporters’ are not
representative of all consumer units.” Bavier argues that average expenditures for complete income
reporters exceed those of other consumer units. However, most of the difference is due to differences in
spending on insurance and pensions, which is typically excluded from measures of consumption.
Moreover this difference arises because income data are used to impute this insurance component.
Whether income data are complete matters crucially for this imputation. When insurance is excluded,
spending for complete income reporters is only slightly higher than spending for incomplete income
reporters.


                                                      23
quarter interview sample is remarkably similar to that of the full sample. This suggests

that including data from interviews beyond the second quarter does not bias analyses of

consumption, even within demographic groups.

       Bavier (2007) examines attrition by restricting his sample to the first reported

interview for each consumer unit (not housing unit). For this sample, he compares

consumption across CUs that differ in the number of quarters of reported expenditures.

Thus, he is comparing samples that have different shares of CUs that have just moved

residences. For example, the four quarter sample will be CUs who never move during

the sample period, while movers will be over-represented in the one quarter sample.

These samples are all non-representative and should differ from each other even when

attrition is random. Comparisons of consumption across these non-representative

samples lead Bavier to conclude mistakenly that “sample loss is negatively related to

economic status.” The fourth row of each panel in Table 6 reports consumption

percentiles for Bavier’s unconventional sample of first reported interview for each CU. It

is not surprising that expenditures for this sample that over-represents movers are lower

than for other samples.



VI.    Consumption and Income as Predictors of Well-Being

       The relative quality of income and consumption data at the bottom can be

investigated by determining whether low consumption or low income is more closely

associated with other bad outcomes (Meyer and Sullivan, 2003). We examine whether

low values of income or consumption are more closely related to poor health, disability,

and worse values of measures of material well-being such as the size of the residence,

number of cars, whether the family took a vacation, and whether the family has access to


                                            24
certain appliances within the dwelling unit. Table 7 examines how outcomes differ for

families in the bottom five percent of the consumption and income distributions

compared to all other families using CE Survey and PSID data. Column 1 reports the

mean value of each outcome for those in the bottom five percent of the income

distribution, while Column 2 reports the mean for those in the top ninety-five percent of

the income distribution. If higher values of the outcome are better, as we expect given

the way all outcomes are defined in the table, the difference in Column 3 should be

negative if those at the bottom of the income distribution fare worse than others.

Similarly, in Columns 4 through 6 we report the same statistics for groups defined by

their place in the consumption distribution. Column 7 reports the key difference-in-

differences summary measure, which should be negative if low consumption is a better

indicator of bad outcomes than is low income.

       The results in this table indicate that low consumption is usually a better indicator

of hardship than income. For the CE Survey, the negative values in Columns 3 and 6

indicate that in all cases, those in the bottom 5 percent of income or consumption

experience worse material conditions than those above the bottom 5 percent. Column 7

indicates that in all cases low consumption is a clearer indicator of worse outcomes than

low income. Moreover, in all but three of these cases, the statistic in Column 7 is

significantly different from zero.

       The PSID results are less strong, but still favor consumption. Seven of the ten

statistics in Column 7 are negative, which favors consumption, and four of these are

significant. Surprisingly, low income seems to be significantly more closely associated

with low automobile ownership than is low consumption in the PSID. We should note




                                            25
that consumption is handicapped in the PSID, where we believe the income data are of

higher quality than the consumption data, while the reverse is true in the CE Survey.

Also, the results are likely biased towards favoring income in the PSID due to the longer

reference period for income (the previous calendar year) than food expenditures (a typical

week).

         We also examine the relationship between low consumption, low income, and the

same outcomes listed in Table 7 for a number of disadvantaged groups such as all single

mother headed families, families with a head age 65 and over, and families with a

disabled head. We summarize the results of these analyses in Table 8, by reporting the

number favoring income (the difference-in-differences statistic is positive) and the

number favoring consumption (the difference-in-differences statistic is negative). The

evidence from the CE Survey again strongly favors consumption, and in most cases this

evidence is statistically significant. For the PSID, we also see more of these outcomes

favoring consumption than income within each of these disadvantaged groups. However,

due to small sample sizes for these groups, the results from the PSID are not very precise.

         Charles et al. (2006) perform a similar analysis to ours for a sample of those 53

and over using the 2001 Consumption and Activities Mail Survey (CAMS) of the Health

and Retirement Study (HRS). For the full sample, they find that income is more strongly

associated with measures of well-being than their measure of consumption. However, for

the bottom decile (roughly those who are poor) the evidence strongly favors consumption

for physical health and wealth measures. The evidence is mixed for housing and

neighborhood measures, and strongly favors income for measures of mental health in the

past week and food hardship. It is somewhat surprising to find even modest support for




                                              26
consumption given that the HRS focuses on income while the consumption data come

from a supplement mailed to a subsample of HRS households.

         Using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), Bavier

(2007) indicates that income is more strongly correlated with material hardship than is

expenditures. However, his measure of expenditures from the SIPP is inappropriate for

this analysis because it includes components that may indicate worse well-being, such as

out of pocket medical expenses, child care, and work expenses, and because consumption

of owner-occupied housing is measured using mortgage payments—an approach most

researchers examining consumption have rejected (Cutler and Katz, 1991; Slesnick,

1993; Meyer and Sullivan, 2003, 2004). Using an alternative consumption measure that

is as good as one can do with the limited information in the SIPP, we find that its

correlation with the various hardship measures is the same or higher than that of

income.24 This result is especially striking because the SIPP provides probably the best

measure of income available in any standard household dataset (Citro and Michael, 1995;

Meyer, Mok and Sullivan, 2007), while the consumption data are based on a little used

supplement that provides only about half of total spending and misses key components

such as food consumption.



VII.     Discussion and Conclusions

         This paper shows that recent changes in income and consumption differ sharply

for some disadvantaged groups and measures of poverty. For example, following welfare

reform, reported income for the bottom decile of single mothers fell as some past authors


24
  Specifically, we sum utilities, rent, and the flow values of homes and vehicles, which are calculated
based on the reported values of these durables.


                                                     27
have emphasized, but we show reported consumption rose. In many cases where income

and consumption patterns diverge, consumption measures show greater improvements

than income measures. However, the reverse is true for child poverty. This paper also

addresses standard criticisms of the quality of consumption data. These criticisms

usually focus on sample size, measurement error, and the declining share of NIPA

consumption captured by the CE Survey. We present substantial evidence that

consumption data are measured better than income data at the bottom of the distribution.

This empirical evidence supports conceptual arguments that generally favor consumption.

The bottom deciles of expenditures exceed those for income suggesting under-reporting

of income. There is a high and rising under-reporting rate for government transfers, a

source of income that is particularly important at the bottom. In addition, the

nonresponse and imputation rates are similar or higher in our source of official income

data than in our main source of consumption data. Finally, low consumption for the

worst off among the disadvantaged seems to be more closely associated with other bad

outcomes than is low income. The results favoring consumption are strongest when

examining the bottom 5 or 10 percent of the distribution; the evidence is more mixed

higher up in the distribution, particularly for those 65 and over. The evidence favors

consumption, or is mixed, in surveys such as the PSID, SIPP, and HRS-CAMS. Given

that these surveys focus on income or have incomplete measures of consumption, this

evidence is even a stronger endorsement of consumption.

       The findings in this paper are in sharp contrast to Bavier (2007). We show that

these differences arise because Bavier draws broad conclusions based on a narrow set of

results and employs inappropriate procedures for studying data quality. For example,




                                            28
Bavier (2007) claims that “there is no huge discrepancy in federal surveys between

income and expenditures near the bottom of the distribution.” This conclusion is based

on results for overall poverty only, ignoring large differences between income and

consumption for key demographic groups, as well as divergent trends in poverty gaps and

deep poverty, and other differences. Bavier (2007) also suggests that income data are of

higher quality than consumption data. However, we show that Bavier’s conclusions

regarding nonresponse are flawed because he reports non-comparable numbers for survey

nonresponse and he completely ignores item nonresponse. In addition, his analysis of

sample attrition is based on an unconventional, non-representative sample. Finally, we

show that Bavier’s analysis of the correlation between hardship measures and income or

consumption depends on an expenditure measure that heavily weights items such as child

care, work expenses, and out of pocket medical expenses that are conventionally left out

of consumption. Using the same dataset, we find that a more conventional and

appropriate consumption measure reverses his result.

       Although the evidence presented here indicates that greater attention should be

given to consumption when studying the well-being of disadvantaged households and the

effects of anti-poverty programs, there are some important limitations of consumption

data. For example, income data are easier to collect for determining individual program

eligibility. Also, the sample sizes in the best consumption datasets currently available are

too small to measure precisely poverty for small geographic areas or to measure year to

year changes.

       Differences between income and consumption at the bottom remain a puzzle. The

relative importance of unreported income and saving or dissaving is not clear, especially




                                            29
for groups besides single mothers. Further research is needed to examine the reasons for

these differences. In addition, more research is needed on how to obtain a reasonable

consumption measure from a small set of questions, as examined in Browning et al.,

2003, and on how to synthesize questions about expenditures and durable holdings into

consumption measures.

DATA APPENDIX

After-Tax Money Income Plus Food Stamps (CE Survey, CPS, and PSID) adds to

money income the value of tax credits such as the EITC, and subtracts state and federal

income taxes and payroll taxes, and includes capital gains and losses, and adds the face

value of Food Stamps.

After-Tax Income Plus Noncash Benefits (CPS) adds to After-tax Money Income Plus

Food Stamps the imputed cash value of housing subsidies, and school lunch programs.

Expenditures (CE Survey) start with the BLS measure of total expenditures. We add

principal payments on home mortgages and financed vehicles, and subtract the purchase

price for financed vehicles. This measure, sometimes called outlays, follows Rogers and

Gray (1994). Expenditures are reported for three-month periods. We scale these

quarterly expenditures to an annual level.

Consumption (CE Survey) subtracts from the BLS measure of total expenditures

spending on health care, education, pension plans, and cash contributions. In addition,

housing and vehicle expenditures are converted to service flows. The rental equivalent

for owned dwellings is used instead of spending on mortgage interest, property taxes, and

spending on maintenance, repairs, and insurance. For those in public or subsidized

housing, we impute a rental value. We subtract spending on vehicle purchases and add a

vehicle service flow. See Meyer and Sullivan (2006a) for more details.

Food Consumption (PSID) includes expenditures on food at home and away from home

and dollars of food stamps received.

Housing (PSID) does not include utilities or other housing costs because they are not

available throughout our sample period in the PSID. It includes rent for renters and the




                                             34
reported rental equivalent for those who neither rent nor own. For homeowners, we

calculate a service flow of housing consumption based on the value of the home. This

flow is calculated as a constant fraction (r) of the reported property value. This is the

service flow for a durable with an after-tax interest rate r and with no depreciation. The

results reported in Figure 3 are for r = 0.07, but we verify that the results do not change

when we use values of r between 0.05 and 0.1. In addition, within the CE Survey this

flow matched up fairly well with reported rental equivalent of the home.

Equivalence Scales are used to adjust resource measures for differences in family size.

In most cases we use the equivalence scale recommended by the National Academy of

Sciences panel (Citro and Michael 1995): (Adults + 0.7*Children)0.7. As a robustness

check, we verify that the trends are similar using the equivalence scale implicit in the

official poverty definition.

Notes: Controls include a cubic in the age of the head, number of children less than 18, number of girls age 2-15, number of
boys age 2-15, education of the head, race, and region. For the models that include married mothers we also include the
number of earners in the family and the education of the spouse. Columns 1 through 4 report the coefficients on the 2nd
and 3rd period dummies in quantile regressions where the first period dummy is excluded. Columns 5 through 8 report the
difference between the coefficients on single mother*period interaction terms. All standard errors are bootstrapped and
corrected for within family dependence. See text for more details.

Notes: The samples in Panel B include all unmarried female headed consumer units or families living with
at least one child under 18. Expenditures are measured as outlays (following Rogers and Gray, 1994) and
income is after tax and includes food stamps as explained in the text. These family level outcomes are
expressed in real terms (2005 dollars) and adjusted for differences in family size using the NAS
recommended equivalence scale and normalized to a family with one adult and two children. Samples from
the CE Survey include only those designated as complete income reporters (U.S. Department of Labor,
various years). See text for more details.

Notes: Survey nonresponse rates are from U.S. Census Bureau (various years) for the CPS and
from U.S. Department of Labor (various years) for the CE Survey. Imputation rates are
calculated as the fraction of the total dollars of income or expenditures that are imputed. After-
tax income includes pre-tax money income, food stamps, taxes, and capital gains and losses.
The expenditures measure used here is the BLS measure of total expenditures. CPS-
ASEC/ADF results are reported by reference year for annual income, rather than by the survey
year.
a
  If more than half of pre-tax income is imputed, then taxes are considered to be imputed.
b
  Taxes are always considered to be imputed.

Notes: For columns 1 and 4, the dependent variable is the log of total consumption (CE Survey) or log of food consumption (PSID). For columns 2 and 5, the
dependent variable is the log of after-tax family income. In addition to the variables reported above, all models include a full set of month dummies, flexible controls
for family size and composition, a cubic in age, and the race and education of the female head. The standard errors in parentheses are corrected for within household
dependence by using the conventional White estimator.

Notes: Single mother headed families include all consumer units (CUs) headed by an unmarried female who lives
with at least one child under the age of 18. The disabled sample includes all CUs with a head who did not work in
the previous year due to a disability. We use the BLS designation of complete income reporters (see U.S.
Department of Labor, various years). Rows 3 and 4 do not exclude incomplete income reporters. Row 3 in each
panel includes data from second quarter interviews only, which is the first quarter that the living unit is eligible to
report complete expenditure data. Following Bavier (2007), Row 4 in each panel includes all CUs reporting
complete expenditure data for the first time, which will include multiple responses from the same living unit if
different CUs reside in the living unit while the living unit is in the survey. See the notes to Table 2 for additional
details.

Notes: Number of rooms is adjusted for family size using the NAS recommended equivalence scale. PSID data are from various
waves between 1984 and 2003 depending on the availability of outcome variables. We predict total consumption in the PSID based on
reported values in the PSID for food and housing, and housing flows for homeowners are calculated from reported housing values. We
also impute a value of housing for those in public or subsidized housing. This approach is a slightly updated version of that used in
Meyer & Sullivan (2003). * denotes significance at the 5% level, which is determined using bootstrapped standard errors that correct
for within family dependence.
