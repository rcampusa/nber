                                          ABSTRACT

In response to the Covid-19 crisis, 186 countries implemented direct cash transfers to households,
and 181 introduced in-kind programs that lowered the cost of utilities such as electricity, water,
transport, and mobile money. Do cash or in-kind transfers generate greater welfare
improvements? And, does a country's financial infrastructure affect optimal aid disbursement?
Through a parallel set of surveys in two urban regions in Africa--with comparable education, cell
phone ownership, and electricity connectivity--we show that optimal government aid
disbursement hinges on financial infrastructure. In line with economic theory favoring direct cash
transfers, in a randomized experiment in Kenya 95% of urban recipients prefer mobile money
over electricity transfers of a similar monetary value. But Kenya is an outlier with high mobile
money adoption: this increases its value and reduces transaction costs of buying electricity credit.
By contrast, in Ghana--where mobile money is less widespread and the transaction costs for
buying electricity are higher--half of recipients prefer electricity transfers, and many are willing
to forego significant value to receive electricity instead of mobile money. These results have
several important policy implications. First, the optimal government policy in response to an
economic crisis is not uniform: cash and in-kind transfers have different advantages that make
each suitable for specific contexts. Second, the adoption of modern financial technologies will
likely increase the efficiency of government cash transfer programs, even as in-kind transfers
continue to be preferred in settings where mobile money uptake is slow. Finally, giving recipients
a choice harnesses valuable local information that a policy maker may not have access to.

1    Introduction
Many countries expanded their social programs in response to the Covid-19 pandemic: 186 in-
troduced or expanded cash transfer programs and 181 introduced programs lowering or postponing
payments for utilities such as electricity, water, transport, and mobile money transactions (Gentilini
et al. 2021). Cash transfers are theoretically utility-maximizing, and evidence shows they damp-
ened the economic impacts of the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns (Egger et al. 2021; Banerjee
et al. 2020). But in-kind transfers may be preferable if they circumvent savings constraints or lower
transaction costs, especially when transfers are inframarginal (Southworth 1945; Bruce and Wald-
man 1991; Currie and Gahvari 2008; Gadenne et al.; Hirvonen and Hoddinott 2021; Cunha 2014).
What programs most effectively address the economic consequences of a nationwide emergency such
as a public health crisis? How does a country's financial infrastructure affect the distribution of
government aid?
    We elicit preferences of 4,100 adults in Ghana and Kenya to compare demand for and impacts
of transfers in the form of mobile money and pre-paid electricity credit. Although urban Ghana
and Kenya are have similar levels of education, cell phone ownership, and electricity connectivity,
responses vary significantly.1 In urban Kenya, in line with basic economic theory, 95% of respondents
prefer cash, and many are willing to forego significant value to receive mobile money rather than an
electricity transfer. Responses in Accra, the capital of Ghana, are strikingly different: 49% prefer
pre-paid electricity over a mobile money transfer of the same value, and many are willing to forego
significant value to receive electricity rather than mobile money.
    We attribute these differences to heterogeneity in mobile money infrastructure and its integration
with economic activity. Cash gives recipients the flexibility to spend money on goods and services
with the highest marginal utility, but this benefit disappears if cash is disbursed via mobile money
in contexts where mobile money is not widely accepted. In Kenya, where 75% of adults use mobile
money and 97% of households have at least one mobile money account, mobile money adoption and
usage is almost twice as high as in Ghana. The integration of the payment system of Kenya Power--
Kenya's nationwide electric utility--with Kenya's mobile money infrastructure also significantly
lowered the transaction costs of buying electricity. The time and effort required to buy electricity
in Ghana increases demand for electricity transfers that allow recipients to circumvent these costs.
While urban respondents in Ghana report five times greater electricity spending than urban Kenyan
respondents, this is unlikely to be driving the differences: the gap exists even among respondents
with similar electricity consumption, and there is no correlation between electricity spending and
preference for electricity. Finally, many respondents in Ghana received government electricity and
water transfers, but this does not correlate strongly with preferences, and few respondents in Ghana
or Kenya report having received any other form of Covid-19 aid from government or NGOs.
    These differences demonstrate how financial infrastructure affects the disbursement of govern-
  1
    The World Bank estimates that 94% and 91% of urban residents in Ghana and Kenya have access to electricity;
98% and 99% progress to secondary school; and they have 134 and 104 mobile cellular subscriptions per 100 people.
The populations of Accra and Nairobi are 3.3 million and 4.7 million, respectively.

ment aid. The rapid expansion of mobile money in some contexts will make government cash
transfers cheaper, faster, and more secure. Ghana is currently experiencing rapid adoption of mo-
bile money technologies--36% from 2017 to 2018, for example--so even the results in this study may
not hold not far in the future. But mobile money uptake may be slow in some settings, including
those where intended recipients are too poor or lack the technological know-how to own a cellphone.
In these contexts, in-kind transfers may remain preferred for some time. Importantly, optimal policy
is a function of local financial infrastructure and access, which can vary across contexts and may
not always be known to the social planner. Building on concerns about external validity of experi-
ments raised by Allcott (2015), Bold et al. (2013), and Vivalt (2020), this paper demonstrates that
empirical findings cannot necessarily be extrapolated beyond the study context, and care must be
taken when doing so for the purposes of policy recommendations. Furthermore, involving recipients
in policy decisions when choosing the form of aid promotes inclusivity and dignity, and can harness
local private knowledge frequently unavailable to a remote policy maker (Alatas et al. 2012; Shapiro
2019; Thomas et al. 2020).
   To study the impacts of electricity transfers, we implement a randomized experiment in Kenya
among a subset of respondents. The results suggest that biased attention or mental accounting
may affect preferences and impacts of cash and electricity transfers. Some were randomly assigned
to treatment groups in which they state their preferences between cash and electricity transfers
and then receive the selected option. This makes the decisions incentivized and also identifies the
causal impacts of the transfers. In theory, electricity and cash transfers should generate identical
increases in electricity consumption by fully rational agents in an efficient market. However, we
find that pre-paid electricity transfers generate significant increases in electricity consumption while
cash transfers do not. We find no impacts of electricity transfers on a wide range of socioeconomic
outcomes, consistent with other work which finds limited social and economic impacts of rural
electrification (Lee et al. 2020; Burlig and Preonas 2016), though transfer sizes are small.
   In Ghana, preference elicitation coincided with a government Covid-19 relief program to provide
all connected households with a monthly electricity transfer. Berkouwer et al. (2021) find that
many households in Accra experienced delays in transfer receipt, and over 30% of eligible households
never received any transfer. Variation in the timing of transfer receipt within households allows us
to estimate the impacts of electricity transfer receipt. Households receiving transfers significantly
reduce their electricity spending, though by less than the transfer amount, and also reduce the
number of trips taken to add to their pre-paid credit. As in Kenya, we find no correlation between
electricity transfers and socioeconomic outcomes.
   The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides background on Covid in Ghana
and in Kenya. Section 3 presents the sample and surveys, and discusses the experimental compo-
nent. Section 4 presents the results and Section 5 discusses the potential mechanisms and policy
implications of these results. Section 6 concludes.

2    Background
Kenya and Ghana both confirmed their first Covid-19 positive patient on March 12, 2020. Three
days later, Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta and Ghana's President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-
Addo both announced a broad set of physical distancing measures which eventually included bans
on social gatherings in crowded places, closures of schools, universities, and congregations in places
of worship, and significant travel restrictions both domestically and internationally. The economic
impacts of the Covid-19 public health crisis and its accompanying policies were substantial. Egger
et al. (2021) find that " 50 to 80% of sample populations in [Ghana and Kenya] report income losses
during the COVID-19 period," and that average firm profits and revenues in Kenya fell by 51 and
44% respectively.
    Numerous governments introduced or expanded cash transfer programs to help alleviate Covid-
19 related economic downturns. In March 2020 the Government of Kenya expanded its existing social
safety net, Inua Jamii, which provides cash transfers to society's most vulnerable populations--
including the elderly, orphaned children, survivors of sexual and gender-based violence, people with
disabilities, and pregnant and lactating mothers--and launched urban public works employment
schemes (Gentilini et al. 2021). In May 2020 Ghana provided an additional round of cash transfers to
existing recipients of the Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) Program, which targets
around 5% of Ghana's poorest households (Dadzie and Raju 2020). In many African countries
mobile money is an important tool for providing cash transfers, particularly for populations excluded
from formal financial institutions.
    At the same time, many countries introduced in-kind transfer programs. These can be attractive
to governments lacking infrastructure to distribute cash broadly, beyond vulnerable populations al-
ready receiving government aid. In May 2020, the government of Ghana launched an electricity relief
program, citing the importance of reliable electricity during economic downturns. All households
with an electricity connection were eligible to receive a monthly transfer, with transfer amounts
pinned to consumption in March 2020 before the program was announced (ECG 2020). Customers
who consumed less than Ghana's `lifeline' amount of 50 kWh in March were eligible to receive 50
kWh in electricity credit--worth USD 3.50--each month, while all other customers would receive
50% of their March consumption, which averaged USD 15 in our sample. In theory, all electricity
customers were eligible for transfers from May to July 2020, and eligibility for lifeline customers--
around 10% of our sample--continued until March 2021. In practice, not all households received
transfers and there was significant variation in the timing and consistency of monthly transfer re-
ceipt (Berkouwer et al. 2021). Among respondents in our sample in Ghana, more than two-thirds
had received at least one electricity transfer in the first three months of the program, and almost
half had received a Covid-19 water subsidy transfer (the other main government pandemic relief
program).
    Other than the programs described above, aid was limited. In both Kenya and Ghana, fewer
than 10% of respondents reported receiving any cash, food, or other aid from the government or an
NGO in the past 1-2 weeks.

3     Study Design
Over a study period of seven months, between May and November 2020, 3,211 respondents in
Kenya and 911 in Ghana were surveyed by phone between one and three times each All respondents
in Ghana were eligible for electricity transfers through the government's Covid-19 relief program
and completed a stated preference survey on electricity versus cash transfers. In Kenya, a subset
of 2,053 respondents--those with pre-paid electricity meters--were enrolled in a randomized field
experiment. Each respondent was randomly assigned to one of four groups: a control group, a group
that received pre-paid electricity tokens, and two groups that were given a choice between cash or
electricity transfers at different rates. 1,041 respondents in Kenya also answered stated preference
questions on electricity versus cash transfers.

3.1    Sample
The primary sample is located in urban areas of Kenya and Ghana and consists of 983 and 911
households respectively that are connected to the grid and use pre-paid meters to pay for electricity
in advance.2 Customers with a pre-paid meter may only consume electricity that they pay for
in advance by purchasing electricity credit, or tokens. In Ghana, most pre-paid customers must
purchase credit from a local utility office or shop. In Kenya most pre-paid customers can purchase
credit remotely using mobile money.
    Table A1 and Table A2 present summary statistics for the Ghana and Kenya samples respectively
and compare these with the broader population. The samples are broadly similar to electricity
customers in Accra and urban Kenya based on observable characteristics like housing quality and
appliance ownership. The urban samples skew slightly younger than census data, likely because
mobile phones were used to recruit respondents and conduct surveys. Rates of appliance ownership
are higher in our sample than in the representative samples, likely because an electricity connection
was required to participate in our study.
    In Kenya, we also surveyed 2,228 respondents located in rural areas of Western Kenya, Nyanza,
and Rift Valley who previously participated in Lee et al. (2020) or Wolfram et al. (2021). 1,070 rural
respondents had pre-paid meters and were included in the experimental sample. 355 had post-paid
meters (receiving monthly bills) and 803 did not have any electricity connection: these respondents
were excluded from the experimental sample, but still completed the socioeconomic surveys to allow
us to investigate descriptive heterogeneity.3
    2
      Respondents in Ghana were enrolled in 2018 and 2019 and are distributed across western Accra (Klugman et
al. 2019). Respondents in urban Kenya were recruited through Ajua, a mobile survey firm, and are located in Nairobi
(39%), Eldoret (11%), Mombasa (9%), and elsewhere.

      Due to budget constraints, a random subset of unconnected households was surveyed in the first survey round,
and the remainder were surveyed in the second survey round.

government electricity transfers in Ghana.


3.2      Study components and timeline
Figure 1 displays the timeline of study activities. All respondents completed between one and three
phone surveys between May and November 2020.
    All respondents in Ghana were eligible for government electricity transfers for at least 3 months
in 2020. On average, respondents were eligible to receive USD 10 per month, equivalent to 95 kWh
using local electricity tariffs, or 17 days of average pre-pandemic electricity spending for this sample.
    Kenya did not have a similar government electricity transfer program. Instead, we implemented
a randomized transfer program. Study participants received--per month, for three months--either
USD 5 in electricity, USD 3.50 or USD 5 in mobile money, or no transfers. Among the urban sample,
USD 5 represents 50 days of average electricity spending. Section 3.4 discusses the treatments in
more detail.

3.3      WTP elicitation
The elicitation for the experimental sample in Kenya was incentive compatible--respondents re-
ceived their selected transfer--while respondents in Ghana were informed choices were hypothetical.
    In each survey round, respondents in Ghana were presented with an iterated sequence of hypo-
thetical dichotomous choices to elicit their Willingness To Pay (WTP) for a GHS 50 (USD 8.60)
electricity transfer. This amount roughly equals monthly government pandemic relief transfer ex-
pected in our sample, and represents 15 days of average electricity spending. In each question the
respondent chooses between a GHS 50 electricity transfer or a cash transfer of a certain amount,
which varies depending on the prior response. WTP is the highest cash transfer amount the respon-
dent rejects in favor of the electricity transfer. Berkouwer et al. (2021) provides more information
on the elicitation methodology.
    In Kenya, one-third of respondents were randomly assigned to a treatment group that allowed
them to choose between either mobile money transfers or electricity tokens (we discuss random

                                                                     6
assignment more in Section 3.4). One-sixth of participants were given a choice between three
monthly transfers of KSH 500 (around USD 5) each of either mobile money or electricity tokens;
a separate one-sixth of participants were given a choice between three monthly transfers of either
KSH 500 in mobile money or KSH 350 in electricity tokens.
       In addition, rural respondents and urban respondents in a smaller pilot survey were given a non-
incentivized decision, which we use to confirm that results hold when comparing the non-incentivized
decisions in Ghana and Kenya. The structure of the non-incentivized decisions mirrors the structure
in Ghana, with a reference electricity transfer of USD 5.

3.4      Randomized experiment
In Kenya, all 983 urban respondents and 1,070 of the rural respondents--those with pre-paid
meters--participated in a randomized field experiment.4 Each respondent was randomly assigned to
one of four groups: a control group, a group that receives electricity tokens (redeemable for pre-paid
credit), and two groups that are given a choice between cash or electricity transfers at different rates
and are then given their chosen option.5 Figure A1 displays the sample size for each treatment.
Participants in the treatment groups received three transfers--either cash or electricity--in between
the baseline and endline surveys.

         [C] Control group (33.3%) Participants are surveyed but did not receive any transfers.
         [T1] Token transfer (33.3%): Participants received three transfers of pre-paid electricity
         tokens valued at USD 5 each.
         [T2A] Token vs high cash choice (16.7%): Participants were given a choice between
         USD 5 worth of electricity tokens or USD 5 in cash, transferred via mobile money. Whichever
         option they chose, they received each USD 5 transfer three times within a two month period.
         [T2B] Token vs low cash choice (16.7%): Participants were given a choice between USD
         5 worth of electricity tokens or USD 3.50 in cash, transferred via mobile money. Whichever
         option they chose, they received each transfer three times within a two month period.

       For 70% of respondents, the USD 5 transfer bought around 32 kWh in pre-paid electricity.6 All
experimental transfers were transmitted remotely. Cash was transferred using Safaricom's M-Pesa
   4
     Electricity transfers in Kenya within this study's timeframe were logistically feasible only among households with
a pre-paid electricity connection. Households with post-paid meters have higher average income and education.

     Random assignment is implemented separately for the urban and rural samples. To avoid spillover contamination,
treatments for the rural sample are randomly assigned at the village level, stratified by the number of respondents

randomization for the urban sample is done at the individual level.

     Kenya Power's tariff changes slightly month-to-month. In addition, those connected through the government's
Last Mile Connectivity Project (LMCP)--including most respondents from Wolfram et al. (2021) and those not
connected through Lee et al. (2020)--were paying monthly installments for their connections. In these cases, part of
each top-up is applied to debt repayment before being used to buy kWh of electricity. 15% received around 22kWh,
7% received around 16kWh, and the rest received between 10 and 30 kWh per transfer. Respondents connected
through Lee et al. (2020) did not have debt outstanding and generally received around 32 kWh. 32 kWh per month
is Kenya's `lifeline' amount and is roughly equivalent to operating 4 light bulbs, a television, a cell phone charger,
and an iron for month under average usage patterns.

         context. The choice is incentivized in Kenya, as respondents receive the transfer they choose, while in
         Ghana the choice is presented as hypothetical.


mobile banking service to a mobile money account corresponding to a phone number provided by
the respondent. Electricity transfer tokens were first purchased at a local Kenya Power office,7 and
the token ID was then sent to respondents via SMS, who could then enter it into their meter to
activate the credit.


4        Results
In Kenya, households overwhelmingly prefer mobile money, and are willing to forego on average
40% of value to receive mobile money instead of an electricity transfer. By contrast, in Ghana,
respondents are on average willing to forego 4% of value to receive an electricity transfer instead
of mobile money. Electricity transfers modestly increase electricity usage in Kenya and decrease
electricity spending and transactions in Ghana, but have limited impacts on broader socioeconomic
outcomes.

4.1        Preferences for electricity and mobile money
Figure 2 displays take-up of electricity expressed as the implicit choice price indicating the value
of the mobile money transfer offer relative to the electricity credit transfer offer. In Kenya, when
the implicit price of USD 1 of electricity is USD 1 of mobile money, 5% of urban participants
take up the electricity transfer (choosing USD 5 in electricity over USD 5 in mobile money). Even

        To prevent fraud, each token is tied to a respondent's Kenya Power account number.



                                                                                                  8
when USD 1 of electricity has an implicit price of only USD 0.70 in mobile money, only 18% select
electricity. This preference for cash is only slightly lower among urban respondents: 13% and 34%
choose electricity, respectively.8
    In Ghana, on the other hand, almost half of respondents choose electricity at an implicit price
of USD 1. Even with an implicit price of USD 1.20, 26% still choose electricity credit.9
    Table 1 explores correlates of preference for electricity over an equal amount of mobile money
by context. In Ghana respondents with many appliance types, and who experienced fewer outage
hours in the past month, were more likely to choose electricity. WTP for electricity is also higher for
households who--conditional on total electricity spending--top up less frequently: they may face
higher transaction costs of purchasing electricity credit, for example living further from a vendor.
We discuss transaction costs more in Section 5.
    In Kenya, households with a refrigerator are more likely to prefer electricity over cash,10

4.2    Impact of transfers
We next analyze how cash and electricity transfers affect economic outcomes. Electricity transfers
nudge recipients towards electricity consumption, despite relatively low transaction costs in using
mobile money to purchase electricity tokens. Other than this, the treatment has no significant
effects on a wide range of socio-economic outcomes.
    The following equation estimates the effects of each randomly assigned treatment for the Kenya
experimental sample:

vary by individual for the urban sample.
    In Ghana we leverage quasi-random variation in respondent receipt of the ongoing government
electricity relief program to estimate these effects. Berkouwer et al. (2021) describes the variation
in whether and when households received government electricity relief in more detail. We analyze
impacts of government transfer receipt using the following household fixed effects specification:

                                               30       pre-30

     While more respondents choose electricity over cash in non-incentivized elicitation in both rural and urban Kenya,
we still observe a strong preference for mobile money (Figure A2).
   9
     Responses in Ghana are similar across survey rounds and among respondents that had and had not received
government electricity relief (Figure A3).

     Just 2% of rural households in this sample have a refrigerator.

This table presents estimates of the correlations between respondent characteristics and preference for electricity
relative to cash, elicited through a series of choices between an electricity credit transfer and a mobile money transfer
of a varying amount. The dependent variable is a dummy for preferring an electricity credit transfer to a mobile
money transfer of equal value. "Respondent is female" indicator is omitted for the urban Kenya sample due to
missing values. Estimates in column (1) include week and district fixed effects, and SEs are clustered by household.
Column (1) includes all households in the Ghana sample. Columns (2) and (3) include households in Kenya in the
experimental treatment arm T2A that were offered an incentivized choice between USD 5 worth of electricity tokens
or USD 5 in cash.

for the rural sample, pooling survey rounds 2 and 3 to increase statistical power. Table 3 estimates
equation 2 for Ghana.
    In Kenya, electricity transfers increased electricity usage by 30 kWh (worth USD 3) for the rural
sample and 43 kWh for the urban sample. They also led to higher electricity meter balances at
endline for both groups, and to decreases in recent electricity spending. These effects are large:
relative to the control group, treated households increased electricity usage by 66% in the rural
sample and 105% in the urban sample.
    On the other hand, the T2A treatment arm had no effect on electricity usage among urban
respondents--95.5% of whom chose mobile money. Given that electricity is storable and transaction
costs for using mobile money to purchase electricity tokens are low, there is no reason ex ante for
the electricity transfers in T1 to generate larger increases in electricity usage. Instead, mental
accounting, or increased attention to electricity usage due to the treatment, might account for
increased electricity consumption among T1.
    In Ghana, electricity expenditure falls by USD 1.50 in the last 30 days for respondents that
received electricity relief in that time period. This reduction is less than the median amount re-
ceived in the last 30 days among recipients (7 USD), suggesting recipients are increasing electricity
consumption relative to non-recipients. Pre-paid meter balance at the time of the survey increases,
but unlike in Kenya this is not significant--households appear to be largely consuming rather than
storing their transfers. This indicates that monthly relief transfers were generally inframarginal to



                                                          12
optimal monthly household electricity consumption. We do not measure electricity usage since base-
line, but for a subset of households we can calculate approximate electricity usage between survey
rounds. Unlike in Kenya, we do not find that transfer receipt is associated with increased electric-
ity usage for this subset of households, despite the above evidence suggesting electricity transfers
increase usage overall. Instead, households receiving electricity relief top up their electricity credit
significantly less frequently, but do not decrease their expenditures when they do top up. Electricity
transfers allow households to avoid transaction costs associated with topping up electricity.
    Other than electricity use, there are minimal effects of electricity transfers on other outcomes
such as non-energy spending and food security in both Kenya and Ghana. Table A3 reports results
for additional socio-economic outcomes in Kenya.


5    Discussion
We document a striking difference in preferences for cash versus in-kind transfers across similar
contexts in Kenya and Ghana. We argue that the effectiveness of cash transfer programs hinges
on the financial infrastructure used to disburse government aid, and its integration with payment
platforms.
    In 2007, the Kenyan firm M-PESA launched one of the first mobile money products in the world.
Today, 97% of Kenyan households have at least one M-PESA account, and 68% live within 1 km
of an M-PESA agent (Suri et al. 2021). But while 75% of adults in Kenya use mobile money at
least somewhat regularly, it is not as widespread everywhere. In Ghana, only 39% of adults use
mobile money (World Bank 2019). The usage gap is even starker: in the past 90 days only 32%
of Ghanaian mobile money accounts had transacted, whereas in Kenya more than 85% of mobile
money account owners had used their accounts (Bank of Ghana 2019, Central Bank of Kenya 2019).
    These differences in financial infrastructure have important implications for the effectiveness
of government aid disbursement. In Kenya, the high penetration of mobile money infrastructure
increases its value by broadening the set of goods and services it can buy. In contexts where
mobile money infrastructure is less advanced, recipients are limited in what they can do with these
transfers, reducing their value. This may also be the case when the use of mobile money incurs
high transaction fees: 10% of respondents in Ghana state that they "worry about mobile money
charges/costs."
    Mobile money also affects the utility's payment infrastructure. The 2013 launch of Lipa-na-
MPESA (`Pay-with-MPESA' ) facilitated the use of mobile money for commercial transactions in
Kenya. Customers of Kenya Power can buy electricity credit easily using mobile money. But 93%
of customers in our Ghana sample must travel to an ECG office or official electricity vendor to
purchase credit--only 7% have a `smart' pre-paid meter that allows mobile top-up. Among adults
who pay utility bills, 82% in Kenya had used mobile money to do so while only 23% in Ghana had
(World Bank 2018). Respondents who choose electricity credit avoid the time and cost of travelling
to an electricity vendor to purchase credit and any fees or costs associated with using mobile money.


                                                  13
    These patterns are reflected in our survey data. In Ghana, 21% of respondents who preferred
electricity state that it "takes too much time/effort to top up," while in Kenya only 10% of respon-
dents report the same. Lipa-na-MESA penetration is also lower in rural Kenya, lowering the value
of mobile money to rural respondents and increasing transaction costs to buy electricity, which can
help explain the gap between urban and rural preferences.
    But the financial landscape is rapidly changing. The evolution of mobile money infrastructure
will likely spur cash transfers as a fast and cost-effective tool to disburse government aid. While
mobile money usage is currently still lower in Ghana than in Kenya, Ghanaians are rapidly adopting
mobile money. Between December 2017 and December 2018 the number of of registered mobile
money accounts increased by 36%--from 24 million to 33 million--and the number of mobile money
agents more than doubled--from 195,000 to almost 400,000 (Bank of Ghana 2019). Thus, if (indeed,
when) Ghana reaches the high levels of mobile money adoption that currently characterize Kenya's
financial landscape, the optimal channels through which to disburse government aid will likely
change too.
    At the same time, mobile money penetration may remain persistently low in some communities--
including those with low financial literacy, and the ultra-poor, for whom mobile banking fees can
be prohibitive. There, in-kind transfers may continue to be preferred.
    Several other differences between Kenya and Ghana are unlikely to be driving the difference
in preferences. Table A1 and Table A2 for example show that monthly electricity spending is
five times as high in Ghana as in Kenya, at USD 15 and USD 3.20 per month in urban Ghana
and Kenya, respectively. To rule out that electricity spending drives differences in take-up of
electricity, Figure A4 shows the correlation between monthly electricity expenditures and preference
for electricity, separately for each country. Preferences are relatively constant along this dimension,
and, crucially, the difference between Kenya and Ghana holds even when comparing respondents
with relatively similar electricity expenditures.
    Respondents in Kenya might also prefer cash if they lack trust that Kenya Power could implement
mobile money transfers in practice. This is less likely to be a concern for respondents in Ghana given
the ongoing government electricity transfer program, particularly for respondents who had actually
received transfers themselves. However, it does not appear that this is an important channel. In
Ghana, respondents who received at least one government electricity transfer are slightly more likely
to opt for electricity, but this difference is less than 5% and only marginally significant at the 10%
significance level. Just 6% of respondents in Ghana who preferred electricity to mobile money
indicated a lack of trust that the government would provide the money as a reason for preferring
electricity.
    Some concerns were shared by respondents across the two contexts. Households may have
present-biased consumption preferences or face social or intra-household pressures but recognize
that they would benefit in the future from allocating more resources to electricity credit. 36% of
respondents in Ghana that choose electricity over cash, and 73% of those in Kenya, state that they
worry they "will spend the money on something else." For such households having a transfer go


                                                    14
directly to their electricity meter would help them optimize spending. Pre-paid electricity generally
does not expire and can thus be a useful savings device.
    At the same time, households are also more likely to face exacerbated short-term liquidity con-
straints during an economic crisis. This may increase preferences for mobile money over electricity
credit. Some households--particularly in Kenya where the electricity transfers are larger relative to
typical consumption--would take several months to consume the full transfer amount. Since electric-
ity credit cannot generally be converted back to cash, fungible cash may provide these households
with much needed short-term liquidity. Households that prefer electricity to cash appear to be
those who do not face major liquidity constraints: 62% of respondents in Ghana and 46% of those
in Kenya who prefer electricity state that they "would use the money for electricity anyway." For
these households, electricity is the marginal expenditure, so they do not benefit from the flexibility
of choosing the mobile money transfer which they could spend on other forms of consumption.
    The electricity transfer has a significant impact on electricity usage but no other outcomes, and
the cash transfers have no impact on any of the measured outcomes. Given the existing literature
finding large positive effects of cash transfers (Haushofer and Shapiro 2016; Handa et al. 2018), the
limited detectable impacts may be the result of limited statistical power, especially considering the
modest transfer size. We therefore interpret these results cautiously.


6    Conclusion
During an economic crisis, should policy makers distribute cash transfers or in-kind transfers such as
electricity subsidies? And how does a country's financial infrastructure affect the relative efficiency
of these types of government aid?
    We complement preference elicitation surveys in Kenya and Ghana with a randomized field
experiment in Kenya where respondents are offered either electricity tokens or the choice between
tokens and a varying amount of cash. These two contexts--urban settings in Sub-Saharan Africa
with high rates of electricity connectivity--are comparable along most observable characteristics,
yet we find strikingly different results. In urban Kenya, 95% of respondents prefer cash, with most
choosing cash even when offered prepaid electricity tokens worth 40% more in monetary value. In
urban Ghana, on the other hand, the median respondent prefers electricity, and many respondents
are willing to forego significant value to receive electricity rather than mobile money.
    These differences likely stem from advances in mobile money infrastructure in Kenya, and its
integration with utility payment platforms. Mobile money is almost ubiquitous in Kenya and is
well-integrated with Kenya Power's payment system, increasing the value of mobile money and
reducing the transaction costs of buying electricity. By contrast, in Ghana mobile money is less
common, limiting its value, and direct electricity transfers allow recipients to avoid the transaction
costs associated with buying prepaid electricity credit.
    These results demonstrate that financial infrastructure affects the efficiency of government aid
disbursement, and may thus affect a social planner's optimal policy choice. In contexts with rapid


                                                  15
mobile money adoption, cash transfers will likely become a cheaper and more effective channel
through which to disburse government aid. But in contexts with limited mobile money adoption
but with a more developed utility infrastructure, in-kind transfers may continue to be preferred.
The results thus emphasize the importance of understanding local contexts and extrapolating from
study results only after carefully considering any differences that may affect policy recommendations
(Allcott 2015; Bold et al. 2013; Vivalt 2020).
   For governments, mobile money infrastructure provides a channel to transfer funds cheaply and
quickly. It may also alleviate financial pressures that electricity subsidies impose on utilities. In
theory the mode of transfer should not affect the fiscal source of funding, but in practice, the cost
of electricity transfers is often borne by utilities, whereas cash transfer programs are often paid
for by other government agencies. This is an important concern. Electric utilities in 37 out of 39
Sub-Saharan African countries are currently operating at a cost that exceeds the revenue recov-
ered through existing tariffs (Kojima and Trimble 2016). In contexts where utilities are majority
government-owned, they may receive a mandate of providing subsidized electricity without finan-
cial compensation for the additional cost this would incur. This added social responsibility may
increase financial strain on a utility's ability to provide reliable electricity. Fiscal and financial
responsibilities will vary by context and may also affect optimal policy.

where USD 1 of electricity costs USD 1 in mobile money. The numbers shown indicate the share of respondents
who prefer electricity to cash in an equal trade-off, by context. Solid lines indicate incentivized elicitation, where
transfers that respondents receive depend on their responses. Dashed lines indicate non-incentivized elicitation,
where respondents indicate preferences over hypothetical tradeoffs between electricity and cash transfers. Data for
the Ghana non-incentivized willingness-to-pay is based on the Ghana sample, as described in section 3. Data for the
Kenya incentivized willingness-to-pay as well as the rural Kenya non-incentivized willingness-to-pay is based on the

The Ghana sample is drawn entirely from urban households in three Accra West electricity districts in the Greater
Accra Region. For time-invariant characteristics, we report means for the first time a household is surveyed. For
time-varying characteristics, we report summary statistics across survey rounds. Data on housing materials and
phones are drawn from prior surveys administered to this sample. Summary statistics for the Ghana Statistical
Service's 2017 Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS)a and the 2015 Labor Force Survey (LFS)b and are for urban
households in the Greater Accra Region. Both of these surveys are designed to be representative at the region level
and by urban/rural location. Survey weights are applied to generate representative estimates.  The respondent for
the Ghana sample may be an adult other than the head of household. For the LFS and GLSS, we present data on
the head of household for comparison.

This table presents estimates of Equation 1 for major socioeconomic outcomes. From left to right, the columns
show the number of observations, the control mean, and the treatment effects of T1, T2A , and T2B (all relative to
control). Regressions include baseline controls for sex, education, banking status, and housing quality; all collected
during enrollment in Lee et al. (2020) or Wolfram et al. (2021)), as well as the Covid-19 survey baseline round value
for each outcome. FDR q-values for all coefficients are statistically insignificant at the  = 0.10 level.
