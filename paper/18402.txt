                                              ABSTRACT

A growing body of literature examines the cross price elasticities between different health care services.
For example, increasing the patient out of pocket price for some health care services increases the
utilization of other health care services. Yet, the literature has generally ignored the connection between
cost sharing for health care services and labor market outcomes. This paper examines the direction
and magnitude of the reduced form relationship between patient cost-sharing and work loss following
methods used to study the impact of cost-sharing and medical spending, finding a positive, quantitatively
meaningful association between cost-sharing and hours absent. We find no such association between
cost-sharing and the probability of incurring short-term disability days. This suggests that the cross-market
ramifications of higher patient cost sharing extend beyond other health care services to include broad
labor market outcomes.

Introduction


In 2010, almost 100 million individuals received insurance coverage through employer-

sponsored health plans offered by large and medium sized firms in the United States (Garrett and

Buettgens 2011). Employers therefore exercise considerable control over the features of

insurance plans. For example, there can be significant variation across employers in the structure

and amount of out-of-pocket cost sharing requirements that the employees face when they use

care. For example, because of variation in the number of tiers in a formulary, and placement of

drugs on those tiers, the copayment charged to employees for any given prescription could range

across employers from $0 to over $90 (Kaiser Family Foundation/HRET 2011). Moreover, over

the past several years, employers have been increasing cost sharing requirements including

copayments for medications in an effort to control spending. For covered workers with three or

four-tier prescription drug cost sharing, average copayments for generics rose from $8 in 2007 to

$11 in 2011, and preferred brand name medications rose from $15 to $25 (Kaiser Family

Foundation/HRET 2011).


Extensive literature examines the ramifications of these employer decisions, focusing largely on

the effects of patient cost-sharing (i.e., copayments, coinsurance) for prescription medications on

health care utilization of health care services. The literature is dominated by studies of the direct

effects of variation in cost sharing (e.g., the impact of higher prescription drug copays on use of

prescription drugs) (Goldman, Joyce et al. 2004; Gibson, Ozminkowski and Goetzel 2005).

While the effects vary across medication classes and patient groups, for the most part, higher

levels of prescription drug cost-sharing have been associated with lower levels of medication

utilization and adherence. A growing body of literature examines the cross price elasticities
                                                                                                      3
between cost sharing for some services and the utilization of others (e.g., the impact of cost

sharing for prescription drugs on hospitalizations, complications, emergency department visits,

and medical spending) (Chandra, Gruber and McKnight 2010; Goldman, et al. 2004; Gibson,

Ozminkowski and Goetzel 2005; Afendulis et al., 2011). Generally, the evidence supports the

connections between markets, which is interpreted largely as a health effect: adhering to

medications that treat chronic disease prevents adverse events that lead to use of more expensive

services.


Yet, because health care data is generally segregated from other types of employer data, the

literature has generally ignored the connection between use of health care services and labor

market outcomes. In general, adverse events and poor health status can lead to higher spending

on expensive healthcare services, as well as missed time at work and reduced productivity (Carls

et al. 2012; Loeppke et al. 2011; Gibson, et al. 2010).


Our aim is to examine the direction and magnitude of the reduced form relationship between

cost-sharing and work loss following methods used to study the impact of cost-sharing and

medical spending. To do so, we analyze a unique database containing quarterly employee-level

data reports of lost work time (absence hours and short term disability days) and cost-sharing

amounts. One underlying concern is that, at a point in time, prescription drug benefit generosity

may be positively correlated with generosity of absence and short-term disability benefits.

Employees in plans with lower prescription drug cost-sharing (more generous) may also receive

larger (more generous) allocations of absence and disability benefits, which will create an

omitted variable bias suggesting lower prescription drug cost sharing is related to more absence

and disability days. Because absence and disability benefits are very stable over time we address
                                                                                                   4
this concern by estimating fixed effects models, focusing on the longitudinal relationship

between changes in cost-sharing and lost work time. We estimate these models on two cohorts of

employees undergoing treatment for pain, where changes in cost-sharing, health, and healthcare

utilization are likely to be quickly realized in terms of lost work time.


We report two main findings. First, we find a positive association between cost-sharing and

hours absent, which, though the effect is small in percentage terms, has large fiscal implications.

Second, we find no such association between cost-sharing and the probability of incurring short-

term disability days.


The paper proceeds as follows. We describe our approach and then describe the characteristics

of the medication class and its relationship to work loss. Next, we describe our methods and

provide a detailed overview of our estimation strategy. Following are results, and in the final

section we offer some conclusions.


Framework


Employers offering health benefits to their employees usually proffer a limited number of health

plans to employees residing in a geographic area. Each health plan available to the employees

within an employer (which we refer to as an employer-health plan or plan) provides a set of

covered benefits at a level of cost-sharing to plan enrollees. Our aim is to analyze the

relationship between prescription drug cost-sharing and work loss in the reduced form. We do

not identify a mechanism connecting cost-sharing and work loss, but are estimating the

magnitude and statistical significance of the relationship between plan generosity (an important

benefit management tool for employers) and time lost from work that may stem from differences

                                                                                                   5
in adherence to medication or changes in care-seeking behavior. We focus on the marginal costs

of services to the employee (e.g., copayments or coinsurance) because deductibles for

prescription drugs are somewhat uncommon in general and are quite rare in our data set.


We construct a panel data set with employees as the cross sectional unit and calendar quarters as

the unit of time. In each quarter, an employee is also mapped into an employer-health plan, and

cost-sharing amounts for the employer-health plan are recorded on each observation in the data

set. Employees can change plans over time (though this is rare) so they do not fully nest within

employer-health plans. This creates a three-level, multilevel model (quarter, employee,

employer-health plan) and we address this directly in our estimation approach.


In cross-sections, employers offering more generous medical benefits may also offer more

generous absence or short-term disability benefits (or may differ in other ways), which may

explain why the cross-sectional relationship observed between cost-sharing and time lost from

work is negative (i.e., employees with lower levels of cost-sharing report a greater number of

absences and/or disability days). We focus on the effects of changes in cost-sharing on changes

in absence and disability using a fixed effect model. If the resulting association between an

increase in cost-sharing and work loss is positive, then plans reducing the generosity of

prescription drug benefits experience increases in absence and/or work loss.


Pain Management


Pain medications (analgesics) are some of the most commonly prescribed medications in the

United States. From 2005-2008 when ranked in terms of the percentage of adults using a

prescription drug in the medication class, pain medications ranked second after antidepressants

                                                                                                   6
for adults 18-44 (5.1% of adults) (National Center for Health Statistics 2011). Similarly, for

adults 45-64 years pain medications ranked third after antihyperlipidemic agents and

antidepressants with 14.0% filling a prescription for a pain medication.


Pain and painful conditions are associated with high rates of absence and work days lost. In a

random sample of 28,902 workers in the United States in 2001-2002, 57.2% reported a common

painful condition in the previous two weeks (e.g., headache, arthritis, back pain, other) and 7.2%

reported two or more hours of time lost from work due to a painful condition (Stewart et al.

2001). Disease exacerbations and pain control are also related to work loss. Almost one fourth

of workers with arthritis currently experiencing a pain exacerbation reported lost productive time

from work, compared to 13.1% with arthritis who were not experiencing a pain exacerbation

(Ricci et al. 2005).


While many pain medications are over the counter or available in generic form, many others are

brand name and are often indicated when pain management and control is an issue. We focus on

two cohorts of patients prescribed brand name non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID)

and opiod pain medications. The first is employees with a diagnosis of a chronic medical

condition that is marked by significant pain (the chronic pain cohort). Chronic pain diagnoses

include osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis and neuropathic pain. Second, as a

sensitivity analysis we include all employees meeting the selection criteria, regardless of

diagnosis (All diagnosis cohort).


We selected pain management as our condition of interest as it is an immediate phenomenon –

these medications work in hours or days and have a short half-life. Also, pain and work

                                                                                                 7
productivity have strong ties; therefore, within the two cohorts changes in medication utilization

or care-seeking would be likely to manifest in the short-term in changes in hours lost from work.


Methods


Data Source


Information from the Truven Health MarketScan Health and Productivity Management Database

was used for this study. The database contains health insurance claims for inpatient, outpatient,

and pharmaceutical services for enrollees from employer-sponsored health plans offered by

approximately 150 medium and large-sized firms in the United States. For a subset of these

firms, medical claims data are supplemented with productivity management information for two

types of lost work time: absence hours and short term disability days. The absence and short

term disability data sets are, for the most part, mutually exclusive.


Study Population


Employees were eligible for inclusion in the study if they were between the ages of 18 and 64,

were continuously enrolled for at least 7 quarters between January 1, 2006 and December 31,

2008, filled a prescription for pain medication, and had no indication of pregnancy throughout

the study time frame. Employees enrolled in high-deductible plans, or comprehensive pain

management programs were excluded because of broader effects of those programs that could

not be measured.


Within the study time frame, the date of first fill in the medication class was assigned as the

index date for each employee. Employees were followed until December 31, 2008 or through

                                                                                                     8
the last complete calendar quarter prior to disenrollment, must have been active employees on

the index date, and must have been continuously enrolled for at least 1 year prior to the index

date to measure preindex health status and at least 3 calendar quarters after. To exclude patients

with a single episode of pain, employees also had to have a second pharmacy claim in the

medication class during the 2 months following the index fill date. We excluded the first (index)

quarter observed for each employee, as the first quarter is most likely to be endogenous with

worker absence or disability.


Measures of Lost Work Time


Two types of lost work time were calculated per quarter throughout the study time frame, hours

absent and days of short term disability for each employee. The information is recorded in the

personnel time management systems of the employers. Hours of absence represented the sum of

hours recorded for all short-term absence types (e.g., vacation, personal and sick time) since

employees may trade off hours recorded for each type of absence (e.g., using vacation time for

sick leave). In addition, some of the employers grant employees a bank of hours of leave from

work that does not distinguish between types of absence. Our approach allows pooling of

absence information across employers.


Short-term disability days represent the number of days in each calendar quarter that the

employee received short-term disability benefits while they were unable to work. Very few

employees utilize this benefit (5-10% of the employees in our sample in a quarter), therefore, we

estimated receipt of short term disability benefits as a dichotomous outcome.


Estimation

                                                                                                     9
Our data set contains three dimensions of variation: time (calendar quarters), employees, and

employer-health plans. Because the error components may be correlated with the observed

explanatory variables, we estimate the parameters using a fixed effects three-way error

components model (Abowd, Kramarz and Margolis, 1999; Andrews, Schank and Upward, 2006).


In the linear form we consider the following model:


Yit = xit + wP(i,t)t + uiη + qP(i,t)ρ + i + p + t + it                                      (1)


Where i indexes employees, t indexes time in calendar quarters, and p indexes employer-health

plans. Yit is the dependent variable. Both employees and plans are assumed to enter and exit the

panel resulting in an unbalanced panel with Ti observations per employee and N* = Ti

employee-quarters in total. The fixed effects are i for the employee, p for the plan and t for

time. We assume it is strictly exogenous. Terms xit and ui are vectors of observable employee

covariates. wP(i,t)t and qP(i,t) are vectors of observable plan covariates and are indexed with P(i,t)

as employees can change plans over time (employees do not fully nest within plans). P(i,t) maps

employee i to plan P at time t. Each unique employee*employer-health plan combination in the

data set denotes a ‘spell’ of plan enrollment, which is indexed with s.


Both i and ui are time invariant for employees and p and qP(i,t) are fixed over time for plans. xit

varies over i and t and wP(i,t)t varies across p and t, although the data are collected at the i,t level,

therefore plan covariates also vary at the i,t level.




                                                                                                         10
The explanatory variable of interest, the prescription drug cost sharing amount, is in . We can

obtain consistent estimates of  and  by time demeaning within each employee-plan spell. We

define the spell-level heterogeneity as:


s  i + uiη + p + qP(i,t)ρ                                                                 (2)


Substituting (2) into (1)


Yit = xit + wP(i,t)t + qP(i,t)ρ + s + t + it                                             (3)


Within each employee-plan spell, the spell level heterogeneity, s, does not vary and can be

removed by subtracting averages at the spell level. We assume that ut are fixed and are

estimated directly using time dummies (hence, not reflected in the next equation).


(Yit – Ybars) = (xit - xbars) + (wP(i,t)t - wbars) + (it - bars)                          (4)


To examine the relationship between cost-sharing and absence hours we first estimate an OLS

model with time fixed effects and standard errors corrected for possible correlation within

employee over time (Model I-OLS). Because we do not include spell fixed effects, this model is

identified, in part, by differences across employers and will suffer from bias associated with

unobserved generosity of absence and disability benefits, but it serves as a useful benchmark.


We then estimate Equation (4) fitting a three-way fixed effect model with spell-level fixed

effects, time fixed effects, and standard errors corrected for possible correlation within employee

over time (Model II-OLS Spell Fixed Effects).




                                                                                                    11
Since absence hours are recorded as counts, as a comparison we also estimate the three-way

fixed effects model in Equation (4) with a conditional ML Poisson regression (with a log link

and robust standard errors) using the same covariates (Model III – Poisson Spell Fixed Effects).


We estimate two linear probability models for use of short term disability: OLS (analogous to

Model I) and OLS Spell Effects (analogous to Model II).


We estimate each of these models for two cohorts of employees: those with chronic pain

diagnoses and the larger cohort of employees including all patients treated for pain, regardless of

diagnosis of chronic pain.


Explanatory Variables


The key explanatory variable is the patient cost-sharing amount imposed by the employer-plan

for the medication class of interest. This is based on the average cost-sharing amount in dollars

(i.e., copayment, coinsurance) per prescription (standardized to a 30-day supply) for medications

in the medication classes (ie, brand name NSAIDs and opiods). Employer-plan cost-sharing is

represented in each calendar quarter as patients are likely to respond to the prices they face, even

if they do not fill a prescription within that class.


Sociodemographic variables included age in years, gender, urban (versus rural) area of residence,

median household income (from the Census Bureau based on ZIP code of residence), percent

college graduates (based on ZIP codes), US census region (Northeast, North Central, West, and

South), and the hourly/salaried status of the employee.




                                                                                                  12
Two health-status measures were also included and were calculated in the 12 months of

continuous enrollment prior to the index date. The Deyo Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)

accounts for the effects of comorbid conditions based on the presence of ICD-9-CM codes in the

health care claims (D’Hoore et al. 1996). Psychiatric Diagnostic Groupings (PDG) were also

accounted for in this study during the pre-index period. The PDGs measure the presence of

psychiatric or substance dependent conditions. There are 12 possible PDGs, which are

aggregated from ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes (Ashcraft et al. 1989). Examples include alcohol

use disorders and other substance use disorders, depression, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic

stress disorders, and schizophrenia.


All models include an array of time fixed effects representing each calendar quarter (with

2Q2006 as the reference quarter).


Results

We found 4,763 employees filling prescriptions for pain medication meeting the selection

criteria who also had absence information and 20,273 employees meeting the selection criteria

who had short-term disability data (Table 1). About one quarter of these employees (1,495 with

absence information and 6,144 with short term disability information) had a diagnosis of chronic

pain (osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis or neuropathic pain). Within these four

groups, patients had relatively similar characteristics. Approximately two thirds were age 45 and

older and about 60% were male. Reflecting the composition of the data contributors, the South

region was most prevalent, representing 40-46% of the employees, and the vast majority lived in

an urban residence (over 88%). The mean CCI score was less than 0.5, indicating that the

average comorbidity burden was less than 1 condition per employee. The average PDG score
                                                                                                   13
was below 0.25, indicating that the number of psychiatric comorbidities was less than 1 per

employee.


Table 2 contains additional descriptive statistics about the employee cohorts, including the two

main measures of interest: absence hours and the percent of employees using short-term

disability benefits in a quarter. On average, employees with chronic pain recorded 76.7 hours of

absence, and employees with all diagnoses had five fewer hours of absence on average. Short-

term disability use rates were 10.25% for employees with chronic pain and were 4 percentage

points lower for employees with all diagnoses.


Results from the absence hours models for the chronic pain cohort (those with a diagnosis of a

condition associated with chronic pain) with largely cross-sectional identification (OLS estimates

I) revealed that the coefficient of cost-sharing is negative (p<0.01) (Table 3a), reinforcing our

concern that employers with less generous cost-sharing policies (higher cost sharing) may also

have less generous absence benefits (and thus fewer absences).


However, when focusing on the longitudinal variation in prescription drug generosity, we find a

positive association: rising cost-sharing amounts were associated with increases in absence

hours. In the linear, three-way, spell-level fixed effect model (II) a $1 increase in copayments

was associated with 0.470 (p=0.004) additional hours of absence, and the magnitude of the effect

was similar in the Poisson model (III). This suggests a price elasticity of absence of about 0.16.


Results from the absence hours models for the all diagnosis cohort (those treated for pain,

regardless of diagnosis) were similar to those of the chronic pain cohort. The cross-sectional

model revealed an inverse relationship between cost sharing and absence (p<0.05). In the linear

                                                                                                    14
spell-level fixed effects model the estimated effect size was smaller than the estimates in the

narrower chronic pain cohort, but retained statistical significance (0.342 additional hours of

absence, p<0.01). Finally, the Poisson spell-level fixed effects model yielded a positive,

statistically significant coefficient (p<0.01) with a similar effect size in this cohort. This

suggests a price elasticity of absence of about 0.12.


Unlike the absence hour models, in the cross-sectional short term disability models the

coefficient on cost-sharing was positive and not statistically significant (Table 4). When adding

spell-level fixed effects to the model, the results were less pronounced than the absence models

and none reached statistical significance.


Effect Size


While we do not attempt to estimate the structural relationships, we are able to estimate the

financial impact of foregone medication use on productivity based on estimates of adherence and

days supply per prescription. In Table 5 we display predicted values associated with a $5

increase in cost sharing per prescription (about 20%). In our fixed effects models, the number of

absence hours per calendar quarter also rises by approximately 1 hour (in the OLS model,

chronic pain cohort) to 2.4 hours (Poisson model, chronic pain cohort). This corresponds to

approximately 1.3% - 3.1% change in absence hours.         Using methods analogous to our analysis

of absences, we estimate a demand elasticity for utilization of pain medications within each

cohort (not shown) of about -0.35 (within the range reported in the literature) (Goldman et al.

2004; Gibson et al. 2005). Accordingly, with a 20% increase in copayment of $5, we expect a

7% drop in prescriptions. Therefore, because the average number of brand name pain

prescriptions per person per quarter was 0.5, we estimate about 0.035 foregone prescriptions/

person/ quarter (0.5 prescriptions * -7%). Combining our estimates of foregone prescriptions

(converted to days supply lost based on a 30 day prescription) and our estimates of increased

absences, we estimate that 1 hour lost of absence (1/8 of a day, or 12%) is associated with 1.05

days supply lost (0.035 foregone prescriptions * 30 days supplied per prescription). Thus, our

estimates imply that if an employee in chronic pain does not take these medications for one day,

the employee has a 1/8 chance (12% chance) of missing a day’s work (8 hrs).


Though the effect size in hours is modest, the fiscal consequences may be large. If we assume

that a $5 increase in cost-sharing (20%) is associated with a 1 hour increase in absence (~1.3%)

this would be valued at $42/hour fully loaded with fringe benefits (workers in private industry,

large establishments) (BLS 2012). Alternatively, the average hourly earnings for Americans

overall is about $31 loaded. The $31-$42/hr in absence-related costs would offset any employer

savings associated with raising copayments.


Those savings, from the perspective of the employer and assuming no wage offset, would consist

of $5 per prescription filled (now paid by the worker not the firm) and the employer costs

associated with foregone prescriptions. In our sample, employees average about 0.5 brand name

pain medication prescriptions/ person/ quarter (so the employer saves $2.50).


Given our estimate of .035 foregone prescriptions/ person if we estimate the employer cost of

prescriptions at $100 per prescription (the high end of the range in our data, we estimate a

savings of $3.50). Combining this with $2.50 associated with the cost shift on inframarginal

prescriptions, yields a savings of $6.00/ person per quarter, which is small relative to the

                                                                                                   16
productivity costs. If we assume full wage offset, the societal cost would be only the cost of the

foregone prescription (employer and employee share) which would be even smaller than $6.00.


However, the calculation of savings is imprecise for several reasons. It likely overstates the

effects as productivity losses are unlikely to amount to 1-2 full hours as an employee may work

from home when sick, or other employees may perform additional work duties for the absent

employee. Yet even if the effective hours of work lost is only 20 minutes (a third of an hour),

the productivity loss is still large relative to the savings.


More importantly, this calculation focuses on a single medication class, and the patient is

typically on multiple classes of medication. On average these patients fill a total of 5.6

prescriptions per quarter in addition to brand name pain medications. This would increase the

savings from $6 to $60 (if overall elasticity is -.35). This exceeds the productivity costs, but the

productivity costs still offset about half of these savings. Moreover, the total savings associated

with higher copayments are lower than estimated above because we omit any increased medical

spending due to less use of medications, which in other cases have been estimated to be non-

trivial (Roebuck et al. 2011; Sokol 2005, Chandra, Gruber, McKnight 2010). Thus while there

is a lot of uncertainty associated with the full financial effects of copayment increases, which is

not our focus, the magnitude of the productivity costs seems meaningful in comparison to the

medical costs.




Diagnostic checks



                                                                                                   17
Fixed effect models remove the cross-sectional variation and the effects of time invariant

observables, identifying effects based on variation in cost-sharing changes over time. The strong

assumption inherent in our identification strategy is that trends in outcomes are similar in plans

that changed cost-sharing (prior to the cost sharing change) and plans that did not change cost-

sharing. We compared trends in outcomes (absence and short term disability) in the quarters

prior to the cost-sharing change for the two thirds of plans that eventually changed their cost-

sharing to trends in outcomes for plans that did not change cost-sharing. This comparison was

made by regressing outcomes on an indicator for plans that changed their cost-sharing, a time

trend and the interaction of the two, controlling for clustering over time by plan. We found that

there were no significant differences in the absence or disability time trends for plans that

eventually increased copayments (prior to the copayment change) and those that did not (for

absence hours, coefficient= -0.85 p = 0.561 and for any short-term disability days, coefficient =

-0.002 p = 0.194.


To address concerns of omitted time varying variables--where cost sharing may be changing at

the same time as other aspects of compensation or sick days, or where cost sharing may be

changing at the same time as other employee characteristics are changing--we first correlated

changes in prescription drug copayments and changes in medical office visit copayments to

determine if prescription drug and medical benefits moved in concert. The correlation between

changes in medical copayments and prescription drug copayments was near zero (-0.02 for

employees with absence data and 0.03 for employees with short term disability data), reflecting

that the structure of prescription drug benefits was often carved out from other health benefits.

We also analyzed two measures of health status, the Charlson Comorbidity Index and Psychiatric

                                                                                                     18
Diagnostic Groupings, each measured in each quarter of the data. We then regressed changes in

copay on changes in each of these health status measures in separate regressions and found no

significant relationship between changes in health status and changes in cost-sharing.


In addition, if employees with lower health status that have a choice choose lower copayments,

these employees may also be more likely to be absent. However, there was little choice of

prescription drug plan benefits in these firms, most prescription drug benefits were similar across

medical plans for a given employee, and our results sign in the opposite direction. If selection on

health status is occurring our results are most likely biased downward.


We performed two additional sets of sensitivity analysis. First, we included a measure of benefit

generosity in the non-drug medical benefit (the plan-level percentage of total payments borne by

employees) and the results were similar. Second, we removed the two health status measures

(CCI and PDG) from the covariates and the coefficients of the models were almost identical to

those presented here.


Discussion

Previous research on the effects of prescription drug copayments has focused on the impact of

higher copayments on the utilization of prescription drugs and other medical services. Yet,

because prescription drugs are an important part of chronic disease management, their effects

may impact broader aspects of patients’ lives. One area of particular importance is worker

productivity. Our analysis, focused on workers with chronic pain, confirms that higher

copayments are associated with more absences from work, but effects on short-term disability

are not statistically significant. Often lost in the discussion about medical pain management is
                                                                                                   19
attainment of appropriate levels of use of pain medications through sufficient limits and supports

to maintain productivity (US FDA 2012). Medications should be taken according to the

physician’s instructions, and not exceeding the prescribed dosage or frequency.


The intent of our study was not to conduct a full cost accounting associated with raising

copayments or to make policy recommendations. Instead we addressed the more focused

question about whether changes in medication use might affect productivity, focusing on a

patient group where effects are likely to be manifest quickly. The effects and effect sizes may not

be similar to other condition cohorts. We focused on active workers with chronic pain, who may

differ substantially from other patients with chronic pain as they continued to participate in the

workforce. Now that we have found a modest, though fiscally meaningful, effect within this

patient cohort, future research focusing on other conditions and exploring structural relationships

should be considered and evaluations of health policy changes should strive to integrate

productivity effects when possible.
