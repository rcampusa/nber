                                         ABSTRACT

The `China shock' operated in part through the housing market, and that is an important reason
why the China shock was as big as it was. If housing prices had not responded at all to the China
shock, then the total employment effect of the China shock would have been reduced by more
than one-half. Housing prices in the United States did respond to the China shock, however, so
the independent employment effect of the China shock is reduced by about 20­30%, with that
remainder reflecting exogenous changes in housing prices.

1        Introduction

In an influential study, Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2013, hereafter ADH) show that rising import

competition from China has been an important contributor to the recent decline in the employment

rate of working age population in the United States. Exploiting variation in exposure to Chinese

import across local labor markets (commuting zones) over 1990-2007, they find that Chinese im-

port exposure caused a large reduction in manufacturing employment: a $1,000 per worker increase

in import exposure over a decade reduces manufacturing employment per working-age population

by 0.596 percentage points (their Table 3, column 6), explaining about 44 percent of the actual

decline in manufacturing employment from 1990 through 2007. Furthermore, the negative em-

ployment shock by Chinese imports goes beyond manufacturing and exists for nonmanufacturing

workers. To be more specific, import exposure to Chinese imports caused a substantial employ-

ment decline in both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing sectors for workers without college

education; while for workers with college education, import exposure caused substantial job loss

in manufacturing sectors but a statistically insignificant increase in employment in nonmanufac-

turing sectors (their Table 5, Panel B).

        Such results, accompanied with findings in other studies such as Pierce and Schott (2015)

and Acemoglu et al. (2016), have important policy implications and challenge the benign view

towards globalization. Meanwhile, studies on Europe, mainly Germany, show that the estimates

of the effect of `China shock' have been moderate. Dauth et al. (2014) analyze the effect of

the rise of `the East' (China and Eastern Europe) in the period 1988-2008 on German local labor

markets. Using an empirical approach similar to ADH, they find that a ten-year increase of C1,000

per worker in import exposure reduces manufacturing employment per working-age population

by 0.19 percentage points (their Table 1, column 5). Taking into account that their analysis is

conducted in 2005 euro instead of the 2007 dollar in ADH, this coefficient can be converted to

around -0.14 and compared to -0.60 in ADH. Furthermore, they find that the negative impact

of import competition is more than offset by a positive effect of export expansion.1 Badinger

     In the aggregate, they estimate 0.44 million job gains in Germany over the period 1988-2008 that would not exist
without the trade integration with China and the Eastern Europe. Feenstra, Ma and Xu (2019) examine the job creating
effect of export expansion for the United States.

and Reuter (2017), who analyze the employment effect of trade for 1146 regions in 17 Western

European countries over 1991-2011, also report a small average coefficient of -0.14 for import

exposure.2

       In this paper, we investigate one reason for the strong impact of the `China shock' on US labor

market, as compared to Germany and other countries of Western Europe, that is the housing market

in the United States. We find that the employment effect of the China shock was magnified through

the housing market. If housing prices had not responded to the China shock at all, then the total

employment effect of import exposure from China would have been reduced by more than half.

Controlling the possible endogenous response of housing prices, the impact of China shock on

total employment is still reduced by 20­30%.

       These results are obtained because during the same period when the United States faces in-

creasing import competition from China, its domestic economy also experiences a national hous-

ing boom that starts from the late 1990s and varies across regions. While manufacturing workers

faced import competition, nonmanufacturing sectors ­ in particular the construction sector and the

financial services sector experienced a demand boom.3 If the China shock influenced the housing

market, then omitting any variables for housing demand would mean that the estimated effect of

import exposure should be interpreted as a reduced form rather than a structural coefficient. This

reduced form coefficient would be overstated, however, if commuting zones that experienced larg-

er increases in import exposure also had smaller increases in housing prices, in part for exogenous

reasons and without those variables included. Thus, to the extent that the housing boom and busts

are endogenous to the China shock, then we are adding a structural interpretation for the magnitude

of the shock.4 But to the extent that some component of the housing boom and bust is correlated

but not causal, then leaving it out will overstate the true magnitude of the shock.

       Our empirical approach builds on that in ADH but augments it with a housing variable. To take

into account the endogenous part of the housing, we employ two instrumental variables. We first

Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom.
   3
     Similar idea has been elaborated in Charles et al.(2016a, 2016b), who argue that during 2000-2007 unemployment
was `masked' by the strong housing boom which promoted employment in the construction sector.
   4
     Feler and Senses (2016) propose that housing prices respond endogenously to import exposure. They show that
commuting zones more exposed to the China shock experienced larger reductions in housing values, business activity,
and the provision of local public goods.

use the estimated structural break from high-frequency housing price changes as our instrument

(Ferreira and Gyourko, 2011; Charles et al. 2016). This instrument relies on the emerging con-

sensus that much of the variation in housing prices during the housing boom in the U.S. was from

speculative activities and not from changes in fundamentals like income, productivity, or popula-

tion. We therefore estimate for each local area a structural break in the evolution of housing prices

and treat these `sharp' breaks exogenous to fundamental shocks. We also use the land topology-

based measure of housing supply elasticity introduced by Saiz (2010) as an alternative instrument.

Saiz (2010) proposes that housing development is effectively constrained by geographic situation,

such as the presence of steep slopes, wet lands, lakes and so on. Saiz constructs an exact measure

of land availability and uses this measure to estimate the housing supply elasticity for local areas.

The estimated supply elasticity is exogenous to housing demand shocks and used commonly in the

literature as instrument for housing price changes, see for example, Mian and Sufi (2011, 2014).

       With the housing instruments, we perform both standard two stage least square (TSLS) esti-

mation and reduced form estimations. In the TSLS estimation, we find that the China shock does

operate partly through the housing market. This can be seen from the first stage regression of hous-

ing price changes on either of the housing instruments ­ structural break or supply elasticity, and
                                         5
the ADH China shock instrument.              Both coefficients are significant. Therefore, the China shock

affects U.S. employment through at least two channels: one is the direct effect on employment

through import competition, the other is the indirect effect through the magnification of housing

market. Controlling housing prices, the direct effect of import exposure on U.S. total employment

would reduce by more than half. To isolate the endogenous response of housing market, we also

construct a predicted housing price change calculated using only the housing instrument term from

the first stage regression, and use it as a control variable in the second stage regression. We also

perform a pure reduced form regression ­ replacing the endogenous variables with instruments

directly in the main regression. Either way shows that, after controlling the endogenous response

of housing price to import exposure, the exogenous variation in housing price changes can still

reduce the impact of the China shock on total employment by about 20­30%.
   5
     ADH instruments the U.S. import exposure with the import exposure of other eight developed countries to isolate
the supply-driven component of imports. We follow this in our estimation.



                                                         4
    Given the fact that imports from China started to accelerate after 2001 when China gained ac-

cession into the WTO, and at the same time U.S. national housing market experienced a boom and

busts cycle mainly in the 2000s, we also explore looking at an alternative sample over both the

housing boom and busts periods: 2000-2007 and 2007-2011. We find that the magnification effect

of housing market is confirmed during these two periods. During 2000-2011, the China shock still

has a negative effect on U.S. manufacturing employment. However, it also has a significantly pos-

itive effect on non-manufacturing employment, even without controlling housing. This offsets the

negative effect on manufacturing employment and makes the effect on total employment positive.

Controlling housing reduces both the negative and positive effects (in absolute value) of the China

shock. Therefore, the fact that domestic housing market creating jobs during boom and destructing

jobs during busts cannot be neglected when estimating the effect of an outside shock, such as the

China shock. Otherwise, the effect of the China shock would be overstated.

    The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the empirical strategy and

describes our instruments for housing. Section 3 shows the estimated role of housing in examining

the employment effect of the China shock. Section 4 performs robustness checks, and section 5

concludes.


2     Empirical Strategy
2.1    Import Exposure and Housing

ADH (2013) point out that US regions (commuting zones) have different exposures to import

competition from China due to their industry structure. Those regions that have larger shares of

employment in industries that experienced larger growth of Chinese imports (at the national level)

will suffer more from import competition from China. Their specification is:

                          Lit = t + 1 IP Wit + Xit 2 + r + eit ,                                (1)

where Lit is the decadal change in the employment share of the working-age population in com-

muting zone i. In different specifications, we can distinguish Lit by sectors (manufacturing vs.

nonmanufacturing), or replace it with unemployment rate or the fraction of the population not in

the labor force (NILF). IP Wit is the change in import exposure, which is instrumented by Chi-

                                                5
na's exports to other high-income countries.6 t is a time dummy for each decadal period. The

vector Xit contains a set of economic and demographic controls at the start of each decade.7 In

addition, r augments the model with geographic dummies for the nine Census divisions to absorb

region-specific trends.

       During the same period when imports from China grew quickly, the US also experienced large

changes in housing price. Importantly, such changes in housing price also vary across regions.

For example, Charles, Hurst, and Notowidigdo (2016b) argue that during 2000-2006 when there

was large and persistent decline in manufacturing employment, the housing boom simultaneously

increased employment in construction. Thus, the housing boom `masks' the adverse labor market

effects of the manufacturing decline. In addition, the housing boom may also affect employment

through the collateral channel, whereby firms that own real estate increase their investment in

response to rising real estate prices (Chaney, Sraer, and Thesmar, 2012). So, if commuting zones

that experienced larger changes in import exposure also had smaller increases in housing prices,

then omitting any variable for housing demand means that the estimated effect of import exposure

should be interpreted as a reduced form rather than a structural coefficient. This reduced form

coefficient would be overstated, however, if the change in housing prices are in part exogenous and

suitable instrumental variables are not used. To explore whether this occurs, we augment ADH's

original specification in equation (1) by including housing price change as an additional variable:


                       Lit = t + 1 IP Wit + 2 HP Iit + Xit 3 + r + eit ,                                           (2)


where HP Iit is the change in housing price at the commuting zone level.

       Figure 1 plots the correlation between changes in local import exposure from China and changes

in the local housing price index, for the pooled period 1990-2007, and for 1990-2000 and 2000-
   6
      The measurement of IP Wit by ADH (2013, p. 2128) uses the change in US imports from China in each indus-
try, weighted by initial commuting zone employment relative to total US employment in each industry, and summed
over industries. The idea for the instrument is that China's exports to other high-income countries are correlated with
the US imports from China due to productivity improvements in China or falling trade costs within the same sec-
tor. ADH (2013) uses the China's total exports to eight countries: Australia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Japan, New
Zealand, Spain, and Switzerland. The change in these exports by industry are weighted by decade-old commuting zone
employment relative to total US employment in each industry, and summed over industries, to obtain the instrument.
    7
      These control variables include: the percentage of employment in manufacturing, percentage of college-educated
population, percentage of foreign-born population, percentage of employment among women, percentage of employ-
ment in routine occupations, and the average offshorability index of occupations.

2007 separately.8 There is an obvious negative correlation between the two variables of interest,

which appears to be much stronger in the 2000-2007 period: regions that experienced larger import

shocks also experienced smaller increases in housing prices.

                                              [Figure 1 here]

       One concern about controlling the effect of housing market is that the change in local housing

price may be partly the result of import exposure. Feler and Senses (2016), for example, argue

that commuting zones more exposed to the ADH China shock experienced larger reductiond in

housing values, business activity, and the provision of local public goods. In this case, estimating

equation (2) without controlling for endogeneity would lead to biased estimate of import exposure

as well. Other factors can lead to endogeneity too, for example: unobserved local conditions may

affect employment and housing price simultaneously; and local job opportunities can also reversely

affect housing prices. To deal with these endogeneity issues, we employ instrumental variables for

housing prices. The aim is to isolate exogenous variations in housing prices that are not related to

import competition as well as other demand or supply shocks.

2.2       Housing Instruments

We first instrument housing price changes using the estimated structural break from rapid changes

in housing prices that occurred in the local area (Ferreira and Gyourko, 2011; Charles et al. 2016b).

The idea is that underlying fundamentals for housing demand (such as productivity, income, or

population) do not change abruptly and are smoothly incorporated into prices when they do change.

So the sharp breaks from the trend would reflect variations due to exogenous speculative activities

or other housing-specific forces, for example, the irrational exuberance documented in Shiller

(2009), Mayer (2011), Chinco and Mayer (2014), the introduction of market products like interest-

only mortgages in Barlevy and Fisher (2010) and so on.

       More specifically, following Charles et al. (2016b), we estimate for each local area an OLS

regression with a structural break, and search for the break date that maximizes the R2 of the
   8
    The annual housing data at US county level can be downloaded from the Federal Housing Finance Agency
website: https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads/pages/house-price-index.aspx. After aggregating and matching
counties to commuting zones, we have housing price information for 522 commuting zones in 1990-2007, as com-
pared to the 722 commuting zones in ADH (2013). The excluded commuting zones are mainly rural regions without
housing price information.


                                                      7
regression:

                                       lnPit = i + i t + i (t - ti )Dit +          it ,                                 (3)

where lnPit is the log value of quarterly housing price index for each area i in year-quarter t, and

i is a constant. Dit is a dummy variable which equals 1 for periods after the date of structural

break ti , and 0 otherwise. Thus i is the linear time trend before the structural break, while i

                                                   9
captures the size of the structural break.

       Our estimation is run for each metropolitan statistical area (MSA) for which the quarterly

housing price series is available. We estimate separately over the periods 1990-2000 and 2000-

2007, and use the annualized size of the structural break i as the instrument for the decadal
                                  10
changes in housing prices.             Figure 2 illustrates how structural breaks are found and estimated for

some MSAs as an example. The left panel shows the example over the first period and the right

panel shows the result over the second period. The first row shows areas that experienced smooth

evolution of prices, suggesting close to zero structural break. The second row shows areas that

experienced `sharp' price increase at some point, suggesting a positive structural break. Similarly,

the last shows a negative structural break found over the sample period. On average, most areas

experienced housing booms after 2000 and they had a relatively slowdown before that, so the

correlation between the estimated structural break i and housing price growth is negative for the

first period and positive for the second period. Figure 3 first row plots the correlation. In our

regression analysis later, we therefore construct our structural break instrument by taking the value

of -i over 1990-2000 and the value of i over 2000-2007 to avoid cancellation of the correlations

due to opposite signs.11

                                                       [Figure 2 here]

       An alternative instrument we use is the land topology-based measure of housing supply elas-

ticity introduced by Saiz (2010). Saiz (2010) proposes that housing development is effectively
   9
      To estimate structural break, we use the high-frequency quarterly housing data, which is available at the metropoli-
tan statistical area (MSA) level. We have 350 MSAs that have the quarterly price information on both periods.
   10
      We use the quarterly price series to do the estimation. For the first period, we restrict the break date to be between
1991Q1 to 2000Q4. For the second period instrument, we restrict the break date to be between 2001Q1 and 2005Q4.
We restrict the break to be before 2006 since housing booms had already started to burst in 2006 for some MSAs.
Extending the search of the break date to 2006Q4, however, leads to qualitatively similar results.
   11
      We also try interact i with the period dummies to instrument separately for the housing price changes over the
two periods. The results are qualitatively similar.


                                                             8
constrained by its geographic situation, such as the presence of steep slopes, wet lands, lakes and

so on. Use satellite-based geographic data on land use and slope maps, Saiz constructs a precise

measure of exogenous land availability and uses this measure to estimate the housing supply elas-

ticity for local areas. The estimated supply elasticity is exogenous to housing demand shocks and

closely related to housing price changes. The more elastic housing supply areas are expected to

experience less housing price changes with respect to demand shocks. We confirm this relationship

in our data. Saiz's supply elasticity ranges from 0 to 12 and is increasing in elasticity. Figure 3

second row plots housing price growth over the two periods against the inverse of Saiz elasticity
                                    12
measure at the MSA level.                There is a clear correlation between the two variables, and it is even

significant in the second period, when most areas experienced housing booms. In the first period,

when most areas experienced a slow down, the relationship is negative and less obvious. Similarly,

in our regression analysis, we construct our supply elasticity instrument by taking the value of

negative elasticity over 1990-2000 and the value of elasticity itself over 2000-2007.

                                                    [Figure 3 here]


3         The Role of Housing
3.1         The Sample

In this section, we examine the effect of housing in the employment effect of import exposure. We

estimate equation (2) using the housing instrument discussed in the previous section. Following

ADH, we run the estimation over periods 1990-2000 and 2000-2007. Table 1 provides summary

statistics of key variables of interest in the ADH sample and our sample. ADH covers 722 com-

muting zones over two periods. We need quarterly housing price data to construct the structural

break instrument. We first estimate the structural breaks at MSA level and then match the 350

MSAs with commuting zones. This reduces the sample to 291 commuting zones. To use the Saiz's

supply elasticity as the instrument for housing, we match the 262 elasticity at MSA/NECMA level

provided by Saiz (2010) with commuting zones, which leads to a sample of 250 commuting zones.

The sample with the structural break housing instrument accounts for 90 percent of the U.S. pop-
    12
         We have 262 MSAs that have elasticity information on both periods.

ulation. The sample with the supply elasticity housing instrument accounts for 85 percent of the

U.S. population. Table 1 shows that they both closely resemble the original, complete sample in

the statistics of key variables.

                                          [Table 1 here]

3.2    Two Stage Least Square Estimation

We estimate equation (2) using two stage least square estimation (TSLS) with housing instrument-

ed by the estimated structural break and supply elasticity respectively. Table 2 reports the results

with the structural break instrument. For ease of comparison, Panel I reproduces ADH's results

with 722 commuting zones over two decadal periods. Panel II then uses the matched sample with

structural break housing data. The dependent variables, as indicated in the top of each column, are

the manufacturing employment-to-population rate (column 1), nonmanufacturing employment-to-

population rate (column 2), total employment-to-population rate (column 3), unemployment rate

(column 4), and not-in-the-labor-force rate (NILF, column 5). By the definition of the population

shares and the property of linear regressions, we know that the coefficents for each column satisfy

the relationship col1 + col2 = col3 = -(col4 + col5).

                                          [Table 2 here]

   Panel II confirms the results of ADH: import exposure substantially reduces the manufacturing

employment rate while it has a negative but insignificant effect on the nonmanufacturing employ-

ment rate, resulting in rising unemployment and NILF. In fact, the effect of China import exposure

is even stronger for the reduced sample of commuting zones: a $1,000 per worker increase in a

CZ's import exposure reduces its manufacturing employment to population rate by 0.705 percent-

age points, and its nonmanufacturing employment rate by 0.218 percentage points (though not

significant), resulting in a total drop in the employment rate of 0.923 percentage points. Further

decomposing the effect by workers' education levels confirms what ADH find: a $1,000 import ex-

posure from China reduces the noncollege employment rate by a highly significant 1.31 percentage

points, consisting of 0.686 percentage points drop in manufacturing and 0.624 percentage points

drop in nonmanufacturing sector, respectively. College employment in manufacturing also expe-

                                                10
rienced a significant drop of 0.704 percentage points, while in nonmanufacturing it increases by

0.202 percentage points, with the net negative effect on employment rate at a highly significantly

0.502 percentage points.

   The effect of import exposure, however, is mitigated if we include housing price change, in-

strumented by the estimated structural break. This is shown in panel III. First, the effects on

manufacturing employment rate (column 1), total employment rate (column 3), unemployment

(column 4) and NILF (column 5) are all reduced by different magnitudes. The last three rows

of the table show the percentage reduction in the estimated coefficients. For example, a $1,000

increase in Chinese imports per worker reduces manufacturing employment by 0.705 percentage

points and total employment by 0.923 percentage points in Panel II. But when we include housing

price changes, the effect drops to 0.595 percentage points for manufacturing employment (i.e., a

16% drop) and 0.430 percentage points for total employment (i.e., a 53% drop) in Panel III. The

reduction for NILF is even bigger at a 63% drop and the reduction for unemployment is 32%. The

same is true when we distinguish college and non-college education level. Second, in a number of

cases, the effect of import exposure on total employment and NILF loses statistical significances

in Panel III. Thirdly, in all cases, local housing booms promote employment in both manufactur-

ing and nonmanufacturing strongly and significantly, and reduce unemployment and the share of

NILF.

   The result on nonmanufacturing employment is even striking. Some conclusions by ADH no

longer arise. In particular, ADH find that import exposure reduces the no-college employment

rate, at similar magnitudes in both the manufacturing and nonmanufacturing sectors. Including

the changes in housing demand, however, makes the impact of import exposure on no-college

employment in the nonmanufacturing sector close to zero (87% drop) and becomes insignificant,

indicating the importance of correcting for the `masking' effect of the housing boom. As for col-

lege workers, ADH (2013) find that import exposure reduced their employment rate substantially

in manufacturing, but had only a modest and insignificant effect in the nonmanufacturing sector. In

contrast, we find that the detrimental effect on college workers in manufacturing is still there, but

that the effect on those in nonmanufacturing turns positive and significant after including housing

price changes. The effects on manufacturing and nonmanufacturing offset each other, resulting in

                                                 11
a small and insignificant impact of import exposure on total employment for college workers.

   Tables 3 reports the estimation results with housing instrumented by Saiz's supply elasticity.

The findings in table 2 are confirmed and even strengthened here: including housing reduces the

effect of import exposure on manufacturing employment, total employment, unemployment and

NILF by 23-26%, 65-79%, 20-47% and 76-79%; the negative effect of import exposure on non-

manufacturing employment for both college and no-college workers disappears and it increases

the nonmanufacturing employment for college workers significantly.

                                            [Table 3 here]

   Table 4 goes further to report the estimation results with housing instrumented by both the

structural break and the supply elasticity. The findings are consistent. When we have two instru-

ments for housing and one instrument for import shock, we are over-identified. The table also

reports the p-value of Hansen J statistic. It is large in most of the regressions, implying the validity

of instrument exogeneity.

                                            [Table 4 here]

   Including housing variable reduces the `direct' effect of the China shock. The China shock,

however, may also transmit partly through the housing market. This can be seen from the first stage

results reported in Table 5. The coefficient on the import exposure instrument is also significant for

the housing price regression, which means that the China shock also operates through the housing

market. Therefore, the China shock affects U.S. labor market through at least two channels. One

is the `direct' effect on employment through import competition, the other is the `indirect' effect

through the magnification of the housing market, as we examine next.

                                            [Table 5 here]

3.3    Reduced Form Estimation

The next experiment we do is to shut down the endogenous response of the housing variable to the

China shock. To achieve this, we construct a predicted housing price growth calculated using only

the housing instrument term from the first stage regression in Tables 2, 3 or 4. More specifically,

                                                  12
we run a first stage regression

                         HP Iit = t + 1 IP Wit + 2 IVit + r + eit ,                              (4)

as we did above, but now we use only the fitted value of 2 IVit as the housing variable in the

second stage regression. In this way, the constructed housing price growth is no longer responsive

to import exposure. The results are reported in Tables 6, 7 and 8, with predicted housing calculated

using different instruments.

   Table 6 reports the results when predicted housing is calculated using the structural break

instrument. Comparing with the results in Table 2 Panel II and III, we find that, shutting down the

endogenous responses of housing to the China shock does mitigate the reduction in the effect of

China shock. However, the patterns are still obvious: the effect on total employment of the China

shock is still reduces by 22-30% after controlling the pure exogenous effect of housing; the effect

on nonmanufacturing employment for college workers still turns to be positive and statistically

significant.

                                          [Table 6 here]

   Table 7 and 8 go further to report the results when predicted housing is calculated using the

supply elasticity or both instruments. The results are qualitatively similar, with the effect even

strengthened when both instruments are included.

                                    [Table 7 and Table 8 here]

   We also perform a simple reduced-form regression to control the pure exogenous effect of

housing. Table 9 reports the results. We directly replace the endogenous variables in the main

regression with the corresponding instrumental variables. To have a direct comparison, in Panel

I, we first consider no housing and replace the endogenous US imports from China with its in-

strument, i,e., other eight countries' imports from China, and see what the estimated effect of the

China shock would be. Then in Panel II, we consider housing and replaces it using both struc-

tural break and supply elasticity instruments. We find that controlling housing can still reduce

the employment effects of the China shock. Now the effect on manufacturing employment, total

employment, unemployment, NILF is reduced by 6-11%, 33-38%, 22-31%, and 37-41%. The

                                                13
effect on nonmanufacturing employment for college workers still turns positive and is statistically

significant.

                                            [Table 9 here]

3.4    Quantifying the Results

We can apply the observed import growth from China to quantify the economic magnitude of

import exposure on manufacturing, nonmanufacturing and total employment. According to ADH

(2013), Chinese import exposure rose by $1,140 per worker between 1990 and 2000 and by an

additional $1,839 per worker between 2000 and 2007. Using their estimated coefficients based on

a sample of 722 commuting zones (Table 2, Panel I), they find a net reduction in US manufacturing

employment of 1.53 million workers for the full period 1990-2007. Applying the same calculation

to nonmanufacturing employment implies another 0.46 million job loss, or 1.99 million lost jobs

in total, as can be seen from Panel I in table 10.

   We perform a similar calculation, but using the coefficients that we re-estimated. To have a

direct measure of the effect of housing, we compare the predicted employment changes between

the estimates of controlling and not controlling housing based on the same sample (the matched

sample). Table 10 Panel II is based on the estimated coefficients reported in Table 4 Panel I, which

consists a sample of 249 commuting zones that have information on both housing structural break

and supply elasticity during 1990-2007. The estimates are even stronger than the ADH estimates,

which therefore implies a net reduction of 1.88 million workers in manufacturing, a reduction of

0.478 million workers and 2.36 million workers in total. Controlling for housing price changes,

however, changed the results. Panel III shows that although Chinese import exposure caused a

reduction in manufacturing employment by 1.61 million workers, it also caused an increase in

nonmanufacturing employment by 0.49 millions. Thus the net reduction in total U.S. employment

due to rising Chinese import exposure was about 1.13 million workers, or less than one-half of that

implied by the estimates without controlling housing. This striking contrast comes mainly from

the different response from the nonmanufacturing sector. In particular, rising Chinese import expo-

sure led to a reduction in noncollege nonmanufacturing jobs (0.07 millions), whereas it increased

employment for college nonmanufacturing workers by 0.65 millions.

                                                     14
         Panel IV performs the calculation based on estimates that shut down the endogenous responses

of housing to import shock. Controlling the indirect effects magnified by the housing market, we

still find that Chinese import exposure caused an increase in nonmanufacturing employment by

0.06 millions, and the net reduction in total employment was 1.65 millions, still about 30% less

than that implied by the estimates without controlling housing. Again, this comes mainly from the

increase of employment in nonmanufacturing sectors for college workers.

                                                [Table 10 here]


4         Robustness Check
4.1         Effects on Wages

In Table 11, we consider the impact of import exposure on average weekly wage of U.S. workers.

Similar to the employment regressions, we first replicate the results of ADH (2013, Table 6), while

Panel II uses the matched sample of 249 commuting zones with information on both structural

break and supply elasticity (similar to our Table 4).13 Both panels show a significant negative ef-

fect of import exposure on the average wages of workers within commuting zones . Such negative

effects mainly show up for non-manufacturing workers, while the effect on manufacturing worker-

s' wages is positive but not significant. The same pattern holds when we separately look at college

and noncollege workers. But when we control housing price in panels III and IV, the depressing

effects of import exposure on total wage and non-manufacturing wages are reduced substantially.

Panel III controls housing using the TSLS estimation with structural break and elasticity as the

instruments. In this panel, the estimated effect of import exposure on total wages decreases by

more than half (69%), and become insignificant. The same is true for college workers. For noncol-

lege workers, the effect on wages become even positive, though not significant. Panel IV controls

housing using the reduced-form estimation which shuts down the endogenous response of housing

to instruments. Again, the estimated effect of import exposure on wages is reduced (by 39%).

                                                [Table 11 here]

     We only report the results with two instruments. Results from using each instrument separately are similar and

4.2       Housing Boom and Bust

In the previous section, we follow ADH and stack the differences for the two periods (i.e. 1990-

2000 and 2000-2007). Imports from China started to accelerate after 2001, when China gained

accession into the WTO. Before 2001, the share of US imports from China increased by about

0.5 percentage point annually, while after 2001 that share grew by 1.2 percentage points per year.

Import penetration by China (i.e. imports from China as a share of total US expenditure) increased

by 0.14 percentage points per year before 2001 and then by 0.38 percentage points after 2001. At

the same time, the U.S. national housing boom and busts lasted mainly from the late 1990s to the

late 2000s. Figure 4 shows the U.S. national housing price index from 1990 to 2015. It shows a

housing boom starting from the late 1990s and then bust around 2006 till 2011. Therefore, in this

section, we explore looking at an alternative sample that stacks the housing boom and bust periods:

2000-2007 and 2007-2011.

                                                    [Figure 4 here]

       We follow closely ADH to construct the trade and employment data in 2011 and annualize the

changes over two periods before stacking them. We construct two instruments, i.e., the structural

break and supply elasticity, as in section 2.2. Table 11 reports the estimated results. Panel I

considers the ADH regression without housing. We find that over the alternative period 2000-2011,

some findings of ADH have already changed, even without controlling for housing. Panel I shows

that the China shock still has a negative effect on U.S. manufacturing employment. However, it also

has a significantly positive effect on non-manufacturing employment, which offsets the negative

effect on manufacturing employment and makes the effect on total employment positive.

       The same is true when we distinguish college and non-college education levels. Panels II and

III go further to control for housing in the employment regression. We report the estimation re-

sults using two instruments.14 Panel II performs TSLS estimation and Panel III performs reduced

form estimation. Both show that controlling for housing reduces the estimated effect of the Chi-

na shock on US employment. The reduction in the effect of import exposure is about 12-14%

for manufacturing employment, 20-22% for nonmanufacturing employment, and 31-38% for total
  14
       Results from using each instrument separately are similar and are available upon request.


                                                           16
employment, when performing TSLS estimation directly. When shutting down the endogenous

responses of housing, the reduction in the effect on manufacturing, nonmanufacturing and total

employment is still about 4-7%, 15-22%, and 26-49%. Therefore, the fact that the domestic hous-

ing market is creating jobs during booms and losing jobs during busts cannot be neglected when

estimating the effect of outside China shock. Otherwise, estimates on the China shock would be

overstated.

                                                [Table 12 here]

4.3      Inference Correction to Shift-Share Instrument

One concern raised by the very recent literature is that usual inference to a shift-share (or "Bartik")

instrument may substantially understate the true variability of the estimator. For example, Adao,

Kolesar and Morales (2019, AKM hereafter) conduct a placebo exercise and find that hypothesis

tests based on usual standard errors tend to over-reject the null of no effect, because regression

residuals could be correlated across regions with similar sectoral shares, independently of their

geographic location. They then derive a new inference method to take into account cross-region

correlation and find that it would increase the standard error of the estimated impact of China shock

in the ADH application.15

       In Table 13, we apply the AKM method to our estimation. Since the AKM procedure is only

designed to correct the standard error for the shift-share instrument, (i.e., the China shock instru-

ment), we can only apply it to our case of the reduced form regression with housing as an additional

control. To have a comparison, we start with the ADH regression without housing. Panel I uses

the ADH sample of 722 commuting zones. Clustered SE are the usual standard error that clusters

commuting zones in the same state. Hypothesis tests based on clustered SE are indicated along

with the estimated coefficients. These can also be found in ADH Table 5 Panel B and our Table 2

Panel I. In contrast, the AKM SE are the standard errors calculated by applying AKM method. The

results shows that the AKM standard errors (and therefore the corresponding confidence intervals)

are much wider than the clustered standard errors. Although the significance of the estimated co-
  15
   Similar arguments are discussed in Borusyak, Hull and Jaravel (2018), in which they propose a transformation of
commuting zone regression to weighted sector regression.



                                                       17
efficient remains valid, the uncertainty regarding the magnitude of the estimated impact is greater

than that implied by usual inference procedures.

    Panel II of Table 13 does the same ADH regression, but uses a subsample of 249 commuting

zones that have housing information. The estimation results and the clustered standard errors can

also be found in our Table 4 Panel I. In this case, the AKM standard errors are substantially larger

than the clustered standard errors, and the estimated effects of China shock on U.S. labor market

outcomes are not statistically significant anymore. This might be related to the fact that the this

subsample of 249 commuting zones are mainly metropolitan areas, for which the cross-region

correlations of the regression residuals are much higher than those in the rural areas. Panel III uses

the same sample as in Panel II, but adds the predicted housing variable as an additional control.

Now, on the one hand, housing reduces the magnitude of the estimated impact of the China shock

(see also our Table 8); on the other hand, AKM inference increases the standard errors substantially,

such that all the estimated effects of the China shock are not significant.

                                           [Table 13 here]


5    Conclusion

The rapid growth in imports from China has been found to be responsible for the great US em-

ployment sag by several studies (ADH, 2013, Acemoglu et al, 2016, Pierce and Schott, 2016).

ADH (2013) show in their influential work that rising exposure to imports from China led to a

reduction of about 1.5 million manufacturing jobs, with a further 0.5 million jobs lost outside the

manufacturing sector or roughly 2 million lost jobs in total.

    In this paper, we re-estimate the empirical results and propose one reason for the strong impact

of the `China shock' on U.S. labor market, which is the housing market in the United States. We

find that the employment effect of the China shock operated in part through the housing market. If

housing prices had not responded at all to the China shock, then the total employment effect of the

China shock would have been reduced by more than one-half. Housing prices in the United States

did respond to the China shock, however, so the independent employment effect of the China shock

is reduced by about 30%, with that remainder reflecting exogenous changes in housing prices.


                                                 18
   Differing results are also found across sectors and education levels. Noncollege workers in the

manufacturing sector continue to experience a reduction in employment, but that reduction does

not occur in the nonmanufacturing sector. For college workers, their employment in the nonman-

ufacturing sector even rises significantly with import exposure from China. This is a surprising

finding because we have not calculated the employment gains due to increased US exports to Chi-

na, but rather, we continue to work with the exposure to Chinese imports as proposed by ADH. Of

course, for general equilibrium reasons, resources that are freed up due to import competition can

be expected to be re-employed, with some lag, into export (or domestic) activities (see Feenstra,

Ma and Xu, 2019). The data from ADH also suggest that some employment opportunities in the

nonmanufacturing sector were created by the China shock, and exploring this topic is an important

direction for further research.

 Note: Robust standard errors in parentheses, clustered on state. * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01. We match the 350 MSAs that have
 quarterly housing price information to the commuting zone level and obtain 321 commuting zones during 2000-2007 and 291 commuting
 zones during 1990-2000. We keep the sample balanced at 291 commuting zones over both periods. The housing price variable is instrumented
 by the estimated structural break illustrated in section 2.2. All regressions include the full vector of controls and weight in ADH, that is, a
 dummy for the 2000-2007 period, a set of census division dummies, and the start of period economic and demographic conditions, including
 percentage of employment in manufacturing, percentage of college-educated population, percentage of foreign-born population, percentage
 of employment among women, percentage of employment in routine occupations, and finally average offshorability index of occupations. All
 regressions are weighted by start of period commuting zone's share of national population.

  Note: Robust standard errors in parentheses, clustered on state. * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01. We perform reduced form
  regressions in this table. Panel I considers no housing and replaces the endogenous US imports from China with its instrument, i,e., other
  countries' imports from China. Panel II considers housing and replaces it using its two instruments, i.e., structural break and supply elasticity.
  All other variables included in the regressions are the same as before.

   Note: This table reports the predicted employment changes (millions of workers) based on the corresponding estimates from ADH sample
   (Table 2 panel I), the matched sample with information on both housing structural break and supply elasticity (Table 4 Panel I), the matched
   sample controlling housing using TSLS estimation with both IVs (Table 4 Panel II), and the matched sample controlling housing using reduced
   form estimation with housing predicted by both IVs (Table 8). A negative sign means a decrease of employment whereas a positive sign means
   an increase of employment. The details of calculation are explained in the Appendix.

   Note: Robust standard errors in parentheses, clustered on state. * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01. We perform the same regression as
   in the employment regressions but with the dependent variable being the average weekly wages for U.S. workers. Panel I uses the ADH 722
   commuting zones. Panel II uses the matched sample with information on structural break and supply elasticity, which leads to 249 commuting
   zones. Panel III uses the same sample as in panel II and controls housing using TSLS estimation. Panel IV uses the reduced-form estimation.
   All other variables included in the regressions are the same as before.

   Each period is annualized. Panel I considers no housing. Panel II performs TSLS estimation with structural break and elasticity as instruments.
   Panel III performs reduced-form estimation using structural break and elasticity to construct predicted housing. All other variables included
   in the regressions are the same as before.

   Note: AKM SE is the standard error calculated using the inference method proposed by Adao, Kolesar abd Morales(2019). Cluster SE is the
   standard error that clusters of CZs in the same state. Reported * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01 are based on the cluster SE. Panel I
   uses the ADH sample with 722 CZs without controlling housing (see also Table 2 Panel I). Panel II and III use a matched sample with 249
   CZs that have information on both housing structural break and supply elasticity. Panel II performs the estimation without controlling housing
   (see also Table 4 Panel I). Panel III controls housing by using the predicted housing variable constructed with both structural break and supply
   elasticity (see also Table 8). All regressions include the full vector of controls and weight in ADH. For simplicity, we only report the results
   for all education levels in this table.

Appendix
I. Calculating employment changes due to import exposure
Using the CensusACS data, ADH calculate that the US mainland population was 157.6, 178.7,
and 194.3 million adults ages 16 through 64 in 1990, 2000 and 2007 respectively. Therefore,
they find a supply-shock driven net reduction in US manufacturing employment of approxi-
mately 1.53 million workers:

       · [0.5×(157.6+178.7)×1.14+0.5×(178.7+194.3)×1.84]×(-0.00596×0.48)=-1.53

    Note that 0.00596 is the coefficient from the ADH benchmark regression on manufactur-
ing employment share, while 0.48 is the proportion of the variation in rising Chinese import
exposure that can be attributed to the supply-driven components (see ADH, 2013, p. 2140 for
details). We adopt this 0.48 proportion in our quantitative exercise.
    Based on these numbers and our re-estimated coefficients, we can calculate our predicted
employment changes. For example, using our coefficients reported in Table 4 Panel II, which
is estimated over a sample of 249 commuting zones that have information on both housing
structural break and supply elasticity over 1990-2007, we have the following calculation:

       · [0.5×(157.6+178.7)×1.14+0.5×(178.7+194.3)×1.84]×(-0.00628×0.48)= -1.612

    We do not have detailed information on employment by education (i.e., employment for
college workers versus noncollege workers), so we use available information from ADH to
back out this number:

       · First, the working-age population by commuting zone can be extracted from Acemoglu
         et al (2016).16 Using the share of a CZ's population with a college education, available
         from ADH in the years 1990 and 2000, we can estimate for each commuting zone the
         working-age population with or without a college education in 1990 and 2000.17

       · Using the percentage change of working-age population with a college education from
         2000 to 2007, we can calculate the working-age population with college education in
         2007.

       · Aggregating the commuting zone level working-age population by education to the na-
         tional level, we obtain the shares of college-educated workers for 1990, 2000, and 2007
         as 48.2%, 53.6%, and 57.3% respectively.

       · Applying these shares to the total working-age population reported in ADH (2013, note
         31), we obtain total working-age population with college education as 75.9, 95.8, and
         111.3 million in 1990, 2000, and 2007 respectively. Similarly, for noncollege workers
         the numbers are 81.7, 82.9, and 83.0 million in 1990, 2000, and 2007 respectively.

   Based on these numbers and our re-estimated coefficients, we can calculate the predicted
employment changes for college and noncollege workers separately. For example, using our
coefficients reported in Table 4 Panel II, our calculations are as follows:
  16
     Note that the national working age population aggregated from this data is 163, 186, and 201 million, in 1990,
2000, and 2007 respectively, which is slightly higher than ADH's number in their note 31.
  17
     Since we use the population share of college-educated person, we may underestimate the actual share of
college-educated workers relative to total working-age population.
