Institutional Requirements for Effective Imposition of Fines

                                               ABSTRACT

A long theoretical literature in economics addresses the heavy reliance of the U.S. criminal justice
system on very expensive forms of punishment ‚Äì prison ‚Äì when cheaper alternatives ‚Äì such as fines
and other sanctions ‚Äì are available. This paper analyzes the role of fines as a criminal sanction within
the existing institutional structure of criminal justice agencies, modeling heterogeneity in how people
respond to various sanctions and threat of sanctions. From research on the application of fines in the
U.S., we conclude that fines are economical only in relation to other forms of punishment; for many
crimes fines will work well for the majority of offenders but fail miserably for a significant minority;
that fines present a number of very significant administrative challenges; and that the political economy
of fine imposition and collection is complex. Despite these facts, and with the caveats that jurisdictions
vary tremendously and that there are large gaps in our knowledge about them, we build a model showing
that it is possible to expand the use of fines as a criminal sanction if institutional structures are developed
with these concerns in mind.

1. Introduction
More than at any other time over the past 30 years, state and local governments are interested in
reducing the burden of the criminal justice system. While some reform proposals are aimed at
reducing the intrusion of the system, current interest in reform is largely motivated by fiscal
concerns (Scott-Hayward 2009). To the extent that fines can replace more socially costly
sanctions such as incarceration without adverse consequences on crime rates and other goals of
the criminal justice system, increasing their use is a move toward ‚Äúeconomical crime control.‚Äù
       Limited data suggest that in the early years of the US, fines were more frequently used
than today, and that there were generally an alternative, not a supplement, to confinement.1
Goebel and Naughton (1970) found that fines were common in the colonial era, based on data
from New York courts. In the more recent period, there was a surge of interest in fines as an
alternative sanction in the 1980‚Äôs, when prison populations were rapidly expanding. Beginning
in Sweden, the system of ‚Äúday fines‚Äù was developed in the 1970s and used successfully,
spreading to several other European countries. In part inspired by this, a series of articles from
the Vera Institute of Justice and the Rand Corporation made the case for fines as a sanction,
described and assessed court practices and evaluated demonstration projects.2
       Before that point, theoretical analyses of fines were concerned with how to impose fines
that did not unfairly discriminate against the poor3 but could still be collected and not


1
         Some of the earliest uses of fines, such as the ‚Äúwergeld‚Äù in Anglo-Saxon law, seem to
be essentially negotiated blood money truces between warring clans. Before the technology of
incarceration was fully developed, it seems that the average state or ruler could choose from a
criminal punishment menu limited to fines, corporal punishment, or capital punishment. It was
fairly common for a punishment for a major crime to be ‚Äúfine if you can pay it, death if you
can‚Äôt,‚Äù or for a single polity to switch freely between the use of the punishment of a fine and the
punishment of a death sentence for the same crime (Zamist & Sichel 1982). Rusche et al. (2003)
suggest that a growing population of poor in Europe in the middle ages and early modern era led
to the use of prison as a deterrent. In their view, industrialization and the increased prevalence of
money and market relations up to 1850 then made the fine a more practical option in Europe, and
it was brought back.

         The most complete reference on the project, including background on day fines, is
Hillsman et al. (1984), but see also Greene (1988), Hillsman (1990, 1988), Hillsman and Greene
(1988). For evaluation results for the demonstration projects, see Turner and Petersilia (1996).

         See the Equal Protection Clause arguments in Williams v. Illinois (1970) and Tate v.
Short (1971), heavily cited Supreme Court cases that established rights of indigent defendants
not to face long terms of incarceration for inability to pay criminal fines.

                                                                                                     1
manipulated by defendants. In the background research on existing practice and field
demonstrations evaluated by Vera and Rand, very few of the problems brought up in more
theoretical analyses seemed to apply. Fines were used for a significant minority of offenses
(perhaps a quarter of offenses); where fines were assessed as a function of income, courts were
usually able to get a good sense of the income of the perpetrator quickly; and collection rates
were decent, if imperfect. And, once fines are nontrivial, they become more attractive to judges,
making them a viable alternative to incarceration (Hillsman & Greene 1988).
       Despite these fairly positive findings, fines have not gained much traction as an
alternative criminal sanction in the United States. Under Tony Blair, the United Kingdom
greatly expanded the use of fines for minor offenses, and many countries in continental Europe
seem to be content with day fines.4 But in the American criminal justice system, outside of
automobile offenses and white-collar crime, fines are something of an afterthought. While they
seem to be imposed quite frequently as part of a package of sanctions, both across the United
States and within specific jurisdictions, fines do not seem to be prioritized, and little thought or
planning seems to go into setting up systems to design fines, track them, and enforce collection.
       In this essay, we undertake an analysis of the role of fines as a criminal sanction in the
U.S. today and the potential for fines to play a larger role in crime control. The literature is
generally divided into two conceptual strands: one that considers issues such as the setting of
fines within a menu of criminal sanctions, how fines do or do not fulfill the purposes of
punishment, and the deterrent and other impacts of fines on choices of potential offenders; and
second a more descriptive strand that considers mechanisms for increasing collection rates and
the perspectives of judges and others on the appropriate utilization of fines and other sanctions.
We consider both the policies regarding fines as criminal sanctions and the organizational and
ecological issues surrounding their collection in order to assess the practical relevance of an
increasing reliance on fines.
       A quick summary of our conclusions is that first, fines are economical only in relation to
other forms of punishment, second, that for many crimes fines will work well for the majority of

4
          The motivation for the expanded use of fines was to reduce pressure on the courts so
that major cases would receive more attention and could be resolved more quickly. Some have
criticized the lack of due process. Others have argued that fines were more of a ‚Äútax‚Äù on
behavior than a punishment, suggesting that fines did not communicate sufficiently a sense that
the behavior was socially unacceptable.

                                                                                                       2
offenders but fail miserably for a significant minority, third, that they present a number of very
significant administrative challenges, fourth, that the political economy of fine imposition and
collection is complex. Despite these facts, and with the caveats that jurisdictions vary
tremendously and that there are large gaps in our knowledge about them, we build a model
showing that it is possible to expand the use of fines as a criminal sanction if institutional
structures are developed with these concerns in mind.


2. Fines as Punishment
Courts have a set of sanctions that can be applied as punishment for criminal offenses, and the
very language ‚Äúalternative sanctions‚Äù reflects the central role of secure confinement as a
sanction. This chapter generally considers probation, jail, prison, and post-incarceration
supervision as the ‚Äúmain‚Äù sanctions in order to discuss other options as ‚Äúalternatives.‚Äù But,
frequently these sanctions are not distinct. Probation is backed with the threat of incarceration, as
are parole and mandatory post-incarceration supervision. Therefore, a given offender may
transition through several of these sanction types under a single sentence.
        As we begin, it is important to bear in mind that the variation across criminal justice
jurisdictions is tremendous ‚Äì size, rules, allocation of responsibilities, funding, etc. As a result,
generalizations are necessary. In our discussion, we treat various sanctioning schemes in their
narrowest form in order to highlight distinctions across the canonical forms of the sanction types.
But we recognize that jurisdictions combine and adjust sanctions so that the distinctions we draw
in prose are not nearly so clean in practice.
        ‚ÄúAlternative‚Äù sanctions are those forms of punishment other than conventional probation
or parole supervision and jail or prison confinement. This category includes ‚Äúintermediate
sanctions‚Äù designed to fall somewhere between probation and incarceration as well as monetary
penalties (such as fines, victim compensation, and court and other fees). In practice, monetary
penalties are frequently assigned along with probation or incarceration, so in some cases they
may not serve as alternatives but as complements. And specialized courts (such as drug courts,
mental health courts, and the like) have introduced an alternative way of supervising and
punishing, one that is not necessarily intermediate to probation and prison. We return to these
more comprehensive sanctioning ‚Äúprograms‚Äù later in the chapter. To begin with, we concentrate
on fines as a distinct sanction.

                                                                                                        3
A. Estimates of the Imposition and Collection of Fines
Many minor infractions are routinely punished with monetary sanctions. A small fine resolves
many driving violations, including ones that put people and property at risk. Monetary sanctions
are generally considered effective and appropriate for minor infractions.
       But for more serious offenses, fines are infrequently applied as the primary punishment.
In 2004, there were 2.2 million arrests for serious violent or property crimes. Of these, 68%
were convicted and 9% diverted to another disposition. Of those convicted of a felony, 32%
were sentenced to prison, 40% to jail, 25% to probation, and 3% to other sanctions (Useem &
Piehl 2008, p.10). From this accounting, clearly sanctions explicitly labeled as diversion or
alternatives, including fines, represent a minority of outcomes. But, as noted above, monetary
penalties including fines or court costs may be part of a criminal sentence to confinement or
probation.
       Table 1 reports data from federal courts in 2006, showing that 76% of convictions have
no fine or restitution imposed. Despite the fact that fines are imposed in a minority of cases, the
total obligation is substantial: nearly $5 billion. Few offenders had both restitution and fine
orders, and, in the federal courts at least, financial obligations vary greatly by offense type. The
table reports some of the most common offenses. Immigration offenses are unlikely to have
financial penalties, while fraud convictions frequently require restitution. In contrast, drug
possession cases frequently result in a fine. Seventy percent of the total payment ordered comes
from fraud cases, which represent fewer than 10% of the offenses.
       For state and local jurisdictions, lack of data on fines and other alternative sanctions
seems to be a nearly universal problem -- a consequence of the lack of priority placed on these
sanctions. Vera researchers made heroic efforts to assemble information, and the reports by Vera
represent the high water mark for concrete data about fines and their implementation in the
United States, a level that has never been approximated before or since.5 So, in spite of the age
of the information, we report a few of their findings.


5
         A sense of the general lack of real numbers comes through in the story of a statistic on
the extent of fine use, as reported by Hillsman et al. (1984). Apparently born in 1932, the modal
figure in the literature for over forty years was that 75% of cases involved fines. ‚ÄúA figure of
seventy-five percent was published in 1953 by the University of Pennsylvania Law Review and
                                                                                                       4
        Table 2 reports results of a telephone survey of court administrators during the 1980s,
showing that the use of fines declines as the seriousness of the offense increases. Our own
informal survey of court administrators found a great deal of variation in the role of fines and
also in the ability of courts to report on the extent of their use. In fact, most of the information
they could provide had to do with the collection more than with the imposition of fines. For
example, one county jurisdiction we contacted could easily provide information on active fines
outstanding, but could not provide any numbers to put this in context.
        The focus of court administrators is generally on the collection of fines. And the general
impression in the field is that collection rates are low. Langan (1994) reports that half of
probationers had not complied with their conditions of probation, including financial penalties,
by the time they were discharged from probation and that noncompliance was infrequently
punished. Table 3 reports on collection of fines in misdemeanor courts across New York City in
1979. While the sample sizes are small (researchers took a one-week sample from each court),
the results show variation in success, both across offense and across court, and generally indicate
that fines collections are not uniformly low (Hillsman et al. 1984). McLean and Thompson
(2007) report more recent data showing great variation across states in imposition of monetary
sanctions and low levels of collection. But this does not mean that collection rates must
necessarily be low.
        Data from Twin Falls (Idaho) in Figure 1 show that collection rates for fines in
misdemeanor cases and infractions were high in 2001, whereas collection rates were low for
felonies and victim restitution. In 2004 the jurisdiction began using a collection agency. Since
that time, collections in the lagging categories increased substantially. This is evidence that
collection is, at least in part, a function of attention.
        One perspective on the potential for fine collection comes from the costs of collection
itself. A review of the British experience is that it costs ‚Ç§91 to collect an ‚Ç§80 fine (United
Kingdom 2006). An Orange County (California) official reported that its collection costs were
an order of magnitude greater than revenues. For an agency charged with collecting fines, such


was passed along by Rubin in 1963 and again in 1973, Davidson in 1966, and the Rutgers Law
Review in 1975. Miller used a very similar figure in 1956 without noting a source. It is
fascinating that the University of Pennsylvania cites a 1932 article for this figure, and researchers
desperate for some measurement have kept this seventy-five percent alive for over forty years,
apparently without confirmation that it reflects current fines use.‚Äù (Zamist & Sichel 1982).

                                                                                                       5
as a county court, this is a large negative return. But for the jurisdiction imposing fines as an
alternative to incarceration, including the avoided costs of incarceration would yield a very high
financial return. To paraphrase Winston Churchill, fines are the least economical form of
punishment, except for all others that have been tried.
       This point is best illustrated by results from a felony-collections program implemented by
Snohomish County in Washington State. In 2003, the state Department of Corrections (DOC)
entered into agreement with local county clerks‚Äô offices to assume collection of financial
penalties owed to the state by felony offenders. The county reports that the results of its program
shown that ‚Äúcollection efforts in felony cases can be highly successful‚Äù (Snohomish County
2009). And from the county‚Äôs perspective, it was. From an expenditure of $85,000, the program
produced $146,000 for the county. This latter figure was comprised of a $61,000 grant from the
state and $85,000 in collection recovery fees ($100 per account). Note that the program would
have simply broken even for the county without the state grant. The benefit touted by the county
was due to the transfer from the state to encourage counties to participate.
       The intervention was relatively simple. Monthly statements were issued, and
administrative hearings held to monitor these accounts. Only after months of delinquency and
repeated administrative intervention is the case referred for formal court hearings. In a sample of
100 cases in the county clerk‚Äôs program, 16% paid in full (three times the rate in a similar group
of cases managed by the DOC) and 38% of the balance was collected (compared to 6% in the
DOC sample). The average payment collected was on the order of $100.
       As in the earlier cases cited, attention to collection can raise rates of collection
substantially, but the return is positive only if the fines have punishment value. From the state‚Äôs
perspective, the program was costly, as the incentives to counties were not covered by the
increase in collections. If the fines are alternatives to other more costly punishments, paying
more than is recovered is economical.
       The collection of fines, even when the fine is an alternative to incarceration, is frequently
backed up by the threat of incarceration if payment is not made. Nagin (2008) discusses that fine
collection requires the ‚Äúcommitment of real resources‚Äù including systems to track payment and
implement followup punishments, such as incarceration, in the case of failure to pay. He cites
Moxon and Whitacker (1996) that roughly 25% of persons fined in England and Wales were
imprisoned for some period as punishment for nonpayment.

                                                                                                      6
       In a finding known as ‚Äúthe miracle of the cells,‚Äù those with credible threats of sanctioning
for nonpayment of monetary penalties had significantly greater compliance. In an experimental
design, Weisburd et al. (2008) found that 35-40% of those facing the threat of incarceration paid
100% of their obligation compared to just 13% of controls. (The addition of other conditions did
not increase compliance over and above the threat of incarceration.) Together with the results of
the Snohomish County pilot project, these results show that agencies that make collection a
priority can achieve much improved, if still imperfect, compliance rates.
       However, a brief look at data from the collection industry suggests that there are serious
limitations. Data from ACA International, which describes itself as the Association of Credit
and Collection Professionals, suggests that of the total credit granted in the United States in any
particular year, as much as 8% is written off by the creditor at some point.6 Collection agencies
seem to be able to collect less than 20% of debts that go into delinquency.7 Because the recovery
rate tends to vary greatly by type of account, it is hard to make a clear comparison between ‚Äúbad
debt‚Äù in a private transactional setting and ‚Äúbad debt‚Äù from fines, but the fact that companies that
are able to preselect who they lend to have an overall recovery rate that is possibly as low as
92% is sobering for agencies trying to collect from individuals who are selected on the basis of
noncompliance with criminal law.
       In Figure 2 we reproduce a number of data points from diverse agencies in different
regions and different time periods, focusing on collecting from very different populations. It
should be noted that two courts, Maricopa County Superior and Pima County Superior, that did
not deal with traffic cases, had total court expenditures 33 and 89 times total collections,
respectively, and would thus be completely impossible to include in the graph.
       A few patterns seem to come through. First, looking at the different categories, it is clear
that collecting on traffic and parking offenses is highly efficient, with low costs per dollar
collected and fairly high collection rates (although these are simply guesses by previous
researchers in several cases). Second, there is something of a negative relationship between rate
of collection and efficiency of collection. Private collection agencies have an extremely high
efficiency, paying about $0.20 to collect each dollar, but their recovery rate is under 20%. Public
6
       The authors use Federal Reserve Bank data showing $2,550 billion of outstanding
consumer credit in early 2008 and IRS data estimates of $152 billion of bad debt write-offs on
consumer debt for the year (PriceWaterhouseCoopers 2008).
7
       ACA International (2005) finds a rate of 16.2% across the industry.

                                                                                                      7
agencies are lower efficiency, but show significantly higher recovery rates. Third, even the
highest recovery rates don‚Äôt get close to 100% - all available data suggest that collection rates in
the 70-80% range are better than average. With more and better data, it should be possible to
sketch out an efficient frontier of fine collection.
        We draw several conclusions from this review of available evidence on collection
practices and success. High rates of collection are possible, as indicated by results from traffic
courts and from pilot projects to increase collection. But many jurisdictions appear not to
emphasize collection. This may be due to generally inattention in light of other workload
demands. But it also in part reflects the high costs of collection generally and from the
population of convicted offenders in particular. An agency charged with collection will not be
motivated to attain high collection rates simply by the financial returns to doing so.


B. Fines and the Purposes of Punishment
The discussion above suggests that fines and other monetary penalties play multiple roles in the
criminal justice system. The traditional theoretical purposes of punishment are incapacitation,
deterrence, rehabilitation, and retribution. Relative to incarceration, fines (and other alternative
sanctions) offer less in terms of incapacitation, but can potentially fulfill the other purposes. But
in practice, a particular sanction for a particular offense must fulfill multiple purposes. At the
same time, different agents of the system may conceive of the same sanction differently. As an
example, the view by court administrators of fines as a potential revenue stream to be balanced
against the costs of collection is very different from the view of a fine as a punishment, perhaps
to be compared in terms of efficiency to other sanction alternatives.
        Economists tend to emphasize the deterrent effect of criminal sanctions. But other justice
system participants have other priorities. The victims‚Äô rights movement of the 1980s and 1990s
led to the increasing imposition of financial penalties in order to provide some compensation to
victims and to fund offices to support crime victims. In addition, many states routinely impose a
wide range of fees on criminal defendants. Reynolds et al. (2009) report a hypothetical
(presented as representative) case of a person convicted of possession of a controlled substance
in Texas, facing a prison sentence of five years (expected time served behind bars is two years of
these five), a fine of $1500, and court costs of $362, including clerk‚Äôs fee, records management
fee, and court security fee, among others. Some government agencies rely heavily on revenue

                                                                                                       8
streams resulting from criminal sentences. McLean and Thompson (2007) report that
‚Äúadministrative assessments on citations fund nearly all of the Administrative Office of the
Court‚Äôs budget in Nevada ‚Ä¶ and [i]n Texas, probation fees made up 46 percent of the Travis
County Probation Department‚Äôs $18.3 million budget.‚Äù
       Another view of the appropriateness of particular sanction options comes from a
consideration of the expressive quality of punishment. Many authors express concern that fines
do not carry sufficient expressive condemnation of conduct, and thus become more like a ‚Äúprice‚Äù
of conduct, a licensing fee, or a ‚Äúcost of doing business.‚Äù To the extent that it is the moral
expressiveness of punishment that leads to deterrence, increasing reliance on fines instead of
sanctions that restrict liberty may become a false economy.8 Yet, concerns that fines lack
sufficient expression of public scorn often omit consideration of the ways that fines are imposed.
As Feeley (1979) and others have described, navigating one‚Äôs way through the courts, even if
one‚Äôs case ends in charges being dropped or the imposition of a fine, will be experienced by
many as punishing. And, as the outcome of criminal conviction is frequently a suspended
sentence, an imposed fine could be experienced as a more onerous punishment.
       One metric of appropriateness of fines as punishment for particular conduct is judges‚Äô
willingness to impose them. A 1987 survey of judges found that 53% to 64% expressed a
willingness to punish the sale of 1 ounce of cocaine with a fine and 27% to 46% expressed a
willingness to punish daytime residential burglaries with a fine. Nagin (2008) interprets these
findings as indicating willingness to use fines for fairly serious offenses. He observes ‚ÄúMy
hunch is that the major barrier to a large increase in the use of fines for nonviolent crimes would
not involve adverse public reaction about being soft on crime. Rather, it would involve justifiable
concerns about the effectiveness of fine enforcement and the possibility that offenders would pay
the fine by committing more crimes (Nagin 2008: 39).‚Äù
       In contrast, those particularly concerned with rehabilitation, including agencies and
organizations focused on the challenges facing prisoners after release, often view monetary
sanctions as a barrier to rehabilitation and a driver of recidivism (Mclean & Thompson 2007).

8
         Zamist and Sichel‚Äôs (1982) review summarizes the literature on expressive role of
sanctions. Gneezy and Rustichini (2000) argue that fines can increase problem behavior under
certain circumstances. Their analysis of fines for late arrival at a day care center found that
parents were more likely to be late after the fines were imposed. It is unclear whether these
findings are relevant to the context of criminal fines, as the day care fines were very small.

                                                                                                  9
Offenders are likely to face a variety of financial obligations, including court costs, victim
restitution awards, and other debts (notably child support payments). The marginal tax rates for
paying these debts can become extremely high, providing strong disincentive to working in the
legal labor market. As noted by McLean and Thompson (2007), ‚ÄúFederal law provides that a
child support enforcement officer can garnish up to 65 percent of an individual‚Äôs wages for child
support. At the same time, a probation officer in most states can require that an individual
dedicate 35 percent of his or her income toward the combined payment of fines, fees, surcharges,
and restitution.‚Äù
       Reynolds et al. (2009) report data from an Office of Court Administration study in Texas
that shows for the population that have both criminal justice debt and owe child support (which
may be 20-25% of the offenders, or more), offense debt is dwarfed by child support obligations.
Perhaps in recognition of the financial demands, the repayment time horizon for the offense debt
is long ‚Äì roughly five years assuming no gaps in payment. Reynolds et al. (2009) recommend,
based on these data, providing judges better training on the financial circumstances of the
offenders so that they will impose fines that are collectable. The view that sentences do not
reflect the practical issues of the collection of monetary penalties was echoed by court
administrators with whom we communicated.
       McLean and Thompson (2007) make a somewhat different policy recommendation,
based on essentially the same findings and with a similar set of concerns. Monetary fines,
including court costs and victim restitution, can be effectively collected if caseworkers
coordinate debt collection across sources, facilitate the logistics of collection across agencies,
and keep the repayment rate practical. Under this approach, the enforcement of the fee
requirements will be individualized (as a function of wealth, earnings capacity, and other debt
obligations) even if the imposition of the fees is not.
       Under both of these recommendations, fines (or their partial forgiveness) may become
individualized to an offender‚Äôs ability to pay. In the process, the link between the fine as a
distinct punishment and the particular conviction that lead to it may well become diffuse in the
offender‚Äôs and in the state‚Äôs perspective (if it wasn‚Äôt already). There are two main arguments in
these policy proposals ‚Äì that it is not practical to fully collect imposed fines in many cases given
the low ability to pay and high debt loads and furthermore it may not be in society‚Äôs interest to
push too hard to collect, as it may on the margin drive more out of legitimate labor market

                                                                                                     10
activity. These are important constraints to be incorporated into any serious proposal regarding
expanded use of fines as an alternative criminal punishment.


C. Jurisdictional Issues
One institutional matter of particular practical concern is that of jurisdiction. While criminal
justice is frequently referred to as a ‚Äúsystem,‚Äù it is anything but. There are multiple layers of
legal jurisdiction (from local to state to federal), and sometimes overlapping jurisdictions of
agencies (such as lower and upper courts, probation, city police, county jails, and state prisons,
among many others).
       As has been implicit in the discussion above, different sanctions are implemented by
different authorities, meaning that individuals may transfer from one agency to another within
the criminal justice system to fulfill the conditions of a single conviction. These transfers may
be transfers of authority or legal responsibility, physical custody, or both.
       For violations of state criminal law, a sentence to prison means that the state correctional
agency has responsibility for the details of the incarceration experience, subject to the time
established by the court and the many restrictions of federal and state laws and regulations.
Other sanctions may be carried out by corrections agencies, probation, or the courts. In about
two-thirds of states probation is in the judicial branch and in the other one-third it is an executive
agency (Piehl & LoBuglio 2005). Therefore, a system of fines collected by the courts with jail
time as punishment for noncompliance may require repeated handovers across jurisdiction, as an
individual passes from the courts to the county sheriff and back again.
       Handovers across these agency boundaries can be clunky, and the time and
administrative work involved can undermine efficiency and rehabilitation. In addition, we
argued above that different agencies may have different goals for the same activities. If a county
clerk (or a collection agency operating under contract) sees revenue as the highest priority, fine
collection might be treated quite differently than by a probation officer working to attain
compliance across a wide range of conditions. As a result, jurisdictional boundaries not only
lead to administrative costs, but may by their very existence fundamentally alter the form the
imposed punishment takes as it is executed in practice.
       A number of alternative sanctions programs have faced this same issue. For example,
programs that employ a strategy of quickly administered, minor sanctions for rule infractions

                                                                                                     11
have shown a lot of promise for modifying criminal behavior (for examples, see Kleiman 2009
and Piehl 2009). But, just as in the fines example, such strategies run counter to traditional
jurisdictional boundaries. In order to be successfully implemented, such programs require either
the development of new agency relationships or new capacities within agencies.
       One approach is to contract out with private (usually non-profit) entities to manage, as is
often done with halfway houses prior to prison release. Another approach has been for agencies
to develop new capacities and manage the punishment for rule violations ‚Äúin house.‚Äù For
example, parole in New Jersey has developed a ‚Äúhalfway back‚Äù program to reduce its reliance on
county and state prison cells for punishment of violations of parole conditions. To do this, the
parole agency now has several facilities with secure cells, located in cities with large numbers of
parolees. Parolees in violation are taken to the halfway back facility where they may serve a few
days, be held for as long as 30 days to be assessed for appropriate disposition, or transferred to a
county or state cell. The new program was promoted as a way to both save resources and
improve outcomes.9
       Yet another solution to jurisdictional conflicts in imposing and carrying out alternative
punishments is a relatively new institutional form known as the specialized court. Drug courts,
mental health courts, reentry courts, and the like have been promoted to provide more
appropriate and flexible supervision and sanctioning. In these courts, a judge (along with a
group of law enforcement and social service practitioners) aims to construct a punishment that
both sanctions the criminal behavior and facilitates rehabilitation. Because of the individualized
program, fines and other monetary obligations of the offender are prioritized and managed
against issues such as work disincentives. In these courts, the details of the sanction are
organized around the particular circumstances of the offender, and these details can be, and are,
modified over time. By including participants from multiple criminal justice and social service
agencies, any conflicts can be managed within the team, with the leadership of the judge.




9
         The added capacity for parole allows more flexibility which can speed resolution, allow
punishment with minimum disruption to an offender‚Äôs productive activities (for example, by
allowing him to continue any paid employment), and to individualize parole requirements. It is
projected to save money by reducing transfers to physically remote locations and reducing
disruption to those facilities. If outcomes improve, then downstream savings will accrue to the
system.

                                                                                                   12
       In all of these alternative sanctions models, the punishment is oriented around the
offender rather than the offense. Choices about priorities for expectations of the offender and
sanctions for noncompliance are made with the offender as the audience, with the goal of
modifying behavior to improve his or her functioning in society in the future. Advocates of such
an approach to punishment tend not to be terribly concerned about the impact of these choices on
other audiences, such as deterrent impact.
       We attempt to accommodate concerns with both the offender and with wider audiences in
the theoretical model below. The model explores the possibility of sorting offenders in a way
that efficiently deters and at the same time is realistic in its imposition of penalties. Certain
offenders are likely to be deterrable by fines or other sanctions, while others may be incapable of
being deterred (because unstable income and minimum allowable consumption levels make it
impossible to collect sanctions from them or because of low levels of social skills).



3. Modeling Offender Choice under Fines
A long theoretical literature in economics addresses the heavy reliance of the criminal justice
system on very expensive forms of punishment ‚Äì prison ‚Äì when cheaper alternatives ‚Äì such as
fines and other sanctions ‚Äì are available. Becker‚Äôs (1968) well known result that the most
efficient way to achieve deterrence is with a maximal fine has been analyzed or extended in a
large number of papers,10 many of which analyze the conditions under which a maximal penalty
may not be optimal. (See Durlauf & Nagin, this volume, for more on modeling deterrence.)
       But the tradeoff among types of punishment has received somewhat less attention. The
essential dimension for present purposes is the tradeoff between fines and incarceration, maximal
or not. Incarceration is socially costly, and growing literatures in sociology, criminology,
economics and policy document the various types of social costs involved in the use of
incarceration (fiscal costs of provision of secure confinement, labor market impacts, costs
imposed on community due to disruption of removal and return of residents, impact on family
members, etc.) If the same level of crime could be achieved at lower social cost using alternative
punishments, the social cost savings could be substantial. As Polinsky and Shavell (2000, p. 51)
state it, ‚Äúdifferent types of sanctions should be employed in the order of their costs (per unit of

10
         See references in recent reviews by Polinsky and Shavell (2000) and Garoupa (1997).

                                                                                                      13
deterrence).‚Äù And these sanctions should be imposed so that marginal deterrence is maintained.
(We discussed earlier that in practice sanctions are frequently combined. To keep the model
tractable, we treat fines and prison as distinct alternative punishments.)
        The current literature reports heterogeneity in how people respond to various sanctions
and threat of sanctions (Hillsman et al. 1984, Kleiman 2009, Moxon & Whittaker 1996). For
example, when given the option, many inmates often prefer incarceration to terms of supervision
‚Äúon the street‚Äù (Piehl 2002). But there is very little empirical data on deterrent impacts of the
sanctions much less heterogeneity in the effects. Therefore, the literature does not currently
allow for calculations of the cost-effectiveness per unit of deterrence.
        One potential limitation on fines is the low level of income and assets of the majority of
criminal offenders (James 2004, Tyler & Kling 2007). The deterrent value of fines may be high
enough to justify an important role in punishment for richer defendants, but for poor offenders
there may be a low deterrent effect. Garoupa (2001) presents a model in which it is optimal for
law enforcement to increase both the probability of apprehension and the penalty against richer
defendants, as the return to prosecution of poor defendants is so low (yet still somewhat costly).


A. Fine Structure and Deterrence
We begin with a benchmark model of the deterrent power of fines, where the potential offender
has a full-time stable job. He (without loss of generality, we stick to the male pronoun) receives
a fixed wage wÔÄ†every period. If he commits a crime he receives a benefit b. The probability of
being caught, convicted and sentenced is p.
If honest, his payoff is:      w


If dishonest, his payoff is:   -pf+w+b

        In this benchmark model, fines can successfully deter crime when our ‚Äútaxpayer‚Äù finds
that honesty is a better policy than dishonesty, which under our assumptions reduces to:
                                               f>b/p
The interpretation of this is fairly simple: in order to make it advantageous for the average law-
abiding citizen to stay law-abiding, all that is required in the benchmark model is a simple fine
structure, based on an estimate of the upper-bound of the benefit the citizen might gain from
breaking a specific law, b and the odds of successfully catching him and convicting him if he
                                                                                                    14
does, p. We simply set a fine equal to the first value divided by the second. If it is believed that
the citizen would at most gain $10 from jay-walking, and the state would have a 50/50 chance of
catching him, the appropriate fine would be set at or slightly above $20.11
       The above assumes that the disutility of the fine is purely the loss of money. There is
substantial evidence that many if not most fines impose additional disutility on offenders beyond
the simple out-of-pocket cost (Feeley (1979) is the classic statement of this). The nonfinancial
disutility is even more difficult to measure than financial disutility, and subject to remarkable
variance. Various situational issues, such as whether or not there is an actual arrest or simply a
ticket or penalty notice for disorder, whether the offender is detained for several hours or days
before the fine is imposed, whether the police, court officials and judge who impose the fine are
professional or gratuitously hostile all can play a role here. Additionally, the personality and
social disposition of the offender may lead him to see the fine as alternatively a minor nuisance,
a substantial imposition.12
       To take this into account, we add a variable di for the individual i‚Äôs expected disutility
from the procedure itself. For each individual, the non-financial disutility is assumed to a random
finite positive value that only he knows, updating the equation to:
                                             di +f>b/p
A few comments are in order. Here, fines, wages, and benefits are measured in comparable
units. If fines are considered to be relative to wage levels, as a day fine would be, this would
require that benefits also be parameterized relative to wages. If utility scales perfectly with
earnings, then the results are unchanged by this reparameterization.
       Note also that we have assumed the offender can pay the fine from his wage this period.
However, the model is effectively identical if the offender is capable of paying from some store
of wealth. Thus, for offenders who have either high income or high wealth, deterrent fine size
and structure are straightforward.

11
          Note that in Becker (1968) a single variable, f, stands in for a generic form of
punishment. It might reasonably be summarized as ‚Äútotal pain,‚Äù ‚Äútotal disutility‚Äù or ‚Äútotal loss of
utility‚Äù from punishment. While Becker‚Äôs article discusses the cost, to society, of inflicting this
disutility on individuals, there is no discussion of the issues of uncertainty, income, wealth etc.
There are numerous papers that incorporate one or more of these additional considerations. See
Polinsky and Shavell (2000) for a review of this literature.
12
          Under certain circumstances an offender may see a punishment as a badge of honor. We
believe these circumstances are unusual, so set this case aside.

                                                                                                     15
        If the taxpayer has a low income, we will need to make some adjustments to the model.
We begin by adding the assumption that consumption is a function of the wage, c(w) and cannot

drop below a threshold, c . Define c(w) as:
                                                  c( w) ÔÄΩ w if w ÔÇ≥ c,
                                                  c( w) ÔÄΩ c otherwise

        In the case where consumption hits the lower bar, the fine cannot be levied. This
corresponds to a range of real-life scenarios, where convicted offenders are so poor that they
have neither income nor assets from which a fine can be collected. In the context of this paper, if
the offender was truly incapable of paying out any money in the near future, the case would no
longer be handled by a fine and would instead have to be handled by some combination of
incarceration, probation, etc. Such cases of completely indigent offenders appear to be a very
minor part of overall criminal activity. A system of fines that cannot handle such cases directly
can still be effective.
        A much more common case is where w ÔÄæ c , but only by a relatively small amount. That is
to say, the offender does have a steady wage, but it is relatively small, and the amount that can be
taken by fine is similarly small. Thus, for every period, there is some amount ÔÅ∏ ÔÄΩ w ÔÄ≠ c ÔÄæ 0 that
can be taken from the offender without being excessive punishment. If we assume that this
amount is taken regularly every period for a set number of periods, and that the offender
discounts the future utility by ÔÅ¢ (which is both a rate of time preference and a sense of the
probability of continued fines) then the expected impact in period 0 of a fine exacted over T
periods would be:
                                                                T
                                                      FT ÔÄΩ ÔÉ• ( ÔÅ¢ tÔÅ∏ )

For a fine to be successfully exacted against a low income offender, it is necessary to find a T,
such that

Several comments are in order: First, T can only be found if 1 ÔÄ≠ ÔÉßÔÉß ÔÄ≠ di ÔÉ∑ÔÉ∑          is positive,
                                                                      ÔÉ®p  ÔÉ∏ ÔÅ∏
                         ÔÉ¶b      ÔÉ∂    ÔÅ∏
which is only true when ÔÉßÔÉß ÔÄ≠ di ÔÉ∑ÔÉ∑ ÔÄº        . Since the figure on the right is the net present value
                         ÔÉ®p      ÔÉ∏ (1 ÔÄ≠ ÔÅ¢ )
of all future payments of ÔÅ∏ , this makes sense; if the inequality didn‚Äôt hold, the net value of all
                                b
payments would never exceed the p value.

       Second, the higher ÔÅ∏ , ÔÅ¢ , di and p are, the lower T is. Likewise, the lower b is, the lower
T is. All of which stands to reason ‚Äì an increase in the steepness of the fine, the greater the ‚Äúslap
in the face‚Äù an offender feels from receiving any fine, or the certainty of the fine process (both
ÔÅ¢ and p) would lower the number of periods we would need to impose fine payments, while the
greater the benefit to the potential offender, the more periods we would need to impose fine
payments.
       Third, for valid Ts , both the numerator and the denominator are logarithms of numbers
between 0 and 1, which mean both have negative values (making T positive). If either value
approaches zero, then the logarithm of that value will asymptotically approach ÔÄ≠ ÔÇ• . This is most
              ÔÅ∏                                 b
critical if 1 ÔÄ≠ ÔÅ¢ is only slightly greater than p ÔÄ≠ di , the situation of an agent who will only barely

pay off (over an infinite number of periods) a fine equal to the ‚Äúexpected benefit.‚Äù As the net
present value of his total fine payments approaches the gain from the crime, the value of the
numerator approaches ÔÄ≠ ÔÇ• , and the value of the overall expression approaches ÔÇ• .
       Fourth, we should assume that there is some T , a maximum number of periods that a
system can expect to collect period payments ( ÔÇ• is a helpful idea for modeling purposes but not
susceptible to implementation). We can effectively use fines to deter even very poor individuals
from a wide variety of crimes, so long as they have a predictable wage, place a high value on the
future, and are unlikely to move around.



                                                                                                      17
       The potential criminal we envision in this adjustment, while not indigent, has an

uncertain honest wage w, which is a simple Bernoulli variable with a sample space {w, w} . The

higher wage, w , allows the agent to pay ÔÅ∏ in each period, while the lower wage draw w ÔÇ£ c ,
does not allow the agent to pay anything. The probability of drawing w in a given period is ÔÅ≤ ,
and the probability of drawing w is 1 ÔÄ≠ ÔÅ≤ .

       Because the expected payment any single period is E ( f t ) ÔÄΩ ÔÅ∏ ÔÇ¥ ÔÅ≤ ÔÄ´ 0 ÔÇ¥ (1 ÔÄ≠ ÔÅ≤ ) ÔÄΩ ÔÅ∏ÔÅ≤ we

will require a 0.1 increase in ÔÅ∏ ; a 50% drop in ÔÅ≤ will require ÔÅ∏ to double.
       In summary, fines can be powerfully deterrent for a wide range of possible crimes and
potential offender situations. However, for every crime there will be some potential offenders for
whom the threat of a fine will simply not be credible or threatening. Potential offenders who are
indigent, who have highly unstable situations, who discount the future heavily, or who are
confident in their ability to outwit the system in the long run will not be deterred by fines in their
pure form.Instead, fines will need to be integrated with other forms of punishment.


B. Fines as the First Line of Defense
Thomas Schelling (quoting Walter Lippman) spoke of the plate glass window as a model
deterrent mechanism ‚Äì once you go too far, it breaks and an uproar ensues (Schelling 1956). Our
vision of a fine is close to that, but not quite as binary ‚Äì something like a thicket. Once you cross
the line it marks out, you get immediately stuck by the branches, which will deter most people.
However, a minority are so willful or heedless that they will keep on going. To deal with them
you need a second, much more powerful, system that they cannot ignore. That doesn't mean the
thicket doesn't play an important role, or that it's not a good investment. By cheaply deterring the
hoi polloi, it allows you to focus on the real troublemakers.

                                                                                                    18
       Similarly, fines may do an efficient job of deterring the majority of potential offenders,
but a significant minority (25%, as a rough guess) may crash right through any fine system,
accumulating a huge number of fines, failing to pay, etc. This is in keeping with a common
pattern in criminal justice, and in management and administration generally. DiIulio and Piehl
(1991) provide evidence of the high variation in offender patterns, showing that focusing
punishment on the minority with the highest rates of offense yields the biggest benefits. Models
of offending trajectories likewise show variation in offending that falls into identifiable clusters
(Nagin et al. 1995). More generally, a commonplace of management lore is the ‚Äú80/20 Rule‚Äù or
‚ÄúPareto Principle,‚Äù the general idea that 80 percent of activity can be traced to 20 percent of
individuals (i.e., 80% of sales are due to 20% of customers, 80% of complaints due to a
presumably different 20% of customers, etc.).13 This general idea seems to be very clearly borne
out in all the available data on fine use and administration. For a wide range of nuisance crimes,
misdemeanors, and even some basic felonies, efficient crime control will require a system that
effectively sorts offenders.
       For the appropriate crimes, fines will represent the first line of defense. An offender who
is caught and convicted can be fined using a flat penalty or one scaled according to his wage or
expected wage. The research by Vera suggests that this latter method can be trusted to assess a
fine that is both payable but onerous. An effective administrative system needs to be in place to
follow up (see Turner and Petersilia 1996 for a summary of some of the issues involved).
       It is possible to further improve on this by linking fines directly with community service
punishments. For some offenders, especially those with limited means and uncertain income,
being able to ‚Äúwork‚Äù off the fine will give them a valuable option. Obviously, the administrative
costs of linking offenders with needed service work, perhaps through community NGOs, will be
higher than the cost of processing a one-off payment. However, we believe that this upfront
administrative cost will be solidly compensated by allowing more offenders a straightforward
way to exit the thicket, saving both them and the system from the costs of harassment and further
follow-up.
       After a certain amount of followup, triage becomes possible ‚Äì one group of offenders pay
quickly and fully, a second pays slowly and only after harassment, and a third group will

13
      It appears that Joseph Juran was responsible for the popularization of this idea (Wood &
Wood 2005).

                                                                                                    19
completely fail to pay. If the administrative system is well-run, the first two groups will have
been punished at only minor net cost to the system.
       The third group, those who have failed to pay, will have crashed through the fine system
into the next level. Most likely a court will need to tailor a solution for them, depending on the
pattern of crimes. The development of the solution could draw on the experiences of the
‚Äúmiracle of the cells‚Äù (Weisburd et al. 2008) or programs with a more graduated set of sanctions
that can be more narrowly tailored, such as those frequently used in specialized courts (Kleiman
2009) or those used to encourage labor force attachment in corrections programs to prepare
inmates for release (Piehl 2009).


C. Using Fines in a System that is Both Fair and Efficient
For this proposed system to work fairly and efficiently for a particular class of crimes, it must do
a good job of allocating fines to those for whom they will be effective and retaining the ‚Äúthicket‚Äù
only for the others. Equilibrium is attained when those who never offend are happy to stay that
way; those who offend once, in a weak moment, are glad it wasn't more than that, and wish it
had never happened; and those who are undeterred wish they had better control of themselves.
       What precepts can we employ to maintain this balance? First, the system should be, on
net, forgiving. For offenders with limited or unreliable means, this means always providing a
realistic and humane way for them to pay or work off their fine. For all offenders, it means not
overreacting to temporary failings. Even the most organized and conscientious citizens
occasionally miss a payment deadline; it is easy for a poor but hardworking offender to miss one
payment of an overall payment regimen, or to show up late for a community service work
session. Carelessly treating them as if they were undeterrable may create needless misery for
them, and unnecessary waste for the system. The simple economics of an efficient criminal
justice system are that deterrence should not be maximal (Becker 1968). The system proposed
here should be evaluated as a whole, not on an incident-by-incident basis.
       Second, whatever tailored program is developed for those who are not deterred by the
sanctioning scheme must not be compelling to somebody behaving according to the benchmark
model, a ‚Äútaxpayer.‚Äù This seems easy to achieve. The tailored program should ensure that
noncompliance with the sanction produces further obligations to government (such as garnished
wages or additional appointments to keep) that the ‚Äútaxpayer‚Äù will find much more noxious than


                                                                                                     20
a simple fine. (For example, someone with regular wages or a hope of regular wages will not
want to lose them.) This condition provides a constraint on how generous the tailored program
can be in terms of writing down the financial obligations for those who cannot pay (Levitt 1997).
        Thirdly, while it is not clear that fines have any less deterrent power than other
punishments, we are certain that first, there are some people who will not be deterred by fines,
and second, that fines are likely to look ‚Äúsofter‚Äù to voters than some other choices available
(especially ex post). It is therefore vitally important that fines not be used as punishments in
cases where a single failure of deterrence is catastrophic: any crime that directly causes serious
pain or anguish to another person would be very inappropriate for punishment solely by fines.
Obvious examples would be murder, rape, or assault. Built into our model of fines is the
certainty that they will fail to deter for a substantial minority of potential offenders.
        Finally, the fine system will need to be sensitive both to offenders who fail to pay, and
offenders who pay and then commit the same crime again. The second offense should cost more
than the first, and the third should cost more than the second. It is important, but perhaps
expensive, for the system to prevent the sanction from becoming a ‚Äúcost of doing business‚Äù or an
indulgence for wealthy offenders.14
        Fines can be an efficient sanction, in equilibrium, where it is possible for the system to
sort offenders into different eventual punishments. Note that the imposed sanction is the same
for all offenders convicted of the same offense, but the behavioral response to the sanction will
vary by offender. After a certain record of failure, courts will tailor a solution. In order to
maintain this as an equilibrium, the system must be keep people from ‚Äúgaming‚Äù it ‚Äì strategically
appearing undeterrable to the court in order to have the obligation reduced.


4. Discussion
Fines potentially provide a low-cost sanction for criminal activity. Yet, fines are infrequently
imposed, and when imposed, often not collected. Is there a reasonable scope for increasing
reliance on fines to improve the efficiency of the criminal justice system?
        In theory, increasing the use of fines could have several benefits. It could provide
punishment for criminal offenses that are currently not punished severely, either because cases


14
        Note: Polinsky and Shavell (2000) assume that the fine (net of collection costs)
represents the true social cost, and hence is indifferent to repeat offenses.
                                                                                                     21
are not pursued or because sentences are suspended or otherwise not enforced. At the other
margin, fines could also provide a mechanism of punishing at lower social cost than short terms
of jail or prison confinement.
       The early part of the article described several practical reasons for the limited use of fines
currently in the American criminal justice system. Three of these seem of particular importance.
One real limitation on the use of fines is the financial position of many offenders: low earnings,
no or minimal assets, and high debts, frequently to other government agencies. The high
marginal tax rates that would be required to add further fines to such an offender would work
against their rehabilitation into work in the legitimate labor market and eventual payments of any
of these obligations.
       Another constraint is that is that agencies or units responsible for fine collection
frequently view active pursuit of the debts as not ‚Äúworth it‚Äù due to the high costs of collection.
Criminal justice writ large will never be revenue producing for government, as producing order
and enforcing laws are expensive. Fines will not be imposed more broadly unless judges and the
public see them as real punishments, and this requires that effort be expected to collect the
judgments. Even if it costs more to collect a fine than the amount of the fine, doing so is likely
to be cheaper at achieving expressive or deterrent purposes of punishment than any alternative
method. This issue of organizational perspective is compounded by the many jurisdictional
boundaries that may exist in a given criminal case. The overlapping responsibilities of the many
agencies that operate within criminal justice mean that any given offender may be transferred
(physically or in terms of legal authority) across agencies multiple times during the course of a
single term of punishment. These handovers provide repeated opportunities for administrative
failures or for priorities to shift. Thus, a fine imposed by a judge to affect deterrence and express
social outrage may be forgiven by another agency either due to lack of resources for collection or
because it is now viewed as an impediment to rehabilitation.
       The model in the previous suggestion proposes to use fines as a first line of defense with
another system as backup. In equilibrium, if the system can sort offenders into different eventual
punishments, the fine can be an important part of an efficient sanctioning system. Fines may




                                                                                                     22
deter and punish many offenders. But the model takes seriously those offenders for whom the
first line of defense is insufficient. After a certain record of failure, courts will tailor a solution.15
        In order to maintain this equilibrium, the system must be keep people from strategically
appearing undeterrable to the court in order to have the obligation reduced. This means that
whatever tailored program is developed for those who are not deterred by the sanctioning scheme
must produces further obligations to government (such as garnished wages or additional
appointments to keep) that those who are deterrable will find much more noxious than simply
paying the fine. This condition requires that the tailored program cannot be overly generous in
terms of writing down the financial obligations for those who cannot pay without adding other
requirements of participants. Specialized courts, day reporting centers, and comprehensive pre-
release programs provide examples of how these programs can be structured.
        One negative possibility is that the ‚Äúthicket‚Äù entered after nonpayment of a fine could be
more costly to society than the system it replaces. For example, if incarceration is used as a
threat to collect fines, then the use of incarceration could logically increase. Murphy (2009)
describes how punishment for process crimes ‚Äì offenses ‚Äúagainst the machinery of justice itself‚Äù
‚Äì can result in substantial criminal penalties that in some cases are more serious than the initial
conduct under investigation. This is an important caution. At the same time, for many, the
thicket need not be complicated or extensive. As the Snohomish County experience
demonstrates, regular follow-up can do a lot to support collection, suggesting that many
offenders are simply disorganized.
        What are the primary threats to the equilibrium envisioned in the model? The single
most important requirement to achieve expanded use of fines is that voters, judges, and court
administrators believe that fines are efficient, that fines have a punitive and deterrent impact, that
fines are regularly collected, and that people who don't pay fines face very serious consequences.
Only if voters, judges and court administrators believe all these things will fines be used on a
regular basis, and resources allocated to developing them further. Of these beliefs, the most
complicated is the belief in efficiency. Fines have been badly overpromised, suggesting that they
are almost perfectly efficient (Becker 1968), while the data suggest that at best, the net loss in

15
          Note that the tailored solution is not terribly different from how the current system
works in the cases in which the sanction is not simply ignored. Many prisoner reentry programs
are designed to work out individualized solutions to accumulated fines and debts. In the model,
this tailored solution is purposeful and is designed to maintain the equilibrium.
                                                                                                       23
fine enforcement (ignoring the economic cost of the crime) is, in the absolute best case, on the
order of at least 20%.
        Combined with the overpromising is the fact that many people think that fines are only
efficient if fine collection covers its own cost, narrowly defined. Those who think about
efficiency without considering opportunity cost will only want to impose fines on wealthy white
collar defendants and traffic violators. Court administrators will enthusiastically fight off any
attempt to broaden the use of fines when expanding the usage is likely to radically reduce
efficiency rates (defined from their perspective) and the overall statistics for their court.
        Finally, fines will not work as standalone mechanisms. The substantial majority of those
punished with fines will pay them or work them off but a significant minority will ‚Äúcrash‚Äù
through the system and enter the thicket. Fines cannot be successfully implemented without
some acknowledgment of this, and a well-developed backup system. For the lowest level
offenses, the backup can be largely administrative (at least until several repeat offenses ensue or
compliance is unacceptably low). This could involve adopting a traffic offense-like system for
nuisance offenses. For more serious offending, the backup could involve incarceration (the
‚Äúmiracle of the cells‚Äù) or some set of tailored and/or graduated consequences sufficient to
maintain the equilibrium.
        At this time, the research literature does not provide sufficient guidance to allow for
detailed consideration of institutional design. The single most important gap in our knowledge
about fines is an understanding of their real deterrent power. A stronger empirical base is
necessary for informing judgments about the efficiency of fines for particular offenders and
particular offenses. Because of the expected heterogeneity, identifying the views at the policy-
relevant margins for different offenses and different offender types is the particular research
challenge. In light of the potential gains from getting the institutional design right, this is a high
priority.

Recovery rate ranges for Pima County, Phoenix Municipal, Tucson Municipal and Maricopa County are from Sichel (1982) but are
only speculative. It is important to note that 2 Arizona courts, Maricopa County Superior and Pima County Superior, both of which
deal exclusively with felonies (no traffic offenses) have expenditures 33 and 89 times total fine collections, respectively.
