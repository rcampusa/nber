Stock Volatility and the Great Depression

                                            ABSTRACT

Stock return volatility during the Great Depression has been labeled a “volatility puzzle” because the
standard deviation of stock returns was two to three times higher than any other period in American
history (Officer, 1973; Wilson, Sylla, and Jones; 1990). We investigate the “volatility puzzle” using
a new series of building permits, a forward-looking measure of economic activity. Our results suggest
that the volatility of building permit growth largely explains the high level of stock volatility during
the Great Depression. Markets factored in the possibility of a forthcoming economic disaster.

                                     Introduction
The annualized standard deviation of US stock returns during the Great Depression
reached as high as 60 percent per annum, two to three times higher than any other
period in American financial history. Figure 1 shows that stock return volatility
during the Great Depression stands out even when compared to the volatility of
market returns over a time span of more than 200 years (1802-2016) that includes
the Great Recession. The high level and persistence of stock volatility during the
Great Depression led Officer (1973) and Wilson, Sylla, and Jones (1990) to identify
the period as a “volatility puzzle.” 1 Shiller (1981) suggested that the “excessive
volatility” of stock prices might be the result of a “Peso problem” or irrational behavior
by investors. Merton (1985) and Schwert (1989) argued that the high levels of stock
volatility during the Great Depression might be explained by the rise of communism
that threatened the capitalist system. Romer (1990) found that stock volatility, a
measure of economic uncertainty, dramatically increased following the 1929 crash.
The large rise in the variability of stock returns led to a decline in the consumption
of durable goods and played an important role in the onset of the Great Depression.
    We break new ground in studying the “volatility puzzle” of the Great Depression
by testing whether building permits can explain movements in stock volatility during
the period 1928-1938. Our interest in building permits as a predictor of stock
volatility is driven by a couple of factors. First, a new wave of literature in economics
has argued that the collapse of the housing and construction industries in the late
1920s and early 1930s played an important role in the onset and severity of the Great
Depression (Brocker and Hanes, 2014; Gjertstad and Smith, 2009; Goetzmann, 2016;
Goetzmann and Newman, 2010; Snowden, White, and Fishback, 2014). Second,
building permits are well-known to academic and professional forecasters to be a
forward-looking indicator of aggregate economic activity (Stock and Watson, 1993;



1Officer (1973) only had aggregate stock market data starting in the mid-1920s. Wilson,
Sylla, and Jones (1990) had aggregate stock market data going back to the nineteenth
century.

Leamer, 2007; 2009; 2015). Therefore, we use the volatility of building permit growth
as a growth option and a proxy for macroeconomic uncertainty during the Great
Depression.2
   We supplement the building permit series with new data to examine the role of
economic, financial, and political factors in predicting monthly US stock volatility for
the period 1928-1938. First, we employ Graham, Leary, and Roberts’ (2015) measure
of financial leverage that is taken from the Moody’s Manuals. Their series allows us
to directly control for a fundamental explanatory variable of stock volatility. Second,
we use a new series of junk bond yield spreads to test the importance of forward-
looking interest rates in forecasting stock volatility.        3   Other forward-looking
indicators such as the volatility of truck production, bank lending, and the ratio of
failed bank deposits to total deposits are used as explanatory variables to predict the
standard deviation of stock returns. Third, we hand-collect data on important
political events to construct a new database of political uncertainty. Measures of
political conflict are used to test the hypothesis that the high levels of stock volatility
during the Great Depression were driven by the rise of communism that threatened
the future of market capitalism (Merton, 1985; Schwert, 1989). We convert Banks’
(1976) annual database on riots, assassinations, anti-government demonstrations,
and general strikes into a monthly measure to examine the relationship between
stock volatility and political uncertainty.
   The empirical analysis suggests that stock volatility during the Great Depression
can largely be explained by two variables: (1) financial leverage; and (2) the volatility
of building permit growth. The two-variable specification along with historical lags of
stock volatility account for about 73 percent of the movements in stock volatility for
the entire sample period 1928-1938. Figure 2 shows that the volatility of building


   2  Economic uncertainty can lead firms to reduce or eliminate dividend payments to
shareholders. Lower expected dividend income from equity investments decreases aggregate
consumption in some disaster models of asset pricing (e.g. Barro, 2006; Gabaix, 2012).
3 It is well-known in the forecasting literature that interest rate spreads are important

leading indicators of economic downturns (see e.g. Stock and Watson, 1993; Estrella and
Mishkin, 1998).

                                              2
permit growth leads and predicts stock volatility for much of the period. The simple
model of stock volatility predicts the standard deviation of stock returns even better
if we limit the sample period to just the Great Depression as defined by NBER
recession dates. The R-squared for the Great Depression period is 85 percent.
    The empirical results are robust to many different specifications. Standard
macroeconomic and credit channel variables do not significantly predict stock return
volatility during the Great Depression except for the volatility of truck production
(trucks are often used by the construction industry to help construct buildings).
Furthermore, the empirical results from the leverage and building permit
specification are robust to expanding the sample period from 1926 (when the CRSP
data begin) to 1961 when the monthly building permit series is no longer available.
Overall, we argue that the volatility puzzle of the Great Depression is largely solved
by incorporating building permits, a forward-looking measure of aggregate economic
activity, into a simple model of stock volatility.4
    The paper begins with a discussion of the economic and financial data. This is
followed by the empirical analysis of stock volatility. We then test the robustness of
the baseline specifications. The empirical analysis concludes with a study of the role
of economic and financial factors in predicting the volatility of building permit
growth. The final section discusses the implications of the results and makes
suggestions for future research.


                                 I.     Building Permits
We use the value of building permits, “Permits”, as a forward-looking indicator of
economic activity. Building permits must be filed with local authorities before any
construction can take place. The construction data are taken from various issues of
Dun and Bradstreet’s Review, a well-known monthly business and financial
publication in the 1920s and 1930s. The forward-looking measure of economic activity
is assembled from building inspector reports collected by the F.W. Dodge Division, a

4Leamer (2015, p. 43) argues that “housing is the single most critical part of the U.S. business
cycle, certainly in predictive sense and, I believe, also in a causal sense.”

McGraw-Hill Information Systems Company. F.W. Dodge also provided their data to
the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The value of building permits is based on the
cost of new commercial and residential buildings for 215 cities across the US.
      Figure 3 plots the value of building permits from 1928-1938.5 At the beginning of
the sample period, building permits rose to a value of almost $350 million and then
declined to $213 million by the start of 1929. Building permits increased to nearly
$229 million in February, and to $372 million in March 1929. In April 1929, building
permits rose to a level of almost $480 million. The rise represents a 62 percent
increase over the previous year. The forward-looking economic measure fell to $260
million in May and to $218 million in June. One month before the Great Crash in
October 1929, the value of building permits declined to $183 million. The value of
building permits fell by more than 60 percent between April and September 1929.
The forward-looking construction measure remained quite low for the remainder of
the sample period except for a couple of spikes at the end of the sample period.
      The building permit spike in 1929 appears to be explained, in part, by an increase
in the number of new filings for large buildings and skyscrapers in New York City.
In Manhattan, 14 skyscrapers of 30 stories or higher were filed with the city in 1928.
The number of skyscraper building permits increased to 52 in 1929 with most of the
activity taking place at the beginning of the year.6 Figure 3 shows that the value of
building permits in New York City rose dramatically from $29.6 million in January
1929 to more than $259.1 million in April. New York City building permits then
abruptly fell to a value of $37.1 million in June. The large rise in building permits
during 1929 disappears if New York City filings are removed from the aggregate
series.
          The 1928-29 New York “skyscraper boom” saw the construction and completion
of the Waldorf-Astoria and the Empire State Building (Barr, 2010). The latter was
finished at half the expected cost of $25 million in 1931 because of the precipitous
decline in economic activity from the Great Depression. Other (less high profile)

skyscrapers included the National City Bank Building that is located at 55 Wall
Street between Hanover and William Streets. Overall, only 19 of the 52 planned
skyscrapers in 1929 were ever built as construction spending tanked with the onset
of the Great Depression (Gray, 2009).7 Many builders decided not to exercise their
option (building permit) to build a skyscraper. Alternatively, some entrepreneurs
exercised only a fraction of their option by building a cheaper skyscraper as shown by
the Empire State Building. Another alternative was to delay construction of the
skyscraper because of poor economic conditions. The National City Bank Building,
for example, was not completed until the 1940s. The historical record suggests that
the volatility of building permit growth is a forward-looking measure of the
uncertainty of a growth option.8


                                        II.       Data
We use monthly data from January 1928 to December 1938 for the empirical analysis.
We combine various sources to assemble a new database with economic, financial,
and political variables to explain movements in stock volatility during the Great
Depression.9 For stock volatility, we calculate the monthly sample standard deviation
of stock returns from daily data using CRSP.10 Panel A of Figure 4 shows the market
capitalization of aggregate equity returns during the period 1928-1938. The market
collapses with the Great Crash of 1929 and bottoms out in late 1932.
Leverage Data.      The data on the market value of corporate leverage are taken
from Graham, Leary, and Roberts (2015). The market value of leverage is calculated
as Debt/(Debt + Market Equity) for non-financial firms. We transform the annual
series of financial leverage into a monthly series by linear interpolation for the period
1928:M1-1938:M12. The measures of book and market leverage reported by Graham,

(2010) and Barr, Mizrach, and Mundra (2015) find that skyscraper height does not Ganger-

Leary, and Roberts (2015) are reproduced in Panel B of Figure 4.11 Book Leverage is
relatively stable over the sample period compared to Market Leverage which shows
large changes during the Great Depression (shaded area).12
Economic and Financial Data.               We use a bank lending measure collected by
the Federal Reserve and an index of new truck production as forward-looking
economic indicators that might predict stock volatility.13 Two yield spread measures
are employed for the empirical analysis. First, the interest-rate differential between
AAA corporate bonds and commercial paper is used to predict stock volatility. Then
a junk bond yield spread for the interwar period constructed by Basile, Kang, Landon-
Lane, and Rockoff (forthcoming) is incorporated into the baseline regression models.
Data on coincident economic variables are also used to assess the importance of real
factors in forecasting stock volatility. We utilize the Federal Reserve’s series on retail
sales and industrial production (IP) to estimate the volatility of the real sector. The
ratio of failed deposits to total deposits is a measure of financial distress/credit
channel (Anari, Kolari, and Mason, 2005). Data on building contracts, manufacturing
hours, and truck production are from the NBER Macroeconomic History Database.
Political Data.      We construct a monthly version of Banks’ (1976) annual Cross-
Polity Time-Series for the US. The political database is widely used in economics,
political science, and other social sciences. The annual database is converted into a
monthly one using Banks’ original sources and the search engine for the ProQuest
Historical New York Times.14 We follow the previous literature (e.g. Passarelli and
Tabellini, forthcoming; Funke, Schularick and Trebesch, 2016) in our selection of
conflict variables that proxy for political uncertainty. The four variables are: (1) Anti-
Government Demonstrations; (2) Assassinations; (3) General Strikes; and (4) Riots. An
Anti-Government Demonstration is any peaceful public gathering of at least 100

which increased corporate bond prices and reduced debt overhang, see Kroszner (1998).

Market Leverage.

System.

people for the primary purpose of displaying or voicing their opposition to government
policies or authority (excluding anti-foreign nature demonstrations). The number of
Assassinations is defined as a politically-motivated murder or attempted murder of a
high government official or politician. A General Strike is a strike of 1,000 or more
industrial or service workers that involves more than one employer and targets
national government policies or authority. Finally, a Riot is a violent demonstration
or clash of more than 100 citizens involving the use of physical force.15 The specific
events data are then summed up to form an aggregate “Politics” variable:


     Politics = Assassinations + Anti-Govt. Demonstrations + General Strikes + Riots


      The descriptive statistics are reported in Table 1. The volatility of the economic
and financial times series are much less for the entire sample period (Panel A)
compared to the Great Depression (Panel B). Political variables are also more volatile
during the Great Depression, which is consistent with the hypothesis that political
conflict is correlated with the poor economic conditions of the Great Depression.
Figure 5 contains panels that show the monthly frequency for each of the different
measures of political conflict. Assassinations were quite rare with only two instances
in the sample. The most frequent events were Anti-Government Demonstrations,
followed by Riots and General Strikes. Riots and Anti-Government Demonstrations
also display greater frequency during the Great Depression sub-period.


                                III.   Empirical Strategy
The first step in our empirical analysis is to extract a measure of volatility from the
raw data. We estimate GARCH (1,1) models to construct estimates of the one-step
ahead conditional standard deviation for several of the independent variables in the
empirical analysis. To control for persistence in the mean of each series, we employ
12 lags of the dependent variable in the mean equation and estimate the system by

Maximum Likelihood methods. We then proceed with our baseline empirical analysis
of the determinants of stock volatility during the Great Depression. The model can
be written as follows:


                            11        𝑃                         𝑃

        𝑆𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑘 𝑉𝑜𝑙𝑡 = 𝛽0 + ∑ 𝐷𝑚 + ∑ 𝛽1,𝑝 ∙ 𝑆𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑘 𝑉𝑜𝑙𝑡−𝑝 + ∑ 𝛽2,𝑝 ∙ 𝐿𝑒𝑣𝑡−𝑝
                           𝑚=1       𝑝=1                       𝑝=1
                            𝑃                         𝑃                          (1)
                         + ∑ 𝛽3,𝑝 ∙ 𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑚𝑖𝑡 𝑉𝑜𝑙𝑡−𝑝 + ∑ 𝛽4,𝑝 ∙ 𝑃𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑠𝑡−𝑝 + 𝜀𝑡
                           𝑝=1                       𝑝=1



where Stock Vol is our measure of stock market volatility (standard deviation of stock
returns), Dm is a set of seasonal monthly dummies, Lev is the market value of
aggregate corporate leverage, Permit Vol is the volatility of building permit growth
estimated from a GARCH(1,1) model, and Politics is the sum of the four measures of
political conflict. A lag length of P is chosen based on the Akaike Information
Criterion (AIC). For the baseline sample (1928:M1–1938:M12), the AIC selected a lag
length of seven. We estimate the following OLS regression models using robust
standard errors:


   1.     Autoregressive Model: a model that includes only the lags of stock
          volatility (Stock Vol) and seasonal dummies to measure how much of
          current volatility can be explained by historical volatility.
   2.     Pure Leverage Model: a model that adds the lags of financial leverage
          (Lev) to the initial Autoregressive Model. Financial leverage is widely
          considered a fundamental determinant of stock volatility.
   3.     Economic Model: a model focusing on the economic determinants of
          volatility. The economic specification includes financial leverage and the
          volatility of building permit growth (Permit Vol), a forward-looking
          measure of economic activity. We employ the volatility of building permit
          growth (as opposed to the volatility of the level of building permits) given


                                              8
           that the dependent variable is stock return volatility rather than stock price
           volatility.16
     4.    Political Model: a model that includes financial leverage and the political
           determinants of stock volatility to test the political uncertainty hypothesis.
     5.    Joint Economic-Political Model: a model combining the variables from
           the Economic and Political models.


     We follow several studies (e.g. Schwert,1989; Flannery and Protopapadakis, 2002;
Elder, Miao and Ramchander, 2012; Fatum, Hutchinson and Wu, 2012), that assess
models of financial volatility by comparing the R-squared of different specifications.
For example, the Economic Model tests the hypothesis that the volatility of the
growth rate of building permits predicts stock volatility. If the forward-looking
measure of economic activity is statistically significant and the R-squared for the
model increases, the result might suggest that economic factors were important for
explaining the high levels of stock volatility during the period 1928-1938. More
importantly, if the R-squared of the building permit specification is even higher
during the Great Depression subsample, then the finding would provide additional
evidence that markets were concerned about a forthcoming economic disaster.


                                   IV.    Results
A. Stock Volatility: Full Sample Period
Table 2 shows the results for the full sample period, 1928-1938. Column 1 reports
the Autoregressive Model. Seven lags of historical volatility explain 60 percent of the
standard deviation of stock volatility for the period 1928-1938. We next control for
financial leverage. A higher ratio of the book value of debt relative to the market
value of equity means that it is more difficult for the firm to pay off its debt



16In the forthcoming empirical analysis, we also tested whether the volatility of building
permits could predict stock volatility. The level of the commercial and residential
construction variable did not predict stock volatility. The results are available from the
authors by request.

                                            9
obligations. Distressed firms or companies with a greater likelihood of default (high
indebtedness) also mechanically have higher stock return volatility. Seven lags of
leverage are then added to the baseline autoregressive specification. Column 2 shows
that leverage is statistically significant at the one percent level. Leverage increases
the explanatory power of the model from 60 to 68 percent.
     The results of the forward-looking economic model appear in Column 3 of Table
2. The F-statistics for the volatility of building permit growth is significant at the one
percent level. The building permit specification increases the R-squared by five
percentage points to 73 percent. We follow-up the forward-looking economic model
with a political model of stock volatility. The empirical analysis is reported in Column
4. The results show that the aggregate political measure is not significant at
conventional levels. 17 The R-squared of the political measure only increases the fit of
the model by three percentage points to 69 percent relative to the baseline model of
historical lags of stock volatility and financial leverage. This is somewhat surprising
given that some political events in the sample period were quite notable and widely
reported in the press. For example, Anton Cermak, the Mayor of Chicago, was
murdered in February 1933 even though the hit targeted President Franklin D.
Roosevelt.18 Senator Huey Long was killed in a shooting in September 1935, a year
before the outspoken congressman planned to run for President of the United States
against FDR.19
     Finally, we combine the forward-looking economic model with the political
specification in Column 5. The volatility of building permits remains statistically
significant at the one percent level while the aggregate political variable is not



17 Voth (2002) finds that political variables explain a significant fraction of stock volatility
using stock market data for a sample of 10 countries during the period 1919-1938. His
analysis does not control for leverage or the volatility of building permits.
18 The front-page headlines of the New York Times read “Cermak in Critical Condition at

Hospital; ‘Glad It Was I, Not You,’ He Tells Roosevelt.” New York Times, February 16th, 1933.
19 We also tested whether the Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) Index constructed by

Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2016) could predict stock volatility during the Great Depression
and 1930s. The EPU variable was not statistically significant. The results are available from
the authors by request.

                                              10
significant at the five or ten percent level.20 The R-squared rises to 74 percent in the
economic and political model of stock volatility. The forward-looking building permit
variable is statistically significant in all specifications. Overall, the results suggest
that the volatility of building permits had a larger impact on stock volatility than
political factors.
     The baseline results for the full sample period are then subjected to a battery of
robustness checks. We test whether the volatility of retail sales, industrial
production, inflation, value of construction contract growth, manufacturing hours,
truck production growth, and the volatility of the growth rate of manufacturing hours
can predict stock volatility. 21 The empirical results reported in Table 3 show that
economic variables cannot predict stock volatility except for the volatility of truck
production growth. This is not surprising given that trucks are often used to transport
materials to help build new commercial and residential structures.
     Table 4 presents the empirical results of adding money and credit variables to
the baseline regression of leverage and the volatility of building permit growth. 22 The
volatility of M2 money growth, the interest-rate differential between Junk bonds and
AAA corporate bonds, the spread between AAA corporate bonds and prime
commercial paper, and the volatility of the growth rate of bank loans cannot predict
stock volatility. The ratio of failed bank deposits to total bank deposits, a measure of
financial distress, does not forecast the standard deviation of stock returns. The
additional money and credit variables are not statistically significant in the stock
volatility regressions. The volatility of building permit growth remains significant in
all specifications.




20 We also constructed another measure of political uncertainty by aggregating the number
of times the words communist(s), communism, socialist(s), and socialism appeared each
month in the New York Times. The political variable did not significantly predict stock
volatility for the entire sample period or the Great Depression period as defined by NBER
recession dates.
21 Schwert (1989) uses the volatility of industrial production, money growth, interest rates,

and inflation as economic variables to explain stock volatility.
22 For a discussion of financial factors during the Great Depression, see Calomiris (1993).


                                             11
      We next assess the explanatory power of the Economic Model by examining
the residuals from a stock volatility regression that includes only financial leverage
and the volatility of building permit growth (i.e., the model excludes historical lags of
stock volatility). 23 Panel A of Figure 6 shows the residual series along with 95
percent confidence intervals. The two-variable model predicts stock volatility quite
well given the high level and persistence of the standard deviation of stock returns
during the late 1920s and 1930s. The R-squared is about 61 percent for the two-
variable specification. 24 There are only two outliers in the residual graph that are
outside of the 95 percent confidence intervals. The first outlier is the largest stock
volatility spike in US financial history. Even though the regression residual of the
dramatic rise in stock volatility during 1929 is outside the 95 percent confidence
bands, the two-variable regression model explains more than 50 percent of the
volatility spike. The simple regression model significantly reduces the amplitude of
the largest stock volatility spike in US history to a much lower level.
      The stock volatility model also does a good job at predicting the second largest
volatility spike in US history that occurred during the “recession within the Great
Depression” of 1937-38. The regression residual of the 1937-38 downturn is just
outside the 95 percent confidence intervals shown in Panel A of Figure 6. Finally,
we run a 24-month rolling regression using only lags of leverage and the volatility of
building permit growth as explanatory variables. Figure 7 reports the R-squared for
the rolling regressions using the aggregate building permit series and the aggregate
building permit series excluding New York City. The R-squared of the rolling
regression for the aggregate permit series is particularly high during the Great
Depression, rising to more than 90 percent as the moving window begins to include
data at the onset of the Great Depression. The R-squared during the Great
Depression is lower if the building permit series for New York City is not included in



23 The regression used to compute the residual series also contains monthly seasonal dummy
variables.

Appendix.

the empirical analysis. Following the Great Depression, the statistical fit of the two
rolling regressions is less sensitive to the building series employed for the empirical
analysis. The results suggest that the boom in New York City “skyscraper permits”
is important for predicting the onset of the Great Depression. However, the volatility
of building permit growth remains a statistically significant predictor of stock
volatility even if the New York City building permits are removed from the analysis.
      Finally, we examine whether financial leverage and the volatility of building
permit growth can predict stock volatility over the period 1926–1961. The regression
starts in January 1926 when CRSP and financial leverage data become available. The
estimation finishes in September 1961 when the NBER Macrohistory database
stopped reporting the building permit series. Table 5 reports the empirical results
of the stock volatility model. Column 3, which presents the results of the Economic
Model, shows that leverage and the volatility of building permit growth are
statistically significant at the 1 and 1.5 percent levels, respectively, over the 36-year
period. Overall, we interpret the residual analysis and rolling regressions as strong
evidence that the volatility of building permit growth largely explains the “volatility
puzzle” of the Great Depression.


B. Stock Volatility: The Great Depression Sub-sample
The rolling regressions suggest that the volatility of building permit growth was
especially important for forecasting the onset of the Great Depression and the largest
stock volatility spikes in US history. 25 Figure 8 shows that the volatility of the
growth rate of building permits leads the Great Crash of 1929, the large rise in stock
volatility, and the onset of the Great Depression.26




25 On the real estate dynamics during the 1920s, see Brocker and Hanes (2014); Snowden,
White, and Fishback (2014); and White (1994, 2014). Goetzmann and Newman (2010) and
Goetzmann (2016) also discuss the building boom of the early 1920s and its collapse.
26 The finding is broadly similar to the well-known relationship between housing starts and

the recent downturn of 2007-09 (Gjerstad and Smith, 2014; Leamer, 2015).

                                            13
     Table 6 reports the empirical results from the Great Depression period as defined
by the NBER (1929:M8–1933:M3). 27 Columns 1 and 2 report the results for the
autoregressive and leverage models, respectively. Both the historical lags of volatility
and leverage are statistically significant. Adding leverage to the historical lag model
increases the R-squared from 42 to 63 percent. Column 3 shows the results for the
economic model. The volatility of building permits is once again statistically
significant at the one percent level. The R-squared strikingly rises 22 percentage
points to a value of 85 percent when the building permit variable is added to the
model. An interesting finding in Column (3) is that the sign on the lags of stock
volatility changes from positive and statistically significant in Columns (1) and (2) to
negative and statistically significant in Column (3). This suggests that the building
permit variable “crowds out” historical lags of stock volatility.28 In other words, the
building permit variable is a more powerful predictor of stock volatility than
historical lags of stock volatility during the Great Depression. To address the negative
coefficient on historical lags of stock volatility, we also report the regression results
using the natural logarithm of stock volatility in Column (3a). Again, the empirical
results confirm the baseline results that the volatility of building permit growth is an
important predictor of stock volatility.
     Column 4 reports the political model of stock volatility during the Great
Depression. The political uncertainty variable is not significant at conventional
levels. The R-squared rises from 63 percent in Column 2 to 68 percent in the political
specification. Column 5 of Table 6 presents the empirical results of the Great
Depression period for the economic-political model. The volatility of building permit
growth is statistically significant at the one percent level, while the political conflict
variable is not significant at conventional levels. The R-squared rises to 88 percent in
the economic-political model. The results from the Great Depression sub-sample




27The AIC selected a lag length of seven for the Great Depression period.
28The result also suggests that the building permit variable is multi-collinear with lags of
historical volatility.

                                            14
period suggest that the volatility of building permit growth predicts stock volatility
even better under more severe economic conditions.29
     We examine the regression residuals for the Great Depression sub-sample. Panel
B of Figure 6 presents the regression residuals calculated from a regression of stock
volatility on lags of financial leverage and the volatility of building permit growth
(once again, the model excludes lags of historical volatility). The R-squared for the
residual regression is almost 72 percent.30 The regression residuals are shown with
95 percent confidence intervals, indicating that the regression residuals are not
statistically significant except for one month in 1931. The Great Depression sub-
sample provides even stronger evidence that the volatility of building permit growth
largely explains the “stock volatility puzzle” of the Great Depression. 31 Given the
importance of the construction measure in forecasting stock volatility during the
Great Depression, a natural follow-up question is: what factors explain the volatility
of building permits? We examine this issue in the next section.


C. What drives the Volatility of Building Permit Growth?
We estimate several regressions to examine the factors that predict the volatility of
building permit growth for the sample period 1928-1938. The dependent variable for
the regressions is the conditional standard deviation of the growth rate of building
permits (Permit Vol). We consider three possible channels that could drive the
volatility of the growth rate of building permits: (1) Real Channel (retail sales
volatility and the volatility of truck production growth); (2) Monetary Channel (money


29 Robustness checks also show that the volatility of truck production growth is not a
significant predictor of stock volatility for the Great Depression sub-sample, even though it
is significant in the full sample. The results are available from the authors upon request.
30 We do not include monthly seasonal dummy variables in the Great Depression sub-sample

given the short time period.
31 As an additional robustness check, we replaced our stock volatility measure (the standard

deviation of monthly stock returns calculated from daily returns) with the historical News-
Implied Volatility Index (NVIX) constructed by Manela and Moreira (2017). The volatility of
the growth rate of building permits is also a significant predictor of implied volatility as
proxied by the NVIX for the Great Depression sub-sample, but not for the full sample period.
These results are available from the authors upon request.

                                             15
growth volatility); and the (3) Credit Channel (Junk Bond -AAA Corporate Bond; AAA
Corporate Bond-Prime Commercial Paper Spread; Volatility of bank loan growth).
The volatility of each variable is estimated using a standard GARCH(1,1) model with
robust standard errors, except for the two credit spreads which are included directly
in the model as in the previous literature.32 A lag length of 7 is employed for each
independent variable. We regress the volatility of the growth rate of building permits
on each of the three channels.
         The empirical results are reported in Table 7. Column 1 shows the regression
using only historical lags of the volatility of building permit growth. The F-stat for
the historical lags of building permit growth volatility is significant at the ten percent
level, and the R-squared is only 24 percent for the baseline regression. Next, we add
the volatility of retail sales to the baseline specification (Column 2). The volatility of
retail sales is not statistically significant at conventional levels. Historical lags of the
volatility of the growth rate of building permits are also not statistically significant
at the five or ten percent level. The R-squared for the predictive regression model is
27 percent.
      We next replace the volatility of the growth rate of retail sales with the volatility
of truck production growth. Column 3 reports that truck production growth volatility
predicts the volatility of building permit growth at the 10 percent level of significance.
The R-squared for the regression is 40 percent for the truck specification. Column 4
presents the results for the monetary model. The volatility of monetary growth (M2)
can predict the volatility of building permit growth at the five percent level. The R-
squared is 26 percent and is only marginally higher than the baseline specifications
that include historical lags of building permit volatility.
      The results for the credit channel models are presented in Columns 5, 6, and 7. In
the junk bond specification, both the historical lags of the dependent variable and the
credit measure are not significant at conventional levels. The R-squared for the high-
risk credit channel model is 26 percent. As for the interest-rate differential between


32   See for instance, Schwert (1989) and Estrella and Mishkin (1998).

                                               16
corporate bonds and commercial paper, the yield spread does not predict the building
permit variable as shown in Column 6. The R-squared for the AAA corporate and
commercial paper model is 29 percent. Column 7 presents the results of the bank loan
specification. The volatility of bank lending growth does not significantly predict the
volatility of building permit growth. Finally, we combine the independent variables
from the monetary model, the real sector specification, and the credit channel
regressions. The results of the fully specified model appear in Column 6. The
historical lags of building permit growth volatility and the other variables are not
statistically significant with the exception of the truck variable (that is related to
building construction as discussed earlier). The truck variable is significant at the 10
percent level and the R-squared is 62 percent for the kitchen sink model that includes
all six variables. The all-channel model also suggests that the volatility of money
growth is not robust in predicting the volatility of building permit growth. Overall,
we find little evidence that standard economic and financial variables can predict the
volatility of the growth rate of building permits.


                           V.     Concluding Remarks
What economic factors explain stock volatility during the Great Depression? We
believe that this question is largely resolved by incorporating the volatility of building
permit growth into a simple model of stock volatility. The forward-looking measure
is supplemented with new data on financial leverage and political uncertainty. The
volatility of building permit growth predicts a significant portion of stock volatility
for the entire sample period. The forward-looking measure of economic activity
predicts stock volatility even better during the Great Depression as defined by NBER
recession dates. This is shown by an R-squared of 85 percent for a simple two-variable
model of stock volatility (along with historical lags of stock volatility). Moreover, even
in a model without historical lags of stock volatility, building permit growth and
financial leverage predict stock volatility with an R-squared of over 70 percent.
Overall, we find evidence that the leverage and building permit specification can



                                           17
predict the largest stock volatility spikes in US financial history, and that the results
are robust to a variety of different specifications.
   Given the importance of the volatility of building permits, we explored the
determinants of the volatility of building permit growth. We found weak evidence
that standard economic and financial measures can forecast the volatility of the
growth option. In sum, our analysis suggests that future research might test whether
forward-looking economic measures such as building permits or housing starts have
greater explanatory power for predicting stock volatility during a period of severe
economic and financial stress. It might be particularly interesting to see if the
volatility of building permit growth can forecast stock volatility in other turbulent
periods such as the 2008 Great Recession where housing played an important role.

The Autoregressive Model contains 7 lags (Akaike-selected) of the standard deviation of stock returns. The Pure Leverage Model augments
the Autoregressive Model with 7 lags of Lev (Market Leverage). The Economic Model adds Permit Vol (estimated Volatility of Building
Permits Growth Rate) to the Pure Leverage Model. The Political Model combines the Pure Leverage Model with 7 lags of Lev (Market
Leverage) and 7 lags of Politics (Sum of the following political events that proxy for Political Uncertainty: Assassinations, General Strikes,
Riots, and Anti-Government Demonstrations). The Economic-Political Joint Model adds the variables from the Economic and Political
Models. All specifications include seasonal monthly dummies. Significance levels: * p<0.10, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01.

Notes: The larger shaded area is the Great Depression period as defined by the NBER recession dates.
The second shaded area is the NBER-defined 1937-38 recession. The data on building permits are
taken from various issues of Dun & Bradstreet’s Review. The stock data are taken from CRSP. Stock
volatility is obtained by calculating the monthly standard deviation from daily stock returns. The
volatility of the growth rate of building permits is estimated using a standard GARCH(1,1) model as
described in the data section.

Notes: The first darker shaded area represents the period of the Great Depression as defined by the
NBER. The largest spikes registered in the All Cities Building Permits time series are in March and

Notes: The darker shaded area in both graphs represents the Great Depression as defined by the
NBER. In Panel A, the Aggregate Market Value of Equity (in Million USD) is the sum of market values
for all CRSP Securities, where the market value is calculated as the product of the outstanding number
of shares and the price of each security. In Panel B, the Market Value of Leverage is defined as Debt /
(Debt + Market Value of Equity) and the Book Value of Leverage is defined as (Total Debt / Total
Assets). Both measures of corporate leverage are taken from Graham, Leary, and Roberts (2015).

Notes: The figures show the original time series of stock volatility (continuous blue line) and stock
volatility regression residuals (dashed red line) after controlling for two variables: financial leverage
(Lev) and the volatility of the growth rate of building permits (Permit Vol). The residuals in Panel A
are constructed from a regression of stock volatility on financial leverage, the volatility of building
permit growth, and a set of seasonal monthly dummies. The residuals shown in Panel B are calculated
from a regression of stock volatility on financial leverage and the volatility of building permit growth
during the Great Depression as defined by the NBER.

Notes: The figures show the R-squared values for rolling 24-month window regressions of Stock
Volatility on lags of financial leverage (Lev) and volatility of building permit growth (Permit Vol). The
only difference between panels A and B is that the time series used to calculate Permit Vol in Panel
B subtracts New York City permits from the original 215 aggregate permits series used in Panel A.
The two vertical black lines indicate NBER recession dates of the Great Depression.

                                Appendix A. Data Sources

A.1. Political Uncertainty Data: Monthly Reconstruction of the Banks (1976) Dataset

       We construct a US-monthly version of the classical Cross-Polity Time-Series annual
dataset originally collected by Banks (1976) for more than 160 countries. The data set is
widely used in political science, economics, as well as other social sciences. The Cross-Polity
Times Series is currently updated every year by Databanks International.33 We used Banks’
(1976) original sources to convert his annual database into a monthly measure for the
following types of political events: anti-government demonstrations, assassinations, general
strikes, and riots. Specifically, we primarily relied on the search engine for the New York
Times to pinpoint the monthly date of anti-government demonstrations, assassinations,
general strikes and riots.

A.2. Housing Data: US Aggregate and City-Level Building Permits Value

        Data are taken from various issues of the Bradstreet & Dun’s Review. The aggregated
series is the sum of city-level data. The index is based on a consistent set of 215 cities for
period 1928-1938.

A.3. Stock Exchange Volatility Data

       We follow Schwert (1989) and calculate stock volatility as the sample standard
deviation of the S&P index returns aggregated monthly from daily data.

A.4. Market Value of Corporate Leverage Data

        The market value of leverage is taken from Graham, Leary, and Roberts (2015). Their
market value of leverage is calculated as (Debt / Debt + Market Equity) for non-financial
firms. We transform their data from annual to monthly for the period 1920:M1-1938:M12 by
linear interpolation.

A.5. Macroeconomic Time Series

      All aggregate time series used in our analysis were downloaded from Federal Reserve
Bank of St. Louis’s (FRED) database unless otherwise noted.
