                                             ABSTRACT

Strategies selected by combining multiple signals suffer severe overfitting biases, because underlying
signals are typically signed such that each predicts positive in-sample returns. “Highly significant”
backtested performance is easy to generate by selecting stocks on the basis of combinations of randomly
generated signals, which by construction have no true power. This paper analyzes t-statistic distributions
for multi-signal strategies, both empirically and theoretically, to determine appropriate critical values,
which can be several times standard levels. Overfitting bias also severely exacerbates the multiple
testing bias that arises when investigators consider more results than they present. Combining the best
k out of n candidate signals yields a bias almost as large as those obtained by selecting the single best
of nk candidate signals.

1. Introduction

   Multi-signal equity strategies, i.e., strategies that select or weight stocks on the basis

of a composite measure that combines multiple signals, are common in the money

management industry. For example, the MSCI Quality Index (according to its fact sheet)

identifies “stocks with high quality scores based on three main fundamental variables: high

return on equity (ROE), stable year-over-year earnings growth, and low financial leverage.”

Popular “smart beta” products, such as Research Affiliates’ Fundamental Indices, also

rely heavily on the methodology, weighting stocks on the basis of multiple “fundamental”

measures such as sales, cash flow, book value, and dividends.
   Increasingly, multi-signal strategies are attracting scholarly attention.         Notable

examples of composite signals employed by academics for stock selection include

Piotroski’s (2000) F-score measure of financial strength, constructed from nine market

signals; the Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick’s (2003) Index, which combines 24 governance

rules to proxy for shareholder rights; the Baker and Wurgler (2006) Index, which combines

six signals of investor sentiment; and Asness, Frazzini, and Pedersen’s (2013) quality score,

which combines 21 stock level characteristics.

   Unfortunately, inferences drawn from tests of these sorts of strategies are misleading,

because the backtested performance of strategies selected on the basis of multiple signals

is biased, often severely. The bias results from overfitting. Underlying signals are typically

signed such that each predicts positive in-sample returns. That is, an aspect of the data

(in-sample performance of the individual signals) is used when constructing the strategy,
yielding a particular form (and a particularly pernicious form) of the data-snooping biases

considered generally by Lo and MacKinlay (1990).

   This overfitting bias is distinct from the selection bias (or multiple testing bias)

confronted by McLean and Pontiff (2013) and Harvey, Liu, and Zhu (2013). Selection

                                              1
bias results when the researcher employs the best performing signal or signals from among

multiple candidates, and fails to account for doing so. The overfitting bias considered here

is strong even when there is no selection bias, i.e., even when a researcher employs each

and every signal considered.

   While the overfitting and selection biases are distinct, they do interact, with the

selection bias severely exacerbating the overfitting bias. In fact, the presence of the two

makes the bias exponentially worse. The bias resulting from combining the best k signals

out of a set of n candidates is almost as bad as that from using the single best signal out of

nk candidates.

   To demonstrate the severity of the overfitting bias, I construct empirical distributions of

backtested t-statistics for multi-signal strategies, constructed on the basis of purely random
signals. The sorting variable (i.e., the random signals) have no real power, but strategies

based on combinations of the “signals” perform strongly. Essentially, diversifying across

the recommendations of stock pickers that performed well in the past yields even better

past performance, even when the recommendations just follow (or go against) the results of

monkeys throwing darts at the Wall Street Journal. This strong backtested performance in

no way suggests, of course, that these recommendations have any power predicting returns

going forward. For some of the constructions I consider strategies usually backtest, in real

data, with t-statistics in excess of five, and statistical significance at the 5% level requires

t-statistics in excess of seven.

   To develop intuition for the observed empirical results, I derive theoretical distributions

for critical t-statistics under the null that signals are uninformative and strategy returns are

normally distributed. These critical values, which have close analytic approximations, are

similar to those observed in the data. Analysis of these results yields several additional
intuitions. First, it suggests that the overfitting bias is severely exacerbated, at least when

there is little selection bias, when more weight is put on stronger signals. That is, when

                                               2
researchers allow themselves more flexibility to overfit the data, in the form of freedom

to weight different signals differently, then backtested performance is significantly more

biased. It also suggests that when researchers constrain themselves to weight signals

equally, then the optimal use of the roughly half of the signals that backtest least strongly,

at least for the purpose of maximizing backtested t-statistics, is to simply ignore them.

Finally, the model implies the approximate power law for the interaction of the overfitting

and selection biases, suggesting that the bias that results from combining the best k out of

n candidate signals yields biases almost as bad as selecting the single best of nk candidate

signals.

   Note that these results do not suggest that strategy performance cannot be improved

by combining multiple signals. The basic tenants of Markowitz’s (1952) modern portfolio
theory hold, and efficient combinations of high Sharpe ratio assets have even higher Sharpe

ratios. The results do strongly suggest, however, that the marginal contribution of each

individual signal should be evaluated individually. That is, while one should combine

multiple signals they believe in, one should not believe in a combination of signals simply

because they backtest well together.

   The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides results from a large

scale bootstrapping exercise. It describes empirical distributions for backtested t-statistics

for strategies, using real stock returns data, selected on the basis of combinations of

fictitious, randomly generated “signals.” Section 3 presents and analyzes a simplified

model, in which signals are uninformative (i.e., do not predict cross sectional differences in

average returns), and the returns to strategies selected on the basis of individual signals are

uncorrelated and normally distributed. It derives critical t-statistics for strategies selected

on the basis of combinations of signals, and uses these results to develop intuition regarding
the factors that determine the magnitude of the backtesting biases. Section 4 derives the

approximate power law governing the interaction between the selection and overfitting

                                              3
biases, showing that backtests of a strategy based on the best k of n candidate signals

are biased almost as badly as those of a strategy based on the single best of nk candidate

signals. Section 5 concludes.



2. Empirical results

   This section considers the backtested performance of strategies selected by combining

random signals. It generates empirical distributions of backtested t-statistics for a general

class of multi-signal strategies, when signals are uninformative about expected returns, by

considering combinations of multiple random signals thousands of times. By construction,
these signals have no real power, and cannot predict performance out-of-sample.


2.1 Strategy construction

   Given any signal, I construct a long/short strategy, rebalanced at the end of June, using

return and capitalization data for individual stocks from CRSP. The weight of a stock in

the long or short side of a strategy is proportional to both the signal and a capitalization

multiplier. That is, stock i is held proportionally to .Si;t      St /mi;t , where Si;t and mi;t

are the signal and capitalization multiplier for the stock i at time t, and St is the median
signal across all stocks. This specification embeds many common construction schemes.

For example, if the signal is an indicator for whether some stock characteristic is in the

extreme 10% of the cross-sectional distribution, then the strategies are just long and short

extreme deciles, equal weighted if the capitalization multiplier is one for all stocks and

value weighted if it is market equity. If the signal is the cardinal ranking of the characteristic

and the capitalization multiplier is always one, then it gives the rank-weighting scheme

employed by Frazzini and Pedersen (2014) to construct their betting-against-beta (BAB)



                                                4
factor.

       I focus on signal-and-capitalization weighted strategies, because these strategies

map most closely into the theoretical model presented in Section 3, and because the

methodology is similar to that commonly employed in industry. For the capitalization

multiplier I use market equity. The signals are randomly generated “z-scores,” drawn

independently for each stock at the end of each June from a standard normal distribution,

or linear combinations of these randomly generated signals.1 Using rank weighting, or

a simple quantile sort, does not change any of the conclusions of the analysis. In fact,

Appendix A shows that the performance of both signal and rank weighted strategies is

essentially indistinguishable from that of strategies based on simple tercile sorts, equal

weighted if the capitalization multiplier is one and value weighted if the capitalization
multiplier is market equity. So, for example, the salient feature of the rank-weighting

scheme employed by Frazzini and Pedersen (2014) to construct their BAB factor is not

the rank-weighting, but that the scheme ignores market capitalizations. The long and short

sides of the strategy are thus almost indistinguishable, before levering or unlevering, from

equal-weighted portfolios holding the top or bottom 35% of stocks by estimated market

betas.


2.2 A simple illustration

       Before analyzing the full scope of the overfitting bias that results form combining
multiple signals, it is useful to illustrate the associated problems as simply as possible.

This illustration simply demonstrates that combining signals that backtest positively can

yield impressive backtested results, even when none of the signals employed to construct
   1
    In particular, because these strategies’ portfolio weights are linear in the signals, and the composite
signals are linear combinations of the underlying signals, strategies based on composite signals are linear
combinations of the strategies based on individual signals. This fact is employed in Section 3, and simplifies
analysis of the model.


                                                      5
the composite signal has real power, or even individually generates significant backtested

results.

       To do this, I generate 10,000 sets of 100 random signals. By construction, none of

the signals have any true power to predict returns. For each set of signals I construct

signal-and-cap weighted strategies, and record t-statistics for these strategies’ excess

returns. For each set I then combine the signals of the two to ten strategies that backtested

with absolute t-statistics closest to either one, or to one and a half.2 These signals are

combined through simple addition, after first flipping the signs on strategies that generated

negative excess returns. Because of the computational intensity of the procedure, I limit

the analysis to a relatively short sample, covering July 1993 through the end of 2014.

       Figure 1 shows the average backtested t-statistics for strategies based on combinations
of from two to ten signals that all individually backtest with t-statistics of basically one

(lower solid line) or one and a half (upper solid line). Despite the fact that none of the

underlying signals are themselves significant, or have any true power, the figure shows that

the combined signals often look highly significant in the backtests. In fact, the figure shows

that the average t-statistic is almost as large as the average t-statistic of the underlying

signals times the square root of the number of signals employed (dotted lines). As a

result, combining just two signals with t-statistics of 1.5, or five signals with t-statistics

of one, yields strategies that have average t-statistics significant at the 5% level, at least if

one counterfactually assumes, as is common, that the combined strategy t-statistics have a

standard normal distribution.
   2
     Specifically, I select the k D 2; 3; :::; 10 strategies corresponding to those with consecutive order
statistics with absolute backtested t-statistics with means closest to either one or 1.5.

t-statistic on the excess return to strategies that combine from one to ten random signals, where each
of the underlying signals yields strategies with t-statistics of one (lower solid line) or 1.5 (upper solid
line). Strategies are signal-and-cap weighted, i.e., stocks are held in direct proportion to both market
capitalization and the demeaned signal used for strategy construction. Return and capitalization data
come from CRSP, and the sample covers July 1993 through December 2014. Average t-statistics
are calculated over 10,000 sets of random signals. Dotted lines show the average t-statistic of the
underlying signals, multiplied by the square-root of the number of signals combined.




               n strategies
2.3 Best k -of-n

    The previous subsection clearly illustrates the overfitting problem that biases backtested

performance of multi-signal strategies. The construction of those strategies, however,

with all the underlying signals selected to produce similar, modest performance, is highly
artificial. This section analyses strategies that are more likely to arise naturally out of a real


                                                     7
research process. In this process a researcher may have a concept or model that suggests

a certain sort of stocks will have higher returns. She then investigates a set of possible

empirical proxies that she thinks might signal stocks that look good on this dimension,

and chooses to somehow combine the few that work the best. If an investigator considers n

signals, and combines the best k of these to select stocks, the result is a best k-of-n strategy.

When k D 1 this results in pure multiple testing, or selection, bias. This bias is relatively

well understood, and interesting here primarily as a point of comparison. At the opposite

extreme, when k D n the result is a pure overfitting bias. When 1 < k < n the result is a

combination of sample selection and overfitting bias.

   For strategies that combine multiple signals, there is an additional issue, related to how

signals are combined. In particular, will the investigator constrain herself to putting the
same weight on each signal, or will she give herself the additional degrees of freedom to

employ different weights for each signal? I consider both cases here, proxying for the latter

by signal weighting the signals, i.e., weighting each signal in proportion to the in-sample

performance of strategies based on the individual signals. These correspond to the weights

on the ex-post mean-variance portfolio of the individual strategies, assuming the strategies

are uncorrelated and have identical volatilities.


2.3.1   Distribution of t-statistics from multi-signal strategies

   Figure 2 shows the distribution of t-statistics for some simple best k-of-n strategies.

Results are again created by generating 10,000 sets of n random signals. The figure shows

results kernel smoothed with a bandwidth of 0.2.

   Panel A shows the case of pure selection bias (k D 1), for n 2 f1; 2; 4; 6; 10g. It

also shows, for comparison, the density for the absolute value of the standard normal. The

empirical distribution of t-statistics for best 1-of-1 strategy looks approximately normal,

though with a slightly fatter tail, reflecting the excess kurtosis and heteroskedasticity

observed on equity strategy returns. The densities for the cases when n > 1 still look

approximately normal, but are shifted to the right. For n D 2 the mode has shifted out from

zero to almost one. For n D 10 it is almost two.

   Panel B shows the case of pure overfitting bias (k D n), for n 2 f2; 3; 5g. Results are

shown for signals that are equal weighted; signals weighting the signal yields even more

extreme results (shown in Appendix B). The figure suggests that even the pure overfitting

biases are more acute that the selection biases. The distribution of t-statistics for the best

5-of-5 strategy is shifted almost as far as it is for the best 1-of-10 strategy.

   Panel C shows the impact of the biases, depicting the cases when the investigator

considers twice as many signals as she uses (n D 2k), for n 2 f2; 3; 5g. The effects clearly

compound. More than half of the mass of the distribution for the best 3-of-6 strategy
is to the right of two—so most strategies selected this way look “highly significant.”

Employing three signals in the selection criteria when constructing marketed indices is

relatively common, suggesting that the highly significant performance of many of these

indices, inferred from t-statistics greater than 1.96, is anything but.


2.3.2   Critical t-statistics for multi-signal strategies

   Because the distribution of t-statistics for multi-signal strategies does not have a

standard normal distribution, critical values derived from that distribution cannot be used

to draw inferences regarding significance of performance for multi-signal strategies.

   Figure 3 shows empirical 5% critical values for best 1-of-n strategies, which suffer

from pure selection bias, and best n-of-n strategies, which suffer from pure overfitting

bias. For the pure overfitting results, it shows both the case when the composite signal is

constructed by equal weighting the individual signals and by signal weighing the individual

signals. It shows that the impact on the critical threshold from the sample selection and

equal weighted overfitting biases are similar for very small n, but that the impact of the

strongest result from a set of n random strategies, where n 2 f1; 2; :::; 10g. The middle, solid line

cases stocks are selected by combining all n random signals, but the underlying signals are signed
so that they predict positive in-sample returns. In the top, dashed line signals are signal-weighted,
while in the middle, solid line signals are equal-weighted. Critical values come from generating
10,000 sets of n randomly generated signals. Strategies are signal-and-cap weighted, with stocks

construction, and rebalanced annually, at the end of June. Return and capitalization data come from
CRSP, and the sample covers July 1993 through December 2014.

overfitting bias is more acute for even moderately large n. It also shows that overfitting

by signal weighting the signals yields much higher critical values than equal weighting the

signals. That is, the pure overfitting problem is more acute when the investigator has more

freedom to overweight good signals. The critical value of 2.1 at n D 1 reflects the fat

tail of the distribution of t-statistics for the best 1-of-1 case, observed in Figure 2. This

excess kurtosis yields a higher frequency of extreme t-statistics, pushing up the critical

value relative to the one obtained under the standard normal assumption.

   Figure 4 shows empirical 5% critical values for best k-of-n strategies, which suffer

from both selection and overfitting biases. It shows these critical values for the cases when

the best one to ten signals are employed, when 10, 20, 40, or 100 signals are considered,

both when signals are equal-weighted (solid lines) and when signals are signal-weighted
(dotted lines). The combined biases yield extreme critical values. For the best 3-of-10

strategies the 5% critical t-statistic is almost four; for the best 3-of-20 strategies it is

almost five; for the best 7-of-100 strategies it is almost seven. The figure also shows a

non-monotonicity in the critical value for the equal weighted signal case when n D 10,

and a large divergence between the critical values of the equal weighted signal and signal

weighted signal strategies when most the signals considered are employed. This occurs

because in-sample performance is impaired by putting significant weight on poor quality

signals, an effect that is considered in greater detail in the next section.

3. Model results

       To develop intuition for the results observed in the preceding section, I now analyze a

simplified model of strategy performance, deriving distributions of backtest t-statistics, and

properties of these distributions, when stocks are selected on the basis of multiple signals.


3.1. Model

       Suppose there are n underlying “signals” used for stock selection, and that the returns

to signal-weighted strategies (i.e., long/short strategies that hold stocks in proportion to

the demeaned signals) are normally distributed, uncorrelated across signals, and have the

same volatilities (or are levered to have the same volatilities). Under these assumptions,

the performance of strategies based on composite signals, formed as linear combinations

of the underlying signals, are relatively easy to analyze. First, the normality of returns

implies that the standard results from modern portfolio theory hold. Second, weights

on individual stocks in a strategy are proportional to the signal used to select them, and

composite signals are linear combinations of the underlying signals, so a strategy selected

on the basis of a composite signal is consequently identical to a portfolio of strategies based

on the individual underlying signals, held in proportion to the weights used to construct the

composite signal.3
       Given n signals, the ex-post Sharpe ratio to the strategy that selects stocks based on a

composite signal that puts weights !E on the individual signals is thus the same as that to
   3
     That is, the assumption that individual stock weights are proportional to the signal used to select them,
together with composite signals that are linear combinations of the underlying signals, yields an exact
equivalence between “siloed” and “integrated” solutions (i.e., the solution that runs multiple pure strategies
side-by-side, and the one that select stocks to get exposure to all the signals simultaneously). While these
assumptions are not satisfied for standard quantile sorted strategies, Appendix A shows that the performance
of quantile sorted strategies is essentially indistinguishable from that of rank-weighted strategies, or from
z-score weighted strategies, which do satisfy the assumptions.

      E e is the vector of realized excess returns to strategies selected using the n signals,
where 

and † D  I is the variance-covariance matrix for the strategy returns, where  is the
volatility of the individual strategies. The sample t-statistic estimated on the combined

strategy is thus

                                                !E 0 tE

where tE is the vector of t-statistics estimated on the individual strategies.

   The back-tested performance of strategies formed on the basis of multiple signals
consequently depends on how the signals are used. The two most common choices, equal

weighting the signals (!E D 1= k1k1 ) and signal-weighting the signals (!E D tE= tE 1 ), here

correspond to well understood strategies, the minimum variance and ex-post mean-variance

efficient portfolios, respectively.

   Without loss of generality, we may assume that the elements of tE are arranged in

increasing order, and letting In;k be the orthogonal projection onto the lower k dimensional

sub-space (i.e., .In;k /ij D 1 if i D j > n         k, and zero otherwise), we then have that

    That is, the t-statistic for the best k-of-n strategy that equal weights signals is the
                                                                         p
L1 -norm of the vector of the largest k order statistics of tE divided by k. Equivalently, it
  p
is k times the average t-statistic of the strategies corresponding to the signals employed.

This conceptualization is basically consistent with the empirical results presented in Figure

1, which showed that the backtested performance of strategies selected on an average of k
                                                                    p
signals that individually backtest with similar strength was roughly k times as strong as

the backtested performance of strategies based on the individual signals.

    For the strategy that signal weights the signals, the t-statistic is the L2 -norm of the
                                                                 MV     MVE

results for Lp -norms imply that the bound is tight if and only if the k largest order statistics
are all equal.

    Before analyzing arbitrary tn;k;p and tn;k;p , it is again useful to develop some intuition

by first considering the extreme cases in k. The first of these occurs when the investigator

considers several signals, but only reports results for the single best performing strategy


                                                      16
(k D 1), and again corresponds to pure selection bias. The properties of the critical

threshold in this case are well understood, but provide a useful point of comparison. The

second occurs when the investigator employs all the signals considered (k D n), but signs

each to predict positive in-sample returns, and again corresponds to pure overfitting bias.

It is free from sample-selection bias, but is biased nevertheless because the joint signal

is constructed using information regarding the directionality with which each individual

signal predicts returns that come from the whole sample.


3.2.1. Pure sample selection bias: Inference when a single signal is used

    For the best 1-of-n strategies, note that the order statistics for standard uniform random

variables follow beta distributions, u.k/  B.k; n C 1 k/. So for the maximal order

n candidate strategies are zero.


3.2.2. Pure overfitting bias: Inference when all signals considered are used

   When all the signals considered are used there is no selection bias, but overfitting

still occurs because the signals are typically signed so that they predict high returns
in-sample. In this case the distribution of the observed t-statistic for the strategy based on

the signal-weighted signal (i.e., the ex post MVE combination of the n strategies) is trivial.

All the signals are employed, and the t-statistics on the excess returns to the strategies based

on the underlying signals come from independent standard normal draws. The t-statistic on

the signal-weighted straegy is consequently distributed as a chi-distribution with n degrees

of freedom,

The critical t-statistic for the ex-post MVE combined strategy constructed using the n

randomly selected signals comes from inverting the chi-squared distribution,

                                                q

   The critical values for the strategies based on the equally weighted signals are more

difficult, but have a simple asymptotic approximation. The mean and variance of the

the estimate is a lower bound on the true critical value. The performance of this estimator

bootstrapped from real stock market data using random signals, provided in Figure 3. The
model critical values are uniformly roughly 7% below their empirical counterparts, for all

three cases and across the range of signals employed (k), because the model lacks the

excess kurtosis and heteroskedasticity observed in the data.

strongest result from a set of n random strategies, where n 2 f1; 2; :::; 10g. The middle, solid line
and the top, dashed line, show 5% critical thresholds when there is pure overfitting bias. In these
cases stocks are selected by combining all n random signals, but the underlying signals are signed
so that they predict positive in-sample returns. In the top, dashed line signals are signal-weighted,
while in the middle, solid line signals are equal-weighted. The dot-dashed line shows the analytic
approximation for the equal-weighted best n-of-n case.

3.3. General case: best k -of-n

      To calculate the critical t-statistic more generally, when the selection and overfitting

biases interact, note that the order statistics for n draws of the standard uniform distribution

are distributed uniformly on the standard n-simplex n D f.u1 ; u2 ; :::; un / 2 Rn j0 

u1  u2  :::  un  1g, which has a volume of 1=nŠ. Using the symmetry of the

normal distribution is obtained by pulling the simplex back through the cumulative normal

       While these do not admit analytic solutions, they are easy to calculate numerically.

Figure 6 shows 5% critical values as a function k, the number of signals employed, for

k D 1; 2; :::10, for cases in which the investigator considers ten, 20, 40, or 100 signals (i.e.,

n 2 f10; 20; 40; 100g). The figure again shows a strong resemblance to the corresponding

empirical critical values provided in Figure 4. The model shows similar, though slightly

lower, critical values for the pure selection bias cases (k D 1), strong, but slightly weaker
dependence on k for small k, and slightly high sensitivity to k for large k.4 The figure also

shows the same non-monotonicity in the critical value for the equal-weighted signal case

when n D 10, and a large divergence between the critical values for strategies that equal-

and signal-weight signals when k  n. These effects are considered in greater detail in the

next subsection.

     The model’s results correspond even more closely to the empirical distribution of critical t-statistics for
signal-weighted strategies constructed without regards to market capitalizations (i.e., mi;t D 1 for all i and
t). The empirical critical values for these strategies are shown in Table 11 of Appendix C.

The variances terms in equations (13) and (14) are relatively insensitive to n and k, while

the means are strongly increasing in both indices (at least for small k), consistent with the

basic rightward shift in the empirical distributions observed in Figure 2.

      Figure 7 compares these analytic approximations to the exact critical values, calculated

The performance of the ex-post mean variance efficient strategy is always weakly improved

by adding strategies to the investment opportunity set, so the critical t-statistic threshold for
                                                
the signal weighted combination of strategies, tn;k;p , is increasing in k  n for all n and p.

The same is not true for the critical t-statistic threshold for the equal weighted combination
                
of strategies, tn;k;p . With these strategies there is a tension. Increasing the number of

signals used decreases strategy volatility, which tends to improve performance. At the same

time, using more signals reduces average returns, as the average quality of the signals for

predicting in-sample performance falls, which tends to hurt performance. Initially the first

effect dominates, and performance improves with more signals, but eventually the quality

of the signal deteriorates sufficiently that the gains from additional strategy diversification

are more than offset by the loss in average returns. At that point employing additional
signals is detrimental to performance. The point at which overall performance starts to

deteriorate, i.e., the optimal number of signals to use to predict in-sample performance,

can be approximated by noting that this occurs (abusing the infinitesimal notation) when

or that k  n=2. Consistent with Figure 7, given n candidate signals the maximal Sharpe

ratio strategy that equal-weights signals employs roughly half the signals. That is, when

forming equal-weighted strategies, the optimal “use” of the worst performing half of the

typical set of candidate signals is to simply ignore them. Observing that a multi-signal

strategy fails to employ any poor quality signals consequently raises concerns that the

investigator threw out poor performing candidates, suggesting selection bias (i.e., n > k)

as well as overfitting bias (i.e., signing each signal so that it performs well in sample).
                                                                   p           p

4    Pure selection bias equivalence

    Another way to quantify the impact of the combined sample selection and overfitting

biases, and how they interact, is to calculate the number of candidate signals an investigator

would need to consider to get the same bias selecting stocks using a single signal. That is,
                                                                                    

given any critical value  and p-value p, we can find n such that  D N       1 2          .

Solving for n , the number of single-signal strategies the investigator would need to
consider to have the same critical value, is thus

    Table 1 shows single-signal equivalent sample sizes, for actual sample size from ten to

100 (rows), when employing two to ten signals (columns). The table shows the pernicious

interaction between the sample selection and overfitting biases. Panel A, which shows

the case when multiple signals are signal-weighted, shows that using just the best three
signals from 20 candidates yields a bias as bad as if the investigator had used the single best

performing signal from 1,250 candidates. With five signals selected from 50 candidates,

the bias is almost as bad as if the investigator had used the single best performing signal

from one million. Panel B shows even stronger results when the researcher has the freedom

to overweight more strongly performing signals.

    A key feature of Table 1 is that the equivalent number of single signals considered (n)

generally grows quickly with the number of signals employed (k). To quantify this relation,

approximately affine in ln n, with a slope approximately proportional to k. That is, n is

roughly proportional to nk .

      This approximate power relation is evident in Figure 8, which plots, on a log-log

signal, dotted lines), as a function of the number of candidate strategies actually considered

(n, form ten to 100). This n is plotted for strategies constructed using the best two, three,

and five signals. As predicted, the figure shows an approximately linear log-log relation,

with slopes proportional to the number of signals employed.

   This approximate power law can be understood intuitively as follows. The biases that

result from using the best k-of-n signals are worse than one would get by partitioning the

signals into k random sub-samples of size n=k, and then using the single best signal from

each sub-sample. The expected in-sample improvement in the quality of the employed

signals that results from going from one candidate to n=k signals is almost as large as

going from one signal to n signals, because the oversampling bias is highly convex in the

candidate sample size, and the effects on n are multiplicative. The bias that results from
the best k-of-n strategies is consequently almost as pronounced as if the investigator had

5. Conclusion

   Multi-signal strategies cannot be evaluated using conventional tests.          Combining

spurious, marginal signals, it is easy to generate backtested performance that looks

impressive, at least when evaluated using the wrong statistics. One solution is to evaluate

multi-signal strategies using different statistics. An easier solution is to evaluate the

marginal power of each signal separately.

   This is not to say that one should not use multiple signals that one believes in. Signals
that work well individually will work even better together. One should not, however,

believe in multiple signals because they backtest well together. Backtesting well together

does not imply that any of the signals, or even the combined signal, has any power.

A. Signal and rank weighted strategies

   The strategies considered in Section 2 hold stocks in proportion to .Si;t           St /mi;t ,

where Si;t and mi;t are the signal and capitalization multiplier for stock i at time t, and

St is the median signal across all stocks. This specification embeds standard quantile

sorts (when Si;t equals an indicator that the sorting characteristic is in the top x% of

the cross-sectional distribution, minus an indicator that it is in the bottom x% of the

cross-sectional distribution), rank-weighted strategies (when Si;t is the cross-sectional rank

of the sorting characteristic), and z-score weighted strategies (when Si;t is the z-score of the

sorting characteristic). It also embeds both value-weighted and equal-weighted strategies

(the former when market cap multiplier mi;t is a stock’s market capitalization; the latter
when it is one for all stocks).

   To facilitate comparison between the empirical results of Section 2 and the theory

presented in Section 3, I assume that the signals were uncorrelated normally distributed

z-scores. Under this assumption, integrated solutions (i.e., strategies based on composite

signals) are exactly equivalent to siloed solutions (i.e., to portfolios of strategies based

on the individual signals). This simplifies the analysis, because it allows us to use well

known results from portfolio theory. This section shows that this assumption is largely

immaterial, as the performance of strategies based on quantile sorts, rank-weighting, and

z-score weighting are essentially indistinguishable.

   This fact should not, perhaps, be very surprising. Figure 9 shows the relative weights

on the long side of long/short strategies constructed by tertile (top 35%) sorting (dotted

line), rank-weighting (dashed line), and z-score weighting (solid line). The figure shows
that each dollar of the long side of a z-score weighted strategy differs from the quantile

portfolio that equal weights the top 35% of stocks by the sorting characteristic by only

23 cents. The impact of this relatively modest deviation is holdings is also unclear, as

relative to the quantile portfolio, the z-score weighted portfolio overweights the stocks
with the most extreme and most marginal characteristic rankings, and underweights those

with moderately strong characteristic rankings. The rank-weighted strategies differ even

less, deviating from the quantile portfolio’s holdings by only 17 cents per dollar.

    These similarities are reflected in the performance of strategies constructed by quantile

sorting, rank-weighting, and z-score weighting. Table 2 compares the performance of



                                                   31
value-minus-growth (VMG) strategies, based on book-to-market, constructed using the

three different methodologies.5            It also compares strategies that are equal and value

weighted. The table provides compelling evidence that the most relevant feature of

rank-weighting or z-score weighting is the fact that these weighting schemes weight

without respect for capitalization, and thus look like equal weighted, not value weighted,

strategies. Similarly, the most relevant feature of the rank and capitalization weighted or

z-score and capitalization weighted strategies is the fact that they weight proportional to

capitalization, and thus look like value weighted, not equal weighted, strategies.

        Panel A regresses the returns to the rank-weighted VMG strategy on to the returns to an

equal-weighted, tertile sorted VMG strategy, and onto a rank and capitalization weighted

VMG strategy. It shows that the rank-weighted strategy is almost indistinguishable from the
simple equal-weighted, tertile strategy, which explains 99.4 percent of its return variation.

The rank-weighted strategy and the rank and capitalization weighted strategy are much

less correlated, and actually do not even have a significant relation, after controlling for the

performance of the equal-weighted, tertile sorted strategy.

        Panels B through D tell similar stories. The z-score weighted strategy looks like an

equal weighted, tertile strategy, not a z-score and capitalization weighted strategy. The rank

and capitalization weighted, and z-score and capitalization weighted, strategies both look

like value-weighted, tertile sorted strategies, not like rank-weighted or z-score weighted

strategies.

        Overall, the evidence is remarkably consistent. The use of quantile sorting, or rank

or z-score weighting, has little impact on the performance of the strategies, which always

look highly similar. The choice of equal-weighting or value-weighting for the capitalization

multiplier, however, has a material impact on the nature of the strategies.

constructed by equal-weighting the k best performing candidate signals, and dotted lines the cases
when the composite signal is constructed by signal-weighting the signals. Critical values come from
generating 10,000 sets of n randomly generated signals. Strategies are signal weighted, with stocks
