                                           ABSTRACT

Three things happen when emerging economies open their stock markets to foreign investors. First,
the aggregate dividend yield falls by 240 basis points. Second, the growth rate of the capital stock
increases by an average of 1.1 percentage points per year. Third, the growth rate of output per

worker rises by 2.3 percentage points per year. Since the cost of capital falls, investment booms, and
the growth rate of output per worker increases when countries liberalize the stock market, the

increasingly popular view that capital account liberalization brings no real benefits seems untenable.

Introduction

       Capital account liberalization was once seen as an inevitable step along the path

to economic development for poor countries. Liberalizing the capital account, it was

said, would permit financial resources to flow from capital-abundant countries, where

expected returns were low, to capital-scarce countries, where expected returns were high.

The flow of resources into the liberalizing countries would reduce their cost of capital,

increase investment, and raise output (Fischer, 1998; Summers, 2000). The principal

policy question was not whether to liberalize the capital account, but when— before or

after undertaking macroeconomic reforms such as inflation stabilization and trade

liberalization (McKinnon, 1991). Or so the story went.

       In recent years intellectual opinion has moved against liberalization. Financial

crises in Asia, Russia and Latin America have shifted the focus of the conversation from

when countries should liberalize to if they should do so at all. Opponents of the process

argue that capital account liberalization does not generate greater efficiency. Instead,

liberalization invites speculative hot money flows and increases the likelihood of

financial crises with no discernible positive effects on investment, output, or any other

real variable with nontrivial welfare implications (Bhagwhati, 1998; Rodrik, 1998;

Stiglitz 2002).

       While opinions about capital account liberalization are abundant, facts are

relatively scarce. This paper tries to increase the ratio of facts to opinions. In the late

1980s and early 1990s a number of developing countries liberalized their stock markets,

opening them to foreign investors for the first time. These liberalizations constitute

discrete changes in the degree of capital account openness, which allow for a positive




                                                                                         2
empirical description of the cost of capital, investment, and growth during liberalization

episodes.

        Figure 1 previews the central message that the rest of this paper develops in more

detail. The cost of capital falls when developing countries liberalize the stock market.

Since the cost of capital falls, investment should also increase, as profit maximizing firms

drive down the marginal product of capital to its new lower cost. Figure 2 is consistent

with this prediction. Liberalization leads to a sharp increase in the growth rate of the

capital stock. Finally, as a direct consequence of growth accounting, the increase in

investment should generate a temporary increase in the growth rate of output per worker.

Figure 3 confirms that the growth rate of output per worker rises in the aftermath of

liberalization.

        While the figures do no harm to the efficiency view of capital account

liberalization, a number of caveats are in order. For example, it is legitimate to interpret

a fall in the dividend yield (Figure 1) as a decline in the cost of capital, if there is no

change in the expected future growth rate of dividends at the time of liberalization. But

stock market liberalizations are usually accompanied by other economic reforms that may

increase the expected future growth rate of output and dividends (Henry, 2000a,b).

Because liberalizations do not occur in isolation, it is important to think carefully about

how to interpret the data. Neoclassical theory provides a good starting point for framing

the issues.



I. Theory

        There are two components to a country’s cost of capital: the risk-free rate and the




                                                                                          3
equity premium. Theory suggests that both will fall when a poor country liberalizes. The

following partial equilibrium, mean variance arguments based on Stulz (1999) make the

central points most succinctly.

        Assume a small country whose equity market is completely segmented from

world equity markets. Also assume that all investors in the world have the same constant

relative risk aversion and care only about the expected return and variance of their

investment. Let E[ R% M ] denote the equilibrium required rate of return on the aggregate

domestic stock market before liberalization and let r f denote the domestic risk-free

interest rate. Define the price of risk as follows: the aggregate risk premium, E[ R% M ] − rf ,

divided by the variance of the aggregate return on the market, VAR ( R% M ) . Under our

assumptions, the price of risk in the small country before liberalization is a constant, Τ .

It follows that

E[ R% M ] = rf + ΤVar ( R% M )                                                              (1).

        Now consider what happens to the required rate of return when the country opens

its stock market to the rest of the world and also allows its residents to invest abroad.

Assume that the mean and variance of domestic dividends are unaltered by the

liberalization.     Let E[ R% M* ] denote the required rate of return on the market after

liberalization and let E[ R%W ] be the required rate of return on the world equity market.

With completely open capital markets, the world risk-free rate, rf* , becomes the relevant

interest rate. The risk premium on the domestic stock market will now depend on the

following two factors: (1) the beta of the domestic stock market with the world stock

market, β MW , and (2) the world risk premium, E[ R%W ] − rf* . Following liberalization it


                                                                                              4
must be the case that

E[ R% M* ] = rf* + β MW ( E[ R%W ] − rf* )                                                   (2).

         Since the liberalizing country is small, adding its stock market to the world

market portfolio has a negligible effect on the variance (and hence the risk premium) of

the world market portfolio. It follows that ( E[ R%W ] − rf* ) = ΤVAR( R%W ) . Using this fact,

the definition of β MW , and a little bit of algebra, one can show that after liberalization the

required rate of return on the domestic stock market is given by:

E[ R% M* ] = rf* + ΤCov( R% M , R%W )                                                        (3).

         Subtracting equation (1) from equation (3) gives the difference in the post- and

pre-liberalization required rates of return:

∆E[ R% M ] = (rf* − rf ) + Τ[Cov( R% M , R%W ) − Var ( R% M )]                               (4).

Since poor countries have lower capital-to-labor ratios than rich countries, we would

expect that rf > rf* . Hence the first term on the right-hand side of (4) is negative. Next,

consider the change in the equity premium.                       For every country in the sample,

Cov( R% M , R%W ) , the covariance of the local market with the world market, is less than

Var ( R% M ) , the variance of the local market (Stulz, 1999). Hence the second term is also

negative. The central result follows: Liberalization reduces the cost of capital.



II. Evidence

         Identifying liberalization dates is the first step in determining whether

liberalization reduces the cost of capital in practice. Since markets are forward-looking,

the most important question is when does the market first learn of a credible, impending


                                                                                                5
liberalization? In principle, identifying a liberalization date simply involves finding the

date on which the government declares that foreigners may purchase domestic shares. In

practice, the liberalization process is not so transparent. In many cases, there is no

obvious government declaration or policy decree that one can point to. When there is no

salient liberalization decree, I infer the first date on which foreigners could hold domestic

shares from the first date on which a closed-end country fund was established.1 Table 1

presents a list of the 18 countries in the sample, the date of their first stock market

liberalization, and the means by which they liberalized. For example, the table shows

that the modal means of liberalization occurred through the establishment of a closed-end

country fund.

           The establishment of a country fund in particular, and stock market liberalizations

in general, may seem like a narrow way to define capital account liberalization relative to

the broader liberalization indicators that are employed elsewhere in the literature (Edison,

Klein, Ricci, and Sloek, 2002). But it is precisely the narrowness of stock market

liberalizations that make them more useful for the purpose at hand. Studies that use

broad liberalization indicators focus on cross-sectional data, examining the long-run

correlation between average openness and average investment.                              Examining the

correlation between average openness and investment tells us whether investment rates

are permanently higher in countries with capital accounts that are more open. The

problem with this approach is that neoclassical theory makes no such prediction.

           What the theory does predict is that capital-poor countries will experience a

temporary increase in investment when they liberalize. Hence, the relevant issue is not

                                                                                                     6
whether countries with open capital accounts have higher investment rates, but whether

investment increases in the immediate aftermath of liberalizations. The most transparent

way of testing the prediction is to compare investment rates during liberalization episodes

with investment rates during non-liberalization periods. Because they constitute a radical

shift in the degree of capital account openness, stock market liberalizations provide ideal

natural experiments for confronting the theory with data.



A. Cost of Capital

        Having identified dates on which liberalizations occur, the key question is how to

detect empirically whether the cost of capital falls. The cost of capital is the equilibrium-

required rate of return on the stock market. Therefore, if liberalization reduces the cost of

capital, we should see a one-time revaluation of stock prices when liberalizations occur

(Henry, 2000a). For the descriptive exercise here, it is more convenient to use annual

dividend yields.

        Again, Figure 1 is consistent with the view that liberalization reduces the cost of

capital. The figure plots the average aggregate dividend yield across the 18 liberalizing

countries in event time (year [0] is the year of liberalization). The average dividend yield

falls by roughly 240 basis points—from an average level of 5.0 percent in the 5 years

prior to liberalization to an average of 2.6 percent in the five years following

liberalization.

        Figure 1 is, of course, also consistent with other interpretations. Recall that the

dividend yield equals the required rate of return on equity minus the expected growth rate

of dividends:




                                                                                           7

P

Section I explains why liberalization reduces E[ R% M ] . Here, the variable under scrutiny

is g , the expected growth rate of dividends. If g does not change when liberalizations

occur, then a fall in the dividend yield implies a fall in the cost of capital. Because

liberalizations are part of a general process that involves substantial macroeconomic

reforms, however, there is a strong possibility that they are associated with changes in g .

Economic reforms do have significant effects on the stock market (Henry, 2002). But the

financial effects of liberalization remain statistically and economically significant, after

controlling for contemporaneous reforms (Henry 2000a, Bekaert and Harvey, 2000).



B. Investment

       If liberalizations reduce the cost of capital then we should also see more

investment.    Figure 2 shows that the growth rate of the capital stock rises by 1.1

percentage points in the aftermath of liberalizations— from an average of 5.4 percent per

year in the pre-liberalization period to an average of 6.5 percent in the post-liberalization

period— but Figure 2 is subject to the same criticism as Figure 1. Does investment

increase because liberalization reduces the cost of capital? Or, is the entire effect driven

by a reform-induced rise in g ? Investment does increase following major reforms, but

the effect of liberalization on investment remains significant, after controlling for reforms

(Henry, 2000b).



C. Growth




                                                                                           8
         Since the growth rate of the capital stock increases, the growth rate of output per

worker should also rise. Figure 3 confirms that the growth rate of output per worker rises

by 2.3 percentage points— from an average of 1.4 percent per year in the pre-

liberalization period to an average of 3.7 percent per year in the post-liberalization

period. On the one hand, there is nothing surprising about Figure 3. Whereas Figures 1

and 2 document behavioral responses of prices and quantities of capital to liberalization,

Figure 3 simply provides a mechanical check of the standard growth accounting equation:

Yˆ = Aˆ + α Kˆ + (1 − α ) Lˆ                                                             (6)

Where a circumflex over a variable denotes the change in the natural log of that variable.

         The interesting point about Figure 3 is that the increase in the growth rate of

output per worker is too large to be explained by the increase in investment. A few

simple calculations illustrate the point. The elasticity of output with respect to capital,

α , is typically around 0.33. So, based on Figure 2, we would expect the growth rate of

output per worker in the post-liberalization period to be about 0.363 (0.33 times 1.1)

percentage points higher. But Figure 3 displays a 2.3 percentage point increase in the

growth rate of output per worker. All else equal, a 1.1 percentage point increase in the

growth rate of the capital stock can produce a 2.3 percentage point increase in the growth

rate of output per worker only if the elasticity of output with respect to capital is on the

order of 2!

         Bekaert, Harvey, and Lumsdaine (2001) find that the increase in growth due to

liberalization is slightly larger than 1 percentage point after controlling for a number of

variables. Nevertheless, their finding still requires an elasticity of output with respect to

capital that is greater than 1. Their paper does not address the inconsistency of their



                                                                                           9
finding with standard production theory. I do so here.

       The missing piece is, of course, Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth.

Equation (6) shows that any increase in the rate of growth of output that is not accounted

for by an increase in the growth rate of capital and labor must be the result of an increase

in Â , the growth rate of technology. In the current context, it is important to remember

that the pure theory of capital account liberalization focuses exclusively on capital

accumulation.    Technological change and TFP growth do not enter into the story.

Therefore, one cannot automatically claim that liberalization is also responsible for the

increase in TFP growth.

       Now, it is true that if liberalization increases the allocative efficiency of domestic

investment, it will also raise TFP growth without any need for technological change.

However, it is not obvious why capital account liberalization, a policy change directed at

increasing international allocative efficiency, would have any effect on domestic

allocative efficiency (Chari and Henry, 2002a; Gourinchas and Jeanne, 2002). But if

theories of capital account liberalization cannot explain the increase in TFP growth, what

can?



III. Open Questions

       The simplest answer is that the economic reforms, which make it difficult to

interpret the fall in the dividend yield as a decrease in the cost of capital, are also

responsible for the increase in TFP growth. While we typically interpret Â as the growth

rate of technological progress, any economic reform that raises the efficiency of a given




                                                                                          10
stock of capital and labor will also increase Â , even in the absence of technological

change.

       The argument is not that capital account liberalization-based theories are utterly

incapable of explaining increases in TFP growth.           To the contrary, one can tell

augmented stories in which capital account liberalization does induce technological

change.   For example, liberalization may ease binding capital constraints, thereby

enabling firms to adopt technologies that they could not finance prior to the liberalization.

It is also possible that increased risk sharing encourages investment in riskier, higher

growth technologies in the spirit of Obstfeld (1994).

       The point is that the developing countries in this sample may have increased their

rate of adoption of new production technologies during the late 1980s and early 1990s

but, if that is the case, it is not immediately apparent from aggregate data (Figures 1

through 3). In contrast, aggregate data are completely consistent with the preponderance

of readily observable evidence that the countries engaged in substantial economic reform.

Occam’s razor argues for the simple, reform-driven explanation of TFP growth over

more elaborate capital-account-liberalization- based stories.

       Having said that, the only way to completely resolve the issue is to confront it

with data that are capable of distinguishing between competing theories. Recent studies

of liberalization that move from aggregate to firm-level data show the way forward. For

example, Chari and Henry (2002b) provide evidence that liberalization does increase risk

sharing. Examining whether the increase in risk sharing induces firms to adopt new

production technologies would provide a direct test of capital-account-liberalization-

based explanations of TFP growth.




                                                                                          11
IV. Conclusion

       When developing countries liberalize the stock market, their cost of capital falls,

investment booms, and the growth rate of output per worker increases. While these facts

cast doubt on the view that capital account liberalization brings no real benefits, there are

many important questions to which the evidence does not speak. For some of these

questions, such as do liberalizations cause crises, aggregate data may yet prove useful.

For other questions, aggregate data are simply too coarse to provide precise answers.

Moving the technological frontier to firm-level data should enhance our general

understanding of the process by which the effects of liberalization are transmitted to the

real economy.
