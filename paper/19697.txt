1     Introduction
The experience of many developing countries reveals uneven regional effects of international
economic integration. For example, China’s recent globalization process took place jointly with
large movements of workers and export-oriented industries toward fast-growing coastal regions
(World Bank, 2009). The standard view in international trade theory interprets countries as points
in space, missing this type of phenomenon. In this paper we introduce an internal geography
to the canonical model of international trade driven by comparative advantages to study the
regional effects of external economic integration. The theory rationalizes patterns of specialization,
employment, and relative incomes observed in developing countries that opened up to trade. A key
feature of the model is that comparative-advantage industries locate closer to international gates.
We find evidence consistent with this pattern in industry-level data from Chinese prefectures, and
document that alternative explanations based on economies of scale or location fundamentals do
not fully account for it.
    We model a 2-sector economy where locations are arbitrarily arranged on a map and differ
in trade costs to international gates such as seaports, airports, or land crossings. Within the
country, trade is costly and international shipments must cross through international gates to
reach foreign markets. To produce, firms in each location use both a mobile and an immobile
factor. The geographical advantage of international gates acts as an agglomeration force, but
decreasing returns to scale due to immobile factors create incentives to spread economic activity
across locations. This structure allows us to represent all equilibrium outcomes in closed form and
the model remains tractable under various extensions.
   The key equilibrium feature is a dual-economy structure. Whenever the economy is not fully
specialized in what it exports, two distinct regions necessarily emerge: locations near international
gates specialize in export-oriented sectors, whereas more distant locations are incompletely
specialized and do not trade with other regions or with the rest of the world. The first set of
locations constitutes a commercially integrated coastal region with high employment density, while
the second set forms an autarkic interior region where immobile factors are poorer. We examine
how the interaction between internal and international trade costs determines each of these regions’
weight in national income and economic activity. International integration causes migration of
mobile factors to the coastal region and an increase in the measure of locations specialized in
export-oriented sectors.
    This specialization pattern leads to uneven regional effects of international trade.        Higher
openness, triggered by a reduction in either international or internal trade costs, has opposing
welfare effects on immobile factors located in different points of the country. The interior region
looses due to the reduced availability of mobile factors who emigrate to the coastal region, while
some locations in the coastal region necessarily gain. When the country is open to trade and internal
trade costs are reduced from a sufficiently high level, regional inequality follows an inverted-U shape.
The theory also offers a rationale for why the gains from trade may be low in the presence of poor
domestic infrastructure. At the aggregate level, the gains from international trade are a weighted

                                                   1
average of the gains accrued to each location, and can be broken down into a familiar term that
captures the gains without internal geography and a term that captures domestic trade frictions.
The latter depends on the size of the coastal region, so that, by reducing the measure of trading
locations, domestic trade frictions hamper the aggregate gains from trade.
   These qualitative results rationalize patterns of specialization, employment, and relative incomes
observed in developing countries that opened up to trade. For example, economic integration
led to larger employment growth in comparative-advantage industries located near borders in
Mexico (Hanson 1996) and near ports in Vietnam (McCaig and Pavnick 2012). The dual-economy
structure generated by the model is consistent with the coexistence of globally integrated regions
and a hinterland with low international participation in large developing countries with a poor
transportation infrastructure (Asian Development Bank Institute 2009). The theory rationalizes
these facts by introducing internal trade costs to the neoclassical trade model. Limao and Venables
(2001) and Atkin and Donaldson (2012) provide evidence that such costs are sizeable in developing
countries.
   In the empirical analysis, we assess the key prediction of the model about regional specialization,
from which its welfare and distributional implications stem: due to the interaction between national
comparative advantages and internal trade costs, export-oriented industries (i.e., industries in
which the economy has comparative advantages relative to the rest of the world) locate closer
to international gates, leading to uneven regional effects of trade.      We assess this prediction
using industry-level data from Chinese prefectures, proxying for industries’ export orientation with
national export-revenue ratios. To sidestep the concern that these ratios are endogenous to activity
within China, we also rely on the argument that China’s comparative advantages lie in labor-
intensive industries and use industry-specific labor intensities from U.S. data as a second proxy for
industry export orientation.
   We find that economic activity at the industry-prefecture level is strongly correlated with the
interaction between prefecture proximity to coastlines and industry export orientation. The direct
effect of distance on economic activity is sizeable: moving inland by 275 miles (the median distance
from the coast across prefectures) decreases industry employment by 17 percent for an industry
with average export-revenue ratio, and by 13 percent for an industry with average labor intensity.
But this negative distance gradient is stronger for export-oriented industries: employment shrinks
by 32 percent for an industry that has an export-revenue ratio one standard deviation higher than
average, and by 21 percent for an industry that has labor intensity one standard deviation higher
than average.
   Finally, we examine alternative explanations that can also generate this pattern.             Our
approach to explaining regional specialization complements explanations within the New Economic
Geography tradition of Krugman (1991). In that view, it could be that industries with higher
returns to scale locate closer to international markets and are more likely to export. Following
Hanson and Xiang (2004), we use product differentiation as an industry-specific measure of returns
to scale to control for this home-market effect. We also control for industry-specific trade costs.


                                                  2
While the data suggest that economies of scale may also be important in determining industry
location, our main finding is not affected by this control.      Our approach also complements
explanations based on location fundamentals such as Courant and Deardorff (1992), and on
external economies of scale as in Rossi-Hansberg (2005). In those views, it could be that, closer
to international gates, either endowments or externalities drive low relative unit costs in specific
industries which become export oriented. We argue that explanations of this type do not fully
account for the regional specialization pattern that we find, for they imply a positive relative-
productivity gradient in favor of comparative-advantage industries toward coastlines that is not
strongly present in the Chinese data.
   Relation to the literature: Few studies consider an explicit interaction between international
and domestic trade costs. In a New Economic Geography context, Krugman and Livas-Elizondo
(1996) and Behrens et al. (2006) present models where two regions within a country trade with
the rest of the world. Henderson (1982) and Rauch (1991) model systems of cities in an open
economy framework. Rossi-Hansberg (2005) studies the location of industries on a continuous
space with spatial externalities. These papers are based on economies of scale, whereas we focus on
the interaction between heterogeneous market access within countries and comparative advantages
between countries.
   Matsuyama (1999) studies a multi-region extension of Helpman and Krugman (1985). He focuses
on home-market effects under different spatial configurations, but does not include factor mobility.
In neoclassical environments, Bond (1993) and Courant and Deardorff (1993) present models with
regional specialization where relative factor endowments may vary across discrete regions within
a country. These papers do not include heterogeneity in access to world markets. Venables and
Limao (2002) study international specialization in a setup with central and peripheral locations
and no factor mobility.
   More recently, Ramondo et al. (2014) quantitatively study the gains from trade and technology
diffusion allowing for multiple regions within countries in the Eaton and Kortum (2002) model.
Redding (2014) develops a multi-region version of the trade and labor mobility model in Helpman
(1998), while Allen and Arkolakis (2013) study an Armington model extended with labor mobility
and external economies. These papers do not study the effect of international trade on the pattern
of industrial specialization across regions within countries.
   Finally, a large empirical literature studies determinants of industry location. Holmes and
Stevens (2004) offer a summary assessment of the forces that determine industry location in the
United States, while Hanson (1998) reviews the literature on the effect of North American trade
integration on the location of economic activity. Amiti and Javorcik (2008) and Lu and Tao
(2009) document the determinants of firm and industry locations in China. Our empirical analysis
complements these studies, suggesting that international trade is an important driver of industry
location within China and that it may also be so in other developing countries that are open to
international trade but face high internal trade costs.

2       Model
Geography and Trade Costs The country consists of a set of locations arbitrarily arranged on
a map. We index locations by ℓ, and assume that only some locations can trade directly with the
rest of the world. Goods must cross through a port to be shipped internationally. As will be clear
below, the nature of our model implies that only the distance separating each location ℓ from its
nearest port matters for the equilibrium. Therefore, we assume without loss of generality that ℓ
represents the distance separating each location from its nearest port, and we denote all ports by
ℓ = 0. We let ℓ be the maximum distance between a location inside the country and its nearest
port.
    There are two industries, i ∈ {X, M }. There is an industry-specific international iceberg trade
                                                                          i
cost such that for each unit of i shipped from ℓ = 0, only e−τ0 units arrive in the rest of the world
(RoW). Within the country, iceberg trade costs are constant per unit of distance and equal τ1i in
                                                                                                   i   i
industry i. Therefore, for each unit of i that location ℓ ships to the RoW, only e−τ0 −τ1 ℓ units arrive.
    Given this geography, we can interpret each location ℓ = 0 as a seaport, airport, or international
land crossing. What is key is that not all locations have the same technology for trading with
the RoW. This will drive concentration near points with good access. Internal geography vanishes
when τ1i = 0 for i = X, M or ℓ = 0.

Endowments There are two factors of production, a mobile factor and an immobile one. We
refer to the mobile factor as workers, and to the immobile factor as land.1 We let λ (ℓ) be the total
amount of land available in locations at distance ℓ from their nearest port and normalize units so
that the national land endowment also equals one.2 Land is owned by immobile landlords who do
not work. We let N be the labor endowment at the national level and n (ℓ) denote employment
density in ℓ, which is to be determined in equilibrium since workers choose their location optimally.

Preferences        Both workers and landlords spend their income locally. The indirect utility of a
worker living in ℓ is
                                                               w (ℓ)
                                                    u(ℓ) =           ,                                              (1)
                                                               E(ℓ)
where w(ℓ) is the wage at ℓ, and E(ℓ) is the cost-of-living index. We let p(ℓ) ≡ PX (ℓ)/PM (ℓ) be the
relative price of X in ℓ. Since preferences are homothetic, there exists an increasing and concave
function e(p(ℓ)) that depends on the relative price of X such that E(ℓ) = PM (ℓ)e(p (ℓ)).
    For landlords, income equals rents r(ℓ) per unit of land and utility is therefore increasing in
r (ℓ) /E(ℓ). Accounting for both wages and rents, income generated by each unit of land at ℓ is
y (ℓ) = w (ℓ) n (ℓ) + r (ℓ).

    1
      The appendix presents an extension where both labor and capital are mobile factors used in production and
sectors can differ in labor intensity. In the empirical analysis we use data on both employment and capital to evaluate
the model’s prediction about the location of the mobile factor in different industries.
    2
      If the distribution of land is uniform, λ (ℓ) represents the measure of locations at distance ℓ from their nearest
port.


                                                           4
Technology       Production in each sector requires one unit of land to operate a technology with
decreasing returns to scale in labor. We let ni (ℓ) be employment per unit of land in industry i at
location ℓ. Profits per unit of land in sector i at ℓ are

                          πi (ℓ) = max {Pi (ℓ)qi [ni (ℓ)] − w(ℓ)ni (ℓ) − r (ℓ)} .                   (2)
                                   ni (ℓ)


The production technology is
                                                               ni (ℓ)1−αi
                                            qi [ni (ℓ)] = κi              ,                         (3)
                                                                 ai (ℓ)

where ai (ℓ) is the unit cost of production in industry i in sector ℓ and κi ≡ α−α
                                                                                i
                                                                                  i
                                                                                    (1 − αi )−(1−αi ) is
a normalization constant that saves notation later on. Decreasing returns to scale 1 − αi measure
the labor intensity in sector i, acting as a congestion force. From (3) it follows that the aggregate
production function in sector i at ℓ is Cobb-Douglas with land intensity αi . To simplify the
exposition, we assume that land intensity is the same across both sectors, αX = αM ≡ α, and
discuss the implications of differences in land intensity across sectors in Section 2.4.
   Industry-specific production costs {aM (ℓ) , aX (ℓ)} may vary across locations, subject to the
restriction that the relative cost of production is constant across the country:

                                      aX (ℓ)                 
                                             = a for all ℓ ∈ 0, ℓ .                                 (4)
                                      aM (ℓ)

Therefore, while some locations might be more productive than others in every industry,
comparative advantages are defined at the national level. In turn, a differs across countries, creating
incentives for international trade. In this way we retain the basic structure of a neoclassical model
of trade, where countries are differentiated by their comparative advantages.
   The solution to the firm’s problem yields labor demand per unit of land used by each sector i
in location ℓ,
                                                                1/α
                                    1−α               Pi (ℓ)
                           ni (ℓ) =                                     for i = X, M .              (5)
                                     α             ai (ℓ) w(ℓ)
Finally, we let λi (ℓ) be the total amount of land used by sector i = X, M at ℓ.

2.1   Local Equilibrium
We first define and characterize a local equilibrium at each location ℓ that takes prices
{PX (ℓ) , PM (ℓ)} and the real wage u∗ as given.

Definition 1 A local equilibrium at ℓ consists of population density n (ℓ), labor demands
{ni (ℓ)}i=X,M , patterns of land use {λi (ℓ)}i=X,M , and factor prices {w (ℓ) , r(ℓ)} such that

  1. workers maximize utility,
                                             u(ℓ) ≤ u∗ , = if n (ℓ) > 0;                            (6)



                                                          5
     2. profits are maximized,

                                      πi (ℓ) ≤ 0, = if λi (ℓ) > 0, for i = X, M,                                    (7)

         where πi (ℓ) is given by (2);

     3. land and labor markets clear,
                                                       X
                                                           λi (ℓ) = λ(ℓ),                                           (8)

     4. trade is balanced.

     Conditions 2-4 from this definition constitute a small Ricardian economy where the amount of
labor is given. In addition, employment density n (ℓ) at each location is determined by condition
1.
     We let pA be the autarky price in each location. By this, we mean the price prevailing in the
absence of trade with any other location or with RoW, but when labor mobility is allowed across
locations. The autarky price pA is the same and equal to a in all locations. Using (27), location ℓ
must be fully specialized in X when p (ℓ) > pA , and fully specialized in M when p (ℓ) < pA . Because
each location takes relative prices as given, this means that a trading location is fully specialized.
Only if p (ℓ) happens to coincide with pA may a trading location be incompletely specialized. This
logic also implies that an incompletely specialized location is in autarky.3
     To solve for the local wage w(ℓ) we note that whenever a location is populated, the local labor
supply decision (25) must be binding. Together with (5) and the market clearing conditions, this
gives the equilibrium population density in each location,4

     Expression (10) conveys the various forces that determine the location decision of workers.
Agents care about the effect of prices on both income and cost of living. Since preferences are
homothetic, agents employed in the industry-location pair (i, ℓ) necessarily enjoy a higher real
income when the local relative price of industry i is higher in location ℓ. That is, the positive
income effect from a higher relative price necessarily offsets cost-of-living effects. At the same time,
there are congestion forces captured by the intensity of land use α, so that workers avoid places with
     3
      In knife-edge cases where p(ℓ) = pA , a location can be indifferent between autarky or trade. In that case, a
location may trade and still be incompletely specialized.
    4
      This is a special case of the expression for density derived under more general conditions in equation (35) in the
appendix.


                                                            6
high employment density. The larger the congestion, the smaller the population density. Naturally,
agents also prefer locations with better fundamental productivity, i.e., lower ai (ℓ).
     We highlight that trade affects density through its effect on the relative price p (ℓ). When
p (ℓ) 6= pA , locations are fully specialized and necessarily export. In this circumstance n(ℓ) increases
with the relative price of the exported good and decreases with the national real wage u∗ .

2.2      General Equilibrium
We move on to the effect of market access (distance to the nearest international gate) on employment
density and the specialization pattern in general equilibrium. The country is a small economy taking
                             ∗ } as given.5 We denote the relative price at RoW by p∗ = P ∗ /P ∗ .
international prices {PX∗ , PM                                                           X    M
     We also define the average international and domestic iceberg costs across sectors, τj ≡
1   P        i                                                                          ′
2     i=X,M τj for j = 0, 1. No arbitrage implies that for any pair of locations ℓ and ℓ separated by
distance δ ≥ 0, relative prices in industry i satisfy

                                                        i
                                     Pi (ℓ′ )/Pi (ℓ) ≤ eτ1 δ for i = X, M .                                (11)

This condition binds if goods in industry i are shipped from ℓ to ℓ′ . A similar condition holds with
respect to RoW. Since all locations ℓ = 0 can trade directly with RoW at the same relative price,
(11) implies
                                          e−2τ0 ≤ p(0)/p∗ ≤ e2τ0 .                                         (12)

The first inequality is binding if the country exports X to RoW, while the second is if it imports
X. Therefore, for any location ℓ we have

                                         e−2τ1 ℓ ≤ p(ℓ)/p(0) ≤ e2τ1 ℓ ,                                    (13)

where the first inequality binds if ℓ exports X to RoW, and the second does if ℓ imports X.
     We are ready to define the general equilibrium of the economy:

Definition 2 (General Equilibrium) An equilibrium in a small economy given international
prices {PX∗ , PM∗ } consists of a real wage u∗ , local outcomes n (ℓ) , {n (ℓ)}
                                                                          i    i=X,M , {λi (ℓ)}i=X,M ,
w (ℓ) , r(ℓ), and goods prices {Pi (ℓ)}i=X,M such that

    It is straightforward to extend the model to a two-country general equilibrium in which the world prices are
endogenously determined.

   3. the real wage u∗ adjusts such that the national labor market clears,
                                                   Z       ℓ
                                                               n (ℓ) λ (ℓ) dℓ = N.                                 (14)
                                                       0


   Since Definition 1 of a local equilibrium includes trade balance for each location, trade is also
balanced at the national level. To characterize the regional patterns of specialization, we first note
that the no-arbitrage conditions rule out bilateral trade flows between any pair of locations within
the country. Since all locations share the same relative unit costs, there are no gains from trade
within the country. To see why, suppose that there is bilateral trade between two distinct locations
ℓX and ℓM . If ℓX is the X-exporting location of the pair, then p (ℓM ) ≤ pA ≤ p (ℓX ). But, at the
same time, the no-arbitrage condition (11) implies that the relative price of X is strictly higher in
ℓM , which is a contradiction. This implies that the country is in international autarky if and only
if all locations are in autarky and incompletely specialized.6
   With this in mind, we can characterize the general equilibrium. The country can be partitioned
into those locations that trade with RoW and those that stay in autarky. It follows that if the
                                                                        
country is not in international autarky there must be some boundary b ∈ 0, ℓ such that all locations
ℓ < b are fully specialized in the export-oriented industry. In turn, all locations ℓ > b do not trade
with the RoW and stay in autarky, while locations at distance b from their nearest international
gate are indifferent between trading or not with RoW.7 Therefore, an internal boundary b divides
the country between a trading coastal region comprising all locations ℓ ∈ [0, b) whose distance to the
nearest international gate is less than b and an autarkic interior region comprising the remaining
locations ℓ ∈ (b, ℓ].8
   This reasoning implies that the distance separating each location from its nearest international
gate is the only local fundamental that matters for specialization.                       This justifies our initial
statement that locations may be arbitrarily arranged on a map, as well as our decision to index
locations by their distance to the nearest port. In addition, any bilateral trade flow in the country
either originates from ports, or is directed toward them. These features allow us to represent
a two-dimensional geography on the line, leading to closed-form characterizations for aggregate

    6
      This outcome is akin to the spatial impossibility results in the tradition of Starrett (1978), whereby homogeneous
space and constant-returns-to-scale technologies lead to autarkic locations. In our setting, the only heterogeneity
across space is the distance to the port. Thus, if trade occurs, it is with the RoW. Of course, this lack of bilateral
internal trade is not a feature of the data. The model could be extended with product differentiation within sectors
to generate internal trade without affecting the regional specialization pattern.
    7
      To determine which locations belong in each set, we note that if the country is an exporter of X then all
locations that trade with RoW must also export X. Therefore, all locations ℓ such that e−2(τ0 +τ1 ℓ) p∗ < pA must
stay in autarky, for if they specialized in X then the relative price of X would be so low that it would induce
specialization in M . In the same way, all locations ℓ such that e−2(τ0 +τ1 ℓ) p∗ > pA must specialize in X, for if they
stayed in autarky then the relative price of M would be so high that it would induce domestic consumers to import
from abroad, violating the no-arbitrage condition (13).
    8
      The regional specialization pattern resembles a Von-Thünen type outcome. In the standard version of the Von-
Thünen model, as featured for example in Chapter 3 of Fujita and Thisse (2013), the pattern of specialization across
locations that trade with a central district is dictated by differences in trade costs or land intensity across goods. In
our context, differences between countries lead to specialization rings within the country.

equilibrium outcomes and making the model tractable for counterfactuals.
   Since all locations ℓ ∈ (b, ℓ] are in autarky, they are incompletely specialized and their relative
price is pA = a. Given this price in the autarkic region and the regional pattern of production,
the no-arbitrage conditions (12) and (13) generate the regional price distribution as function of the
internal boundary b. Henceforth, we assume that the economy is a net exporter of X, and below
we provide the conditions under which this is the case. Therefore, the distribution of local relative
prices is given by
                                                     p(ℓ) = p∗ e−2(τ0 +τ1 min[ℓ,b]) .                                                     (15)

   Using (10) in the aggregate labor-market clearing condition (14), we can solve for the real wage,
                                            "             Z                                          1/α        #α
                                                                  ℓ
                                          1−α 1                                     1      p(ℓ)
                                     u∗ =                             λ (ℓ)                                  dℓ        .                  (16)
                                           α N                0                   aX (ℓ) e (p(ℓ))

Since the relative price function in (15) depends on b, so does the real wage. To find the location
of the boundary b, we use the continuity of the relative price function:

                                                        p(b) ≥ pA , = if b < ℓ.                                                           (17)

When p(ℓ) > pA , then b = ℓ, so that the interior region does not exist. The general equilibrium
is fully characterized by the pair {u∗ , b} that solves (16) and (17). All other variables follow from
these two outcomes.
   Figure 1 illustrates the structure of the equilibrium when the economy exports good X but is
not fully specialized. On the horizontal axis, locations are ordered by their distance to their nearest
port. As we have already established, this is the only geographic aspect that determines the local
equilibrium. In the left panel, the relative price of the exported good declines with distance to the
port until it hits the autarky relative price, and remains constant afterward. The economy is fully


                                                                              9
specialized in X in the coastal region, but incompletely specialized in the interior. Only the coastal
locations ℓ ∈ [0, b] are commercially integrated with RoW.
   In the right panel, we plot population density assuming that the fundamental aX (ℓ) is constant
across locations, so that international trade is the only force that shapes the distribution of
population density. As the relative price of the export industry decreases away from international
gates, so does population density in the coastal region until it reaches the interior region. Hence,
international trade causes population to agglomerate near international gates relative to autarky.
   So far we have assumed a given trade pattern at the national level. It is simple to determine the
national trade pattern: it must be consistent with the trade pattern at ports. Therefore, as in a
model that lacks internal geography, the country exports X if pA /p∗ < e−2τ0 and is in international
autarky if e−2τ0 < pA /p∗ < e2τ0 . These results imply that domestic trade costs, while capable
of affecting the gains and the volume of international trade, are unable to impact the pattern or
the existence of it. In this context, the interior region exists if and only if e−2(τ0 +τ1 ℓ) < pA /p∗ ,
i.e., when trade costs {τ1 , τ0 } or the extension of land ℓ are sufficiently large, or when comparative
advantages, captured by pA /p∗ , are sufficiently weak.
   We summarize our findings so far as follows.

Proposition 1 (Regional Specialization Pattern) There is a unique general equilibrium, in
which: (i) if the country trades internationally but is not fully specialized, there exists an autarkic
                 
interior region b, ℓ that is incompletely specialized and a coastal region [0, b) that trades with RoW
and specializes in the export-oriented industry; and (ii) the national trade pattern is determined
independently from internal geography.

2.3   Impact of International and Domestic Trade Costs
The experience of many developing countries shows that international trade integration may be
associated with shifts in economic concentration and industry location. In our model, population
density varies across locations based on proximity to international gates, and population density
in the coastal region relative to the interior region is endogenous. We summarize the impact of a
discrete change in trade costs on these outcomes as follows.

Proposition 2 (Internal Migration) A reduction in international or in domestic trade costs
                                                                     
moves the boundary inland to b′ > b and causes migration from region c, ℓ into region [0, c] for
some c ∈ (b, b′ ). A lower τ0 causes population at the port n(0) to increase, but a lower τ1 causes
n(0) to decrease.

   The direct impact of a reduction in trade costs is that the relative price of the exported industry
increases in the coastal region, [0, b). In the case of a reduction in τ0 , the shift is uniform across
locations, while a lower τ1 results in a flattening of the slope of relative prices toward the interior.
In both cases, the change in prices causes the relative price at b to be larger than the autarky
price pA , so that locations at the boundary now find it profitable to specialize in export-oriented
industries and the boundary moves inland.

   What are the internal migration patterns associated with these reductions in trade costs? A
natural consequence of lower trade costs is an increase in the real wage, u∗ . Since in the autarkic
interior region relative prices remain constant, labor demand shrinks. As a result, workers migrate
away from locations that remain autarkic toward the coast, and relative population density increases
in the coastal region as result.
   Figure 2 illustrates these effects. The solid black line reproduces the initial equilibrium from
Figure 1. The dashed-double-dotted red line represents a new equilibrium with lower international
trade costs. The price function shifts upward and the intercept increases from p (0) to p1 (0),
increasing population density at the port to n1 (0). Locations in [b, b′ ] start trading, but the newly
specialized locations [c, b′ ] lose population. The dashed-dotted blue line shows the effect of a
reduction in domestic trade costs. Prices at the port stay constant, but the slope flattens. As a
result, population density at the port shrinks to n2 (0). In relative terms, locations at intermediate
distances become more attractive when domestic trade costs decline. In both cases, population
density is higher in [0, c] in the new equilibrium.
   We move now to the impact of domestic trade costs τ1 on the gains from international trade.
We study the impact of trade costs on the real wage u∗ , but we note that average real returns to
land as well as national real income are proportional to the real wage u∗ . Therefore trade costs
have the same impact on the average real returns to both mobile and immobile factors.
   We can consider two extreme cases. As τ1 → ∞, domestic trade becomes prohibitive so that
b → 0 and the country approaches international autarky. In that case, all locations face the same
relative price p (ℓ) = pA . We let ua be the real wage in that circumstance. In the other extreme,
when τ1 = 0, then b = ℓ, and all locations face the relative price p (ℓ) = p(0). In that case, the real
wage is                                                       α

neoclassical model, the real wage is increasing in the terms of trade, which are captured by p(0).
Diminishing returns to labor causes the real wage to decrease with the national labor endowment.
   Using the solution for the real wage u∗ from (16), the actual gains of moving from autarky to
trade can be broken down as follows,

                                                   u∗                 u

   The actual gains from trade, u∗ /ua , equal the potential gains from trade without domestic
trade costs, u/ua , adjusted by Ω (τ1 , b). This function captures the impact of internal geography
on the gains from trade. It is a weighted average of the losses caused by domestic trade costs in
each location, with weights that correspond to each location’s absolute productivity level and land
endowment relative to the country aggregate. In turn, the location-specific losses from domestic
trade costs are captured by the reduction in the terms of trade caused by distance. The total
friction, Ω (τ1 , b), is strictly below 1 as long as τ1 > 0, and it equals 1 if τ1 = 0.
   How do the gains from trade depend on domestic trade costs? Naturally, the larger the size of the
export-oriented region, the more a country should benefit from trade. Since τ1 causes the export-
oriented region to shrink, the gains from trade decrease with domestic trade costs. Intuitively, a
lower τ1 makes exporting profitable for locations further away from the port, allowing economic
activity to spread out and mitigate the congestion forces in dense coastal areas.
                                                                                     ′ (p)
   To formalize this, we define the elasticity of the consumer price index, ε(p) = ee(p)   p, and let s (ℓ)
be the share of location ℓ in total employment. Given a shock to p∗ , τ0 , or τ1 , total differentiation
of the labor clearing condition (14) and the condition (17) for b yield the change in the real wage:

gains from a reduction in trade costs, either domestic or international, as a function of the

relative price change faced by export-oriented locations weighted by their population shares s (ℓ).
Reductions in domestic or international trade costs cause the relative price of the exported good to
increase. This has a positive effect on revenues and a negative effect on the cost of living. The latter
is captured by the price-index elasticity ε(p (ℓ)), and mitigates the total gains. In this context, (20)
implies that the gains from an improvement in the terms of trade, caused by either lower τ0 or
larger p∗ , are bounded above by the share of employment in export-oriented regions.9
   It follows from this reasoning that domestic and international trade costs are complementary,
in that the gains from international trade are decreasing in domestic trade costs. Larger τ1 causes
relative export prices to decrease faster toward the interior, reducing the gains from trade:10

   This aggregate effect of trade-cost reductions hides distributional effects between immobile
factors located in different points of the country. The real returns to immobile factors at location
ℓ are v (ℓ) ≡ r (ℓ) /E (ℓ). The change in these returns at ℓ when there are marginal changes in
international or domestic trade costs is

                                              1                         1−α ∗

The first term measures the impact of relative price changes through both revenues and cost of
living. The second part considers the economy-wide increase in real wages, which captures the
emigration of mobile factors.
   Consider first the interior locations ℓ ∈ (b, ℓ]. In these places, pb (ℓ) = 0 because distance precludes
terms of trade improvements, but mobile factors emigrate with trade reform because of the real
wage increase. As a result, immobile factors in the interior (b, ℓ] region lose from lower trade costs.
However, some immobile factors located in the coastal areas ℓ ∈ [0, b) necessarily gain. Hence,
reductions in both international and domestic trade costs generate redistribution of resources away
from the interior to the coastal region.
   However, outcomes for immobile resources in the coastal region are not uniformly positive. While
on average the coastal region necessarily gains from improvements in international or domestic trade
conditions, reductions in domestic trade costs τ1 necessarily hurt immobile factors located at the
port. In other words, coastal areas are better off if places further inside the country have poorer
access to world markets.
   We summarize these results as follows.

trade costs, while on average the coastal locations [0, b) gain. There is some ε < b such that real
income of immobile factors in locations [0, ε) decreases with reductions in domestic trade costs.

    These distributional effects give rise to an inverted-U shape for inequality across immobile factors
with internal integration. When the country is open to trade and τ1 → ∞, all locations other than
the port are autarkic. Reducing internal trade costs leads to an initial increase in regional income
inequality by expanding the coastal region and thus benefiting newly integrated locations. But as
τ1 → 0, internal geography vanishes and outcomes are again symmetric in all locations within the
country, eliminating income differences across locations.

2.4      Extensions
The benchmark model developed so far is purposely stylized to highlight the key forces of our
analysis. In Appendix A we characterize the local equilibrium and specialization patterns in
more general model that allows for a non-tradable sector, location-specific amenities, capital as
an additional (mobile) factor of production, and differences in capital and land intensity across
sectors.
    When the benchmark model is extended to allow for αX 6= αM , so that land intensity may vary
across sectors, the equilibrium features highlighted in Proposition 1 remain unchanged under a
condition similar to (4). In that case, local autarky prices are the same in all locations, independent
of their labor endowments, if and only if aX (ℓ)αM /aM (ℓ)αX is constant for all ℓ.11 If this condition
holds, we ensure that the economy retains the dual-economy structure that we have described.12
    In turn, when the benchmark model is extended to allow for capital as an additional factor of
production, comparative advantages at the national level are also determined by factor endowments
as in the Heckscher-Ohlin model. In Appendix A we show that, if sector X is labor intensive, then it
is the export-oriented sector if the national labor-land ratio n is sufficiently large. In the empirical
analysis, we use industry labor intensity as a proxy for industry export orientation.


3        Comparative Advantage and Regional Specialization in China
The central mechanism of the model, from which its welfare and distributional implications stem,
is the regional specialization pattern in export-oriented industries: due to the interaction between
national comparative advantages and internal trade costs, export-oriented industries locate closer
to international gates. This industry-location margin is not present in recent models of trade and
internal geography such as Ramondo et al. (2014), Redding (2014), or Allen and Arkolakis (2013).


    11
      From Appendix A we have that the autarky price pA (ℓ) corresponds to the unique value of p (ℓ) such that
ωX (ℓ) = ωY (ℓ), where ωi (ℓ) is defined in (34).
   12
      When αM 6= αX , conditions (2)-(4) of the local equilibrium constitute a small Hecksher-Ohlin economy where
the autarky price may in principle depend on factor endowments. However, labor mobility implies that the labor
density is higher in places with more land abundance. This offsets the factor proportions effect, turning each local
economy into a small Ricardian economy.


                                                        14
   We now turn to an empirical examination of this mechanism using data from China. We
examine whether industries in which China has comparative advantages relative the rest of the
world are more likely to locate in places with better access to international markets. We proxy
for comparative advantages with national export-output ratios, and also rely on the argument
that China’s comparative advantages lie on labor-intensive industries and proxy for comparative
advantages using industry labor intensities from the United States.
   Several factors make China a particularly suitable country for this exercise. Its rising external
trade has been largely driven by its comparative advantages based on factor endowments. Before
market-oriented reforms, it has been described as a closed agricultural economy with an economic
structure lacking in industrial specialization and agglomeration (Chan et al. 2008). After the
reforms, increased industrial output and exports have been fueled by—among other factors—a
sustained wave of migration of workers into coastal regions (World Bank 2009).13

3.1    Data
Our regional data of Chinese industries is aggregated up from the firm-level Annual Survey of
Industrial Production conducted by the Chinese government’s National Bureau of Statistics. The
Annual Survey is a census of private firms with more than 5 million yuan (about $600,000) in
revenue and all state-owned firms. It covers 338 mainland prefectures and 425 manufacturing
industries in 4-digit CSIS Chinese classification system between the years 1998-2007.14                         Each
industry-prefecture-year cell has information on employment, capital, revenue, value added, and
exports by state-owned and private enterprises.15
   To this data, we add the distance of each prefecture to China’s coastline. More precisely,
we calculate the Euclidian distance from the administrative center of a prefecture to that of the
nearest coastal prefecture. There are 53 coastal prefectures with zero distance and the median is
275 miles. An alternative distance measure using as terminal points those prefectures which host
main international seaports generates similar results since these facilities are scattered somewhat
uniformly across the Pacific seaboard (see the map in the appendix). As reported below, an
alternative measure based on travel times also generates similar results.
   Several characteristics of China’s geography and trade suggest that distance to the coast is a
good measure of foreign market access. Maritime transportation is the primary mode of shipping in
external trade, while exports over land to bordering countries account for a small share (6.7 percent)
of total exports (authors’ calculation using 2006 UN Comtrade data). The share of air shipments

   13
      China’s Household Registration System, also known as the Hukou system, was relaxed during 1980s as part of
market-oriented reforms. The current Hukou system limits the access of migrant workers to certain amenities, such as
education and health, that are financed by local taxes. While the Hukou constitutes a cost to labor mobility, regional
wage differentials have been sufficiently large to promote large migration flows to coastal provinces. See World Bank
(2009).
   14
      Prefectures are the second level of the Chinese administrative structure, contained within 31 provinces in
mainland China. Due to administrative reclassifications, mostly before 2002, the number of prefectures and industries
varies slightly over the years.
   15
      The underlying firm-level data has been recently used by Hsieh and Klenow (2009) and Roberts et al. (2011).


                                                         15
in exports to top-20 trade partners is just 17.4 percent (Harrigan and Deng 2010). While inland
rivers play an important role in freight transportation in general, their export share is limited.
Inland river ports, most of which are also in close proximity to the sea, constitute only 20 percent
of port capacity (in terms of tonnage) suitable for international trade (authors’ calculation using
data from Chinese Statistical Agency).
   To carry out the empirical exercise, we need an industry-level measure of Chinese comparative
advantages against the rest of the world. One possibility is to use proxies constructed from actual
exports data such as the industry export-revenue ratio. While this measure correlates with the
underlying variation in relative productivity in which we are interested, to avoid endogeneity
concerns it is desirable to use an industry measure that both proxies for comparative advantages
and is exogenous to the Chinese environment. In what follows, we use export-revenue ratios for
descriptive purposes, but also incorporate a second industry-specific measure, labor-capital ratio
in the US, to proxy for Chinese comparative advantages. In doing so, we draw on the notion that
China has a comparative advantage in labor intensive industries.16
   To construct industry-specific labor-capital ratios in the US, we use the publicly available NBER-
CES Manufacturing Industry Database and divide production worker hours by the total real capital
stock for each industry.17 The NAICS 2002 classification—in which the US data is reported—can
be mapped to the CSIS Chinese classification by using the official concordance between CSIS and
ISIC Rev. 3 as a bridge. This reduces the number of industries to 120, still leaving us with enough
variation to conduct our analysis. The US labor-capital ratio has a correlation coefficient of 0.6 with
the Chinese labor-capital ratio, and a correlation coefficient of 0.4 with the Chinese export-revenue
ratio. Table 1 in the appendix provides further summary statistics.

3.2    Preliminary Analysis
As a preliminary check, we visualize the drop in regional openness toward the interior of the
country. We average industry-prefecture level observations over time and calculate export shares
in prefectures’ revenues. Denoting industries by i, prefectures by p, and time by t, average regional
export share (in logarithm) at the prefecture level is

where (Xipt , Ript ) stand for total exports and revenue at the industry-prefecture-year level. Panel
A of Figure 3 plots this variable against the natural logarithm of the prefecture-specific distance
measure introduced above. As expected, regional openness declines with distance. The elasticity
is -0.73 and highly significant.

      In Appendix A we develop an extension to the model where capital is also used in production. At the national
level, comparative advantages are determined as in the Heckscher-Ohlin model, so that X is the export-oriented
sector if it is labor intensive and the country is sufficiently labor abundant.
   17
      With Cobb-Douglas technologies and common factor prices across sectors, industry labor intensities can be
measured by labor-capital ratios.

Notes: In both panels, x-axis is ln(Distancep + 1), i.e. we add one to distance before taking the logarithm in order to keep
coastal prefectures in the figure. In panel A, each observation is a prefecture, in panel B, each observation is an industry. In
panel B, distance refers to average industry distance defined in the text. While all prefectures and industries have positive
aggregate revenue, some report zero exports. We thus also add 1 to aggregate exports to include them in figures, but fit the
regression lines to observations with strictly positive distance and exports.



   The model generates this negative distance gradient for regional export shares through intensive
and extensive margins. The mechanism of interest, however, is the latter, i.e., the change in industry
composition against comparative-advantage industries toward the interior of the country.                                                                                                                To
preliminary assess whether declining regional export shares reflect this type of industry composition,
Panel B of Figure 3 plots industries’ export-revenue ratio at the national level (i.e., the share of
exports in total industry revenue) against “industry distance” in logarithmic scale. The former
variable equals                                                                                                                                                            

Industry distance is defined as the employment-weighted average of prefecture distances:

                                                                                       p

where Distancep is prefecture p’s distance and Lip is industry i’s employment in prefecture p
averaged over time. Therefore, the larger Distancei is, the farther industry i is located from
the coast. If the gradient from Panel A was exclusively generated by an intensive margin there
would not be a definite relationship between the industry export share and the industry distance.
However, Panel B shows that, on average, industries with higher export intensity at the national
level are situated closer to the seaboard. The distance elasticity is -1.126 and variation in industry
distance captures around 43 percent of the variation in industry export intensity.
   The following subsection provides a more thorough examination using a rich set of controls and
an exogenous measure of industry comparative advantages.


                                                                                                       17
3.3    Regression Analysis
Our econometric analysis is based on regressions of the form,

                        Yip = βZip + θ · Distancep × ExportOrientationi + ǫip .                                 (23)

   Depending on the specification, the dependent variable is a function of employment (Lip ), capital
stock (Kip ) or export orientation in industry-prefecture cells. The baseline linear specification
uses observations with strictly positive employment or capital levels. We also estimate a Poisson
pseudo-maximum likelihood regression using all observations, including those with zero activity.
In a separate exercise, we investigate the extensive margin of industry presence using linear and
nonlinear specifications when the dependent variable is binary, taking the value one if Lip > 0, and
zero otherwise.
   On the right hand side, the variable of interest is the interaction between Distancep ,
the prefecture-specific distance measure, and ExportOrientationi , an industry-specific export
orientation measure. As discussed above, we use two variables here: Chinese export-revenue ratios
(CN XRi ) and US labor-capital ratios (U SLKi ).18
   Our model predicts a negative coefficient θ < 0, i.e., export-oriented industries should be more
likely to locate closer to the coast.19 Depending on the specification, the set of other covariates Zip
includes direct effects of the interacted variables or various fixed effects.
   In all the regressions where U SLKi is used, we only exploit the cross-sectional variation from
our data by taking time averages over 1998-2007. The data on export-revenue ratios (CN XRit )
allows us to investigate our model prediction on regional specialization not only in cross-section
but also in the panel dimension. The model predicts that, in a period of trade liberalization,
industries that increase export-output ratios increase their presence closer to coastlines. In addition
to the cross-sectional specifications described above, we estimate a separate panel regression with
industry-specific fixed effects using the export-revenue ratios.
   Table 2 reports the baseline cross-sectional results using time averages for all variables when the
dependent variable is the natural logarithm of employment (Columns 1-2), capital (Columns 3-4)
or the level of export-output ratio (Columns 5-6), using nonzero observations. Columns 2, 4 and
6 feature industry and prefecture fixed effects. Panel A uses export-revenue ratios and Panel B
uses industry capital-labor ratios as proxy for industry comparative advantages. Standard errors
are clustered at the prefecture level. As expected, regional employment, capital stock and export
orientation decline with distance, reflecting the gradient of population density and economic activity
in China. The coefficient of interest on the interaction term is negative and highly significant in all
specifications.
  18
      As an alternative measure of export orientation, we also use the Balassa (1965) revealed comparative advantage
(CN RCA) index. The correlation between CN RCA and CN XR is around 0.7, and the results are both qualitatively
and quantitatively very similar. RCA based results are available from the authors upon request.
   19
      In the model, the export-revenue ratio at the national level is positive for the comparative-advantage industry
and zero for the import-competing industry. Adding product differentiation to the model would generate positive
export-revenue ratios for both industries.


                                                         18
   To give a sense of the economic importance of the results, we use the interaction coefficients
equal to -0.288 and -2.9 reported in the second column of panel A and B, respectively. Consider
an industry with an average export-revenue ratio of 0.21. Moving inland by 275 miles, which is the
median distance from the coast across prefectures, decreases regional employment by 17 percent
for such an industry. The same decline is 32 percent for an industry with an export-revenue ratio
one standard deviation (equal to 0.19) higher than the average. These magnitudes are 13 and 21
percent for the average and high labor-intensity industries, respectively. This is a fairly sizeable
impact on regional specialization.20
   Given the high level of spatial and industry disaggregation in our data, it is natural that not
all industries will be observed in every prefecture. Approximately 58 percent of all prefecture-
industry combinations in our data report zero employment. To exploit this extensive margin
variation, we define the dependent variable in the estimation equation (23) as a binary variable
that takes the value one if industry i has positive employment in prefecture p at time t, and zero
otherwise.21 Using the same explanatory variables, we estimate the probability of industry presence
under various specifications and report the results in Table 3. The results from a probit model
are reported in column 1. To avoid the incidental parameter problem, we introduce fixed effects
through conditional logit and linear probability models in columns 2-4. Except for the conditional
logit models using U SLK as the export orientation measure, the interaction coefficient is negative
and highly significant, indicating an increasing probability of regional presence for export oriented
industries as one gets closer to the ocean. The linear probability model in the fourth column
implies that the probability of observing an industry with an export-revenue ratio that is one
standard deviation higher than the average increases by around one percent in response to a one
percent decrease in distance.
   Our next specification, reported in Table 4, identifies the effect within industry-prefectures over
time using the Chinese export-revenue ratio as the trade measure. Instead of separate industry
and prefecture fixed effects, now we use industry-prefecture fixed effects in order to control for
unobserved, time-invariant factors that affect economic outcomes at the industry-prefecture level.
In columns 2 and 4, we also include industry-year and prefecture-year fixed effects. The interaction
coefficient is still significantly negative, implying that the previously estimated effects are not solely
due to cross-sectional variation: employment (or capital stock) in industries that have become more
export-oriented at the national level during the data period increased relatively more in prefectures
close to China’s seaboard.




   20
      As Table 1 shows, mean export-revenue ratio across all years is 0.21 with a standard deviation of 0.19. Since
distance is measured in 100 miles, we multiply −0.288 · 0.40 · 2.75 = −0.317.
   21
      Out of 147,030 observations, there are only 509 cells with zero employment and a strictly positive capital stock,
and 104 cases with the reverse pattern. Thus, using an alternative definition of industry presence as having positive
levels of both employment and capital doesn’t have a noticeable effect on results.


                                                          19
3.4   Alternative Mechanisms
We now examine alternative mechanisms that could also generate this empirical pattern. First,
our approach to explaining regional specialization complements explanations based on location
fundamentals such as Courant and Deardorff (1992) and on external economies of scale as in
Rossi-Hansberg (2005). Following these views, it could be that, closer to international gates, either
endowments or externalities drive high relative productivity in specific industries which then become
export oriented.
   In light of these forces, we should observe that relative productivity in export-oriented industries
decreases as we move away from international gates. To inspect if this pattern is present in China
we replace the dependent variable in the estimation equation (23) with measures of local industry
productivity. We define value added per worker and per unit of capital as

                                  V alueAddedip                    V alueAddedip
                        V Lip =                 ,        V Kip =                 ,
                                       Lip                              Kip

and regress the natural logarithms of these variables on the interaction variable of interest and
fixed effects. The results are in Table 5. We expect a negative interaction if these alternative
explanations are driving the regional specialization patterns that we find.
   While there is a negative gradient for labor productivity when CN XR is used to proxy export
orientation (first column of panel A), capital productivity increases toward coastal prefectures for
industries with higher export orientation using either measure (second column of panel A and B).
However, this is not robust to excluding state-owned enterprises while constructing the regional
data. Doing this renders the interaction coefficient on capital productivity significant at 10 percent
only (fourth column, both panels), pointing toward the existence of unproductive, capital-intensive,
state-owned enterprises located in interior prefectures, operating in industries with low export
orientation. These capital-intensive industries are not major exporters: the correlation between
the industry-wide capital-labor ratio (in China) and industry-wide export-revenue ratio is -0.3.
Therefore, interior state-owned enterprises in capital-intensive industries create the impression that
coastal prefectures have higher value added per unit of capital in export-oriented industries. A
likely explanation for this pattern lies in Chinese regional planning strategy in the pre-reform
era, which located heavy industries in interior provinces for national security purposes (see Gao
2004). Hence, while we find some association between the market-access gradient for the location
of export-oriented industries and their productivity gradient, the relationship is weak once state-
owned enterprises are excluded.
   Second, our approach also complements explanations within the New Economic Geography
tradition of Krugman (1991). In this view, industries with larger scale economies are more likely
to locate in regions with high population density or close to gateways to large markets. Hanson
and Xiang (2004) show that this mechanism is empirically relevant in international trade, i.e., more
differentiated industries concentrate in large countries. Therefore, the specialization pattern that
we find could result from industries with larger returns to scale situating closer to the seaboard,


                                                    20
where many of the largest Chinese cities are historically located. Given that location, it is possible
that these industries in turn become exporters to the rest of the world. Also, such industries
are likely to have higher intra-industry trade, which would make the export-revenue measure less
precise in capturing underlying comparative advantages.
   To control for this channel, we follow Hanson and Xiang (2004) and use industry elasticities
of substitution as a measure of scale economies.22 We use the estimates of trade elasticities by
Broda and Weinstein (2006) and let EOSi denote the elasticity of substitution for sector i. If
home-market effects are the only force that matters for the location of export-oriented industries
at lower distances, EOSi would be expected to pick up the distance gradient estimated before. We
thus re-estimate our baseline relationship in equation (23) by including the interaction of EOSi
with distance and report the results in Table 6.23 We also include controls for industry-specific
measures of trade costs to control for the possibility that sectors with high trade-costs also locate
closer large markets. In particular, we use two measures of trade costs: the weight/value ratio
and the ratio of CIF charges to the value of imports calculated from the Census US Imports of
Merchandise data.
   The interaction between EOSi is positive and typically significant, implying that more
differentiated industries (lower EOSi ) locate relatively closer to seaboards. This confirms that
home market effects based on product differentiation are an important determinant of industry
location in China. However, the main interaction term between distance and industry export
orientation remains stable with a negative sign and statistically significant.

3.5     Robustness
To check the robustness of the baseline results, we first replicate the intensive margin analysis
with a specification that allows us to include observations with zero employment in the estimation.
Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006) have shown that the Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood (PPML)
estimator is well behaved in datasets with many zeros. Their implementation is motivated by the
need to estimate gravity equations without excluding bilateral country pairs with zero trade flows,
but the methodology is applicable to a wide range of estimations with nonnegative and continuous
dependent variables. Table 7 reports the results. In these specifications, the dependent variable
is the absolute level of employment and capital stock at the industry-prefecture level, including
observations with a zero. While it is not possible to directly compare the coefficients from the
non-linear PPML estimators with our baseline linear estimates in Table 2, we still find a highly
significant negative effect of the distance-exports interaction on regional specialization patterns.

   22
      In Krugman (1980), higher product differentiation, captured by a lower elasticity of substitution, leads to larger
revenues per worker and accentuates the returns to scale. Clearly, there may be other industry-specific characteristics
related to returns to scale, such as product differentiation on the inputs side.

      As expected, industry-level elasticities are negatively correlated with export orientation. A log-log regression
of EOSi on export-revenue ratio gives a statistically significant elasticity of −0.96 with an R2 of 0.36. In order
to use Broda and Weinstein elasticities, we concord Chinese industry classification CSIS to 3-digit SITC industries
using as a bridge the official concordance between CSIS and ISIC Revision 3. This procedure reduces the number of
observations since the mappings are not one-to-one.


                                                          21
   In Table 8, we replicate the specification presented in columns 2 and 4 of Table 2 by excluding
from the sample 34 prefectures in three large, autonomous interior provinces of China (Inner
Mongolia, Tibet and Xinjiang, marked with red triangles in Figure 4), or 53 coastal provinces
with zero distance. The three interior regions that we exclude (columns 1 and 3) are among the
least industrialized parts of China. Their autonomy may also subject them to a different policy
environment. Since many large Chinese cities are historically on the eastern seaboard, excluding
coastal prefectures (columns 2 and 4) is a robustness check on the effect of cities. Another concern
addressed by this robustness check is that the first special export zones (SEZs) established in the
early 1980s as part of China’s gradual reforms were all coastal.24
   Excluding autonomous interior prefectures significantly increases the absolute value of the
interaction coefficient. For example, when employment is the dependent variable and US labor
intensity is the trade measure, the distance gradient for export-oriented industries increases from
2.9 to 5.25. Similarly, when the dependent variable is capital, the gradient increases from 2.55 to
4.15. These changes suggest that while activity in export-oriented industries shrinks sharply from
the coast to the immediate interior of the country, the decline is less pronounced as one reaches the
remote interior.
   Excluding coastal prefectures from the sample has the opposite effect: the interaction coefficient
shrinks in absolute value, indicating the high levels of export orientation in coastal prefectures. In
the case of capital, it drops from 0.216 to 0.057 and is only significant at the 10 percent level when
Chinese industry-wide export-revenue ratio is the trade measure (4th columns in the top panel of
Tables 2 and 8). Still, the coefficient is of the expected sign and highly significant in other cases.
Thus, while coastal prefectures may display disproportionately high levels of activity in export-
orientated industries, the baseline intensive margin results do not exclusively rely on their presence
in the sample.
   In the extensive margin, however, the message is different. Table 9 replicates the results of the
fourth column in Table 3 (the linear probability model). The first two columns in Table 9 impose
the same sample restrictions by excluding the remote interior and the coast. As in the intensive
margin, the gradient of industry presence gets steeper when interior provinces are dropped, but the
coefficient reverses sign and loses significance when coastal prefectures are excluded.
   The last two columns of Table 9 check the robustness of the extensive margin results to excluding
state-owned enterprises (column 3) and to clustering the standard errors at the more conservative
level of provinces.25 The loss of significance in the case of province-level clustering is consistent
with the result obtained when coastal prefectures are excluded: most of the variation in the baseline
extensive margin seems to be coming from the steep drop in the probability of observing an industry



   24
      The four SEZs established in 1979 were coastal. An additional 14 port cities in eight coastal provinces were
declared SEZs in 1984. The policy experiment, however, quickly spread to the rest of the country. By 1992, more
than half of Chinese municipalities had a SEZ with the majority being in the interior (Wang 2013).
   25
      The intensive margin results are robust to both of these changes. In order to keep the analysis focused, we do
not report them in Table 8, but all additional results are available from the authors upon request.


                                                        22
as one moves away from coastal prefectures.26 Thus, our robustness checks suggest that immediate
proximity to the seaboard and ports seems to be a big advantage in attracting export-oriented
industries in China. Conditional on regional presence, however, there is still a significant decline
in industry activity beyond the coast.
    In Table 10, we assess the robustness of the panel data outcomes to the four alternative
specifications tried above. The first two and bottom panels show that the results are robust to
excluding state-owned enterprises and autonomous interior provinces from the sample, as well as
clustering at the province-level. As in the extensive margin analysis, however, the panel data results
are not robust to excluding coastal prefectures. All 3 columns in Panel C indicate the lack of a
statistically significant relationship between export-orientation and industry location over time.
    Finally, as an alternative measure of foreign market access, we use the natural logarithm of travel
time (in hours) to the nearest international port obtained from Google Maps. Table 11 confirms
that the interaction term remains negative and significant.


4        Conclusion
We developed a theory that combines a neoclassical international trade structure with an internal
geography. In the model, international trade creates a partition between a commercially integrated
coastal region with high population density and an interior region where immobile factors are
poorer. Reductions in domestic or international trade costs generate migration to the coastal region
and net welfare losses for immobile factors in the interior region. Qualitatively, these outcomes are
consistent with the spatial structure of economic activity in large developing countries such as
China or India where coastal regions integrated with the rest of the world coexist with remote and
commercially isolated corners within the country.
    A key feature of the model is that comparative-advantage industries at the national level locate
closer to international gates. We find evidence consistent with this pattern in industry-level data
from Chinese prefectures. Previous work in economic geography and international trade highlights
the importance of relative productivities and scale economies for industry location, but these
channels do not fully account for the patterns that we find. A full quantitative evaluation of
the relative importance of the forces in our model relative to other mechanisms in shaping industry
location is outside the scope of this paper and would be an interesting question for future research.




    26
     When estimated with the probit model, the extensive margin coefficient remains significantly negative when we
cluster at the province-level. To be conservative, we only report the outcomes that are not robust to alternative
specifications.

APPENDIX
A1: Derivation of Equilibrium Outcomes
We characterize local-equilibrium outcomes in a model that, in addition to the ingredients in the
baseline model, also allows for a nontradable sector (with share 1 − βT in consumption), location-
specific amenities m (ℓ), capital as an additional factor of production (with share 1−γi in production
per unit of land in sector i), and differences in land intensity αi across sectors. The model in the
text corresponds to the case when βT = γi = 1, for all i, m (ℓ) = 1 for all ℓ, and αX = αM .
   Utility of an agent who lives in ℓ is m (ℓ) CT (ℓ)βT CN (ℓ)1−βT , where CT (ℓ) is a consumption
basket of tradables that includes X and M , CN (ℓ) is consumption of nontradables, and m (ℓ) is
the level of amenities at ℓ. (The preferences in equation (1) in the text are the special case when
βT = m (ℓ) = 1.)
   The land endowment λ (ℓ) in each location is owned by immobile landowners that consume where
they live. There are two types of mobile agents: workers (who own only labor) and capital-owners
(who own only capital).
                                                               w(ℓ)
   Indirect utility of a worker who lives in ℓ is u(ℓ) = m (ℓ) E(ℓ) , where w(ℓ) is the wage at ℓ, and
E(ℓ) is the cost-of-living index, which includes the (homothetic) price index for tradables ET (ℓ)
and the price of nontradables PN (ℓ):

                               E (ℓ) = ET (PX (ℓ), PM (ℓ))βT PN (ℓ)1−βT .                              (24)

We let p(ℓ) ≡ PX (ℓ)/PM (ℓ) be the relative price in sector X, so that there exists an increasing and
concave function e(p(ℓ)) satisfying ET (ℓ) = PM (ℓ)e (p (ℓ)). The (endogenous) real wage, common
to all locations in equilibrium, is u∗ .
   Indirect utility of a capital-owner is m (ℓ) rE(ℓ)
                                                 k (ℓ)
                                                       , where rk (ℓ) is the return to each unit of capital.
Capital owners are mobile both across locations within the country and between the country and
the rest of the world, where they can obtain an outside option rk∗ .
   Demand for nontradables per unit of land in ℓ is cN (ℓ) = (1 − βT ) y (ℓ) /PN (ℓ), where y (ℓ) is
income per unit of land at ℓ. Income in each location is generated by land, capital, and labor, so
that y (ℓ) = [w (ℓ) n (ℓ) + rk (ℓ) k (ℓ) + r (ℓ)] λ (ℓ), where k (ℓ) is the endogenous capital density.
   The technology to produce output per unit of land is

intensity per unit of land is γi (the production technologies defined in (3) in the text are the special
case when γi → 1).
   The local equilibrium definition is similar to Definition 1, with the following additions: the
nontradable market clears, the market-clearing conditions include land and labor used in the

are equalized throughout the country. Specifically, a local equilibrium at ℓ consists of population
density n (ℓ), capital density k (ℓ), labor and capital demands {ni (ℓ) , ki (ℓ)}i=X,M , patterns of land
use {λi (ℓ)}i=X,M , and factor prices {w (ℓ) , r(ℓ), rk (ℓ)} such that

Specialization Patterns

From (32), if λi (ℓ) > 0 then ωi (ℓ) ≤ ωj (ℓ) for i, j = X, M and i 6= j. Also, note that ωX (ℓ) is
increasing in p (ℓ) and ωM (ℓ) is strictly decreasing in p (ℓ), so that the wage-rental ratio increases
with the relative price of the good exported by the location. Therefore, the local economy is fully
specialized in X when p (ℓ) > pA (ℓ) and fully specialized in M when p (ℓ) < pA (ℓ), where pA (ℓ)
is the the unique value of p (ℓ) such that ωX (ℓ) = ωY (ℓ). As mentioned in section (2.4), this
implies that if βT = m (ℓ) = 1 but αX 6= αM , then pA (ℓ) is independent from ℓ if and only if
aX (ℓ)αM /aM (ℓ)αX is independent from ℓ.
   Since the local economy is incompletely specialized in autarky, pA (ℓ) must be the autarky price.
When αX = αM (so that both tradable sectors use capital with the same intensity) then:

                                                                  δM −δX
                                                            u∗         βT        aX (ℓ)
                                        pA (ℓ) =                                        .
                                                            rk∗                  aM (ℓ)

                                                                                                                            aX (ℓ)
In this case, we have as in the main text that pA (ℓ) is the same across locations when                                     aM (ℓ)   = a. In
addition, comparative advantages at the national level are also determined by factor endowments
as in the Heckscher-Ohlin model. Assuming that sector X is labor intensive (γX > γM , which
implies δM > δX ) and the national labor-land ratio n is sufficiently large (so that u∗ , and therefore
the relative autarky price of X, pA , is small enough) implies that X is the export-oriented sector.

Employment Density

To solve for population density n (ℓ), we combine the labor and capital demand derived from (31)
with the market clearing conditions (28) to (30), the labor and capital mobility conditions (25) and
(26), and the market clearing condition in the non-traded sector. When a local economy is fully
specialized in the production of i ∈ {X, M } and N , we can solve this system to obtain:

                                                       1 − ζ1i − ζ2i 1
                                         n (ℓ) =                           ,                                                            (35)
                                                            ζ1i     ωi (ℓ)


                                                                  29
where ωi (ℓ) is given in (34), and where {ζ1i , ζ2i } are function of the parameters.27 This condition is
the generalized version of equation (10) in the text. When capital is not used in production (γi = 1
for i = X, M, N ) then labor density is:

where αi ≡ βT αi + (1 − βT ) αN and zi (ℓ) ≡ m (ℓ) / ai (ℓ)βT aN (ℓ)1−βT .


A2: Proofs
The following results are shown under the assumption that αX = αM = α so that αi = α in the
model from Appendix A1.

Proposition 1 For (i), we have that if the country is a net exporter of X, all locations that trade
with RoW must produce X. Condition (13) then implies that e−2(τ0 +τ1 ℓ) p∗ ≤ p(ℓ). Therefore, all
locations such that e−2(τ0 +τ1 ℓ) p∗ > pA cannot be in autarky and must specialize in X. In turn,
since the country is not fully specialized, there must be autarkic locations for which e−2(τ0 +τ1 ℓ) p∗ <
pA . Therefore, there must exist b < ℓ such that e−2(τ0 +τ1 b) p∗ = pA . For (ii), we have that, if
pA /p∗ < e−2τ0 but the country is in international autarky or exports M then the no-arbitrage
conditions (12) and (13) are violated. In that case, equilibrium condition (17) implies that b <
ℓ ←→ pA /p∗ < e2(τ0 +τ1 ℓ) . Similar reasoning applies when the country exports M . Finally, if
e−2τ0 < pA /p∗ < e2τ0 but the country exports X or M then the no-arbitrage conditions (12) and
(13) are violated.

Proposition 2 From (17), it follows that b is decreasing with τ1 or τ0 . Therefore, b′ > b when
either τ1 or τ0 decreases. Consider the case when the economy is a net exporter of X and let p (ℓ)′
and n (ℓ)′ be the relative price and density in the new equilibrium with τ0′ < τ0 or τ1′ < τ1 . Note
              ′                   ′
that ∂n(ℓ)
       ∂ℓ < 0 and
                      ∂n(ℓ) 1
                        ∂ℓ n(ℓ)′ ≤
                                    ∂n(ℓ) 1                                      ′
                                     ∂ℓ n(ℓ) for all ℓ ∈ [0, b). Therefore, n (b) > n (b), for otherwise
Rℓ      ′                                           ′                                 ∗
 0 n (ℓ) λ (ℓ) dℓ < N . Also note that p (ℓ) = p (ℓ) = a for all ℓ ∈ (b, ℓ] and that u is higher in the
new equilibrium. Since n (b′ )′ < n (b′ ), there must be c ∈ [b, b′ ] such that n (c)′ = n (b). We conclude
that n (ℓ)′ − n (ℓ) > 0 ↔ ℓ < c, so that population density increases in [0, c]. When τ0 shrinks,

n (0)′ > n (0), for otherwise   0    n (ℓ)′ λ (ℓ) dℓ < N . In contrast when τ1 shrinks then n (0)′ < n (0)
since u∗ is higher in the new equilibrium, but p (0) = p (0)′ .

Proposition 3 The real return to immobile factors at ℓ is v (ℓ) = r (ℓ) /E (ℓ). Using (36) and
u(ℓ) = u∗ , we can write
                                                  α
                                            v (ℓ) =   n (ℓ) u∗ ,

                                                       Rℓ
so that the real return to land at the national level, 0 v (ℓ) λ (ℓ) dℓ, equals

                                                       α
                                                 v=       N u∗ .                                     (37)
                                                      1−α

In turn, using (10), the percentage change in population density in each location in response to an
arbitrary change in relative prices or in the real wage is

                                            βT                          1 ∗

The percentage change in the real return to immobile factors at ℓ is given by (22) in the text. In
turn, the change in relative prices in response to a change in domestic or international trade costs
is                                          (
                                                −2 (dτ0 + ℓdτ1 )        ℓ < b,
                                 pb (ℓ) =                          if
                                                       0                ℓ > b.

Therefore, vb (ℓ) < 0 if ℓ > b. Since vb > 0 from (37), there must be some vb (ℓ) > 0 for ℓ < b. In
                                             b∗ > 0, implying vb (0) < 0. Since vb (ℓ) > 0 for ℓ < b,
turn, when dτ0 = 0 > dτ1 then pb (0) = 0 but u
there is some ε such that vb (ℓ) < 0 for all ℓ ∈ [0, ε).

Notes: All panel regressions are estimated with year and industry-prefecture fixed effects. Dependent variables are the logarithm of employment
L or capital K at industry-prefecture-year cells with positive observations in the first two columns. Dependent variable in the third column is a
binary variable that takes the value one if L > 0 and zero otherwise. Panel A excludes state-owned enterprises in the construction of the regional
data. Panel B excludes the prefectures in three autonomous interior provinces (Inner Mongolia, Tibet, Xinjiang). Panel C excludes 53 coastal
prefectures with zero distance. Panel D clusters standard errors at the province level. Significance: * 10 percent, ** 5 percent, *** 1 percent.
