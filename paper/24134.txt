The Value of Pharmacogenomic Information

                                         ABSTRACT

Pharmacogenomics, or the application of genetic testing to guide drug selection and/or dosing, is
often cited as integral to the vision of how precision medicine can be integrated into routine
clinical practice. Yet despite a growing base of scientific discovery on genetic variation that
predicts drug response, reimbursement for genetic testing among health systems and payers
remains uneven. In large measure this is because the cascading impacts of genetic testing on
individual and provider incentives and behavior, as well as downstream health care spending and
outcomes, remain poorly understood. In this study, we couple evidence from a real-world
implementation of pharmacogenomic testing with a discrete event simulation model. We use this
framework to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of various genetic testing strategies. We find that
the cost-effectiveness of multiplexed genetic testing (e.g., whole genome sequencing) hinges on
the ability of a health system to ensure that dense genotypic information is routinely utilized by
physicians. Moreover, while much attention has been paid to lowering the cost of genetic tests,
we demonstrate that in practice, other scientific and behavioral factors, focused on certain high-
yield drug-gene pairs, are key to implementing precision medicine in ways that maximize its
value.

       A key objective of precision medicine is to guide health care decision-making with

genetic data to improve patient care—a vision that is fueled by extraordinary advances in the

discovery of genomic variation that predicts both disease risk and therapeutic response (Shurin

and Nabel 2008). For example, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recognizes many

interactions between gene variants and drug-related outcomes: currently more than 120 drug

labels include references to germline genomic information that can affect prescribing across a

wide array of diseases and conditions (FDA 2017). Yet while scientific evidence underlying

precision medicine is expanding rapidly, parallel efforts to understand its economic dimensions

remain lacking (Feero, Wicklund, and Veenstra 2013; M. J. Khoury et al. 2008).

       Our focus here is on pharmacogenomics (PGx), or the application of genetic testing to

guide drug selection and/or dosing. Among potential clinical uses for human genetics,

pharmacogenomics is often cited as integral to the vision of how precision medicine might be

immediately applied to routine clinical practice (Collins and Varmus 2015; Shurin and Nabel

2008; Conn 2017; Phillips et al. 2001; Ginsburg 2005). The promise of pharmacogenomics is

informed not only by a growing base of scientific discovery on drug-gene associations, but also

by technical improvements that have dramatically lowered the cost of genetic tests and increased

the capacity of health information systems. For example, in 2001 it cost nearly $100 million to

sequence a single human genome (Human Genome Research Institute} 2017); today it costs

roughly $1,000–approximately the cost of three outpatient specialist visits (Machlin and Scott

2015). Likewise, improvements in clinical information systems and interoperability have led to

modern electronic health records (EHRs) that can store genotypic data and return actionable

drug-gene information through decision aides at the point of prescribing (Gottesman et al. 2013;

J. M. Pulley et al. 2012; Josh F. Peterson et al. 2013; Denny et al. 2012).
       Existing research on the value of pharmacogenomics has focused primarily on the short-

term cost effectiveness of single gene tests—an approach that ignores the potential lifetime value

of multiplexed genetic testing strategies (Berm et al. 2016; Verhoef et al. 2016; Kazi et al. 2014).

Compared with single gene testing, these strategies—which include whole genome sequencing

(WGS), whole exome sequencing (WES) and multiplexed genetic panel testing—facilitate the

acquisition of wide swaths of genetic information all at once. Thus, a drug-gene pair for which

single-gene testing is found to be cost-ineffective could potentially improve overall value when

integrated within a broader multiplexed testing strategy, since information on that gene can

effectively be obtained at little to no marginal cost via WGS, WES, or panel testing.

       Despite these potential advantages, the overall value of pharmacogenomic testing

remains uncertain (Phillips and Van Bebber 2005). In part this is because the scientific basis

underlying pharmacogenomics is evolving (Zineh, Pacanowski, and Woodcock 2013; Phillips et

al. 2001; Ginsburg 2005). But this uncertainty arises also because the cascading impact of

multiplexed testing on individual, provider and payor incentives and behavior, as well as

downstream health care spending and outcomes, remain poorly understood (Feero, Wicklund,

and Veenstra 2013). As a consequence, reimbursement for genetic tests remains uneven and

focused almost exclusively on payment for single gene tests (Frueh 2013). This, in turn, has

slowed investment and translation of broader pharmacogenomic testing strategies into clinical

practice; currently, only a handful of health systems have implemented discrete

pharmacogenomic data into their clinical workflows. These efforts have not been funded via

reciprocal payor reimbursement but rather using internal funds or from external (drug-industry

and NIH) sources. At the very least, if the economic dimensions underlying pharmacogenomics
are not better understood it will be difficult if not impossible to capture the potential value of

pharmacogenomics in particular and precision medicine more broadly.

        In this study, we couple evidence from a real-world implementation of

pharmacogenomics with a discrete event simulation model for multiplexed genomic testing. In

doing so, we build on theoretical insights to estimate both the value of pharmacogenomic

information (i.e., the dollar-valued opportunity cost of not incorporating genomic information

into therapeutic decision-making) and the cost-effectiveness of alternative genomic testing

approaches. Notably, the scalability and flexibility of our simulation approach affords us the

ability to conduct large-scale probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) under which we re-estimate

our model over a large (varying) parameter space. Coupled with novel methods in metamodeling

and value of information (VOI) analysis, this allows us to identify key economic, scientific and

behavioral parameters that can affect decision-making on the optimal genetic testing strategy.

We discuss how these insights can be used to prioritize future research and to inform

implementation of genetic testing in ways that maximize its value.

        Our primary finding is that relative to a no-testing strategy, multiplexed genetic testing is

not cost-effective at the lower end of commonly used societal willingness to pay thresholds (e.g.,

$50,000 per quality-adjusted life year, or QALY). However, at slightly higher thresholds

($118,000/QALY or greater) a pre-emptive multiplexed testing strategy is optimal conditional on

the ability of a health system to ensure that pharmacogenomic information is regularly utilized

by clinicians. To the extent that physicians are no more likely to utilize genetic testing

information that was obtained upstream as they are to order a new genetic test, then a serial

single-gene testing strategy is still preferred.
        Given widespread churn in both physician patient panels and insurance markets (Graves

and Nikpay 2017), as well as behavioral frictions that result in less than 100% of physicians

ordering or acting upon the results of a genetic test (J. F. Peterson et al. 2016), these findings

point to distinct design and financing challenges for pharmacogenomics. For example, the long

time horizon over which the value of pharmacogenomic information accrues suggests that

individual payers will have diluted incentives to reimburse for multiplexed pharmacogenomic

testing, even if the resource cost of testing and storage distribution of genomic information is

further streamlined. Indeed, our VOI results reveal that the most important parameters driving

whether pharmacogenomic testing is cost-effective are not related to the cost of the genetic test

itself, but rather: (1) the strength of evidence on the risk-reduction in severe adverse events

associated with a pharmacogenomically-guided alternative therapy; (2) the additional social

resources it takes to deliver a pharmacogenomic alternative; and (3) the likelihood that

physicians procure and/or act upon genetic testing information. We demonstrate that these

factors, focused in particular on certain high-yield drug-gene pairs, are key to understanding how

pharmacogenomic precision medicine can be most cost-effectively integrated into routine

clinical practice.

        The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. The next section provides basic

background information on pharmacogenomics, genomic testing strategies, and evidence on the

implications of genetic testing on both individual and physician behavior. We also provide

background information on PREDICT, the real-world pharmacogenomics implementation that

directly informs our simulation model. We then outline a basic theoretical model of the value of

genomic information that builds on prior work on the expected value of individualized care.

Following that, we outline the details and assumptions of our discrete event simulation model.
We next discuss the translation of the DES to a coupled time differential delay equation that

facilitates probabilistic sensitivity analysis. We provide a brief overview of metamodeling and

value of information methods we utilize to identify parameters with key leverage in our model,

and that can be used to guide future research on pharmacogenomics. A results section follows,

and a final section concludes.

Background

         The utility of sequencing patients and return of actionable genetic variation has grown

with the rapid pace of discovery within large sequenced cohorts, disease registries, and genomic

medicine implementation studies (Green et al. 2016; Gottesman et al. 2013; K. W. Weitzel et al.

2016; Carey et al. 2016). The primary applications of germline sequencing are selection and

dosing of therapies guided by pharmacogenomics, and diagnosis, prognosis, or risk stratification

guided by genomic variants informing disease risk.

         Of particular relevance for the present study is the list of drug-gene pairs published by the

Clinical Pharmacogenomic Implementation Consortium (CPIC). CPIC provides guidelines of

how to select or dose medications based on pharmacogenomic variants (Relling and Klein 2011;

CPIC 2017). The organization also rates the strength and robustness of evidence underlying

drug-gene interactions and the clinical utility to use within affected populations. Similarly, the

American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) also publishes a curated list of potentially

actionable disease risk genes found in clinical exome or genome sequencing. These genes have

strong associations with hereditary cardiomyopathies, familial cancer syndromes (e.g. Lynch

syndrome, breast and ovarian cancer), and arrhythmias among other conditions (Kalia et al.

2017).
Pharmacogenomic Testing Strategies

       The application of pharmacogenomic testing in clinical settings can be considered using

two types of strategies. One is reactive serial testing of single genes. Under this strategy,

genotyping for specific variants is undertaken in individual subjects at the point of care, and then

acted on when the results become available (typically within a week). By comparison, under a

multiplexed strategy, dense genotypic information is acquired once using a genetic panel test or

through WGS or WES. This information is then stored in advanced EHR systems, allowing

genotype-based recommendations to be routinely delivered in the future (J. S. Schildcrout et al.

2012). Multiplexed testing could be carried out either reactively (i.e., panel-based testing or

sequencing is initiated at the first pharmacogenomic drug indication ) or preemptively (i.e.,

testing is carried out upstream of any drug indication, under the expectation that the information

will be stored and available for future use). Figure 1 summarizes these drug testing scenarios.




       Figure 1. Pharmacogenomic Testing Strategies
Reimbursement Policy for Pharmacogenomic Testing Strategies

         With the decreasing cost of genotyping and the very high cost of severe adverse events

(e.g. warfarin-related intracranial hemorrhage is estimated to cost approximately $40,000; see

Ghate et al. (2011)), multiplexed genomic screening may represent a more cost-effective

approach to current single use methods. The marginal cost of obtaining additional genomic

information in a panel test is small, and is virtually nonexistent in sequencing-based approaches

that capture nearly all of an individual’s actionable germline genomic information. Meanwhile,

advances in clinical information systems and lessons from real-world implementations have

yielded low-cost strategies for the storage and dissemination of genomic testing information

through EMRs and decision aides. (J. M. Pulley et al. 2012; Delaney et al. 2012; Denny et al.

2012).

         Despite these favorable properties, reimbursement of multiplexed and even single-gene

testing from major public and private payers remains uneven (Feero, Wicklund, and Veenstra

2013; M. J. Khoury et al. 2008; Frueh 2013; Teng et al. 2012; S. A. Scott 2011; J. P. Cohen

2012; Faulkner et al. 2012). Limited support for reimbursement of PGx reflects the reality that

the majority of payers view genetic testing as experimental (M. J. Khoury et al. 2008; Grosse

2014; Feero, Wicklund, and Veenstra 2013). Reimbursement challenges are particularly acute for

genomic screening because of the pace of innovation and the size of the potential impact. For

example, a recent Blues plan coverage policy stated:

         “… genetic panels are considered investigational because the current scientific evidence

is not yet sufficient to establish how test results from panels which include a broad number of

genes may be used to direct treatment decisions and improve health outcomes associated with all

components of the panels.” (BCBS 2013)
          This policy was developed because of valid concerns about the generation and return of

ancillary information (i.e., “incidental” findings that point to susceptibility of disease risk) as

well as concern about the scientific validity of markers that were being included in sequencing

panels.

          In addition, it is increasingly clear that what happens downstream of genetic testing is

also a critical determinant of payers’ skepticism (Kohane, Hsing, and Kong 2012; Vassy et al.

2017). For example, a 2005 randomized controlled trial of genetic testing for Alzheimer’s

disease found that individuals who tested positive were 5.76 times more likely to adjust their

long-term insurance plans (Zick et al. 2005). In a more recent randomized controlled trial (RCT)

of WGS, patients randomized to WGS were twice as likely to be recommended a new clinical

action (e.g., a follow-up visit or referral to a specialist) from their primary care physician (Vassy

et al. 2017). Moreover, patients receiving WGS had overall 6-month spending patterns that were

30% higher than the non-WGS arm, mostly due to higher rates of follow-up lab tests and

specialty visits (Vassy et al. 2017). These results have fueled concerns over whether genetic

testing will exacerbate adverse selection into insurance plans, or might otherwise raise costs in

the health care system.

Towards Better Evidence for Pharmacogenomics

          There are distinct challenges to understanding whether the additional health benefits from

pharmacogenomics are worth the additional costs they induce. For one, given the low incidence

of adverse events and the relative infrequency of risk alleles, few PGx scenarios have support for

overall economic or clinical benefit when using a sequencing result to care for an average risk

population. Cumulatively, however, the potential value of pharmacogenomics may be large. For

example, a recent retrospective study of 52,942 patients in a Vanderbilt University Medical
Center (VUMC) medical home population revealed that over a five year period, nearly two-

thirds were exposed to at least one of 56 CPIC drugs (J. S. Schildcrout et al. 2012). Within this

population, an estimated 383 severe adverse events over five years could have potentially been

avoided had pharmacogenomic information been utilized (J. S. Schildcrout et al. 2012).

       The collection of evidence on the value of pharmacogenomics is difficult, however,

because the lifetime benefits of screening for gene variants are exceedingly difficult to

experimentally estimate using standard research strategies. Clinical trials and prospective cohorts

typically measure short-term benefits or harms of disclosing genetic data to patients and their

physicians. The time horizon for assessing clinical and economic differences after personalized

screening interventions or even genetically tailored preventive therapy may be exceptionally

long, often decades. In addition, the benefits (or harms) will likely vary based on patients’

demographics, variant rate, phenotype status, family history of disease, environmental exposures,

and other non-genomic risk factors. Many of these factors are rarely, if ever, collected as

baseline measures in an RCT if they do not relate directly to the trial design itself.

       Designing research studies to explain how clinical benefits may change within all of

these key subgroups is not feasible without very large sample sizes and long-term follow-up.

Even if feasible, RCT-derived data often does not provide the external validity to implement

genetic testing in diverse, uncontrolled clinical practice settings. For these reasons, synthesizing

direct and indirect evidence on the costs and benefits of pharmacogenomics testing within a

modeling framework offers a way forward for understanding the trade-offs of implementing

personalized medicine in practice, and ultimately informing both future research priorities and

precision medicine reimbursement policy. That is the goal of this study.
PREDICT

       Direct, real-world evidence for our model are derived from the Pharmacogenomic

Resource for Enhanced Decisions In Care and Treatment (PREDICT) program, a clinical quality

improvement initiative at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) (J. M. Pulley et al.

2012). This program has genotyped almost 15,000 patients since 2010 as a part of routine care.

Through PREDICT, VUMC established procedures for applying clinically significant gene

variants to decisions involving drug selection and dosing. As a distinctive feature of the program,

healthy outpatients are prospectively identified (using a prediction model) as candidates for

genotyping based on their likelihood of receiving certain drugs in the future. These patient

records are subsequently monitored to assess the impact of genetic variant information on

physician decision making and subsequent utilization and clinical outcomes. VUMC has already

implemented six functional algorithms (warfarin dosing; anti-platelet therapy selection;

thiopurine, tacrolimus and simvastatin guidance), with more in development. The program has

already served as a prototype for a general understanding of applying multiplexed genomic data

in practice (S. M. Teutsch et al. 2009; Muin J. Khoury et al. 2009; Gottesman et al. 2013; K. W.

Weitzel et al. 2016; J. A. Johnson and Weitzel 2016).

       We draw upon the PREDICT cohort for several parameters that inform the construction

of our model. First, we utilized the PREDICT medical home cohort of 140,166 patients to query

the frequency at which they were prescribed the 42 CPIC Level-A drugs. These drug frequency

estimates were then used to classify each drug-gene pair into one pharmacogenomic class, as

described in the simulation approach section below. Second, we drew upon internal data on

physician responses to genotying to inform parameters governing physician utilization of

genotyping information in our model. These parameters, for example, were set to reflect the
observation that only about 50% of physicians switched to a pharmacogenomic alternative for

antiplatelet therapy in cases where the patient was identified as a poor or intermediate

metabolizer of clopidogrel, a CPIC Level-A drug (J. F. Peterson et al. 2016).

Theory: The Value of Genomic Information

        To further motivate our simulation approach we first outline a framework for how a

simulation model might be used to estimate the value of genomic information (VOGI). This

framework is based on the model developed by Basu and Meltzer (2007), which draws on

Bayesian decision theory and value of information methods (Basu and Meltzer 2007; K. Claxton

et al. 2001; K. P. Claxton and Sculpher 2006). Conceptually, the VOGI model provides a

framework for estimating the opportunity cost (if any) of failing to incorporate genetic

information into therapeutic decision-making.

        Suppose that patients are heterogeneous in their characteristics, and in particular they

vary in their susceptibility to adverse events based on genomic traits that affect their ability to

metabolize drugs. Assume this heterogeneity is captured by model parameters 𝛑𝛑 = {𝜋𝜋1 , . . . . , 𝜋𝜋𝐼𝐼 }

and that for a given drug treatment option 𝛼𝛼 (e.g., a standard therapy and a costlier

pharmacogenomic alternative therapy), Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) and costs are

captured by 𝑄𝑄(𝛼𝛼, 𝛑𝛑) and 𝐶𝐶(𝛼𝛼, 𝛑𝛑), respectively.

        We next define the Net Monetary Benefit (NMB) as a summary measure of cost-

effectiveness. The NMB is a common metric summarizing (in dollar terms) the health benefits

and costs of a given strategy (Neumann et al. 2016). In this context, the NMB for alternative

drug treatment strategies is captured by:

                             (1)      𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁(𝛼𝛼, 𝛑𝛑) = 𝜆𝜆 ⋅ 𝑄𝑄(𝛼𝛼, 𝛑𝛑)– 𝐶𝐶(𝛼𝛼, 𝛑𝛑)
        where 𝜆𝜆 is the fixed value of the marginal societal willingness to pay for an incremental

health improvement (i.e., $100,000/QALY). Thus, NMB captures the (dollar valued) overall

health benefit of a given drug therapy, net of the costs of administering the therapy.1

        In a baseline (i.e., no testing strategy), physicians are unaware of their patients’ genetic

variant status and base their prescribing decisions on the distribution of 𝛼𝛼 in the population.

        The optimal therapeutic choice in this scenario is that which maximizes the average

NMB across the population:

                                   (2)      max𝛼𝛼    𝐸𝐸𝛑𝛑 [NMB(𝛼𝛼, 𝛑𝛑)]

        Based on population average risk, the optimal strategy under this approach may be to

treat all patients with the standard therapy, even though the alternative drug may produce

superior net health benefits for a select population of individuals with a genetic variant.

        Now suppose that physicians can directly observe and act upon patient heterogeneity in

response to the drugs. In other words, the physician can optimally choose a drug therapy and

maximize the NMB for each patient. In that case, the average NMB for the population is given

by:

                                   (3)      E𝛑𝛑 [max𝛼𝛼   NMB(𝛼𝛼, 𝛑𝛑)]

        We obtain an estimate of the VOGI by taking the difference between equations (3) and

(2):

               (4)      VOGI = E𝛑𝛑 [max𝛼𝛼      NMB(𝛼𝛼, 𝛑𝛑)] − max𝛼𝛼       𝐸𝐸𝛑𝛑 [NMB(𝛼𝛼, 𝛑𝛑)]




        1 A related concept, the Net Health Benefit (NHB), captures the gain in QALYs net of

any (QALY-valued) costs: 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁(𝛼𝛼, 𝐩𝐩𝐩𝐩) = 𝑄𝑄(𝛼𝛼, 𝛑𝛑) − 𝐶𝐶(𝛼𝛼, 𝛑𝛑)/𝜆𝜆.
       Conceptually, the VOGI provides an estimate of the opportunity cost (in dollar terms) of

failing to incorporate genetic information into therapeutic decision-making (Basu and Meltzer

2007). In other words, for a given 𝜆𝜆 it provides an estimate of the maximum amount society

would be willing to pay (per patient) to implement genotype-tailored care. We will return to this

conceptualization of VOGI in the results section below by fitting our model under two strategies:

(1) a no genotyping strategy; and (2) a strategy in which information on patients’ genetic variant

status is obtained (for free) and acted upon 100% of the time. The estimate NMB difference

between these two strategies provides an estimate of VOGI in our simulated patient population.

Simulation Approach

       Our estimates of the VOGI and cost-effectiveness of alternative genomic testing

strategies are drawn from a discrete event simulation (DES) model. Specifically, this model

simulates the lifetime trajectories of patients who are at risk of developing an indication for any

one of the 42 CPIC level-A drugs (i.e., none of the simulated patients are on any of the CPIC

Level-A drugs at the initiation of the model).

       Discrete Event Simulation (DES) is a modeling methodology designed to incorporate the

timing and interdependency of events (Karnon et al. 2012; Caro and Möller 2016; Standfield,

Comans, and Scuffham 2014). Though its origins are in industrial engineering and operations

research, DES is increasingly used in health technology assessments (Standfield, Comans, and

Scuffham 2014; Jacobson, Hall, and Swisher 2006; J. E. Stahl 2008). For example, in a DES is is

straightforward to allow the probability of some future event to depend on the time spent in a

given state (e.g., the probability of a pharmacogenomically-related adverse event declines as the

amount of time spent on the drug increases). In addition, in cases where pharmacogenomic

information informs the initial dosing of a drug (e.g., in the case of Warfarin, which has received
a great deal of pharmacogenomic attention), DES can readily accommodate the arrival rate of the

genomic information. Such dynamics are difficult if not impossible to model using more

standard Markov approaches (Caro and Möller 2016).

Simple Pharmacogenomic Model Structure

       Our DES model tracks a population of 40 year-old females at risk of exposure to an array

of up to 𝐾𝐾 = 42 CPIC drug indications with potentially actionable pharmacogenomic drug

selection and/or dosing opportunities. The choice of 40 year-old females allows us to match

secular mortality in our model to observed life expectancy as reported in current US lifetable

data; in principle, any age-gender combination–or even a distribution of ages and genders

matching any observed population–could be used.

       For a given drug indication 𝑘𝑘, exposure over time is defined based on an exponential

distribution–though, again, any statistical distribution, or even an empirical distribution matched

to observed data–could be used. Moreover, for the sake of modeling simplicity we assume that

drug exposures are independent events.2

       Individuals exposed to drug 𝑘𝑘 are at risk of a composite adverse event (e.g., AMI, bleed,

muscle myopathy) that carries a case fatality rate and a permanent utility decrement among

survivors. In this simple scenario, we assume that all individuals exposed to the drug indication

are prescribed a standard therapy. Each individual is followed until death, and remain at risk of

modeling time to drug exposure using a Weibull distribution with copulas that capture the

dependence in exposure across different drugs. See www.rightsim.org for more.
an indication for all 𝐾𝐾 drugs throughout their lifetime. However, once an individual is exposed to

a given drug she is no longer at risk of a second exposure to that drug.

       Our model also includes a pharmacogenomic alternative therapy which, if administered

to individuals with a genetic variant, reduces the risk of the composite adverse event. Our

baseline case assumes that 20% of the population has the genetic variant and models a relative

risk of 0.70 for the composite event under the pharmacogenomic alternative. This value tracks

closely with recent evidence on the risk reduction of a composite adverse event from

genomically-tailored dosing of Warfarin (Gage et al. 2017). However, as noted below in our

PSA analysis we test the sensitivity of the model to a wide range of gene prevalence and relative

risk parameter values.

       In our base case we also assume the pharmacogenomically-guided alternative is costlier

than the standard therapy. Because we take a societal perspective this cost does not necessarily

capture differences in price. Rather, it captures the notion that the pharmacogenomic alternative

requires more resources to administer (e.g., administration of the drug triggers greater

downstream utilization and/or testing). Our baseline case assumes that the relative cost of the

pharmacogenomic alternative is 3 times the standard therapy–though, again, we test the

sensitivity of this assumption by allowing the relative cost parameter to vary over a plausible

range of values in the PSA.

       Figure 2 provides a Petri net representation of the DES model structure for a single drug

scenario 𝑘𝑘. The figure plots a bipartite network in which the nodes represent events (e.g., initial

drug indication, adverse event, secular death) and the directed arrows describe the states from

which individuals can flow into each node. Time is represented on the bottom axis. All drug
scenarios in our model have an identical structure, though with differing values for the underling

parameters (see below).




       Figure 2. Discrete Event Model Structure for a Single Pharmacogenomic Scenario

Mapping CPIC Level-A Drugs to the Simple Model

       The generic pharmacogenomic model described above can be summarized (for a given

drug scenario 𝑘𝑘) using a set of discrete set of parameters 𝜋𝜋𝑘𝑘 . Because the DES modeling

structure is modular, we can easily scale up our model to accommodate the 𝐾𝐾 = 42 drug

scenarios captured in the CPIC Level-A list. That is, our estimates below are the result of

simulating the drug experiences of a patient population as they are simultaneously exposed to 42

specific pharmacogenomic scenarios over the remainder of their lifetimes.

       In principle, a different parameter set based on the published literature or based on

observed estimates from a genotyped cohort could be defined for each of the 42 CPIC drug-gene

scenarios. Moreover, ideally an “enriched” sub-model could be constructed that captures the set
of trajectories that could be experienced by a patient under each specific drug-gene scenario.3

However, to fully model all 42 drug-gene pairs, the resources, data requirements, and

computation time would be prohibitively expensive.

       For these reasons we simplify our model by mapping the 42 CPIC drug-gene pairs to one

of 7 pharmacogenomic scenarios. These scenarios are characterized by three specific criteria: (1)

the frequency at which the drug is prescribed; (2) the frequency of the composite adverse event;

and (3) the severity of the adverse event. For each CPIC drug-gene pair we queried both the

literature and our medical home cohort data, and assigned values of “high” and “low” to each of

the 3 criteria. For example, the drug-gene pair for Warfarin mapped to the high-high-high

scenario because Warfarin is a commonly-prescribed drug, adverse events are frequent

(Warfarin-related complications are among the most common reasons for ED visits in the US),

and the adverse events potentially averted by pharmacogenomically-guided therapy are severe

(these events include bleeding and blood clots that can lead to stroke or acute myocardial

infarction). By comparison, Simvastatin is another commonly-prescribed drug with a common

but much less severe side effect (myopathy, or muscle soreness). For these reasons the

Simvastatin drug-gene pair is mapped to a High-High-Low pharmacogenomic scenario. A full

listing of the CPIC drug-gene pairs and their mapping to the 7 pharmacogenomic scenarios is

provided in Table 1.




       3 Indeed, in parallel work (available at www.rightsim.org) we construct drug-specific

sub-models for three common cardiovascular drugs: Warfarin, Clopidogrel and Simvastatin.

Baseline DES Model

        Table 2 provides a summary description of the baseline parameter values that form the

underlying basis for our DES model. For each genetic testing strategy, we model a baseline
scenario for 10 million patients in which we summarize the average QALYs and costs incurred

across the population. As noted above we utilize a societal perspective and discount all benefits

and costs using a standard 3% discount rate. All patients in the DES model are tracked from

initiation until death, either due to case fatality from an adverse event, or due to secular causes.

Probabilistic Sensitivity Analyses

        While DES affords significant modeling flexibility, one downside is its computational

burden. To reduce first-order (stochastic) uncertainty in a model where only a fraction of patients

experience a drug exposure, and where adverse events are rare, millions of patient trajectories

must be simulated. Even with optimized computing software, a DES model with multiple

pharmacogenomic drug scenarios takes up to a day or more to execute. This computation time

severely limits our ability to perform an important component of our analysis: probabilistic

sensitivity analyses (PSAs).

        In a PSA, model parameters are assigned distributions rather than values; the simulation

is then run iteratively by drawing a new set of parameter values from the joint distribution of

parameter values each time the model is run. PSAs are an important tool for identifying

parameters with the greatest leverage, understanding variation in the estimated outcomes as

parameter values are varied, and performing value of information analyses that can inform future

research priorities.

Representation as Coupled Delay Differential Equation

        To facilitate PSA analyses we converted the DES model structure described above into a

set of coupled time delay differential equations (DEDEs). Estimates derived from the numerical

solution to the DEDE effectively eliminate stochastic uncertainty from the model, and provide

for very fast model executions that return expected average outcomes (i.e., average QALYs and

costs for a given strategy).

        A downside to the DEDE modeling approach is that it does not provide details on event

counts, patient attributes, or variance in outcomes among the simulated population–all of which

are feasible in a standard DES. We therefore view our DEDE approach for PSAs as
complementary to the DES model, which can be run to provide rich detail on the value of

pharmacogenomic testing (e.g., number of adverse events averted, number needed to genotype to

avert an adverse event) that may be of interest to payers, clinicians, and policymakers.

       To construct our differential delay model we treat time as an independent variable, and

create a series of variables each representing a state that an individual could occupy at a point in

time in a manner similar to Markov chain modeling. Each of these variables can take a value

from 0 to 1 representing the average expected occupancy of the population at that point in time.

We treat each pharmacogenomic drug indication type as a sub-model in a series of coupled

models, and individual occupancy in any given sub-model (including deaths) must total to 1.

       If all rates were fixed values, this would be equivalent to solving a Markov chain model.

However, in differential equations, rates can depend upon current occupancy of a node. This

allows for a richer set of modeling tools. For example, our sub-models are coupled by two

principal effects: rates of multiplexed panel testing and death rates from other sub-models. If a

condition in one sub-model triggers a multiplexed panel genomic test at a rate proportional to its

population, then this transition rate affects all sub-models. Further, individuals dying from

adverse events in one drug sub-model must die in all other drug models. Another benefit is that

the secular death rate is a function of time in model, and this time varying rate is taken from the

2011 social security death data and splined into a smooth curve. One could additionally use rates

which correspond to probability distributions via the following transform: 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 = 𝜑𝜑(𝑡𝑡; 𝜃𝜃)/(1 −

𝜙𝜙(𝑡𝑡; 𝜃𝜃)) when a distribution represented arrival times. In this simulation we use exponential

arrival times to condition indicators for each sub-model.

       Inside each sub model counter variables are also used to keep track of occurrence of

indication, adverse events, and adverse events resulting in death. The overall structure of the
model facilitates a solution via coupled ordinary differential equations. However, the indicator

condition carries a temporary disutility cost that occurs over a period of time and cannot be

modeled as a simple fixed cost. To model this, a special tracking variable is used that allows for

occupancy entrance based on a fixed rate and exit based upon entering occupancy at a point in

the past minus death over that period. This requires the rate to depend on a value at another point

in time and thus requires techniques of delay differential equation for solving this variable.

       Figure 3 summarizes the parameters in the DEDE model. The PSA distributions for all

model parameters are provided in Table 2 above.




Figure 3. Delay Differential Equation Representation of a Single Pharmacogenomic Scenario
Linear Metamodel

        The numerical solution to the DEDE facilitates a PSA in which we allow each model

parameter to vary based on a prespecified distribution. For example, in our PSA we test the

sensitivity of the overall average QALY and cost outcomes to differences in the probability that

genetic information is ordered and/or acted upon. We do so by allowing these parameters to vary

from 0 to 100% across the PSA model runs. Furthermore, we also assess whether the optimal

genetic testing strategy changes if the cost of the pharmacogenomic alternative increases, or if

the cost of genetic testing declines, etc.

        To execute our PSA we define a parameter space by specifying distributions for nearly all

parameters in our model (See Table 2). We then re-estimate the numerical solution to the DEDE

model 5,000 times using a latin hypercube sampling design, each time drawing and fitting the

model using a newly sampled set of parameters. The use of latin hypercube sampling ensures

that we efficiently obtain a near-random sample covering the multidimensional parameter space.

        Based on the PSA model runs we then fit a linear metamodel that regresses the outcomes

for a given strategy (e.g., average QALYs, average costs, NMB, or NHB) on the parameter

values, which are first rescaled to have mean zero and standard deviation 1 (Jalal et al. 2013;

Jalal, Goldhaber-Fiebert, and Kuntz 2015). Thus, the coefficients and predicted values from the

metamodel can be used to assess how the outcome for a given strategy changes as a given

parameter value varies, while holding all other parameters fixed at their mean value.

        For our sensitivity analyses we are interested in identifying parameters and threshold

values that determine whether the optimal genotyping decision changes. To do this, we fit a

multivariate metamodel with the Net Health Benefit (NHB) for each genotyping strategy as the

outcomes, and with the parameters of interest entering as flexible splines. Following recent work
by Jalal and Alarid-Escudero (2017), we fit the metamodel using a generalized additive model

(GAM) to flexibly estimate the relationship between the varying model parameters and the

outcome. We then use this model to predict the NHB across the observed range of values. At

each set of values we identify the strategy with the maximum NHB (i.e., the optimal strategy at

that value). These calculations form the basis for the one- and two-way sensitivity plots

presented in the results section below.

Expected Value of Partial Perfect Information

       The metamodel specification described above provides a linear approximation to the

main DES/DEDE model. That is, the metamodel can be used to predict changes in the outcomes

given a change in the underlying parameters. However, while this method can be used to identify

parameters that yield the largest predicted changes in outcomes, this information may be useful

only insofar as it informs decisions on the optimal genotyping strategy. For example, for a

societal willingness to pay threshold (e.g., $50,000/QALY), varying a given parameter over a

plausible range may result in large changes in the outcome but it may not result in any change

the optimal decision; in that case, then our decision to genotype, or not genotype, is mostly

uninformed by the specific value of that parameter, whatever it may be.

       To identify and prioritize model parameters that drive uncertainty in decision-making we

estimate the expected value of partial perfect information (EVPPI) as a measure of model

uncertainty (Campbell et al. 2015). The EVPPI provides a dollar- or health-valued estimate of

the cost of resovling all uncertainty in a model (Neumann et al. 2016). Because the EVPPI

identifies parameters that contribute to uncertainty in decision-making, the estimates can be used

to guide future research prioritization for precision medicine.
       To estimate the EVPPI for each parameter in our model, we define a metamodel outcome

that, for each genotyping strategy under consideration, is the result of a loss function that is the

difference between the estimated NMB for the strategy in that PSA model run and the NMB for

the (overall) optimal strategy determined under the baseline value run. In other words, this loss

function provides an estimate of the (dollar-valued) opportunity cost of identifying the wrong

optimal genotyping strategy:

                               𝐿𝐿(𝛼𝛼, 𝛑𝛑) = 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁(𝛼𝛼, 𝛑𝛑) − 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁(𝛼𝛼 ∗ , 𝛑𝛑)

       For example, suppose that under the basline run that for a given 𝜆𝜆 value, the NMB for the

optimal (no genotyping) strategy is $100. Now suppose that for a given PSA model run, the

NMB for the preemptive panel testing strategy is $102. In that case, the opportunity loss of

identifying the wrong optimal strategy under baseline is $2. By comparison, if the NMB for the

preemptive panel strategy were $98, then the opportunity loss would be $0 since the same

decision was made under both the baseline and the PSA model run.

       To produce our estimates of the EVPPI we fit a metamodel that that regresses the

opportunity loss outcome on the (varying) model parameters:

                                       𝐿𝐿(𝛼𝛼, 𝛑𝛑) = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝛑𝛑 + 𝑒𝑒

       We also fit the EVPPI results over a range of values of 𝜆𝜆 to assess how the estimates

change under a range of societal willingness to pay thresholds.

Results

Value of Genomic Information

       Before examining the cost-effectiveness of specific genetic testing approaches we first

aim to estimate the value of pharmacogenomic information—that is, the (dollar valued)
opportunity cost of not incorporating genetic information into therapeutic decision-making. This

estimate is directly linked to the VOGI defined in the theory section above.

       To estimate the VOGI we utilize our DES model to calculate outcomes under two

scenarios: one in which no genetic information is used, and another in which genomic

information is obtained at no cost and is acted upon 100% of the time (i.e., patients with the

genetic variant are always prescribed the alternative therapy). This latter scenario is intended to

capture an idealized world in which physicians could observe and optimally act on genetic

heterogeneity.

       To identify and decompose which pharmacogenomic scenarios drive our value

calculations, we repeat this exercise separately for the 7 scenarios (i.e., the CPIC mappings) as

described above.4 The difference in average NMB between the “no testing” and the “free

testing” approaches provides an estimate of the VOGI for each pharmacogenomic scenario.

       Our VOGI estimates for the 7 pharmacogenomic categories are summarized in Table 3

below. The leftmost columns classify scenarios based on our three criteria: prescription

frequency, adverse event frequency, and adverse event severity. Likewise, the rightmost columns




       4 When estimating the VOGI for a specific pharmacogenomic scenario we allow the

other scenarios to run out in our model as well, though without the genomic information being

used. This allows for apples-to-apples comparisons of VOGI estimates that are not affected by

competing risks (e.g., fatal adverse events) issues that would come up if we only modeled a

single scenario at a time.

       The VOGI estimates demonstrate that for commonly-used societal willingness to pay

thresholds, only a few drug scenarios accrue (dollar valued) health benefits that are greater than

their downstream costs. The Low-High-High scenario (e.g., Azothiaprine-TPMT) has a positive

estimate under all values of 𝜆𝜆, while the High-Low-High (e.g., Clopidogrel-CYP2C19) and

High-High-High (e.g., Warfarin-CYP2C9/VKORC1) scenarios have large positive values for

𝜆𝜆 > $100,000/𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿. These results not only highlight which drug-gene pairs are likely to drive

overall value in a panel-based or sequencing approach, but also indicate which specific single-

gene testing strategies have favorable cost-effectiveness estimates. Notably, our finding that

Clopidogrel and Warfarin are cost-effective single-gene testing scenarios is consistent with

published studies on single-gene testing for those two drugs (Verhoef et al. 2016; Kazi et al.

2014).

Cost-Effectiveness of Testing Strategies

         We next turn our attention to estimates of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios

(ICERs) for multiplexed and serial single gene testing strategies. These ICERs, as well as the
average QALY and cost estimates that underlie them, are summarized in Table 4 and in the cost-

effectiveness plane depicted in Figure 4.

Strategies

                                Average QALY           Average Cost    ICER

 Preemptive Multiplexed Testing 22.434                 15,398          139,615



       Here we see that under our baseline model assumptions, all genomic testing strategies

result in net average gains in both QALYs and costs in the simulated patient population (i.e.,

each strategy is in the northeast quadrant of the cost-effectiveness plane in Figure 4). However, a

strategy of reactive multiplexed testing is ruled out by extended dominance–that is, this strategy

has an ICER that is greater than that of a more effective strategy (Neumann et al. 2016). By

comparison, serial single gene testing has an ICER of $117,689/QALY, while a preemptive

multiplexed testing strategy has an ICER of $139,615/QALY–both of which would be deemed

cost-effective based on the upper end of standard societal willingness to pay thresholds

($150,000/QALY) (Neumann, Cohen, and Weinstein 2014).
Figure 4. Cost-Effectiveness of Single-Gene Testing Strategies

Sensitivity of Results

Cost-Effectiveness Acceptability Curve

       Our results thus far correspond to the average change in QALYs and costs under the

baseline model parameters summarized in Table 2. However, given that only a subset of these

parameters are based on direct evidence, and given that the underlying model is built on a

relatively simple representation of a pharmacogenomic scenario, a natural question to ask is how

sensitive the results are to varying assumptions and parameter values.

       We begin our exploration of decision uncertainty in Figure 5, which plots a cost-

effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC) based on the PSA model runs. This figure summarizes
uncertainty by plotting, for varying values of 𝜆𝜆 (i.e., the societal willingness to pay threshold),

the fraction of the PSA model runs that are cost-effective at that value. For example, at 𝜆𝜆 =

$50,000/𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄 a no-testing strategy is optimal in nearly 100% of model runs. Thus, even

allowing nearly all parameters to vary over a large plausible range does not change our

recommendation not to genotype. By comparison, at 𝜆𝜆 = $100,000/𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄 a no-testing strategy

is optimal in 50% of model runs, while the pre-emptive multiplexed testing strategy is optimal in

25% of runs. In this case, and for higher values of 𝜆𝜆, it is worth investigating which specific

parameters drive decision-making uncertainty.




Figure 5. Cost-Effectiveness Acceptability Curve
One- and Two-Way Sensitivity Analyses

        In Figure 6 we draw on the results of the linear metamodel to examine how sensitive our

estimate of the Net Health Benefit (NHB) for each strategy is to values of specific parameters for

the High-High-High scenario (i.e., Warfarin-CYP2C9/VKORC1), all while holding all other

parameters fixed at their baseline value. The choice of this scenario and parameters was driven

primarily by our finding that it yielded the highest VOGI estimate above, and also because these

parameters were identified as providing the highest leverage in terms of driving decision

uncertainty in our model (more discussion on this point is provided in the section on the

Expected Value of Partial Perfect Information below).

        The leftmost column of the figure provides one-way sensitivity analyses for NHBs

estimated for 𝜆𝜆 = $100,000/𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄, while the rightmost column depict NHBs based on 𝜆𝜆 =

$150,000/𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄. The sensitivity of our results for three key parameters–the risk reduction from

the PGx alternative, the relative cost of the PGx alternative, and the probability genetic testing

information is used–are depicted in the rows.

        The plot in the upper right of Figure 6 demonstrates that when 𝜆𝜆 = $100,000/𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄, the

optimal strategy changes as the adverse event risk reduction from PGx changes. For example,

when the relative risk of an adverse event under the PGx-guided therapy is 0.6 or below, then a

preemptive testing strategy is optimal. However, if the risk reduction is 0.7 or above, then a no

testing strategy is optimal; in that case, the additional costs it takes to administer the testing and

the alternative therapy are not worth the smaller reduction in the risk of an adverse event. On the

other hand, when 𝜆𝜆 = $150,000/𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄 a preemptive strategy remains optimal even at higher

relative risk values. To put these findings in context, a recent RCT found a relative risk for a
composite adverse event outcome of about 0.85 from PGx-guided Warfarin dosing (Gage et al.

2017).

         The middle row of Figure 6 shows outcome sensitivity as the relative cost of the PGx-

guided therapy varies. Not surprisingly, we see that the NHB under a no-testing Strategy is

constant since, under that scenario, no patient receives the PGx alternative therapy. But if the

relative cost of the PGx alternative is 2x or more when 𝜆𝜆 = $100,000/𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄 then genetic testing

is not the recommended strategy. Again, however, this decision is heavily dependent on the

chosen value of 𝜆𝜆 since, when 𝜆𝜆 = $150,000/𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄 a preemptive strategy remains optimal.

         Finally, in the last row of Figure 6 we show how sensitive our results are to assumptions

on the likelihood that pharmacogenomic information is ordered and/or acted upon. In a reactive

strategy, this corresponds to the probability that the physician orders the genetic test at the time

of drug indication; in real-world settings this probability has been demonstrated to be well below

100% in scenarios where a genetic test is not mandated by FDA guidelines (J. F. Peterson et al.

2016). Similarly, in a preemptive strategy this value corresponds to the probability that genetic

information obtained upstream is utilized by the physician.

         The figure demonstrates that the relative value of reactive testing vs. a preemptive

approach is heavily influenced by the probability that the physician orders and/or acts on the

information. For example, when 𝜆𝜆 = $150,000 and the probability of use is high, then a

preemptive strategy is optimal. However, when this probability is low then the reactive strategies

win out.
Figure 6. One-Way Sensitivity Analysis for the High-High-High (Warfarin) Scenario
        In Figure 7 we explore these relationships further by plotting the optimal strategy as a

function of two varying parameters: the relative risk reduction, and the probability that genomic

information is used. Again, these estimates correspond to the High-High-High (Warfarin)

scenario, and are derived from a linear metamodel fit with an interaction term between the two

parameters. The figure is further divided into two panels corresponding to results using 𝜆𝜆 =

$100,000/𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄 and 𝜆𝜆 = $150,000/𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄.

        The results in Figure 7 show, again, that if the risk of an adverse event under the PGx

alternative is similar to the risk under the standard therapy, then a no testing strategy is preferred.

However, for low relative risk values (i.e., 0.8 or below) the optimal strategy is preemptive

multiplexed testing only if the probability of the physician utilizing the information is high; if

this probability is low, then reactive serial single gene testing is preferred.




        Figure 7. Two-Way Sensitivity Analysis Based on Linear Metamodel
Expected Value of Partial Perfect Information

           To generalize our sensitivity results we now turn to our estimates of the EVPPI for each

of the varying model parameters. The EVPPI estimates for the top 25 highest-valued parameters

for 𝜆𝜆 = $100,000/𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄 are provided in Table 5 below. These values are also summarized in

the slopegraph depicted in Figure 8, which visualizes how the prioritization of key parameters

changes over different values of 𝜆𝜆.

           Again, as noted in the methods section above the EVPPI provides a dollar-valued

estimate of the opportunity cost of selecting the wrong strategy. Echoing the result in Figure 5

(i.e., that a no genotyping strategy is optimal in nearly all simulations), the EVPPI for almost all

parameters is $0 when 𝜆𝜆 = $50,000/𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄. In other words, because the overall decision to not

genotype is robust under nearly all plausible parameter values, there is little value in conducting

additional research that can inform knowlege of the specific parameter values in practice.

           By comparison, however, at 𝜆𝜆 = $100,000/𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄 several categories of model

parameters stand out as influential. These parameters mostly relate to the High-High-High (e.g.,

Warfarin-CYP2C9/VKORC1) and High-Low-High (Clopidogrel-CYP2C19) scenarios.

Moreover, within these categories the most influential determinants of the cost-effectiveness of

genotyping relate to the risk reduction from a PGx alternative (black lines in Figure 8), to the

relative cost of the PGx alternative (green lines), and to parameters governing physician behavior

to genotype and/or act upon genotying information obtained upstream (blue lines). Taken

together, our results on the EVPPI indicate that scientific evidence on PGx should focus on these

factors.

           Finally, it is notable also that the parameters governing the cost of the genetic tests

receive EVPPI estimates of $0 across the entire range of willingness to pay thresholds (Table 5).
That is, lowering (or raising) the cost of genotyping rarely, if ever, changes our decision on the

optimal strategy. Rather, it is the parameters that govern downstream costs and behavior that are

key determinants of decision-making.

Threshold

Conclusion

       The integration of pharmacogenomics into routine clinical practice is key to the overall

vision of precision medicine. However, despite substantial and growing body of scientific

evidence and enthusiasm of many clinical practitioners, funding agencies, and policymakers,

pharmacogenomic testing has yet to be broadly and routinely adopted by health care systems. In

large part, adoption is hindered by a lack of payor reimbursement and confidence that

multiplexed testing will yield downstream improved health care outcomes and acceptable costs.

       In this study, we attempt to bridge key research gaps by developing a methodological

framework for assessing the long term value of PGx testing strategies. Our modeling approach

overcomes several distinct limitations of past work by broadening both the scope and time

horizon for PGx to affect patient costs and health outcomes. Moreover, by coupling real-world

evidence on a PGx implementation with novel value of information methods, we are able to
identify scenarios where preemptive testing and single-gene testing are each cost-effective. Our

sensitivity analyses, moreover, clarifies the circumstances in which PGx testing strategies may

be optimal, and can be used to prioritize future work by highlighting parameters and specific

gene-drug scenarios that drive the overall cost-effectiveness.
