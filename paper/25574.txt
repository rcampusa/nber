                                          ABSTRACT

Central to the welfare analysis of income transfer programs is the deadweight loss associated with
possible reforms. To aid analytical tractability, its measurement typically requires specifying a
simplified model of behavior. We employ a complementary “decomposition” approach that
compares the behavioral and mechanical components of a policy’s total impact on the
government budget to study the deadweight loss of two unemployment insurance policies.
Experimental and quasi-experimental estimates using state administrative data show that
increasing the weekly benefit is more efficient (with a fiscal externality of 53 cents per dollar of
mechanical transferred income) than reducing the program’s implicit earnings tax.

1    Introduction

In designing social insurance and income transfer programs, policymakers are primarily interested in how to

best provide adequate material support at minimal taxpayer cost. It has long been recognized that increasing

the generosity of income or in-kind transfers may in theory generate unintended work disincentives that lead

to additional program costs. In the context of unemployment insurance (UI) programs, the focus of this pa-

per, more generous benefits may reduce job search effort, leading to longer periods of unemployment. These

negative labor supply effects have been estimated in an extensive literature (for comprehensive reviews, see

Krueger and Meyer, 2002 and Schmieder and von Wachter, 2016).

    More recent studies have sought to better understand the normative implications of these estimated be-

havioral effects for UI (e.g., Gruber 1997; Chetty 2008; Schmieder, von Wachter and Bender 2012; Lawson

2015, 2017; Nekoei and Weber 2017; Kolsrud et al. 2018).1 The welfare analysis of UI by Chetty (2008),

which builds on work by Baily (1978), specifies a stylized job search model in which a representative

worker optimizes her search effort in response to UI benefits and a fixed-wage job offer distribution. Using

this model, one can express the full benefits and costs of a reform using a small number of reduced-form

parameters, one of them corresponding to the labor supply effects that have been central to the empirical

labor literature. Using this “sufficient statistics” method, Schmieder and von Wachter (2016) systematically

review the most recent wave of empirical studies on UI and provide a mapping of existing estimates of

labor supply behavioral elasticities to the fiscal externality—the excess fiscal cost that results from behav-

ioral responses—associated with marginal changes in benefit levels and benefit lengths, which are meant to

summarize the deadweight loss of the policy.

    While this approach makes welfare analyses analytically tractable, it is unclear to what extent the choice

of behavioral model (and hence the consequent sufficient statistics formulae) might itself affect estimates of

fiscal costs. As one example, optimal UI models typically assume that eligible claimants receive full benefits

for each week that they are unemployed. However, this is not true in practice as individuals can choose to

forgo claiming benefits in any given week, or receive partial benefits for working part time while claiming

UI. These additional margins of adjustment could have consequential effects on the fiscal costs that are not

captured by standard models of UI in the sufficient statistics literature.
   1 The framework has been adapted to study policy design in other social insurance and transfer program settings, such as Pell

grant (Denning, Marx and Turner, 2017), workers’ compensation (Bronchetti, 2012), and sick pay (Bockerman, Kanninen and
Suoniemi, 2015).



                                                               1
    This paper proposes a complementary, nonparametric strategy for measuring the fiscal externality as-

sociated with changes to income-transfer programs and applies the approach to UI policies. Instead of

specifying a particular behavioral model that leads to an expression for the fiscal externality as a function

of reduced-form elasticities or other model primitives, we utilize an accounting identity that holds both

for every individual data point and in the aggregate: the impact of a UI reform on total government net

expenditures can be decomposed into a “mechanical component,” the budgetary impact in the absence of

behavioral responses, and a component driven by responses to the reform, the fiscal externality. This exter-

nality is nonparametrically identified by the difference between the total effect on benefit expenditures net

of tax receipts and the “mechanical effect,” both of which, given some policy variation of interest, can be

easily and directly measured in the data.2 This “decomposition” approach naturally follows from the widely

understood notion in public economics that the impact of a marginal reform on government revenues can

be sufficient to characterize marginal efficiencies or deadweight loss. A key benefit of our methodology is

that it will produce the same quantity across a very broad class of behavioral models and requires minimal

assumptions regarding individual-specific heterogeneity. Although this strategy is the logical consequence

of well-known principles in public economics, it has not been employed to estimate the fiscal externalities

of UI policies. To the best of our knowledge, the approach has yet to be employed in other income-transfer

and taxation settings more broadly.3

    We apply our decomposition approach to a study of the fiscal externalities associated with two distinct

policies that affect the UI benefit generosity. First, we estimate the fiscal externality induced by an incre-

mental change in the UI weekly benefit amount, a magnitude that plays a key role in the recent optimal UI

literature and the margin of interest in a large number of empirical studies of UI (Moffitt, 1985; Meyer, 1990;

Card et al., 2015a,b; Lalive, van Ours and Zweimüller 2006; Chetty 2008; Kroft and Notowidigdo 2016;

and DellaVigna et al., 2017). Second, we also estimate the fiscal externality induced by a seldom-discussed

feature of UI systems — the fact that all U.S. states allow workers to be “partially unemployed” (i.e., with

some limited earnings) and still be able to receive some UI benefits, as dictated by an earnings deduction
   2 We use the term “nonparametric” to describe this strategy because it allows the behavioral model to have parameters of arbitrary

dimension. Instead of deriving an expression for the fiscal externality as a function of a small number of elasticities, we are
estimating the fiscal externality directly.
    3 For example, the optimal tax literature focuses on using elasticities (such as the elasticity of taxable income) to estimate the

efficiency of taxation (Feldstein, 1999; Saez, Slemrod and Giertz, 2012), though it has been acknoweledged that an alternative
method is to focus directly on the behavioral component of the government revenue impact (Auerbach, 1985, Slemrod, 1998,
Kleven and Kreiner, 2005, Chetty, 2009a). Hendren (2016)’s framework emphasizes the sufficiency of examining the impact of
various tax and transfer policies on government budgets but empirically relies on existing elasticities estimated in the literature.



                                                                  2
formula. While some studies (McCall, 1996; Le Barbanchon, 2016) have investigated the behavioral re-

sponse to variation in the disregard amount (i.e., earnings threshold above which UI benefits are reduced),

our paper examines the response to a reduction in the implicit tax rate.

    We study these policies in the context of Washington State in the mid-nineties. In 1994, the Washington

State legislature authorized a randomized experiment to examine the impact of changing the benefit formula

for partially unemployed workers. One quarter of all new UI claimants starting from the fourth quarter

of 1994 and lasting for one year were randomized into a treatment group that saw their weekly benefit
                        2
amount reduced by       3   of every dollar earned as opposed to the control group’s rate of 75 cents per dollar—

see the report by O’Leary (1997) for details. We use the experimental variation to estimate the total and

behavioral effects of a change in this implicit tax rate on the government’s budget. Furthermore, we provide

quasi-experimental evidence on the fiscal externality of a marginal change in the weekly benefit amount by

applying a regression kink design along the lines of Card, Lee and Pei (2009); Card et al. (2015a,b). Our

analysis uses detailed UI claim and quarterly earnings data for the entire universe of claimants eligible for

the experiment in the quarters leading up to the filing and for four quarters or more after the initial date of

the claim.

    Our empirical analysis finds statistically significant estimates of the fiscal externalities for both the

experimental reduction in the implicit tax rate on earnings and the quasi-experimental variation in the weekly

benefit amount. For the marginal dollar that is transferred to inframarginal UI claimants via an increase in the

weekly benefit amount, we estimate that between 27 cents and 79 cents are spent on the behavioral response

to the change. In comparison, the reduction in the implicit tax rate — for which there was hope of a negative

behavioral cost — incurred a fiscal externality of $1.38, and we can statistically rule out magnitudes less

than $0.49 per dollar of mechanical transfer. Most of this fiscal externality appears to be driven by the

impact of the behavioral response on benefit expenditures, as opposed to lost tax revenue. Comparing our

RKD and experimental results suggests that the relatively more fiscally efficient way to transfer income is

via an increase in the weekly benefit amount, not a reduction in the implicit tax rate.4 The total behavioral

costs found here are on the high end of the range reported for the U.S. in the survey by Schmieder and von

Wachter (2016). Finally, when we take a typical “sufficient statistics” approach and obtain an expression for

the same fiscal externality using a job search model, we arrive at a significantly higher estimate, suggesting
   4 Although   we show that one policy is more fiscally efficient, a full welfare comparison requires information on the relative
social benefits of each policy, which may depend on the specific behavioral responses to the policy.



                                                                3
that the choice of the simplified behavioral model affects the measurement of fiscal externality. We further

show that the magnitude of the estimate is quite sensitive to other simplifying approximations that would be

common in typical “sufficient statistic” exercises.

      The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 uses a standard public economics frame-

work to define fiscal externality and to contrast existing identification strategies to the decomposition ap-

proach taken in this paper. In Section 3, we describe the Washington State’s UI system, the earnings deduc-

tion experiment, and aspects of the administrative data relevant to our analysis. We present our results in

Section 4 and conclude in Section 5 by summarizing our findings and their implications, as well as identi-

fying some important directions for further work.



2      Conceptual and Econometric Framework

Using a standard public economics framework, this section defines the fiscal externality parameter of interest

and reviews its role in the literature on the welfare analysis of UI. First, we contrast the typical sufficient

statistics approach used to empirically analyze the problem with the complementary decomposition strategy

that we adopt. Then, we describe its implementation in the specific cases of using UI benefit variation from

a randomized experiment and a regression kink design, which we later employ in our empirical analysis.


2.1     The Fiscal Externality Parameter

We first introduce notation to define the fiscal externality parameter of interest. Let the vector-valued func-

tion Yi (θ , τ) represent the reduced-form optimal choices of individual i in response to the UI policy rules,

parameterized by θ (e.g. benefit levels) and the tax schedule τ (a tax parameter). For simplicity of exposi-

tion, we consider θ and τ to be scalars.5 Yi could include, for example, a “reservation wage” for accepting

a job offer, job search effort, the number of hours worked in a given week, an individual’s benefit take-up

threshold above which the individual will take up the benefit, or any other related labor supply, consump-

tion, or program participation choices; the function represents the individual’s optimal response for any

given value of the parameters θ , τ. Let the net transfer (UI benefits less taxes paid) to the individual be

represented by the function B (Yi (θ , τ) , θ ) − T (Yi (θ , τ) , τ), where B (·, ·) are UI benefits and T (·, ·) are

taxes, both of which depend on the choices Yi (θ , τ) and the policy parameters θ and τ. This function com-

                                                                   4
bines the UI benefit formula (e.g. benefits are paid out according to past and future earnings), and the tax

schedule, with choices to determine the actual benefits and taxes paid.

    We now consider making benefits more generous through an increase in θ . Letting the expectation

operator E [·] represent averaging over all individuals in the heterogeneous population and suppressing sub-

script i, we can decompose the marginal cost of the increase in θ in terms of net dollars transferred into two

Relation to Optimal Unemployment Insurance

While this “marginal excess burden” parameter stands on its own as an interpretable summary of the fiscal

consequences of the policy change, it also plays a central role in existing welfare analyses of UI. To review

these standard results from the literature, let Vi (·, ·, ·) be individual i’s utility function with B(Yi , θ ), T (Yi , τ),

and Yi (θ , τ) as arguments. To aggregate individual utilities to social welfare, we use the function Gi (·) to

translate an individual’s utility to a metric that can be averaged across individuals. The social planner’s
                                                                            1

subject to a balanced budget constraint E [B − T ] = 0 (where we have suppressed arguments of B and T and

describes the necessary change in tax parameter τ that is required to offset the budgetary impact of a marginal

change in UI parameter θ .8

      Taking the derivative of (3) with respect to θ subject to a balanced budget, a marginal increase in the UI

balance the budget).

Although the framework above is introduced with unrestricted heterogeneity, it is helpful to build intu-

ition by considering the simpler (and more commonly adopted) case of a representative agent (see, e.g.,
                                                                                                                            V1

where VV2 ·φ
          1
             represents the individual’s valuation of an extra dollar of UI benefits (via an increase in θ ) relative

to the value of the increase in taxes (via τ) levied to pay for the increase in θ . Since individuals pay taxes

when employed and receive UI benefits when unemployed, α reflects the insurance value of transferring

income from the employed to the unemployed state. In the more general case with heterogeneous agents, α

will contain the the ratio of aggregate welfare gain from an increased UI transfer to the aggregate welfare

gain from decreased taxation.

    Equally important to the social planner’s cost–benefit analysis is the right side of the relation (4)—the

fiscal externality from the transfer, β + γ.10 β represents the amount of additional benefits that need to be

paid out per one dollar of “mechanical transfer” as a consequence of the behavioral response to the policy

change, while γ represents the analogous loss in tax receipts. The higher the quantity β + γ is, the less likely

one is to conclude that there is a net welfare gain to increasing θ ; or put differently, the larger the α would

need to be in order to justify the marginal increase in θ . β + γ can also be computed for different policies

and compared to determine which policy transfers income more efficiently (e.g., increase in the maximum

weekly benefit level or increasing the potential duration of benefits), as suggested in Schmieder and von

Wachter (2016).

    The comparison of α and β + γ in (4) is central to a number of studies in the optimal UI literature. A

typical approach entails specifying a job search model in which a representative unemployed agent decides

the effort with which to search for a new job or the minimum wage at which a job offer is accepted, while

the social planner chooses the benefit policy that maximizes the agent’s utility subject to a balanced budget

constraint (Baily, 1978; Gruber, 1997; Shimer and Werning, 2007; Chetty, 2008; Schmieder, von Wachter
  10 Our definition of fiscal externality captures the externality that occurs when individuals do not account for the impact of their
actions on the government budget, similar to the recent work by Hendren (2016). Note that this is different from the definition
in Lawson (2017), who defines “fiscal externality” as the impact of individual actions on the non-UI portion of the government
budget.



                                                                  7
and Bender, 2012; Landais, 2015). Under the assumptions of these models, the social costs of a policy, β +γ,

can typically be expressed as a function of a reduced-form behavioral elasticity, such as the elasticity of

unemployment durations with respect to benefits, while the social benefits α can be expressed as a function

of a risk aversion parameter and the change in consumption associated with job loss.11 A driving motivation

for this “sufficient statistics” approach is its empirical tractability: it conveniently allows one to use existing

reduced-form estimates of behavioral responses from the literature to inform welfare analyses.

    However, the degree of sensitivity of the conclusions of these welfare analyses to the choice of equally

plausible alternative behavioral models – each of which would presumably lead to different expressions – is

unknown. Each optimal UI formula in the studies above relies on simplifying assumptions and approxima-

tions that rule out what is believed to be second-order behavioral aspects in order to express α and β + γ as

a function of a small number of parameters. For example, the model of Chetty (2008) assumes that an indi-

vidual is initially unemployed, and once a job offer is accepted, she remains employed until the final period,

even though movements back and forth between UI receipt and employment are observed in the data.12

Additionally, as is typically the case in optimal UI analyses, there is little or no discussion of imperfect

take-up and the possibility that more generous benefits may impact take-up even though the take-up rate of

benefits is far from complete.13 Furthermore, the model assumes a fixed pretax wage and a “representative

agent,” ruling out various forms of heterogeneity. Although these models can be extended to rely on fewer

simplifications, doing so without offsetting assumptions leads to more parameters to estimate (which may or

may not be available in the literature) but does not meaningfully resolve the question of whether the welfare

conclusions are sensitive to the choice of an inevitable set of modeling restrictions one must make.


Complementary Decomposition Approach

In this paper, we propose using a complementary decomposition approach to measure β and γ. Specifically,

instead of assuming a particular structure and functional form for B (·, ·), T (·, ·), and Yi (θ , τ) that would lead
  11 Alternative  forms of the optimal UI formula may contain unemployment duration responses to lump-sum transfers (Chetty,
2008) or reservation wage responses to benefit increases (Shimer and Werning, 2007).
   12 Thirty percent of the claimants in our data have at least two unemployment spells over the course of their benefit year, where

we define the end of a spell to be three or more weeks without a claim.
   13 See Blank and Card (1991), Anderson and Meyer (1997), and Vroman (2009) for evidence of incomplete take-up in UI, and

Kroft (2008) for a discussion of the theoretical implications of this imperfect take-up. Although this literature focuses on the fraction
of eligible unemployed workers who do not receive any UI over the unemployment spell, another type of “imperfect take-up” could
occur if workers start claiming UI, but decide not to claim benefits in specific weeks despite being eligible. While the approach
proposed in our paper can in theory capture the fiscal effects of both types of take-up given sufficient data, we focus on the latter
type in our empirical application.

    This empirical approach follows naturally from the insight of the public economics literature that within

a broad class of models, the behavioral impact on the government budget is sufficient for measuring eco-

nomic efficiency for welfare analysis. However, although the decomposition of impacts on government

revenue has been implicitly and explicitly suggested in numerous papers throughout the public economics

literature, the estimation of the fiscal externality directly from microdata has yet to be employed in studies

of UI, or to the best of our knowledge, in studies of other income transfer programs.15

    This decomposition approach to estimating the fiscal externality has two potential advantages. First,

when working with administrative program data, which is increasingly prevalent in analyses of UI (Schmieder

and von Wachter, 2016), data on government expenses and revenues are often more complete, compared to

measures of labor supply or job search behavior that are required to faithfully estimate hypothesized be-

havioral models that might be constructed to conduct welfare analysis.16 In the absence of the true labor

supply measures, the observed data are used to proxy for those behaviors. For example, it is common in

the US context to construct a single spell of UI receipt from claim data, and to presume that these spells
  14 Another   technical advantage of this approach is that for a non-marginal reform it is often easier to estimate the mechanical
effect of the reform and infer the behavioral effect as a “residual” than to estimate the behavioral effects of the reform directly,
which requires information about how behavioral elasticities change over the policy path (see Chetty 2009b and Kleven 2018 for
details). Appendix A shows that the mechanical effect of a large reform can be approximated using the trapezoid rule by the average
of mechanical effects from two decompositions.
   15 Attributing the idea to Auerbach (1985) and Slemrod (1998), Chetty (2009a) notes that one way of measuring the deadweight

loss of income taxation is to estimate the behavioral component of the overall impact on the government budget. Hendren (2016)
recently emphasizes the sufficiency of a policy’s causal impact on government revenue for welfare analysis but computes the fiscal
externality of several policies using existing labor supply or taxable income elasticities. In a review and extension of the sufficient
statistics approach, Kleven (2018) notes the generality of the principle that marginal efficiency loss is given by the behavioral
impact on government revenue, tracing the clarification of these principles to discussions in Feldstein (1999), Saez (2004), and
Kleven and Kreiner (2005). Ashenfelter and Plant (1990) use a similar decomposition method to analyze labor supply responses to
the SIME/DIME experiment by computing the difference between actual NIT payments of an experimental group and the predicted
payments using the control group, but does not consider its relation to measures of efficiency and welfare as recognized in the
public economics literature.
   16 We do note here that the scope of our study is limited by the available data to studying UI as an isolated system, which is

typical in the optimal UI literature. A more comprehensive view, which would embed the UI system and incorporate interactions
with the rest of the government budget (see Lawson, 2015 and Leung and O’Leary, Forthcoming for discussions of UI program
interactions), would require a dataset that contains all government expenses and revenues (related and unrelated to the UI program),
for both the beneficiary and non-beneficiary populations, firms, and other entities.



                                                                  9
approximately correspond to actual spells of non-employment, when we know empirically that this is not

necessarily the case. As another example, specific models of behavior may have predictions about weekly

wages and hours which are typically not observed for those who do not file a weekly claim. Finally, richer

behavioral models that allow for heterogeneity in wage offer distributions or in reservation wages are likely

to require data that are even more difficult or infeasible to obtain.

    Second, and more importantly, given that Yi (θ , τ) can take on a very general form, with arbitrary di-

mension, the decomposition approach is consistent with a wide range of behavioral models. Because of

this degree of model-insensitivity, the decomposition measures of β + γ can serve as a nonparametric, com-

plementary benchmark to these other strategies. Since the decomposition approach uses a strict subset of

assumptions compared to a “sufficient statistics” or structural approach, if one uses all three approaches

on the same data and obtains different estimates of the same fiscal parameter β + γ, then one must con-

clude that the differences are being driven by the additional modeling assumptions that undergird either the

“elasticities-to-welfare” formula of the sufficient statistics approach, or the structural estimation of the fiscal

externality.

    We point out three important qualifications to the application of the decomposition approach that we

present in the paper. First, throughout this paper, we use the term “sufficient statistics approach” to refer

to the general idea of leaving primitives of an underlying behavioral model unindentified, while focusing

on how high-level parameters (i.e. elasticities) that can inform a welfare analysis of a policy (see Chetty,

2009b). In this context, our main point is that a decomposition that leaves the behavioral effect as the

“residual” allows one to inform welfare analysis, while making even fewer assumptions about the structure

of the problem than a standard “sufficient statistics approach.” On the other hand, we note that typically,

when the “sufficient statistics approach” is applied to a specific context—such as an assessment of the

optimality (or non-optimality) of the level of UI—one needs to ascertain estimates of both β + γ (the fiscal

externality) and α (the consumption smoothing benefit). Since we only focus on β + γ, we can only make

directional statements, like the minimal value of α that would justify a marginal increase in benefit levels;

or, alternatively, it can address the question of the relative efficiency of different mechanisms of transfer (as

discussed in Schmieder and von Wachter, 2016). In order to answer the question of whether current levels

of UI are optimal, we would have to combine our nonparametric estimate of β + γ with estimates of α

obtained through an alternative approach. It is clear from equation (4) that any claim of identifying α must

be implicitly or explicitly making a claim about the nature of social and individual utility functions Gi and

                                                        10
Vi , which is beyond the scope of the current paper.

    Second, the decomposition approach does not circumvent the need to maintain other assumptions about

the broader economy, ones that are unavoidably invoked in either a “sufficient statistics” or structural ap-

proach. For example, in a standard sufficient statistics analysis, in order to interpret the fiscal externality

parameter as capturing the full welfare costs of a policy, one must abstract away from other pre-existing

distortions in the economy. In the UI setting, this abstraction is problematic if economic agents are not

optimizing or if markets are not fully efficient, which creates the potential for UI policies to have additional

externalities that are relevant for welfare analysis. For example, Spinnewijn (2014) shows that when un-

employed workers are (sub-optimally) overly optimistic or pessimistic about job finding probabilities, there

is an additional cost or saving (to the individual) in changing UI benefit generosity beyond the impact on

government budgets. In terms of market inefficiencies, Landais, Michaillat and Saez (2018) show that UI

may have an effect on labor market tightness if a worker’s search effort impacts others who are also looking

for a job. The decomposition approach does not require any additional assumptions beyond that which are

already invoked to abstract from these effects.

    Finally, we also note that the decomposition approach cannot circumvent the need to make extrapolative

parametric restrictions if there is interest in making predictions of marginal efficiency for large changes

of θ that are far beyond the variation observed in the data (e.g. a reduction in the implicit tax rate from

0.75 to 0.20 in the earnings deduction experiment). In order to make predictions beyond the range of

the observed policy variation, one clearly needs to make parametric assumptions, whether that comes in

the form of a stylized model that is the basis of a sufficient statistics approach or a structural model that

specifies primitives (see Kleven, 2018 for a recent discussion of these issues). This is why we view the

decomposition approach as a useful complementary benchmark: in principle, since any particular structural

model is contained within the broad class of models for which the decomposition approach is valid, then

if it is correctly specified, it should produce the same magnitude of β + γ. If it does not, it would indicate

that the structure itself is distorting measurement of the fiscal externality. In Section 4.3, we show in our

empirical setting how the necessary model and simplifying approximations adopted in Schmieder and von

Wachter (2016) for comparing fiscal externalities across studies using only reported elasticities may lead to

different estimates of β + γ.

the mechanical effect on benefit payments, E ∂∂ θB . In the case of the Washington State earnings deduction

experiment, credible identification of these parameters in response to a change in the implicit marginal tax

rate of benefits is straightforward. In the experiment, one quarter of the sample was randomly assigned to an

alternative UI benefit schedule. The most important difference between the benefit schedules of the treatment

and control groups was the variation in the implicit marginal tax rate. In the control group, workers’ weekly

UI benefits were reduced by 75 cents for every dollar earned above $5 (the “disregard”), whereas the benefits

of members in the treatment group were reduced by 32 of every dollar earned above a $15 disregard.

control means of benefits (less taxes) received by claimants. Identification of the mechanical effect E ∂∂ θB is

achieved by using the observed data from the control group and calculating the benefits that they would have

received if their benefits were instead determined by the treatment group’s benefit schedule, assuming no

behavioral response (e.g., no change in earnings or take-up). The difference between this simulated average

and the control average yields the mechanical effect.17

      As discussed more fully in Section 3.2, in practice we do not observe actual tax receipts, but the admin-

istrative data do contain individual earnings as reported by the employer to the UI agency, which are the

amounts used to determine the actual tax amount. Thus, we very closely approximate actual tax receipts at

the individual level by approximating the statutory tax schedule.


Fiscal Externality from a Regression Kink Design: Changing the Weekly Benefit Amount

Fiscal externalities corresponding to a marginal change in the weekly benefit amount can be identified

using quasi-experimental variation from a regression kink design (Card et al., 2015b). Specifically, most
  17 An   alternative decomposition can be obtained by applying the control schedule to the treated group. If the reform is small
enough, the difference between the mechanical effect calculations should be minimal. For a larger reform, however, the average of
the two mechanical effects more closely approximates the actual mechanical effect, as we show in Appendix A. In our application,
the second decomposition – simulating the treatment group’s benefits under the control formula – leads to an overstatement of the
mechanical effect because some treated units are observed to have exhausted their benefits, which censors the simulated outcome
(i.e., we do not observe simulated spells that extend beyond the actual weeks claimed).




                                                              12
UI systems determine the weekly benefit amount for the fully employed as a constant fraction of some

measure of past earnings, but the benefit amount is capped at a fixed nominal level. This feature of the UI

formula creates a kink in the relationship between past earnings and the benefit amount.

    More concretely, let X̃ denote past earnings and wba the UI weekly benefit amount. The statutory

relationship between wba and X̃ is wba = min(λ X̃, θ ), where λ is the constant multiplier on past earnings

and θ the cap. The cap induces a kink in the formula at X̃ = θ /λ , and we introduce a normalized running

variable X = X̃ − θ /λ so that the location of the kink is X = 0. The UI weekly benefit amount formula in

terms of X is

                                                       wba = θ + min(λ X, 0),                                   (5)

which is graphically represented in panel A of Figure 1. Panel B of Figure 1 represents the conceptual policy

reform of raising wba by $1, which is equivalent to raising the cap θ by $1 as seen in equation (5).

    Since there is a sudden change in the UI marginal replacement rate as X moves across 0, the kink in

the weekly benefit formula offers quasi-experimental leverage to identify the total effect of the reform. In

particular, there is an RKD analogue to the identification statements made above for the earnings deduction

experiment. Under various smoothness assumptions as specified in Card et al. (2015b) and assuming a sharp

design with no deviation from formula (5), the ratio of the slope change in the conditional expectation of

total benefit B (tax T ) to the slope change in the wba formula identifies a weighted average of the total effect

of increasing wba, or equivalently θ , on total benefit B (tax T ):

is the total UI payment under the existing regime; the first term, B (Yi (θ , τ) , θ + 1) is the simulated to-

tal UI payment under the reform represented by the dashed line in panel B of Figure 1. In simulating

B (Yi (θ , τ) , θ + 1), we keep UI duration, labor supply and take-up behavior fixed while allowing the worker

one more dollar in weekly benefit amount.19 The expectation of this variable, conditional on X = 0, is

This represents the weighted mechanical effect of the marginal increase in θ , where the weight is the same

as that in equation (6).20

       With the quantities in (6) and (8), we can thus identify, analogous to the randomized experiment, the

fiscal externality as
                                            h         i    h                 i    h              i

                                                                                            · ∂θ
                                 h             i        =            h                    i                                             (9)
                                                                                  ,τ),θ )
                                E ∂∂ θB |X = 0                   E ω · ∂ B(Y(θ  ∂θ


       While this “weighted average” version of the fiscal externality of an increase in the weekly benefit

amount resembles the expression in (2), there is an important difference between (9) and (2): the total

marginal effect applies only to individual’s responses when they are at the maximum benefit level. This

qualification is inevitable for regression kink designs. Although the weights ω are unobservable, we can

examine the conditional mean of any observable baseline characteristic C at X = 0, E[C|X = 0], which is

equal to E[ω ·C]. By comparing the characteristics of overall claimant population and those at the threshold,
  19 As   will be evident in our discussion in Section 4, this is a simplification of the simulation of the mechanical effect that we
must perform. In particular, the above expression does not incorporate limits on the maximum benefits payable. In our empirical
analysis, we ensure that we adjust the data to account for the fact that a higher weekly benefit will cause some individuals to exhaust
benefits earlier than observed in the data.
   20 In our application, the first stage is very strong but falls short of being deterministic, as a small fraction (6 percent) of observa-

tions appear to deviate from the statutory schedule. Instead of the sharp regression kink design discussed here for ease of presenting
the main idea, our empirical setting requires the application of a fuzzy RKD. The weights for the mechanical and total effects are
generally not the same in a fuzzy RKD, but we propose a testable condition in Appendix C that imply the same weighting scheme
for both the mechanical and total effects, and present evidence that this condition is met in our setting.




                                                                     14
one can get a sense of the extent to which the resulting RKD estimate applies to all other claimants. We

report estimates of these characteristics in Section 3.

      For the fiscal externality quantity in (9) to correspond to a policy such as increasing the weekly benefit

amount uniformly for all workers, some additional restrictions on unobserved heterogeneity are required.

One approach that would respect the fact that the mechanical effect of these policies may be heterogeneous,

and that also avoids making assumptions about the weights ω, is to adopt the approximation that the behav-

ioral effects are constant proportions of the mechanical effects for each individual. That is,                     ∂B
                                                                                                                   ∂ Yi   · ∂∂Yθi = k0 ∂∂ θB

and   ∂T
      ∂ Yi   · ∂∂Yθi = k1 ∂∂ θB , where k0 and k1 are constant across the population. This would imply that the RKD

fiscal externality quantity in (9) would equal k0 − k1 and also equal the fiscal externality (2) for the full

population. We elaborate on the assumptions that would permit this extrapolation in Appendix B.



3      The Unemployment Insurance System in Washington State

This section describes the unemployment insurance benefit formula, the state of Washington’s randomized

experiment for studying the effects of partial UI, and the data used for our empirical analysis.

      In Washington, UI claimants are eligible to receive a weekly benefit amount based on the earnings and

hours in their “base year” (or “base period”), which is defined as the first four of the last five completed

calendar quarters before the week of the initial claim.21 A claimant must have worked at least 680 hours

in the base year to be eligible for UI benefits, a feature that is unique to Washington and thereby leads

to employers’ reporting of claimants’ history of hours worked. If the applicant is eligible, two quantities

are computed for her: the weekly benefit amount and the maximum benefits payable. The weekly benefit

amount—the amount they can receive while unemployed, subject to a job search requirement—is calculated

as 1/50 of the sum of the two highest quarterly earnings within the base year, subject to a maximum and

minimum.22 The maximum benefits payable is the total amount of UI payments that can be made within

one year of the initial filing date. This total amount is equal to the lesser of 30 times their weekly benefit

amount and 1/3 of their total base year earnings.

      Formally, the weekly benefit amount (wba) and the maximum benefits payable (mbp) can be expressed
   21 For example, if an individual first files a claim in February 1995, then their base year is defined as starting on October 1, 1993

and ending on September 30, 1994. Claimants who are ineligible for UI benefits under the primary definition of the base year
can use the most recent four completed quarters (in this example, from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1994) to determine their
eligibility and benefits.
   22 We will omit the minimum weekly benefit amount from our analysis and in the following discussion because that threshold is

binding for only a small proportion of our sample.


                                                                  15
as functions of the quarterly earnings in the base year in the following way: Let Q1 (highest), Q2 , Q3 , and

Q4 (lowest) be the quarterly earnings within the base year. Suppose, for this example, that the maximum

weekly benefit amount is $350.23 Then

                                                                      
                                                          Q1 + Q2
                                                wba = min         , 350
                                                            50

                                                                           
                                                          Q1 + Q2 + Q3 + Q4
                                      mbp = min 30 · wba,
                                                                  3

    To identify the impact of a change in the weekly benefit level, we exploit the kink in the wba formula as

a function of the sum of the two highest quarter earnings in the base year. However, as is clear from the mbp

formula, there is an additional kink in the maximum benefits as a function of the total base year earnings.
                                                                                                                          Q3 +Q4
To visualize where these kinks occur, and how they relate to each other, let X̃ = Q1 + Q2 and R =                         Q1 +Q2 ,

and consider regions of X̃-R space, as in Figure 2.

    The figure shows that there are four regions where the wba and mbp will be computed differently, and as

a result, the boundaries between these regions will coincide with a kink in those quantities.24 Focusing on

the evolution of wba as a function of X̃, note that wba is kinked at X̃ = $17, 500. Furthermore, when R > 0.8,

mbp is also kinked as a function of X̃ at X̃ = $17, 500 (denoted boundary I). When R < 0.8, there is only a

kink in the relation between X̃ and wba at X̃ = $17, 500 (denoted boundary II). This means that a regression

kink design using normalized X̃ as the running variable identifies the marginal effect of simultaneously

increasing both the wba (e.g. by a dollar) and the mbp (e.g. by 30 dollars) for those who have R > 0.8, and

the effect of just increasing the wba (keeping mbp constant) for those with R < 0.8. In our analysis, which

pools the individuals above and below R = 0.8 to estimate the marginal effect of wba, we acknowledge that

for a subsample of individuals (those with R > 0.8), the marginal effect is overstating the effect of wba to

the extent that there is an independent marginal effect of mbp. In our analysis, we normalize X̃ to be zero at

the threshold (denoted X) as mentioned in Section 2.2.25
  23 The  maximum weekly benefit amount was $343 from July 1994–95, and $350 from July 1995–96.
  24 In principle, we can also exploit the kinks labeled III and IV on the graph in separate RKD analyses. For individuals for whom
X̃ < $17, 500, with a running variable to R, there is a kink in the relation between R and mbp at boundary III, but not between R
and wba. This allows identification of the impact of a marginal increase in mbp, keeping wba constant. The same kind of marginal
effect can be identified using Q1 + Q2 + Q3 + Q4 as the running variable, where there is a discontinuous relation between the full
base year earnings and mbp at boundary IV.
   25 The threshold was at $17,150 before July 1995, and $17,500 thereafter.




                                                               16
      The benefits that claimants are paid in any given week also depends on the amount of labor income they

earn while claiming UI. Similar to other states in the U.S., Washington has a disregard amount d for which

claimants can earn each week without penalty, and a rate ρ at which benefits are deducted for each dollar

earned above d. During the period of our sample, Washington reduces the amount that they pay a claimant

by $0.75 for each dollar that the individual earns above $5 in the week of the claim. Formally, if Y is the

amount of labor income that a claimant earns in a given week, d is the disregard, and ρ is the implicit tax

on earnings above d, then the amount of benefits that the claimant would receive that week is given by


                                         B̃ = max(0, wba − ρ(Y − d)1[Y > d])


      To summarize, as in many states in the U.S., the Washington UI system can be characterized by four

parameters: wba, mbp, ρ and d. Our goal is to examine the fiscal externality of marginal changes in wba and

ρ. While there is an extensive literature that studies the effects of changes to wba, less is known about the

effect of changes to the partial unemployment insurance parameters. Two papers that have focused on partial

unemployment insurance have used different kinds of variation in the disregard level d. McCall (1996)

studied whether the level of the partial UI earnings disregard influences a UI recipient’s job search behavior.

He used variation in the level of earnings disregard across states and within states over time and found that

a higher earnings disregard increases both the part-time and overall re-employment hazards. More recently,

Le Barbanchon (2016) uses bunching at the disregard level to show how kinks in the benefit schedule with

respect to labor income can lead to intensive margin responses. That study’s estimated earnings elasticity

with respect to the tax rate and the corresponding counterfactual simulation suggests an optimal benefit-

reduction rate of 80 percent. In practice, the disregard level d is quite low in Washington ($5 a week; $15

in the treatment group), so our interpretation of the effects will center around the impacts resulting from

variation in ρ.26




3.1     The Washington State Unemployment Insurance Earnings Deduction Experiment

For one year starting in October 1994, Washington conducted a large randomized experiment to investigate

the effects of reducing the amount of benefits deducted from claimants who work while on UI. In partic-
  26 Furthermore,  we note that we find no evidence of “bunching” at the disregard levels, which would be evidence of behavioral
responses to the disregard.


                                                              17
ular, Washington randomly assigned 25 percent of all eligible UI claimants to an alternate unemployment

insurance system whereby claimants faced a disregard rate of $15 (rather than the usual $5) per week and a

marginal tax rate of 2/3 (compared to the usual 3/4). These individuals each received a letter in the mail that

explained their more generous benefit schedules. Figure 3 illustrates the net income as a function of their

weekly earnings (under a scenario where the calculated wba is $300), for both the treatment and control

groups. Although the baseline disregard was more than 0, and the treatment group faced a higher disregard

($15), the treatment can largely be thought of as a “pivot” of the benefit schedule outward, reflecting the

lower ρ .

      To give a sense of the magnitude of transfers from being in the treatment group, consider how much a

claimant with a weekly benefit amount of $300 would receive. According to Figure 3, an individual who

does not work would see no difference between the treatment and control benefit schedules. On the other

hand, if the individual earned $405, their benefits would have been just reduced to zero in the control regime,

but would be eligible to receive an extra $42 a week—about a 10 percent increase in total income—under

the treatment regime.

      The goal of the experiment was to measure the extent to which the lower implicit tax rate could induce

claimants to work more than they otherwise would and, as a consequence, reduce the amount of UI benefits

paid. In the evaluation report of the experiment, O’Leary (1997) found that claimants in the treatment

group received $67 more in benefits in the benefit year than the control group, and furthermore, that this

amount was greater than what the control group would have received if the more generous benefit formula

were mechanically applied to the control group’s reported earnings. Thus, the behavioral response to the

reduction in the marginal tax rate was cost-increasing, rather than cost-reducing. Our analysis interprets

these experimental findings (including the impacts on earnings) within the fiscal externality framework, and

compares those effects to the quasi-experimental evidence on the marginal effect of increasing wba from

using the regression kink design.




3.2     Administrative Claims and Employer Earnings and Hours Data

We use administrative data for all individuals who filed for unemployment insurance in Washington between

October 1, 1994, and September 30, 1995. The dataset contains detailed records of claimants’ demographic

characteristics, earnings and hours as reported by the employer on a quarterly basis before and during the

                                                      18
benefit year, the weekly benefit amount, maximum benefits payable, and actual UI payment each week. The

administrative measure of quarterly hours is a distinct feature of the Washington data that most other state

UI systems do not track, and it provides an alternative measure of work activity throughout the period. The

great advantage of using the employer-reported information is that the coverage is probably as complete as

any single data source could be: we can capture work activity post-UI-filing irrespective of claiming activity.

The alternative source, which is more commonly available in existing UI studies of administrative data, is

the employee-reported earnings on the continuing claim forms, which are missing in any week for which the

individual does not claim benefits. This source complicates any interpretation of results regarding earnings

due to non-random sample selection.

    While we have highly detailed information on individuals’ earnings, we do not know the exact amount

of UI tax paid by each individual, which is needed to compute the tax component of the fiscal externality.27

Washington, like other states, uses an experience rating system whereby an employer’s payroll tax rate

depends on its history of contributions to and withdrawals from the state’s UI trust fund. Since we do not

observe the employers’ tax rates, we apply the average tax rate of each year in Washington state, defined as

total employer contributions divided by total taxable wages within the year, to individual earnings, up to the

statutory cap on taxable earnings.28

    There were 300,957 UI claimants subject to randomization during the year of the experiment. After

removing individuals from the sample who were either 1) ineligible for benefits,29 2) ineligible for the

experiment because they were part of a timber industry retraining program, or 3) had unexplained errors in

their data,30 the evaluation report used a final sample of 278,055 for their analysis (O’Leary, 1997). The

analysis in this paper begins with these 278,055 observations. We further drop a relatively small fraction of

observations in order to make our analysis less sensitive to outliers in the RKD analysis, bringing our main

analysis sample to 272,261 observations.31
  27 We  calculate our fiscal externality from the perspective of the state UI agency, who may be interested in the impact of policies
on the UI trust fund only. If we were to take a more expansive view (e.g., from the perspective of the state or federal government),
we will need to account for impacts on state and federal tax revenues. We provide alternative estimates using a “full tax wedge” (as
in Schmieder, von Wachter and Bender, 2016) to calculate the fiscal externality below and in the Appendix.
   28 Only the first $19,900 of each employee’s wages are taxable in 1994 and 1995 ($20,300 in 1996). Total contribution and taxable

wage information is available on the US Department of Labor website: https://workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/unemploy/hb394.asp
   29 Most of these individuals either did not work or worked less than the required 680 hours in their base year to qualify for

unemployment benefits.
   30 There are 927 individuals for whom it could not be explained why their weekly UI benefits did not follow the actual benefit

formula, minus any deductions recorded in the data.
   31 Specifically, we identified an unusually large number of claimants with their highest two quarterly earnings in the base year

totaling to a handful of specific values, which originated from a few employers. This concentration of observations generated
“spikes” in the distribution of the running variable. In order to prevent our RKD estimates from being too heavily influenced by


                                                                 19
    Table 1 reports the means of baseline characteristics of our main analysis sample by treatment status.

The means of these variables are of similar magnitudes to what one might expect to see in the unemployed

population, as measured by the Current Population Survey.32 For example, 64 percent of the claimants

are male and 80 percent are white, whereas the percentages for the unemployed population (including non-

claimants) from Washington State in 1994–95 from the CPS are 56 percent and 91 percent, respectively. The

average age is 37, and average years of schooling is 10.7 years in our sample. The corresponding estimates

using CPS data are 35 and 12.8 years. The small variation in means between the treatment and control

groups across all the characteristics is consistent with effective randomization of treatment status.

    The RKD analysis will produce “weighted average” marginal impacts of an increase in the weekly

benefit amount, as described in Section 2.2. Also as mentioned in Section 2.2, while those weights are

unobserved, we can nevertheless estimate the weighted means of the baseline characteristics using those

same weights. This is given by estimates of the means of the characteristics, conditional on X = 0. We

estimate regressions of each of the characteristics on a polynomial of order 6 in X, adding an interaction

between X and a treatment indicator, as well as the treatment indicator variable itself. The regression

intercepts serve as estimates of these conditional means and are reported in Column (4) of Table 1. They

show that the implicit weights discussed in Section 2.2 are such that the resulting weighted means are similar

in magnitude to the overall means from the treatment and control groups. As one might expect, given that

the weights will disproportionately upweight those expected to have earnings close to the threshold (which

is about $6,000 more than the overall average for two highest quarter earnings), the weighted average age,

fraction male, fraction white, and years of schooling—all attributes positively correlated with earnings—are

larger than the overall means in the sample.

    Column (5) of Table 1 shows the estimated jump in the derivatives from the regressions above. If

the conditions for valid causal inference from an RKD hold (Card et al., 2015b), we would expect there

to be no kinks in any of these baseline characteristics, and overall the estimates are consistent with that

prediction. Finally, in Column (6), we report the coefficients on the treatment indicator, which measures

the gap between the conditional expectation functions for the treatment and control groups. Since treatment

was assigned randomly, the detection of significant differences would be driven by an overly-restrictive
a very small number of employers, we dropped all claimants who were previously employed there, leaving us with a final sample
size of 272,261.
   32 The CPS sample consists of 1,126 individuals surveyed in Washington between 1994 and 1995 who reported being unem-

ployed.



                                                             20
functional form (e.g. the 6th-order polynomial). Overall, there are no significant differences found from

this specification, indicating that the polynomial of order 6 is a reasonable approximation for gauging these

rough magnitudes. That said, in our RKD analysis, we will explore local polynomial estimators of different

orders and bandwidths, as is standard in the RDD and RKD literature.




4      Experimental and Quasi-Experimental Fiscal Externality Estimates

This section presents the findings from the Washington UI Earnings Deduction Experiment and the regres-

sion kink design analysis. The experiment yields variation in the implicit tax rate ρ, whereas the RKD yields

variation in the weekly benefit amount wba. For both sources of variation, our focus is on estimating the

fiscal externality described in the conceptual framework, β + γ. To better understand the factors driving the

fiscal externality, we also estimate the behavioral costs due to changes in UI payments (β ) and tax receipts

(γ) separately, as well as the impact of the policy on various measures of labor supply.

      We estimate quantities within varying periods of time since the quarter of the first filing, ranging from

the same quarter of the initial filing (indicated in the tables as “Q1”) to four quarters (“Q1 to Q4”) after

the filing. Specifically, since some of our parameters combine behavioral effects on UI payments and tax

receipts (which are measured using quarterly earnings), we aggregate the weekly UI payment data so that

we measure total payments within calendar quarters. Therefore, “Q1” covers the entire quarter in which the

individual initiated the claim, and “Q1 to Q4,” for example, covers Q1 and the subsequent three calendar

quarters.33


4.1      Estimates from the UI Earnings Deduction Experiment

To estimate the fiscal externality of decreasing the earnings deduction rate, we must first decompose the

effect of the experiment on UI payments into its behavioral and mechanical components. The top four rows

of Table 2 show the average UI payments within each time frame for the treatment and control group. On

average, the control group receives a total of $2, 689 over four quarters, with most of that amount ($2, 447)

accumulating within the first three quarters. As in O’Leary (1997), we find with statistical significance that
    33 Sincethe initial filing can occur any time within the quarter, the length of the post-filing window varies from 1 to 13 weeks for
Q1. Note that in all of our time frames, all outcomes will include pre-filing data; with successful randomization and a valid RKD
design, this inclusion should “difference out” and should not impact the consistency of the estimates, but could increase sampling
variability.


                                                                  21
the treatment group received more UI benefit payments than the control group. The causal effect of the

lower implicit tax rate grows over time, from $16 in Q1 to $67 for the full Q1–Q4 time frame.

    A positive effect on total UI payments is to be expected even in the absence of any behavioral response

to the more generous benefit schedule. In Table 3, we break the effect up into mechanical and behavioral

components. The former measures the additional payments that would result from a formulaic application

of the treatment benefit schedule to the control population. To compute these amounts, we simply infer each

control group member’s implied weekly earnings from their received weekly benefits and then apply the

treatment group’s benefit formula to the control group.34 The difference in total UI payments between the

simulated treatment group and the control group is our estimate of the mechanical effect. The difference

between the full treatment effect and the mechanical effect is the effect that can be attributed to a behavioral

response to the different benefit formula. Our estimates imply that by the fourth quarter, the mechanical

effect accounts for $28 of the total difference, while the remaining $39 is due to behavioral responses.35

    With the mechanical effect in hand, we are able to estimate the fiscal externality. We compute the

difference in UI payments net of taxes between the treatment and control groups, where tax receipts are

estimated by applying the average payroll tax rate schedule on earnings.36 By subtracting the mechanical

effect from this treatment effect, and then taking the ratio of this difference with the mechanical effect, we

obtain an estimate of the fiscal externality β + γ, which we report in column (5) of Table 3. The fiscal

externality over four quarters is $1.38 (standard error $0.45) per dollar of mechanical transfer, meaning

that for every dollar transferred inframarginally via a decrease in the earnings deduction rate ρ, there is an

additional cost of $1.38 to the government budget due to behavioral responses.

    To understand how much of the fiscal externality is driven by increased UI payments or reduced tax re-
  34 For those receiving the zero benefits, we apply the treatment group formula assuming that earnings exceed the break-even point

above which a claimant in the treatment group would no longer receive benefits. In effect, we impose that individuals who receive
zero benefits in the control group would continue to receive zero benefits in the treatment group. In principle though, earnings can
be above the control schedule’s break-even point but below the treatment schedule’s. An alternative approach to calculating the
mechanical effect is to use the reported earnings in the claimant data. In practice, there are some unexplained deviations between
the UI payments and that which would be predicted by the earnings reported on the weekly continuing claim form. Our approach
will be favorable if the payment data are considered to be measured with less error than the earnings variable in the claims data.
  35 As mentioned in Section 2.2, we can obtain an alternative estimate of the mechanical effect by simulating UI payments using

the treatment group, and averaging the two effects. In that case, we get a mechanical effect estimate of $35 (standard error 0.3) and
a behavioral effect of $32 (standard error 12.6). However, this mechanical effect is overstated because we do not observe the full
simulated payments under the control regime of treated units who exhaust UI. Therefore, the resulting fiscal externality estimate of
0.90 (standard error 0.36) should be viewed as a lower bound of the true fiscal externality.
  36 We use average UI payroll tax rates, which were 1.96 percent, 1.92 percent, and 1.88 percent for 1994, 1995, and 1996,

respectively. We conduct our welfare analysis from the perspective of the state considering only the fiscal impacts of each policy on
the UI benefits and taxes. If one takes a more expansive view of government (i.e. from the perspective of the federal government),
one could also consider the impact of the policy on federal income tax receipts, which would be larger. See Schmieder and von
Wachter (2016) and Lawson (2017) for more a more detailed discussion.


                                                                22
ceipts, we also estimate β and γ separately in Table 3. The component of the externality due to UI payments

β is computed by taking the ratio of the behavioral UI payment effect (column 3) to the mechanical effect

(column 2), while the component due to tax receipts is the ratio of the experimental impact on taxes (column

4) to the mechanical payment effect.37 The results suggest that the entire $1.38 of the fiscal externality over

four quarters is due to the behavioral impacts on UI payments. Alternatively, as shown in Appendix Table

A.1, when we use the “full tax wedge” tax rate (31.54 percent) of Schmieder and von Wachter (2016), we

obtain a γ of 65 cents and a larger fiscal externality estimate of $2.03 over four quarters.

    We also document the experimental impacts on various measures of labor supply directly. Indeed, one of

the motivating questions behind the Washington earnings deduction experiment was whether a lower implicit

tax rate in the benefit schedule will increase employment and earnings. The second set of rows in Table 2

reports the average effect of the experiment on earnings. Unlike with UI payments, we do not find any

statistically significant differences in earnings between the treatment and control group in any time frame.

Furthermore, the magnitudes that we can statistically rule out are small relative to the means. For example,

for Q1 to Q4, the 95 percent confidence interval is between $184 to $68 on a base of $13,388—or 1.4 percent

to 0.5 percent. Consistent with the null earnings effects, we find no statistically significant impacts of the

experiment on cumulative hours over any time frame and the range of the 95 percent confidence intervals are

small relative to the mean (third set of rows in Table 2). As seen in the fourth and fifth set of rows in Table 2,

we also detect no extensive margin effects: the proportion of non-zero earnings or hours in the treatment and

control groups are nearly identical in all time frames, with standard errors between 0.0010 and 0.0018 on

means ranging from 0.80 to 0.95. The intensive margin effects, shown in the sixth and seventh set of rows

in Table 2 in terms of log(earnings) and log(hours) mirror the results for levels. The treatment and control

means are identical to the second decimal place, with differences never greater than 0.004 and statistically

indistinguishable from zero.38 Overall, we consistently find no impact of the experiment on labor supply.

    To gain further insight on the drivers of the behavioral effect captured in β , we report in the last six

rows of Table 2 the experimental impacts on the frequency of claiming UI and the duration of the first UI
  37 The  standard errors account for the covariance between the estimators for the behavioral and mechanical effects via a stacked
regression, in which we estimate the two equations jointly and cluster the standard error by individual (similar stacked regressions
can be seen in more detail in Section 4.4.2. of Lee and Lemieux, 2010 and Section 5.3 of Pei, Pischke and Schwandt, forthcoming).
   38 By construction, the logarithm drops all observations with zero earnings or hours, so the treatment and control means are

conditioned on a potentially selected sample. However, as discussed in Lee (2009), if we assume that the treatment effect on sample
selection is characterized by a monotonicity condition, then given that we found no differences in the proportions of missing values
in the treatment and control populations, we can interpret the observed log-earnings and log-hours differences as reflecting causal
impacts of the treatment.



                                                                23
spell. From Q1 to Q4, the average number of weeks claimed is 13.23 in the control group and 13.76 weeks

(4 percent higher) in the treatment group. This statistically significant increase in claims can potentially be

explained by the length of the initial UI spell, defined as the number of weeks of UI payments with no more

than a three-week gap, which is 0.60 greater in the treatment group than in the control group. Since there

was no detectable effect of the experiment on earnings, this evidence suggests that an increased propensity

to claim is the driving force behind the behavioral response to the more generous benefit formula. While

we find that much of the fiscal externality is driven by claiming or take-up behavior, it is important to note

that, to the extent that the social planner values increased take-up (which may be indicative of individual

optimization frictions), a complete welfare analysis will need to account for the social value of this change

in behavior, along with measures of the social benefit of the transfer (i.e., α in equation (4)).

      Finally, we point out that while the earnings effects are statistically insignificant, they are roughly on par

(and opposite in sign) to the point estimates of the UI payment effects. An interesting question from a policy

perspective, which goes beyond the welfare framework described in Section 2, is whether the policy had an

impact on workers’ incomes, where income includes both earnings and UI payments. Adding up the effects

from the first two sets of rows in Table 2, we find that the the point estimate suggests a small positive impact

of about $9 on income over the four quarters. If we scale this number by treatment-control difference in UI

payments, $67, this implies that a one dollar increase in UI transferred increases the income of workers by

13 cents. A 95 percent confidence interval, however, suggests that income may be reduced by as much as

$1.71 and or increased as much as $1.98 for every dollar of UI transferred.39 We will return to this number

in the next section, when we estimate the same quantity for the weekly benefit level policy.


4.2     Estimates from the Regression Kink Design

This section reports the regression kink estimates of the fiscal externality associated with a marginal increase

in the weekly benefit level (wba). As with the analysis of the experiment, we need to estimate the impact

of wba on UI payments and tax receipts, but in this section, we will use the quasi-experimental variation in

benefits generated by the UI benefits cap. We first present graphical evidence of the design’s validity and

impacts on the behavioral and mechanical components of UI payments and earnings before proceeding to

our main estimates. After verifying the robustness of our estimates to various estimating specifications, we

turn to estimates of the fiscal externality parameters of interest.
  39 This   confidence interval accounts for the estimated impact on UI payments.


                                                                 24
    Figure 4 shows the RK first stage, plotting the weekly benefit amount wba against the normalized two

highest quarter earnings variable, i.e. the running variable X. Each solid circle represents the average of wba

(left y-axis) within a X-bin of width $400. The empirical relationship between X and wba tracks closely

the statutory benefit formula described in Section 3, in the range where X is above –$14,000. We do see

some modest departure from the benefit formula, which is common in RK analyses, most likely due to

measurement error in X as discussed in Appendix C.40 Therefore, we apply a fuzzy regression discontinuity

design as described in Card et al. (2015b).

    To confirm our understanding of the UI benefit formula, we also plot the maximum benefit payable mbp

(right y-axis) against X in Figure 4 separately for workers with R > 0.8 (hollow circles) and R 6 0.8 (hollow
                             Q3 +Q4
triangles), where R =        Q1 +Q2   and Qi is the earnings from the ith highest paid quarter in the base period. As

discussed in Section 3, the relation between X and mbp differs depending on whether the ratio R is above
                                                                                      mbp
or below 0.8. When R > 0.8, the rules imply a kink in mbp because                     wba ,   the maximum number of weeks

of UI at the full benefit amount, is exactly 30 throughout. When R 6 0.8, we would not expect a kink

in the relationship between mbp and X. We see both of these features in the empirical relationship when

viewing them separately for individuals who have an R above or below 0.8. In our main analysis, we pool

observations from both sub-groups to maximize statistical power. We note that any estimated kink from the

pooled sample will include the marginal effect of both the marginal effects of wba and mbp for those with

R > 0.8. That said, the estimates when only using 72 percent of the sample that has R 6 0.8 are similar.

    Following Card et al. (2015b), a valid regression kink design requires that, conditional on unobservables,

the density of X is continuously differentiable at the kink threshold. The first way to test this identifying

assumption is to examine the empirical density of X, to determine if there is evidence of “sorting” around

the threshold—this is the RKD analogue to the test of McCrary (2008). We plot the frequency distribution of

the running variable X in Figure 5. Finding a kink in the density at the threshold would indicate a rejection

of the identifying smooth density assumption at the individual level. The frequencies do not reveal any large

kinks in the histogram. It is also clear that the observations in the left tail of the X distribution causing the

most deviations in Figure 4 are relatively few in number. In subsequent graphical presentations, we will

restrict to the range of X ∈ [−14000, 14000].

    A second method of assessing the validity of the identifying smoothness assumptions is to examine

whether or not there are kinks in the relationship between the baseline characteristics and X. Column (5)
  40 The   recorded wba is within 1 dollar of the nominal wba using X for 93.8 percent of the sample.


                                                                 25
of Table 1 presents evidence showing that a global parametric regression does not reveal significant kinks

in those characteristics. In principle, one can perform an in-depth examination of those estimates and their

sensitivity to different functional forms and bandwidths, for each variable. As an alternative, we adopt

the approach taken in Card et al. (2015a) and Card et al. (2017) and examine a “covariate index” for each

outcome that we consider. The index is simply a linear combination of the baseline characteristics, where

the coefficients are those from a regression of the outcome on the covariates.41 This constructed index is

measured in the same units as the outcome variable, and so we can directly compare the covariate index to

the actual outcome of interest in our plots.

    We now present graphical evidence on the key outcomes in our analysis before turning to estimation and

inference. When indicated, we “de-trend” both the outcome and the covariate index from a linear regression

of the outcome (or covariate index) on the running variable X in order to facilitate the visual detection of

a kink in the relationship. We hypothesize that it can be difficult to recognize a kink when the slope of

the function is steep. Residualizing the outcome (and covariate index) from a linear prediction using X

effectively rotates the relationship around the threshold, which may improve the ability to see a feature such

as a kink near the threshold. Using this method, Figure 6 plots total UI payments against X in the four time

periods. Each dot represents an average payment amount within a bin that is $400 wide. In all four graphs,

there is a visible break in the slope of the relationship, with the magnitude of the kink growing as the time

frame expands, and as more benefits are received. By contrast, the comparable plots for the covariate index

are quite flat with respect to X.

    Figure 7 plots the empirical relation between X and the mechanical increase in UI payments from a

dollar increase in wba within the four time periods. The mechanical effect is the additional benefits that

claimants would receive if their weekly benefit amounts were $1 higher and if they did not change their UI

take-up or labor supply behavior. To compute this amount, we add a dollar to the benefits that claimants

receive each week that they claim, and then restrict their cumulative payments to be no more than their mbp,

accounting also for the fact that mbp increases by $30 for individuals with R > 0.8. The difference between

the simulated UI payments and the actual UI payments is the mechanical increase in UI payments from a

marginal increase in wba. For many claimants, this mechanical effect is equal to the number of weeks that

they claim UI benefits, because absent any behavioral response, a dollar increase in wba simply translates to
  41 Thecovariates are age, age-squared, sex, ethnicity, years of schooling, veteran status, job center location, occupation, industry,
self-employment, week in quarter of initial UI claim, and the earnings and hours in each quarter of the base year.



                                                                 26
an additional dollar per week claimed. However, since individuals cannot receive more benefits than their

mbp, some claimants’ mechanical effects are less than the number of weeks that they claim UI payments.

We do not de-trend the graphs in Figure 7 in order to show our estimate of the graphs’ intercepts, which is

the mechanical effect of a marginal increase in wba for individuals at the kink. Thus, for example, in the Q1

to Q4 period, the pure mechanical effect of a dollar increase in the wba is about 11.

    Figure 8 displays the relationship between cumulative earnings and X for each follow-up period. In this

case, there are no visible kinks in either the actual outcome or the covariate index for this outcome, although

for the Q1 to Q4 period, the variability in the binned averages could potentially be masking kinks in either

direction. The covariate index appears to have much less variability and does not appear to show any kinks

in the relationship with X. Based on the visual evidence for earnings, unlike the previous figures, we might

expect to see statistically insignificant effects of wba on earnings.

    To estimate the magnitudes of these kinks, we follow the approach in Card et al. (2015b) and estimate the

fuzzy RKD estimand by taking the ratio of estimated kinks in the outcome and observed wba with respect

to X, where each kink is estimated by a local polynomial estimator of the change in the derivative at X = 0.

Numerically, this is equivalent to restricting the data within a bandwidth of the threshold, and regressing the

outcome on wba, instrumenting with A · X, using as controls polynomial terms X k and A · X k (excluding the

linear A · X term) for k up to order p, where A = 1 [X ≥ 0] indicates that a worker has base period earnings

above the threshold.

    Two tuning parameters are required for RK estimation: the bandwidth h and polynomial order p. For

h, we use the mean squared error (MSE) optimal bandwidth from the rdrobust Stata package by Calonico

et al., 2017 (henceforth CCT bandwidth).42 For polynomial order p, we choose the order from the set

{1, 2, 3} that delivers the lowest estimated MSE as per Pei et al. (2018) by using the accompanying rdmse

Stata package. We also present evidence that the RK estimates of our key outcomes are generally robust

with respect to these tuning parameters.

    Table 4 presents the fuzzy RK estimation results for the same outcomes as in Table 2. The first two

columns report the tuning parameters used in estimation: column (1) reports the polynomial order p that
   42 When using the default CCT bandwidth, which includes a regularization term, we find that our estimates in many cases suffer

from low precision. This is the case, for example, with the estimate of cumulative UI payments from Q1 to Q4, despite the
visually striking and institutionally grounded kink in the lower right panel of Figure 6. Therefore, our results reflect estimates
without the regularization term. Consistent with the findings in Card et al. (2017), the regularization term, while asymptotically
negligible, greatly impacts the computed value of the RK optimal bandwidth. Following Card et al. (2015b), we use the fuzzy CCT
bandwidth without regularization as our specification to estimate the various RK effects, but explore the sensitivity of our estimates
to bandwidth choices in Figures 9, 10, A.3, and A.4.


                                                                 27
minimizes estimated MSE, and column (2) the CCT bandwidth h for the selected p. A quadratic or linear

specification is chosen for the vast majority of outcomes, though in a handful of cases, a cubic polynomial

is estimated. In terms of our main outcomes, the effects on UI payments are estimated with a linear specifi-

cation, while the effects on earnings are generally estimated with a quadratic specification. In general, the

optimal bandwidth for linear specifications (ranging from 1,453 to 7,817) is smaller than that for higher or-

der polynomials (ranging from 2,991 to 12,208 for quadratic). As reported in column (3), the corresponding

effective sample size, i.e., the number of observations within bandwidth h, ranges from 20,164 to 127,864

for local linear and from 41,164 to 225,983 for local quadratic.

    The first stage estimates in column (4) confirm the formulaic relationship graphically presented in Figure

4 between the treatment variable wba and the running variable X. In rows where the level of wba is the

treatment variable — every row except for the last row, for which log(wba) is the treatment variable —

the first stage estimate almost always falls between –0.019 and –0.020 (recall that –0.02 is the exact slope

change implied by the formula).43 The first stage is also precisely estimated, and the associated F-statistic

is above 1,000 for every outcome.

    We present the fuzzy RK estimate in column (5). In all rows but the last, the estimate represents the

average marginal change in the outcome in response to a one dollar increase in the wba, and in the last row,

we report the elasticity of initial claim duration with respect to wba in order to connect our estimate to the

UI literature. Looking down the first four rows, we see that a dollar increase in wba is estimated to increase

total UI payments by 4.7 dollars in Q1 and 15.9 dollars in Q1–Q4. These cumulative UI payment estimates

are statistically significant and encompass both the mechanical effect and the behavioral response. The next

four rows report the fuzzy RK estimates for cumulative earnings within the four time periods. The effects are

statistically insignificant except for that of Q1, and a closer inspection, which we describe below, indicates

that the Q1 estimate is likely an outlier. Consistent with the insignificant cumulative earnings result, the

RK estimates for the next sets of outcomes—cumulative hours, whether a worker has positive cumulative

earnings/hours, and log(cumulative earnings/hours)—are generally statistically insignificant as well.

    In the final rows of Table 4, we present our estimates of wba on the initial benefit duration, defined as the

number of consecutive weeks of UI payments with a gap of no longer than three weeks. To compare with

the literature, we redefine the treatment variable (in the last row) to log(wba) so that the estimate is close to a
   43 The only exception is log(cumulative hours), for which a cubic polynomial with bandwidth 14,647 is selected with a resulting

first stage estimate of –0.014. This is one of the few cases where the bandwidth seems too large, resulting from the lack of
regularization.


                                                               28
duration elasticity.44 We find an estimate of 1.06, implying an elasticity of 1.15, with a 95 percent confidence

interval that allows us to rule out elasticities below 0.28. This point estimate is larger than the elasticity of

0.88 recently found in Card et al. (2015a), which uses the same methodology and similar administrative

data from Missouri. As a visual aid for comparison, we plot in Figure 11 the empirical relation between the

logarithm of the initial UI spell duration and base earnings, using the same running variable scale and range

as Card et al. (2015a).45 While the figure does show a visible break at the discontinuity threshold, variability

in the binned averages appears to be larger in Washington compared to Missouri.46

    Figures 9 and 10 show graphically the sensitivity of our estimates to alternative regression specifications

for our two main sets of outcomes. Figure 9 plots the estimated RK effects of wba on total UI payments

Q1–Q4 (row 4 of Table 4) using different bandwidths and a different polynomial order. The solid black

curve plots quadratic estimates for bandwidths ranging from 2,000 to 14,000 in 500 increments, and the

short dashed black lines plot the upper and lower end of the pointwise 95 percent confidence intervals.

In gray, we generate the analogous series of estimates using a linear specification. Our point estimate of

about $16 for total UI payments over four quarters is consistent with those estimated using a number of

alternative bandwidths in the stable range for both linear and quadratic specifications, though the standard

errors are smaller for the linear estimates. Figure 10 shows that the negligible effect for earnings are robust

to both specifications and for a wide range of bandwidth choices. Appendix Figures A.3 and A.4 show the

analogous graphs for UI payments and earnings in all quarters (the lower right corners of the two figures

replicate Figures 9 and 10, respectively). Although we find statistically significant and positive quadratic

RK estimate for earnings effects in Q1 in Table 4, it is only attained for a set of very large bandwidths, and

the unregularized CCT bandwidth happens to fall into this range. Therefore, while we report the positive

effect using the unregularized quadratic CCT bandwidth in Table 4, we will focus on the more robust Q1–Q4

estimate on cumulative earnings in our discussion.

    Table 5 shows our estimates of the fiscal externality β + γ. We first reproduce the estimates on UI

payments from Table 4 in the first column. The mechanical effects (column 2) are the estimated intercepts in
  44 Since                                                                                      1+claim duration
             the numerator is one plus the claim duration, the estimate needs to be scaled by    claim duration to
                                                                                                               be interpreted as an
elasticity.
   45 We adjust for inflation and the fact that the running variable in Card et al. (2015a) was measured in terms of one quarter of

earnings.
   46 A key difference between the two contexts is that the threshold in Washington State is much higher than in Missouri in an

absolute (inflation-adjusted) and relative (position in the base earnings distribution) sense. When we look at approximately the
same range around the threshold, we have much fewer observations in our analysis compared to the pre-recession Missouri sample
in Card et al. (2015a).



                                                                29
Figure 7, which we obtain from a regression of the simulated mechanical increase in UI payments on quintic

polynomials in X and A · X, and the behavioral effects on UI payments are the differences between total and

mechanical effects. Column (4) shows the fuzzy RKD estimates of the increase in wba on tax receipts,

which are calculated by applying the average payroll tax schedule on earnings. We find economically small

estimates of wba on tax receipts, which is consistent with the negligible estimates earnings effects of Table 4.

The Q1–Q4 estimate of the fiscal externality suggests that to transfer one mechanical dollar via an increase

in the weekly benefit amount, it costs an extra 53 cents (with a confidence interval of 27 cents to 78 cents)

to pay for the behavioral claiming response and the lost UI tax revenue due to changes in labor earnings. In

comparison, recall that the fiscal externality of decreasing the implicit tax rate that we estimated earlier is

in the range of 49 cents to $2.26 with a point estimate of $1.38. Unsurprisingly, due to the low tax rates,

we find that the fiscal externality is driven mostly by the increased benefit payments when we break the

estimates down into components due to UI payments and tax receipts (columns 6 and 7).47,48

    While the fiscal externality estimates are useful for quantifying the behavioral impacts of a policy, one

may also look beyond the standard welfare framework to another economically meaningful metric of how

the policy affects overall income of its intended recipients. As before, we estimate the dollar increase in

total income, where total income includes UI payments and wages, associated with a dollar transferred to

recipients in the form of UI payments. To compute this, we estimate a fuzzy RK specification using income

as the outcome and UI payments (instead of wba) as a first stage.49 The resulting estimate suggests that a one

dollar transfer of UI payments increases income by 96 cents, with a 95 percent confidence interval suggesting

an income increase by at least 66 cents. In contrast with the implicit tax rate policy, which increases total

incomes by (a statistically insignificant) 13 cents per dollar transferred, an increase in the weekly benefit

level is therefore more effective at increasing recipient income. We note again, however, that the fiscal

externality and associated concepts do not capture potential benefits such as consumption smoothing. A

complete welfare analysis requires measurement of these benefits along with the cost measures presented in

this study.
  47 Due  to the small earnings effects, when we use the “full tax wedge” tax rate of 31.54 percent (Schmieder and von Wachter
2016), we obtain a similar estimated γ of –0.02 and a total fiscal externality of 0.53 over four quarters. See Appendix Table A.2 for
details.
  48 We use the same bandwidths and specifications, which minimize estimated MSE when UI payments are the outcomes, to

estimate the different components of the fiscal externality.
  49 Bandwidth and polynomial orders are chosen to minimize estimated MSE when the outcome is total income.




                                                                30
4.3     Fiscal Externality Measures: Decomposition versus Sufficient Statistics Estimates

In this section, we directly compare our decomposition estimate (0.53) of the fiscal externality for an increase

in the weekly benefit level to the estimate that one would obtain from employing a standard sufficient

statistics approach. Specifically, we directly use the sufficient statistics formula of Schmieder and von

Wachter (2016) which relates the fiscal externality to behavioral elasticities and other program parameters

and quantities. The bottom row of Table 6 shows the formula they use: the fiscal externality is proportional

to ε, the elasticity of UI claim duration with respect to the benefit amount, where the factor of proportionality

is dependent on the tax rate and the UI replacement rate. We estimate the elasticity ε using the fuzzy RKD

estimate of 1.15 referred to in the previous section.50 The resulting fiscal externality estimate of 1.21 is

reported in the last row of 6.51

      What explains the difference in the magnitudes from these two different approaches applied to the same

data, and essentially the same research design for estimating behavioral responses? We identify the source

of these differences in Table 6. Starting with the first row of the table, which reproduces our decomposition

estimate from Table 5, in each subsequent row, we consider the magnitude that would be obtained by adopt-

ing more of the modeling assumptions implicit in a simple implementation of Schmieder and von Wachter

(2016)’s formula, until we employ all of the modeling assumptions assumptions in the final row.

      The second row of Table 6 adopts the simplification that total benefits paid out is equal to the number

of weeks claimed times the weekly benefit amount. This simplification allows one to use weeks claimed as

a dependent variable rather than benefits paid, and it leads to a different measure of the mechanical effect:

an estimate of E [weeks claimed] at the threshold. Note, however, that this is a simplification of actual

benefits because it does not account for the possibility of partial benefits (i.e., the actual weekly benefit may

be lower than the assigned weekly benefit amount), and more subtly, that the total UI benefits available

over the benefit year is capped.52 The latter simplification is consequential for calculating the mechanical

impact of increasing the weekly benefit amount because some workers already claim at or close to their

maximum entitlement and an increase in the weekly benefit amount (with no corresponding change to the

formula for the maximum total UI benefits over the benefit year) will have a smaller actual mechanical

impact than under the simplified formula. Indeed, under this simplified benefits assumption, the resulting
  50 This estimate is constructed in the same way as Card et al. (2015a)’s 0.78 elasticity estimate that was used in Schmieder and

von Wachter (2016)’s Table 2.
  51 We thank Johannes Schmieder for providing the code for the Schmieder and von Wachter (2016) calculations for this exercise.
  52 The maximum benefit entitlement is equal to the minimum of 30 times the weekly benefit and a third of the base period wages.




                                                               31
fiscal externality shrinks to 0.31, much of it due to a larger estimated mechanical effect.

    The third row of Table 6 makes the additional set of assumptions from Schmieder and von Wachter

(2016) that allow the researcher to obtain an estimate of the lost tax revenues from the estimated impact

on weeks of UI claimed. These assumptions are: 1) a constant weekly hazard from unemployment, 2) the

pre-layoff and post-reemployment wages are equal, and 3) a linear tax schedule. Under these assumptions,

the fiscal externality can be expressed as being proportional to the RKD estimate of the average marginal

effect of θ weeks claimed. This additional set of simplifications result in a slight increase (to 0.34) in the

fiscal externality estimate relative to the second row.53

    The fourth row employs the simplification of focusing on the initial (and only) spell of unemployment.

With this simplification “weeks claimed” in the formula is replaced with “(initial) claim duration”.54 In our

data, the RKD estimate of the impact of θ on initial claim duration (from Table 4) is small enough to drive

down the fiscal externality estimate to 0.08.

    The last assumption, which fully reconciles the differences between the first and last row, is the most

consequential. The Schmieder and von Wachter (2016) formula, which is derived using a representative

agent model, simply requires an estimate of the elasticity of UI duration with respect to θ . Following their

calculation of the fiscal externality for Card et al. (2015a), we plug in our estimated average elasticity of
                                                                                           h                           i

in responses across individuals, the use of average elasticity ε requires the assumption that individual claim

duration elasticities are (mean) independent of initial claim durations, which implies

                                                = ε · E [claim duration]


Put another way, this assumes that the elasticity of the average duration with respect to the weekly benefit is

equal to the average elasticity across individuals. Of course, in the absence of heterogeneity in elasticities,

this assumption is trivially satisfied. A homogeneity assumption in this context turns out to be the most

                                                                                   claim duration , where “claim duration” is the average
initial duration at the threshold.
   54 As in common empirical practice, we define the initial benefit duration as the observed number of consecutive weeks of benefit

receipts before a three-week period of non-payment. This definition implicitly assumes that claimants have full take-up for every
week of their unemployment spell, even when the data shows a lapse of one or two weeks in claims.



                                                                  32
consequential assumption in Table 6, increasing the fiscal externality from 0.08 to 1.21.55

    In summary, the decomposition approach invokes a strict subset of the assumptions that would be needed

for the sufficient statistics calculation using the formula in Schmieder and von Wachter (2016), which adopts

the necessary modeling assumptions that are similar to the kinds of simplifications used in the UI literature to

infer fiscal externalities from elasticity estimates. Therefore, by computing the fiscal externality both ways,

one can conclude that substantial differences in the magnitudes must be due to the assumptions made by the

latter approach that are not needed for the former approach. In our particular application, the assumption that

appears to be most inconsistent with the data is that of the assumption of homogeneity. More broadly, this

exercise illustrates how the decomposition approach we have discussed can help critically evaluate modeling

assumptions when conducting welfare analyses, whether one uses a “sufficient statistics” or fully structural

approach.



5     Implications and Conclusions

This paper proposes a “decomposition” method of estimating fiscal externalities associated with government

income transfer policies as a complement to the prevailing sufficient statistics approach. By employing a

simple accounting identity, the behavioral component of the effect of a policy on the government budget

can be estimated from the microdata as the difference between the estimated total effect and the mechanical

effect that can be calculated using knowledge of the income transfer formula. This allows one to compute

a fiscal externality quantity that is consistent with a very large class of behavioral models, and therefore

can serve as a complementary benchmark to approaches that require more modeling assumptions. While it

follows quite naturally from well-known public economics principles, this method of estimation does not

appear to have been employed in the empirical analysis of UI or other income transfer programs.

    We use this decomposition framework to evaluate the efficiency of two policy experiments in the Wash-

ington State UI system. First, we examine a large randomized experiment that reduced the implicit tax rate

on the earnings of UI claimants. While the hope was that the enhanced work incentive could have generated

a positive labor supply response and hence reduced the cost to the government, instead we find that for each

dollar of inframarginal transfer, the government must pay at least an extra 49 cents to cover the increased

benefit expenditure, with a point estimate of $1.38.
  55 This suggests that initial claim duration is negatively correlated with responsiveness (elasticity) of durations with respect to the

benefit level, which is likely if benefit durations are capped as in our setting.


                                                                  33
    By contrast, our confidence interval for the fiscal externality from increasing the maximum weekly

benefit amount ranges from $0.27 to $0.79 with a point estimate of $0.53 for each dollar of mechanical

transfer. As a point of comparison, Schmieder and von Wachter (2016) survey the US literature, using

elasticities (typically the UI spell duration with respect to the benefit level) estimated in the literature to

compute the fiscal externality, and find a range of $0.08 to $0.95, with a median of $0.26, per dollar of

mechanical transfer. Our estimate is thus on the high side of this range.

    Comparing the fiscal externality quantities for the above two policies suggests that, despite the intent

of increasing work incentives through a lower implicit tax rate, increasing the weekly benefit is a relatively

more efficient way of transferring income to UI recipients. The fiscal externality of a lower implicit tax rate

in UI has a point estimate of $1.38, which is more than double the corresponding measure of increasing the

weekly benefit amount of $0.53. The two fiscal externalities are statistically significantly different at the

10 percent level.56 Therefore, in a standard welfare analytic framework, the social benefits of lowering the

implicit tax rate must exceed those of increasing the weekly benefit level in order for the former to be more

welfare-enhancing.

    We believe that there are a number of avenues of research that may be promising, based on the decompo-

sition approach that we employ. First, our analysis focuses on the margins of increasing the weekly benefit

and reducing the implicit tax rate on earnings. But there is little reason why the same approach for estimat-

ing the fiscal externality could not be similarly employed to estimate the impact of a policy that lengthened

the maximum duration of UI benefits. As suggested by Schmieder and von Wachter (2016), the side-by-side

comparison between the fiscal externalities associated with the benefit margin and the maximum duration

margin can suggest the margin along which UI transfers can be made with minimal distortionary burden.

    Second, although we find that our direct estimate of the fiscal externality of an increase in the benefit

amount is somewhat smaller than that computed using the modeling framework and formula of Schmieder
  56 Another way to compare the two fiscal externalities while accounting for the sampling errors in both estimates is to consider
the following thought experiment. Suppose a policymaker intends to transfer a portion ξ of benefits by increasing wba and the
remainder 1 − ξ by decreasing ρ. With our estimates of the fiscal externality of increasing wba and decreasing ρ in hand —
denoted by (β̂ + γ̂)wba and (β̂ + γ̂)ρ , respectively — the policy maker can forecast the fiscal externality by using the estimates from
this paper:
                                               (β̂ + γ̂)ξ = ξ (β̂ + γ̂)wba + (1 − ξ )(β̂ + γ̂)ρ .
She knows that she should set ξ = 1 to minimize (β̂ + γ̂)ξ . But given the uncertainty of the estimates, she also wants to minimize
the “5 percent worst case” level of fiscal externality. That is, she would like to choose ξ to minimize the upper bound of the
one-sided 95 percent confidence interval:
                                                 (β̂ + γ̂)ξ + 1.64 ∗ SE[(β̂ + γ̂)ξ ].
Because SE[(β̂ + γ̂)wba ] = $0.13 is also substantially smaller than SE[(β̂ + γ̂)ρ ] = $0.45 and that the estimated correlation between
the two fiscal externalities is very close to zero, the policy maker’s choice is again ξ = 1.


                                                                  34
and von Wachter (2016), it is still an open question whether the size of this discrepancy is an outlier or a

magnitude that could be expected. In principle, our proposed decomposition approach can also be used to

calculate the fiscal externality of other UI policies which have been studied in previous empirical studies of

UI (e.g., of extending the potential benefit duration). The systematic comparison between the nonparametric

decomposition-based benchmark and estimates using parametric formulae can be informative in assessing

the ability of parametric modeling approaches, including “sufficient statistic” approaches, to accurately

forecast the fiscal externalities of new policies.

    Finally, as is evident from the framework in Section 2, there is virtually nothing in the empirical strategy

that is specific or unique to UI. In principle, it is also possible to compute the fiscal externality parameter for

other income transfer programs, as long as one has relatively complete microdata on benefits and taxes and

the inputs needed to simulate a mechanical effect. It would be useful to compare the relative efficiency of

transfers across different programs as in Hendren (2016) and Hendren and Sprung-Keyser (2019), but using

a similar decomposition strategy as proposed in this paper.

of the two lowest earning quarters in the base year to the two highest earnings quarters in the base year. The
slope of weekly benefit amount (wba) with respect to X̃ changes sharply at X̃ = $17, 500 (boundaries I and
II). If R > 0.8, then the slope of maximum benefits payable (mbp) also changes at X̃ = $17, 500 (I). The
slope of mbp with respect to R changes at R = 0.8 (III). The slope of mbp with respect to X̃(1 + R) changes
at X̃(1 + R) = $31, 500 (IV).

the Unemployment Insurance Earnings Deduction Experiment




Note: This graph shows the weekly UI benefits and income for a worker with a weekly benefit amount of
$300, under control and treatment regimes. The example marked on the graph shows that if a worker has
$150 in earnings, she would receive $191.25 of UI if she were assigned to the control group and $210 if
assigned to the treatment group. Adapted from O’Leary (1997).

Note: Each graph shows the averages, within bins of highest two quarter earnings, of the expected total
administrative earnings accumulated since the quarter in which the first UI claim was filed. Covariate index
is a linear combination of baseline characteristics (details in text). Both dependent variables are deviated
from a linear regression fit of the running variable. Only data within $14,000 of the threshold are shown.
There are 70 bins, each $400 wide.

Note: The scale has been adjusted to be comparable to Card et al. (2015a). Paid duration is defined as one
plus the number of weeks for which a claimant receives a UI payment before a gap of three or more weeks
with no payments. Covariate index is a linear combination of baseline characteristics (details in text). There
are 44 bins, each $400 wide.

     Note: Robust standard errors in parentheses. Columns (1)–(3) compare the mean values between the treatment and control group of the experiment. Columns (4)–(6) are estimates
     from regressing the outcome variable on an indicator for the treatment group, a polynomial of order 6 in the running variable X, and the variable A · X where A = 1[X > 0]. Individuals
     in the bottom and top 3 percent of the running variable are dropped for this regression. Column (4) is the estimated intercept. The coefficient on A · X is scaled by 1500. Actual age
     only has 272,247 observations because some claimants were missing their birth date. We impute the 14 missing values with the mean age.

the first 3 weeks of no payments. Claim duration (elasticity) is a fuzzy RK estimate with log(wba) as the regressor and log(1+claim
duration) as the outcome. All remaining variables are averaged over cumulative calendar quarters, where Q1 refers to the quarter of
the initial UI claim. Columns (1) and (2) show the polynomial order (chosen between 1 and 3) and CCT bandwidth that minimize
estimated MSE. Column (3) reports the effective number of observations within the CCT bandwidth that is computed without
regularization. Column (4) reports the first stage estimates and Column (5) the fuzzy RK estimates. Unless stated in brackets next
to the quarters of accumulation, the total number of observations in the analysis sample is 272,261.

Note: Robust standard errors in parentheses. Column (1) shows the estimates from the first four rows of Table 4. Column (2) is the
estimated mean mechanical transfer at the threshold from increasing wba. It is the intercept from a regression of the mechanical
effect on a quintic polynomial in X and A · X, where A = 1[X > 0]. Column (3) is (1) minus (2). Column (4) is the fuzzy RKD
estimate of wba on tax receipts, calculated as in Column (1). Column (5) is the fuzzy RKD estimate of the effect of wba on UI
payments net of tax receipts, divided by column (2), and minus 1. Column (6) is (3) divided by (2). Column (7) is (5) minus (6). The
bandwidths and orders of the RKDs for all columns except (4) are chosen to minimize MSE (polynomial order is selected between
1 and 3) where the outcome is UI payments. For column (4), the bandwidth and polynomial order are chosen using tax receipts
as the outcome. Standard errors for Columns (5) to (7) are computed by jointly estimating their numerator and denominator, and
allowing unrestricted covariances across equations, and then using the delta method.

     Notes: Each row shows the estimated fiscal externality calculated under an additional set of assumptions. The weekly benefit amount is denoted by
     θ . “Weeks claimed” is the average number of weeks of positive UI payments over the four quarters post-claim for workers at the kink threshold.
     “Tax rate” and “replacement rate” are the payroll tax rate and UI replacement rate, respectively. As in Schmieder and von Wachter (2016), under the
                                          unemp
     constant hazard assumption, ∂ weeks∂θ      = ξ ∂ weeks∂ θclaimed , where ξ = 1 − (1 + Pγ) exp(−Pγ), P is the potential duration of UI benefits, and γ is the
     estimated weekly hazard. “(Initial) Claim duration” is the average number of weeks of benefit payments before a three-week gap in payments for
     workers at the kink threshold. ε is the average elasticity of initial duration with respect to the weekly benefit.

A    Decomposition of a Large Reform

In this section, we discuss the implementation of the decomposition approach when evaluating a non-

marginal reform. Consider government expenditures for a single individual, where we drop the i subscript:


                                            B(Y(θ , τ), θ ) − T (Y(θ , τ), τ)


The impact of a marginal change in θ on the government expenditures is

                                                             
                                                 ∂B     ∂B ∂T     ∂Y

where the first term is the mechanical effect and the second term is the behavioral effect.

    When we consider a non-marginal change in θ , say from θ0 to θ1 , the total impact on the government

expenditures is

where, again, the first term is the mechanical effect. Focusing only on the mechanical effect, note that it can

be approximated using the trapezoid rule:
                                                                                            !

                                            dθ       ≈                        +

Now consider the objects in parentheses. By a first order approximation,

                                           ∂B              ∂ B(Y1 , θ )

                                                               57
and

                                          ∂B             ∂ B(Y0 , θ )

where Y1 = Y(θ1 , τ) and Y0 = Y(θ0 , τ). Therefore the mechanical effect of a non-marginal reform can be

approximated by averaging two quantities:

                             ∂B           [B(Y1 , θ1 ) − B(Y1 , θ0 )] + [B(Y0 , θ1 ) − B(Y0 , θ0 )]
                        Z θ1
                                   dθ ≈
                         θ0   ∂θ                                      2

      These terms represent alternative decompositions of the mechanical effect. When we apply the treatment

group formula to the control group’s earnings, we get the following decomposition


                    B(Y1 , θ1 ) − B(Y0 , θ0 ) = B(Y0 , θ1 ) − B(Y0 , θ0 ) + B(Y1 , θ1 ) − B(Y0 , θ1 )
                                                |           {z         } |              {z         }
                                                         Mechanical1                 Behavioral 1


while applying the control group formula to the treatment group’s earnings will yield the alternative decom-

position

                    B(Y1 , θ1 ) − B(Y0 , θ0 ) = B(Y1 , θ1 ) − B(Y1 , θ0 ) + B(Y1 , θ0 ) − B(Y0 , θ0 )
                                                |           {z         } |              {z         }

Therefore, to get closer to the true mechanical effect (which is still approximate) for a large reform, we can

average the two mechanical effect calculations.



B      Extrapolating Fiscal Externality Parameters Identified in an RKD

In this section, we consider in greater detail a set of sufficient conditions under which the fiscal externality

from an increase in the full weekly benefit amount can be inferred from the estimates obtained from the

regression kink design. In the presence of unobserved heterogeneity, the RKD produces estimates that are

“local” in nature. It is thus constructive to establish what restrictions on heterogeneity would permit one to

interpret the RKD estimates as the fiscal externality for the policy change more generally.

      Recall that if the outcome variable of interest is a smooth function f (B, X,U) of the continuous treatment




                                                            58
variable B, running variable X, and type variable U, the sharp RK estimand identifies the treatment effect


                                                    E[ f1 (b0 , 0,U)|X = 0]                                                 (A1)


where f1 denotes the partial derivative of the causal response function f with respect to its first argument,

and b0 is the value of the treatment when X = 0 (Card et al., 2015b).57

    As in Card et al. (2015b), we allow unrestricted heterogeneity to be represented by the variable U, and

write the key components of UI benefit expenditures as functions of U and the running variable X:


                  Statutory UI amount for fully unemployed: W BAt = wbat (X, θ , λ ) = θ + min [λ X, 0]

                                                               Earnings: Yt = yt (W BAt , X,U, θ , λ , ρ)

UI benefit accounting for disregarding a fraction of earnings: Bt = bt (W BAt ,Yt , ρ) = max [W BAt − ρYt , 0]

                                               Probability of take-up: Pt = pt (W BAt , X,U, θ , λ , ρ) .


For concreteness, t is the week indicator, so the total UI benefit received, for example, is ∑t Bt · Pt . The

parameter θ is the maximum weekly benefit amount, λ the scaled UI replacement rate, and ρ the implicit

tax rate in partial UI.58 For concreteness, we specify that behavioral responses are captured by earnings Yt

and take-up probability Pt , which the individual jointly chooses, conditional on the parameters and other pre-

determined factors U, X. Note that we omit the tax component of the fiscal externality from this discussion.

We focus solely on the benefits component of the fiscal externality to illustrate the types of behavioral

assumptions that would be sufficient to extrapolate from the RKD estimates to the full population.

    With this notation, we now derive the fiscal externality of marginally changing the UI benefit level for

the fully unemployed for all UI claimants, which amounts to a small change in the parameter θ . We will

impose two exclusion restrictions regarding how Yt and Pt respond to a change in θ (recall that θ is the

fourth argument in both functions yt and pt ):


                                                         yt4 = pt4 = 0.                                                     (A2)
  57 Inthis section, we use gk to denote the partial derivative of a given function g with respect to its k-th argument.
  58 For simplicity, we abstract away from the partial UI earnings disregard since it was very low ($5) in Washington state during
the sample period as mentioned in Section 3.




                                                               59
The first restriction on Yt means that θ can only impact earnings through its impact on benefit levels, while

the second restriction on Pt similarly requires that θ can only impact take-up decisions through its impact

on benefit levels and earnings.

    Since the fiscal externality is the ratio of the behavioral and mechanical increase in total UI benefit ex-

penditures, let us first consider the effect of changing θ on the total expected benefit payment in a particular

week t — we will drop the t subscript for ease of exposition:

                                                                       dy
                                      = E 1 [B > 0] · p1 B + P b1 + b2
                                                                       dθ

where we have employed p4 = 0 from assumption (A2), and have included the indicator function 1 [B > 0]

to account for the fact that the partial derivative of b with respect to its arguments will be zero when B ≤ 0.

    Using the other restriction y4 = 0, we have that when B > 0

                                              dy
                                                 = wba2 y1 + y4
                                              dθ
                                                   = y1


and with the assumptions stated in equation (A2), the above expression reduces to


                                      E [1 [B > 0] · (p1 B + P (b1 + b2 y1 ))]

                                    =E [1 [B > 0] · (p1 B + P (1 + b2 y1 ))]
                                                                      
                                                          B
                                    =E 1 [B > 0] · p1 − ρy1 + 1 P
                                                          P

Meanwhile, the mechanical effect is


                                          E[P · b1 ] = E [1 [B > 0] · P]


If we assume homogeneity across individuals in the behavioral component p1 PB − ρy1 = κ (across individ-

uals U, X and benefit levels B and probabilities P) then the fiscal externality reduces to


                                                       60
                                       E 1 [B > 0] · p1 BP − ρy1 P
                                                                
                                                                    =κ
                                             E [1 [B > 0] · P]

Furthermore, if the homogeneity in this behavioral component extends across all t, then it can be shown that

the fiscal externality for the accumulated benefit payment up to time T is also κ.

    A similar expression for the RKD fiscal externality estimand can be shown to be, for each week:

                                    E 1 [B > 0] · p1 BP − ρy1 P|X = 0
                                                                    
                                                                        =κ
                                          E [1 [B > 0] · P|X = 0]

In summary, although we may allow for various forms of heterogeneity (note that the p and y functions

contain U as an argument), we must restrict the behavioral responses in some way to extrapolate from the

RKD estimand to the fiscal externality quantity for the full population. We have shown that the constancy

of p1 BP − ρy1 , along with the exclusion restrictions (A2), is sufficient for this extrapolation.



C     Weights on Mechanical Effects in a Fuzzy Regression Kink Design

As described in Section 2.2, the RK estimand and our mechanical effect estimand identify a weighted

average of the total and mechanical effects, respectively, of raising the weekly benefit amount. Following

the arguments in Lee (2008) and Card et al. (2015b), it is straightforward to show that the weights on the

total and mechanical effects are the same in a sharp RKD. However, this is not generally true in a fuzzy

RKD. In this section, we propose a testable condition tailored to our empirical context, under which the

weights remain the same.

    Card et al. (2015b) establish a general fuzzy RKD framework which allows for noncompliance with

the benefit formula and measurement error in both the running variable X and the weekly benefit amount

wba. The generality of the framework partly stems from the complexity of the Austrian UI system, which

Card et al. (2015b) study. For example, there are multiple UI benefit schedules depending on the num-

ber of dependents, which is unobserved in the data, and noncompliance is motivated by the fact that the

econometrician does not know how to assign a particular worker to a given schedule.

    In Washington state, there was only one UI schedule, and the deviation from the formula in our data was

most likely due to measurement error in the running variable X. If base period wages were missing or were

discovered to contain errors (e.g., entry errors that result in outliers), employers were contacted directly and


                                                        61
would report the correct base period wages. The weekly benefit amount was then recalculated based on the

correction, but the original wage records, which we use, were not updated. Armed with this institutional

knowledge, we focus on the impact of the measurement error in X on the mechanical effect weights while

abstracting away from noncompliance and treating the weekly benefit amount as measured without error.

    With these simplifications, Proposition 2 of Card et al. (2015b) implies that the RK estimand for the

total effects on benefit payout identifies

                                                                    

Appendix B, and fX|U=u and fX denote the conditional and unconditional densities of the running variable

X respectively.

are equal because a worker with X ∗ = 0 and no measurement error has X = 0 and receives the maximum

UI weekly benefit amount (wba = θ ); we express the term (b) as the sum of (d) and (e) by conditioning on

whether or not a worker is assigned the maximum wba.
                           h            i
   In order to identify E ∂∂ θB |X ∗ = 0 , it is reasonable to assume that the conditional expectation function
 h               i
E ∂∂ θB |X ∗ = x∗ is continuous, which is empirically supported by Figure 7. To a first order, the mechanical
         ∂B
effect   ∂θ   is simply the insured unemployment duration of the worker, which is often the outcome of interest

in a standard regression kink design application. The identification assumptions in Card et al. (2015b) imply

that for each unemployed worker the insured unemployment duration is a smooth function of X ∗ . Because

of this continuity, we can identify the mechanical effect by extrapolating from the right of the threshold:

limx∗ →0+ E[ ∂∂ θB |X ∗ = x∗ ].
                                                                           h                 i

    We now argue that we can approximate the mechanical effect E               ∂ θ |X     = 0 with the sum of the terms

(c) and (d) from equation (A4), which will help to pin down a testable condition that implies the same

weighting scheme between the total and mechanical effects identified in our RKD. First note that workers

with X ∗ ≥ 0, UX 6= 0, and wba 6= θ , the subpopulation underlying term (e) in equation (A4), are just workers

with X ∗ ≥ 0 and wba 6= θ . Since these workers are directly observed and because of the continuity of              ∂B
                                                                                                                    ∂θ

as a function of X ∗ , we can extrapolate their mechanical effects to the threshold. Using a global quintic, we

obtain an estimate of 5.69, which is statistically and economically significantly different from the mechanical

effect estimate of 10.80 for the remaining workers. However, the workers underlying term (e) only constitute

a small fraction of the sample – out of 49,426 observations with X ∗ above the threshold, exactly 200 or 0.4%

of the workers have a non-maximum wba. Therefore, the term (e) is small overall; in fact, including the 200

observations changes the estimate of E[ ∂∂ θB |X ∗ = 0] with a global quintic from 10.80 to 10.75. Therefore, it

is reasonable to invoke the approximation

which states that there is a sudden composition change as X ∗ moves across the threshold. Below the thresh-

old, there are only workers whose X ∗ is measured with error, and we have a mixture of workers with and

without measurement error in X ∗ above the threshold. Assuming that          ∂B
                                                                             ∂θ   evolves smoothly with X ∗ in

the population with UX 6= 0 and wba = θ and provided that Pr(UX = 0|X ∗ = x∗ , wba = θ ) is nonzero, the

continuity of E ∂∂ θB |X ∗ = x∗ , wba = θ at x∗ = 0 is equivalent to condition (A6).

    We present empirical evidence in support of condition (A6). In Appendix Figure A.1, the composition

change is apparent through the sharp discontinuity at zero in the histogram of X ∗ for workers at the maxi-

mum wba, implying that Pr(UX = 0|X ∗ = x∗ , wba = θ ) 6= 0. Appendix Figure A.2 is the sample analog of

intervals of Calonico, Cattaneo and Titiunik (2014) fail to reject continuity at the 5% level with p-values of

0.11 and 0.19 respectively.

    Finally, we acknowledge that the number of observations below the threshold in Figure A.2 is small

– a total of 2,419, and we may lack the power to detect a discontinuity. The conventional local linear
                                        h                         i
point estimate of the discontinuity in E ∂∂ θB |X ∗ = x∗ , wba = θ is 1.34, indicating that workers subject to

measurement error in earnings contribute a lower mechanical effect on average. We have noted above that

workers captured by term (e) of equation (A4) also have a lower mechanical effect on average. Taken

together, this means that in our fuzzy regression kink design, measurement error in the running variable

lowers the average estimated mechanical effect, which in turn raises the estimated behavioral effect. As a

result, the “true” fiscal externality (i.e., that applies the same weights in the total and mechanical effects) of

a policy reform that marginally increases the wba will have an even lower deadweight loss than estimated.

Note: Column (1) are the estimates from the first four rows of Table 2. Column (2) is the cumulative UI payments that the control
group would gain if it was mechanically subject to the treatment group’s earnings deduction schedule. Column (3) is (1) minus (2).
Column (4) is the experimental impact on tax receipts. Column (5) is equal to the estimate from a regression of tax receipts on the
treatment indicator, then divided by column (2). Column (6) is (3) divided by (2). Column (7) is (5) minus (6). Tax receipts are
calculated using assuming that the tax rate on earnings is 31.54 percent.

Note: Robust standard errors in parentheses. Column (1) shows the estimates from the first four rows of Table 4. Column (2) is the
estimated mean mechanical transfer at the threshold from increasing wba. It is the intercept from a regression of the mechanical
effect on a quintic polynomial in X and A · X, where A = 1[X > 0]. Column (3) is (1) minus (2). Column (4) is the fuzzy RKD
estimate of wba on tax receipts, calculated as in Column (1). Column (5) is the fuzzy RKD estimate of the effect of wba on UI
payments net of tax receipts, divided by column (2), and minus 1. Column (6) is (3) divided by (2). Column (7) is (5) minus (6). The
bandwidths and orders of the RKDs for all columns except (4) are chosen to minimize MSE (polynomial order is selected between
1 and 3) where the outcome is UI payments. For column (4), the bandwidth and polynomial order are chosen using tax receipts
as the outcome. Standard errors for Columns (5) to (7) are computed by jointly estimating their numerator and denominator, and
allowing unrestricted covariances across equations, and then using the delta method. Tax receipts are calculated using assuming
that the tax rate on earnings is 31.54 percent.
