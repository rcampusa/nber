Income-Based Disparities in Health Care Utilization under Universal Coverage in Brazil

NBER Working Paper No. 17069
May 2011, Revised August 2013
JEL No. I0,O12

                                              ABSTRACT

Since Brazil's adoption of universal health care in 1988, the country's health care system has consisted
of a mix of private providers and free public providers. We test whether income-based disparities in
medical visits and medications remain in Brazil despite universal coverage using a nationally representative
sample of over 48,000 households. Additional income is associated with less public sector utilization
and more private sector utilization, both using simple correlations and regressions controlling for household
characteristics and local area fixed effects. Importantly, the increase in private care use is greater than
the drop in public care use. Also, income and unmet medical needs are negatively associated. These
results suggest that access limitations remain for low-income households despite the availability of
free public care.

1     Introduction and Background

    In 1990, Brazil adopted a universal health care system that uses network of public
providers to deliver a full range of health services free of charge. The public system —
called sistema único de saúde (SUS) — is guided by three main principles of universality,
integrality, and decentralization. Universality means that health care is a universal right;
it is the state’s duty to provide health care to all citizens free of charge. Integrality means
that public health assistance must comprise primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of care.
Decentralization means that the management and organization of health services is the re-
sponsibility of the municipalities. The SUS is one of the world’s largest public health care
systems. Its ambulatory system consists of 56,640 units and assists 350 million cases annu-
ally, while 6,493 hospitals and 487,058 hospital beds are part of the SUS network. In 2001,
the SUS conducted 250 million consultations, 200 million laboratory tests, and 70 million
high complexity procedures (Rehem de Souza, 2002). The SUS network consists of a mix
of public, non-profit, and for-profit providers, but all services are paid by the federal, state,
and municipal governments (Uga and Santos, 2007).
    In 1994, the Brazilian government added the Family Health Program (Programa Saúde
da Família; PSF) to the public system in an eﬀort to improve primary health care access
and reduce service inequality. The PSF assigns a geographical area inhabited by an average
of 3,450 and a maximum of 4,500 people to a team composed of one physician, one nurse,
one nurse assistant, and four or more community health workers. While PSF physicians and
nurses typically provide care at health facilities, community workers provide prevention and
education services during household visits.
    Brazil’s private health care system — called sistema suplementar de saúde (SSS) — com-
prises those private institutions that do not belong to the SUS. Patients are responsible
for their own medical bills in the private system. Individual and group health insurance
plans are available to help defray the costs, but coverage rates are low. Though only 20% of
the population participates in the SSS, it accounts for approximately half of the country’s

                                               3
medical expenditures.
   According to SUS principles, essential medicines are also to be provided universally and
free of charge. However, in practice a large proportion of Brazilians resort to private pharma-
cies. The main reasons indicated in the literature are the prescription of drugs not included
in the list of essential medications, the lack of stock at local public pharmacies, and bureau-
cratic problems such as improper prescriptions (Bertoldi et al. 2009, Oliveira Silva Naves
and Silver 2005).
   Empirical research to date suggests that universal health care in Brazil has improved
health care utilization and health but that barriers to access remain. Thume et al. (2010)
and Rodriguez et al. (2009) found that the PSF increased health care utilization by the
elderly. Macinko et al. (2006 and 2007), Rasella et al. (2010), and Morsch et al. (2001)
documented a negative association between PSF coverage and infant or five-year mortality
rates. Goldbaum et al. (2005) compared two areas of São Paulo City and found that
disparities in health care utilization on the bases of income and education were more evident
in the area that was not covered by the PSF. However, according to Xu et al. (2003) Brazil
had the second-highest prevalence of catastrophic medical expenditures out of 59 countries
despite the availability of free public care. Rodriguez et al. (2009) found that less than
half of elderly individuals with chronic conditions had a medical visit in the preceding six
months. Barros and Bertoldi (2008) examined a sample of 869 households and found that
the proportion of income spent on private health services was similar across economic groups,
though in a larger sample Uga and Santos (2007) found that this proportion falls with income.
In a study of the northeastern state of Ceará, Maciel et al. (2010) show that the need of
physicians to have multiple jobs is a major obstacle to SUS eﬃcacy. Bos (2007) estimated
a positive relationship between the number of public outpatient clinics in a municipality
and residents’ probability of using the public system, suggesting that utilization could be
increased by further expansion.
   We contribute to this growing literature in three ways.3 First, we use a large nationally


                                              4
representative sample to test for income-based disparities in health care utilization in Brazil.
Second, we examine whether these disparities are purely driven by diﬀerences in the private
sector or whether disparities exist in the public sector as well. Third, we test whether income
influences the amount of medical needs left unmet because of cost despite the existence of
free public care.



2     Data and Methods

2.1    Data

    Our main data source is the 2002-2003 wave of the Pesquisa de Orçamentos Familiares
(POF; Survey of Family Budget), a nationally representative dataset of about 50,000 house-
holds collected by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. The POF contains
detailed information on all types of expenditures (including doctor visits and medicines) and
income sources by the families in a one year period, as well as socioeconomic and demographic
characteristics of the household members.
    We also use the next wave of the POF, 2008-2009, to confirm the results from 2002-2003.
Because public (as opposed to private) doctor visits and the variables on unmet medical needs
are not available, a complete analysis using 2008-2009 data is not feasible. The variables
and summary statistics described below, as well as the main regressions in the next section,
are therefore from 2002-2003.1
    In the POF, total household income is reported per month; we multiply it by twelve
to approximate annual income. Table 1 lists the independent variables for our empirical
analysis, which include the natural log (because of the skewness of the income distribution)
of income as well as sets of controls for demographics, religion, health, and living conditions.
Table 1 also reports the variable means from our analysis sample of 48,225.
    The (June 2006 version of the) 2002-2003 POF also collects data on services and products
consumed by the surveyed individuals’ households, either paid for by them or obtained free


                                               5
of charge, as well as those that they intended to consume but could not aﬀord. In the
medical visits instrument, each record corresponds to a narrowly defined service reported
by the individual, its associated cost, a payment method including the option donation,
its source of provision (e.g. private provider, diﬀerent types of health insurance, or public
provision), and the provider location (e.g. SUS or SSS)..We use this information to construct
the following dependent variables reflecting household-level health care utilization: private
doctor visits, public doctor visits, all doctor visits, doctor visits needed but not made because
of cost, private medications, public medications, all medications, and medications needed but
not consumed because of cost.
   Private doctor visits are defined as reported services provided by a private doctor, health
organization, or other health company for which the individual was charged a cost. Services
provided by health organizations associated with labor unions are included as health com-
panies and any payment made by the individuals to these organizations in exchange of
services is included as an out-of-pocket expenditure. We define public visits as those clas-
sified as a donation whose provider location was coded as SUS.2 Medical visits needed but
not aﬀorded are those with the payment method restriction. All doctor visits are simply
the sum of private and public visits.3 The POF reports the number of medical visits in the
preceding three months; we multiply the responses by four to obtain an annualized mea-
sure. The following doctor specializations were included in our analysis: ob/gynecologist,
pediatrician, cardiologist, ophtalmologist, orthopedist, neurologist, psychiatrist, dermatolo-
gist, allergist, gastroenterologist, generalist, geriatrician, homeopat, nefrologist, nutricionist,
obstetric, oncologist, otolaryngologist, pneumologist, rheumatologist, endocrinologist, proc-
tologist, urologist, angiologist, other medical specialization.
   Pharmaceutical expenditures are collected in the POF through a separate instrument.
Each record corresponds to a medicine reported by the individual, its associated cost, a
payment method including the option donation, and the provider location. Both prescription
and over-the-counter medications are included. Our procedure to classify private, public,


                                                6
all, and not aﬀorded medications is analogous to the one applied for physician services. The
POF’s questions on medications are for the preceding month; we multiply by twelve to obtain
approximations of annual consumption.
   Table 2 gives, for each of the eight dependent variables, their means, correlations with
ln(income), proportion of the population for whom utilization is non-zero, and the mean
among those for whom utilization is nonzero. Only 16% of households report any private
medical visits, while 24% report any public visits and only 38% report accessing either sector.
These means suggest some limitations in access, and these limitations are correlated with
income. The correlation between ln(income) and private visits is 0.27, while the correlation
between income and overall visits is a smaller 0.127 but still positive and significant. The
correlation is weaker for overall visits than for private visits because income is negatively
correlated with public visits (-0.071).
   Utilization patterns are quite diﬀerent for medications, as 78% of households obtain at
least one medication and the vast majority of medications are purchased in the private sector.
The higher participation rate for medicines relative to medical visits could be explained by
over-the-counter medications not requiring physician access. The private sector accounting
for a much larger share of medications than medical visits is consistent with the fact that
not all prescriptions or recommendations for over-the-counter drugs issued by SUS doctors
are filled for free at a public facility. Despite these diﬀerences in overall utilization, we
observe the same patterns for income-based disparities: ln(income) is positively correlated
with overall and private medications and negatively correlated with public medications.
   The means and correlations for our most direct measures of access limitations — visits
and medications needed but not consumed because of cost — also reveal interesting patterns.
First, only 5.6% and 7% of households report any unmet needs for visits and medications,
respectively. These relatively low rates are consistent with improved access as a result of
universal coverage. However, the correlations show that unmet medical needs because of
cost fall with income, suggesting that some pro-rich disparities still remain.


                                              7
3     Methods

    We use regression analysis to estimate the association between ln(income) and the health
care utilization measures controlling for the demographic, religion, health, and living con-
dition factors summarized in Table 1 plus fixed eﬀects for all 3,979 local geographic areas
utilized in the POF. Brazil consists of 5,560 municipalities, so the POF’s geographic ar-
eas are on average slightly larger than a municipality (Pan American Health Organization,
2008).The dependent variables are non-negative counts with a significant number of zeros,
and the process governing the transition from non-participation to the first visit/medication
is likely diﬀerent than the process governing successive visits/medications after a household is
already participating in the system. We therefore estimate two-part hurdle models where the
first part predicts participation and the second part predicts number of visits/medications
conditional on participation. We estimate a separate two-part model for each of the eight
visit/medication dependent variables from Table 2. There is controversy over whether Heck-
man’s sample selection model or the two-part model is the most appropriate when potential
health care utilization/expenditure is the outcome of interest (see Madden, 2008 and Jones,
2000). However, our outcome of interest is actual utilization — Brazilians’ actual consump-
tion of health services, rather the services they would have consumed had they sought health
care. Dow and Norton (2003) underscore that the appropriate model in this case is the two-
part model as no selection bias is actually present in the sample. Sometimes this is referred
as the "true zeros" case in the literature, since a zero observation represents no consumption,
and not an unobserved value.
    The first part estimates the conditional association between income and probability of
a household having any visits/medications. We estimate linear probability models because
probit and logistic fixed eﬀects estimators are known to potentially suﬀer from bias — even
with the number of observations per group as large as it is in our dataset — because of the
incidental parameters problem (Kalbfleisch and Sprott, 1970; Hsiao, 1996; Greene, 2004).
While the linear probability model has the drawback of predicting outside of the 0-1 range,

                                               8
its coeﬃcient estimates are reliable (Angrist, 2001), and the purpose of our analysis is to
accurately estimate average eﬀects of the covariates rather than predict outcomes. Eﬀect
sizes obtained from probit and logistic regressions (available upon request) were similar.
The regression equation is


                   (  0|  Xij ) = 0 + 1 ln( ) + X0ij α +              (1)


where  and  are indices for household and local area,  is the number of visits/medications,
 is household income, X is the vector of control variables, and  is the local area
fixed eﬀect. Taking the log of income gives the coeﬃcient a straightforward interpretation:
the approximate percentage point eﬀect on participation of a 100% increase in income. We
compute heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors clustered by local area.4
   The second part of the model estimates the relationships between the covariates and the
number of visits/medications among those who cleared the participation "hurdle" in the first
step. Since the dependent variables are counts, we estimate zero-truncated Poisson models
of the form

                                                   exp( 0 +  1 ln( ) + X0ij β+  )
              [ |  Xij    0] =                                                (2)
                                                       1 −  ( = 0|  Xij )

where the sample is restricted to participators. Further details of this econometric model can
be found in Greene (2007, p. 37-38). Greene (2004) notes that this model is not susceptible
to the incidental parameters problem. In unreported regressions we also considered trun-
cated negative binomial models and found that the coeﬃcient estimate and standard error
for  1 were virtually identical to the truncated Poisson in all cases. Since the coeﬃcient es-
timates are diﬃcult to interpret, we computed the eﬀect sizes of ln(income) on visits among
participators, which we define as 1 . Combining the results from the two parts allows us to




                                                      9
approximate the overall marginal eﬀect of () on  for the whole sample as follows:

                             []
                                      = 1 (|  0) + 1 ( [  0])                      (3)
                          ln()

where |  0 is the mean number of visits/medications among participators and  [  0]
is the sample participation rate, given in the last two columns of Table 2.
   The control variables, listed in Table 1, are chosen to capture as many factors that may be
correlated with both income and health care utilization as the data allow. The underweight,
overweight, and obesity indicators capture certain aspects of health, while the private health
insurance indicator also reflects health as demand for insurance is a function of expected
medical needs. Since the POF does not contain more detailed health information, we also
add the extensive set of controls for living conditions, which could influence health and be
correlated with income. The fixed eﬀects for local areas push further toward isolating a
causal relationship by capturing unobserved factors related to health care demand or supply
that vary systematically across communities.
   The variance inflation factor (VIF) for ln(income) is only 3, well below the maximum
accepted level of 10 at which the extent of multicollinearity is considered to be problematic
(Wooldridge, 2006:99). Moreover, there is little to no loss in precision if we drop the fixed
eﬀects from the model, suggesting that the eﬃciency gained from their predictive power is
suﬃcient to oﬀset the lost degrees of freedom.
   Finally, the SUS and, in particular, the PSF, have continued to grow since our sample
period of 2002-2003. This poses the question of whether our results would still hold today.
We therefore re-estimated our models using the subsequent 2008-2009 POF for the four out
of our eight dependent variables that are available in the later survey: private medical visits
and private, public, and all medications.5 The estimated eﬀects of income remained very
similar to those obtained using 2002-2003 for those four variables (results available upon
request), which suggests that the results would likely also remain similar for the other four



                                              10
utilization measures for which 2008-2009 data is not available.



4     Findings

    Tables 3 and 4 present the results for medical visits and medications, respectively. The
top half of each Table reports the coeﬃcient estimates and standard errors for the ()
variable from the linear probability models (equation (1)), while the bottom half gives the
eﬀect sizes and standard errors for the income variable from the zero-truncated Poisson
regressions (equation (2)). To conserve space, we do not report the full regression output
for the control variables but instead present F statistics from tests of the joint statistical
significance of the variables in each group. The next-to-last line of each Table reports the
overall marginal eﬀects as computed by equation (3), while the last line scales these overall
marginal eﬀects by the dependent variables’ sample means from Table 2 to express them as
percentages.
    The first column of Table 3 shows that income is positively and statistically significantly
(  0001) associated with the probability of household members having any private medical
visits, as well as the number of private visits conditional on having any. Specifically, a 100%
increase in income raises the probability of participation by approximately 5.1 percentage
points and the number of visits conditional on participation by approximately 0.43. The
overall eﬀect size suggests that a 100% increase in income leads to 0.36 more private visits
per household across the entire sample (including both participators and non-participators),
or 40% of the sample mean of 0.91 visits.
    The second column of Table 3 gives the results for public visits. Additional income leads
to a statistically significant (  0001) reduction in the probability of participating in the
public sector for medical visits, but has no statistically detectable eﬀect on the number of
public visits conditional on participation. In other words, a pay raise makes an individual
more likely to opt out of the public sector, but if she chooses to remain in the public sector



                                              11
her level of utilization does not change. A 100% increase in income is associated with a 2.5
percentage point reduction in the probability of having any medical visits. Combining the
negative eﬀect on participation with the non-eﬀect on utilization, the overall eﬀect of a 100%
increase in income is to reduce public visits by 0.14, or 10% of the sample mean of 1.38.
   The fact that the positive eﬀect on private visits is larger than the negative eﬀect on
public visits suggests that income should increase the total number of visits. This is what
we find in the third column of Table 3. A 100% increase in income raises the probability of
having any medical visits (public or private) by 2.3 percentage points (  0001) and the
number of visits conditional on having any by 0.22 (  0001), for an overall eﬀect of 0.223
or 9.7% of the mean of 2.3.
   The final column of Table 3 shows that an additional 100% of income reduces the prob-
ability of having any medical visits needed but not made because of cost by 0.7 percentage
points (  0001) and the number of these unaﬀordable visits conditional on having any
by 0.31 (  005). Together, these estimates imply an overall reduction in visits not made
because of cost of -0.06, which represents a sizeable 19% of the sample mean of 0.32.
   The results for medication, shown in Table 4, reveal a similar pattern. In the first column,
a 100% increase in income raises the probability of purchasing at least one medication in
the private sector by 5.8 percentage points (  0001) and the number of medications
purchased among those who purchase at least one by 3.4 (  0001). Overall, the eﬀect is
4.5 medications, or 18% of the sample mean of 25.6. The second column shows that a higher
income leads to fewer medications obtained for free at SUS facilities. An additional 100%
of income reduces the probability of public sector participation by 2.3 percentage points
(  0001) and the number of free medications obtained by participators by 0.5, although
the latter is not quite statistically significant at conventional levels. The overall eﬀect is 0.57
fewer free medications, or 19% of the mean of 3.06.
   Since income leads to a greater increase in medications bought than the decrease in
medications given for free, its association with total medications — given in the third column


                                                12
— is positive. A 100% increase in income leads to a 4.2 percentage point increase in the
probability of obtaining any medicines (  0001) and 3.1 additional medicines for those
who obtain at least one (  0001). In all, 100% more income increases the number of
medications consumed by the average household by approximately 3.9, or 14% of the sample
mean of 28.7.
    Finally, the fourth column of Table 4 shows that 100% of additional income reduces the
probability of having any unmet needs for medications because of cost by 2.1 percentage
points (  0001), while also reducing the number of unmet needs among those with any
by a statistically insignificant 0.44. Together, these estimates imply that a 100% increase in
income is associated with 0.4 fewer medicines needed but unable to obtain because of cost per
household per year, or 32% of the sample mean of 1.25. Note that, while we also observed
a negative relationship between income and medical visits not made because of cost, the
magnitude is larger for medications. This may reflect the fact that many prescriptions and
recommendations for over-the-counter drugs issued by SUS doctors still have to be bought in
the private sector, so using the public sector for doctor visits does not automatically translate
to getting free medicines. Increasing the stock of medicines SUS facilities have available to
distribute may therefore ameliorate this disparity to some extent.



5     Discussion

    Brazil adopted a universal health care policy in 1990 with the aim at reducing important
health access disparities. By analyzing the utilization of a nationally representative sample
of Brazilians, our study sheds light on the degree to which income-based disparities in Brazil-
ians’ use of health services and medication still remained over a decade after the enactment
of universal coverage.
    Our estimated correlations reveal four key results relating to income-based disparities.
First, income is positively associated with private sector utilization. Second, income is neg-



                                               13
atively associated with public sector utilization. Third, income is positively associated with
overall health care consumption. These first three points together suggest that additional
income leads to a substitution away from the public sector and toward the private sector.
Most of this is likely due to the fact that the private sector oﬀers more desirable (although
non-essential) characteristics compared to the public sector, such as lower wait times for
appointments and upscale facilities. However, our results show that the increase in private
care from higher income outweighs the decrease in public care. This raises the question
of whether higher income families overuse health care resources or, more worrisome, lower
income families do not have enough access. Our fourth key result, namely the negative
association between income and unmet medical needs because of cost, provides evidence
supporting the latter.
   Because these correlations may be driven by confounders we also conducted regression
analysis. The results were consistent with the correlations. Controlling for a large, although
not fully comprehensive, set of characteristics, we find that income increases the number of
private visits and decreases the number of public visits. The net eﬀect remains that higher
income increases the total number of doctor visits. Importantly, we find that an increase in
income is associated with a reduction in the overall number in visits that were needed but
could not be aﬀorded. The size of this eﬀect is substantial: a 100% income increase reduces
the mean number of unaﬀordable visits by 19%. This is an important contribution. It shows
that, in spite of the financial and human resources invested in the public health system, low
income families claim to have unmet health care needs. Whether this occurs because the
access is insuﬃcient (e.g., lack of facilities in rural remote areas) or because the families do
not have the resources (time and money) to have their needs met, is an important question
that will have to be addressed in future work.
   Our research also points to the fact that higher income levels are associated with a much
larger number of acquired medications. At first glance, one may think that this phenomenon
is similar to (and occurs for the same reasons as) the association between income and doctor


                                              14
visits. However, this is not necessarily true. In particular, there may be an important
causal connection between diﬃculties in accessing doctor visits and diﬃculties in accessing
medications. For example, low income families may have substantially lower number of doctor
visits because of their perception that doctors are likely to prescribe medications that they
will not be able to aﬀord. This hypothesis (which cannot be tested with our data) has critical
policy implications. Knowing the answer is critical to understanding whether unmet needs
for doctor visits can be most eﬀectively reduced by increasing the number of facilities (or
extending PSF) or by priorizing universal access to medications.
   Importantly, our results should not be interpreted to suggest that universal health care
in Brazil has not led to reductions in income-based disparities or improvements in access
to health care services for low income families. The pro-poor disparity in public utilization
and the overall relatively low rate of unmet medical needs imply that disparities and access
problems would be worse without the public sector. Furthermore, the finding that income
increases the likelihood of individuals opting out of the public sector could conceivably be
considered equity-improving. By switching to the private sector in seek of comfort and
non-essential services, richer individuals free public resources for those in need of essential
medical care.
   Our research has limitations. First, our ability to control for health characteristics of the
individuals is limited given our dataset. We included underweight, overweight, obesity, and
health insurance indicators as well as a number of variables related to sanitation and living
conditions, but these may not suﬃce to capture all important aspects of health. Second,
there may be potential endogeneity of the health and living condition controls and local
area fixed eﬀects. Income could influence health, living conditions, and area of residence,
which in turn could influence health care consumption. In this case, our specification might
"control away" part of the overall eﬀect of income on utilization. To address this concern, we
estimated additional models dropping each of these three sets of covariates separately as well
as dropping all three together. This did not aﬀect our findings; the results are available upon


                                              15
request. Third, the Brazilian economy, and the SUS in particular, are in constant change.
Our analysis are based on 2002-2003 data and complemented by 2008-2009 data. However,
there still remains the concern that the current expenditure patterns may depart from those
captured in our datasets.



6     Conclusion

    In its Constitution of 1988, Brazil adopted a universal health care policy with the goal of
guaranteeing public health care to the most vulnerable sectors of the population. Previous
research suggests that Brazil’s universal health care system has improved access to health
care but that gaps in access for vulnerable populations remain. We test for income-based
disparities in medical visits and medications and find results that are consistent with this
assessment.
    We find that more income leads individuals to substitute paid private sector care for free
public sector care. This may be due to perceived higher quality, shorter queues, or greater
convenience of the private sector. However, we also find that the increase in private care
doctor visits is greater than the decrease in public care doctor visits. This suggests that the
overall disparity in health care utilization remains pro-rich. We also show that income is
negatively associated with medical needs unmet because of cost, pointing to continued access
problems among at least some low-income households. In all, our findings add to the growing
body of evidence that limitations in health care access still exist for low-income households
in Brazil despite the availability of the free public sector.
    Overall, our findings suggest that universal coverage does not automatically lead to uni-
versal care. Even if a population is shielded from medical bills, high transportation costs,
long waits, or perceived diﬃculties in securing the medications can still prevent the poor
from obtaining care.

   Notes
   1. An alternative survey, the Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicilios 2008 (PNAD
2008), contains more detailed health information, but it is not suitable for our purposes since
it does not allow for separate counts of medical visits (or medicines) based on whether the
provision is public or private. Additionally, the PNAD’s health system utilization data has
a reference period of only two weeks.
   2. As robustness checks we also defined public visits in two alternative ways: 1) any
visit whose payment method was coded as donation, and 2) any donation whose source of
provision was coded as public and whose provider location was coded as SUS. The results
were virtually identical and are available upon request. This robustness reflects the fact that
virtually all free visits in Brazil are publically provided by the SUS.
   3. Occasionally, medical visits reported by the POF do not fall into either our private or
public classifications, so our classification of "all" visits does not include every single POF
visit. However, these "other" visits are rare and may in many cases simply reflect reporting
error. We therefore elect not to include them when computing "all visits". This exclusion is
of little consequence for the sample means, correlations, or regression estimates, and results
using the broader classification are available upon request. A similar caveat applies to the
following discussion of medications.
   4. We do not use the POF sampling weights since some of the Stata modules used in
the analysis do not support them. In unreported regressions (available upon request), we
verified that the results from the regressions for which sampling weights are supported are
not sensitive to their use.
   5. The 2008-2009 POF questionnaire on individual expenditures contains the variable
payment method but not source of provision or provider location. Hence, publicly provided
medicines were identified only through the code that corresponds to donation as payment
method, introducing a degree of noise in the variable. We nonetheless obtain similar results
as with the 2002-2003 data.
