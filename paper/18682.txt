                                              ABSTRACT

We augment a standard monetary DSGE model to include a Bernanke-Gertler-Gilchrist financial accelerator
mechanism. We fit the model to US data, allowing the volatility of cross-sectional idiosyncratic uncertainty
to fluctuate over time. We refer to this measure of volatility as 'risk'. We find that fluctuations in risk
are the most important shock driving the business cycle.

1         Introduction
We introduce agency problems associated with …nancial intermediation into an otherwise stan-
dard model of business cycles. Our estimates suggest that ‡uctuations in the severity of these
agency problems account for a substantial portion of business cycle ‡uctuations over the past
two and a half decades.
        The agency problems we introduce are those associated with asymmetric information and
costly monitoring proposed by Robert Townsend (1979). Our implementation most closely
follows the work of Ben Bernanke and Mark Gertler (1989) and Bernanke, Gertler and Simon
Gilchrist (1999) (BGG).1 Entrepreneurs play a central role in the model. They combine their
own resources with loans to acquire raw, physical capital. They then convert this capital into
e¤ective capital in a process that is characterized by idiosyncratic uncertainty. We refer to
the magnitude of this uncertainty as ‘risk’. The notion that idiosyncratic uncertainty in the
allocation of capital is important in practice can be motivated informally in several ways. For
example, it is well known that a large proportion of …rm start ups end in failure.2 Entrepreneurs
and their suppliers of funds experience these failures as a stroke of bad luck. Even entrepreneurs
that we now think of as ‘sure bets’, such as Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, experienced failures as
well as the successes for which they are famous.3 Another illustration of the microeconomic
uncertainty associated with the allocation of capital may be found in the various ‘wars’over
industry standards. In these wars, entrepreneurs commit large amounts of raw capital to one
or another standard. Whether that raw capital turns into highly e¤ective capital or becomes
worthless is, to a substantial degree, up to chance.4
        We model the idiosyncratic uncertainty experienced by entrepreneurs by the assumption
that if an entrepreneur purchases K units of physical capital, that capital then turns into
K! units of e¤ective capital. Here, !               0 is a random variable drawn independently by

      Other important early contributions include Carstrom and Fuerst (1997), Fisher (1999) and Williamson
(1987). More recent contributions include Christiano, Motto and Rostagno (2003), Jermann and Quadrini
(2011) and Arellano, Bai and Kehoe (2011).

      Steve Jobs experienced tremendous success in allocating capital to the iPod, iPhone and iPad,
but experienced a commercial failure when he allocated capital to the NeXT Computer (see Ham-
mer (2011)).       Similarly, Bill Gates experienced a spectacular return on the resources he invested
in Microsoft.      However, his previous e¤orts, focused on his …rm, Traf-O-Data, completely failed
(http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2011/04/24/my-favorite-mistake.html).
    4
      For example, in the 1970s Sony allocated substantial resources to the construction of video equipment that
used the Betamax video standard, while JVC and others used the VHS standard. After some time, VHS ‘won’
the standards war, so that the capital produced by investing in video equipment that used the VHS standard
was more e¤ective than capital produced by investing in Betamax equipment. The reasons for this outcome are
still hotly debated today. However, from the ex-ante perspective of the companies involved and their suppliers
of funds, the ex post outcome can be thought of as the realization of a random variable (for more discussion,
see http://www.mediacollege.com/video/format/compare/betamax-vhs.html).



                                                      1
each entrepreneur, normalized to have mean unity.5 Entrepreneurs that draw ! larger than
unity experience a success, while entrepreneurs that draw ! close to zero experience failure.
The realization of ! is not known at the time the entrepreneur receives …nancing. When !
is realized its value is observed by the entrepreneur, but can be observed by the supplier of
…nance only by undertaking costly monitoring. We denote the time t cross-sectional standard
deviation log ! by        t:   We refer to   t   as risk. The variable,   t;   is assumed to be the realization
of a stochastic process. Thus, risk is high in periods when                t   is high and there is substantial
dispersion in the outcomes across entrepreneurs. Risk is low otherwise.
         Our econometric analysis assigns a large role to        t   in business ‡uctuations because a jump
in       t   triggers responses in our model that resemble actual recessions. The underlying intu-
ition is simple. As in BGG, we suppose that entrepreneurs receive a standard debt contract.
The interest rate on entrepreneurial loans includes a premium to cover the costs of default
by the entrepreneurs that experience low realizations of !. The entrepreneurs and the asso-
ciated …nancial frictions are inserted into an otherwise standard dynamic, stochastic general
equilibrium (DSGE) model.6 According to our model, the credit spread (i.e., premium in
the entrepreneur’s interest rate over the risk-free interest rate) ‡uctuates with changes in                  t:

When risk is high, the credit spread is high and credit extended to entrepreneurs is low. With
fewer …nancial resources, entrepreneurs acquire less physical capital. Because investment is a
key input in the production of capital, it follows that investment falls. With this decline in
the purchase of goods, output, consumption and employment fall. For the reasons stressed
in BGG, the net worth of entrepreneurs - an object that we identify with the stock market -
falls too. This occurs because the rental income of entrepreneurs falls with the decline in eco-
nomic activity and because they su¤er capital losses as the price of capital drops. Finally, the
overall decline in economic activity results in a decline in the marginal cost of production and
thus a decline in in‡ation. So, according to the model the risk shock implies a countercyclical
credit spread and procyclical investment, consumption, employment, in‡ation, stock market
and credit. These implications of the model correspond well to the analogous features of US
business cycle data.7
     5
     The assumption about the mean of ! is in the nature of a normalization because we allow other random
variables to capture the aggregate sources of uncertainty faced by entrepreneurs.
   6
     Our strategy for inserting the entrepreneurs into a DSGE model follows the lead of BGG in a general way. At
the level of details, our model follows Christiano, Motto and Rostagno (2003) by introducing the entrepreneurs
into a version of the model proposed in Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (2005) and by introducing the risk
shock (and an equity shock mentioned later) studied here. To our knowledge, the …rst paper to appeal to
variations in risk as a driver of business cycles is Williamson (1987).
   7
     Our model complements recent papers that highlight other ways in which increased cross-sectional dis-
persion in an important shock could lead to aggregate ‡uctuations. For example, Nicholas Bloom (2009) and
Bloom, Floetotto and Nir Jaimovich (2009) show how greater uncertainty can produce a recession by inducing
businesses to adopt a ‘wait and see’attitude and delay investment. For another example that resembles ours,


                                                           2
    We include other shocks in our model and then estimate the values of its parameters by
standard Bayesian methods using 12 aggregate variables. In addition to the usual 8 variables
used in standard macroeconomic analyses, we also make use of 4 …nancial variables: the value
of the stock market, credit to non…nancial …rms, the credit spread and the slope of the term
structure. As with any empirical analysis of this type, it can be interpreted as a sort of
accounting exercise. We in e¤ect decompose our 12 aggregate variables into a large number
of shocks. In light of the observations in the previous paragraph, it is perhaps not surprising
that one of these shocks,       t;   emerges as the most important by far. For example, the analysis
suggests that ‡uctuations in          t   account for 60 percent of the ‡uctuations in the growth rate
of aggregate US output since the mid 1980s. Our conclusion that the risk shock is the most
important shock depends crucially on including the four …nancial variables in our dataset.
    Our empirical analysis treats           t    as an unobserved variable. We infer its properties using
our model and our 12 aggregate time series. A natural concern is that we might have relied
on excessively large ‡uctuations in                  t   to drive economic ‡uctuations. To guard against this,
we look outside the data set used in the econometric analysis of the model for evidence on
the degree of cyclical variation in             t.       For this, we study a measure of ‘uncertainty’proposed
in Bloom (2009). In particular, we compute the cross-sectional standard deviation of …rm-
level stock returns in the Center for Research in Securities Prices (CRSP) stock-returns …le.
According to our model, the time series of this measure of uncertainty is dominated by the
risk shock. We use our model to project Bloom (2009)’s measure of uncertainty onto the
12 data series used in the econometric analysis of our model. We …nd that the degree of
cyclical variation in the empirical and model-based measures of uncertainty are very similar.
We interpret this as important support for the model
    Our analysis is related to a growing body of evidence which documents that the cross-
sectional dispersion of a variety of variables is countercyclical.8 Of course, the mere fact that
cross-sectional volatility is countercyclical does not by itself prove the hypothesis in our model,
that risk shocks are causal. It is in principle possible that countercyclical variation in cross-
see Cristina Arellano, Yan Bai, and Patrick Kehoe (2011). For an example of how countercyclical dispersion
may occur endogenously, see Christiano and Ikeda (2012).
    8
      For example, Bloom (2009) documents that various cross-sectional dispersion measures for …rms in panel
datasets are countercyclical. De Veirman and Levin (2011) …nd similar results using the Thomas Worldscope
database. Matthias Kehrig (2011) uses plant level data to document that the dispersion of total factor produc-
tivity in U.S. durable manufacturing is greater in recessions than in booms. Vavra (2011) presents evidence that
the cross-sectional variance of price changes at the product level is countercyclical. Christiano and Ikeda (2012)
present evidence on the countercyclicality of the cross-sectional dispersion of equity returns among …nancial
…rms. Also, Alexopoulos and Cohen (2009) construct an index based on the frequency of time that words like
‘uncertainty’appear in the New York Times and …nd that this index rises in recessions. It is unclear, however,
whether their evidence about uncertainty concerns variations in cross-sectional dispersion or changes in the
variance of time series aggregates. Our risk shock corresponds to the former.



                                                                3
sectional dispersion is a symptom rather than a cause of business cycles.9 Some support for
the assumption about causal ordering in our model is provided by the work of Scott R. Baker
and Bloom (2011).
       Our work is also related to Alejandro Justiniano, Giorgio E. Primiceri and Andrea Tam-
balotti (2010), which stresses the role of technology shocks in the production of installed capital
(marginal e¢ ciency of investment shocks). These shocks resemble our risk shock in that they
primarily a¤ect intertemporal opportunities. Our risk shock and the marginal e¢ ciency of
investment shock are hard to distinguish when we only include the eight standard macroeco-
nomic variables in our analysis. However, the analysis strongly favors the risk shock when our
four …nancial variables are included in the dataset. In part this is because, consistent with the
data, the risk shock implies the value of the stock market is procyclical while the marginal e¢ -
ciency of investment shock implies it is countercyclical. The intuition for this follows from two
observations: (i) the fact that the marginal e¢ ciency of investment shock perturbs the supply
of capital while the risk shock (by the a¤ecting amount of credit extended to entrepreneurs)
a¤ects the demand for capital; and (ii) movements in the price of capital are an important
determinant of entrepreneurial net worth.
       To gain intuition into our model and promote comparability with the literature, we also
include a shock that we refer to as an equity shock. Several analyses of the recent …nancial crisis
assign an important causal role to the equity shock (see, e.g., Saki Bigio (2012), Gertler and
Peter Karadi (2011) and Gertler and Nobuhiro Kiyotaki (2011)). This is a disturbance that
directly a¤ects the quantity of net worth in the hands of entrepreneurs.10 The equity shock
acts a little like our risk shock, by operating on the demand side of the market for capital.
However, unlike the risk shock the equity shock has the counterfactual implication that credit
is countercyclical. Thus, the procyclical nature of credit is also an important reason that our
econometric analysis assigns a pre-eminent status to risk shocks in business cycles.
       The credibility of our …nding about the importance of the risk shock depends on the em-
pirical plausibility of our model. We evaluate the model’s plausibility by investigating various
implications of the model that were not used in constructing or estimating it. First, we evaluate
the model’s out-of-sample forecasting properties. We …nd that these are reasonable, relative to
the properties of a Bayesian vector autoregression or a simpler New Keynesian business cycle
   9
     For example, Rudiger Bachmann and Giuseppe Moscarini (2011) explore the idea that the cross-sectional
volatility of price changes may rise in recessions as the endogenous response of the increased fraction of …rms
contemplating an exit decision. D’Erasmo and Boedo (2011) and Kehrig (2011) provides two additional exam-
ples of the possible endogeneity of cross-sectional volatility. Another example of endogeneity in cross-sectional
volatility is provided by Christiano and Ikeda (2012).
  10
     In the literature, the equity shock perturbs the net worth of banks. As explained below, our entrepreneurs
can be interpreted as banks.

model such as the one in Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (2005) (CEE) or Frank Smets
and Rafael Wouters (2007). We also examine the model’s implications for data on bankrupt-
cies, information that was not included in the data set used to estimate the model. Finally,
as discussed above we compare the model’s implications for the kind of uncertainty measures
proposed by Bloom. Although the match is far from perfect, overall it performs well.
    The plan of the paper is as follows. The next section describes the model. Estimation
results and measures of …t are reported in section 3. Section 4 presents the main results.
We present various quantitative measures that characterize the sense in which risk shocks are
important in business cycles. We then explore the reasons why the econometric results …nd
the risk shock is so important. The paper ends with a brief conclusion. Technical details
and supporting analysis are provided in the online Appendix, Christiano, Motto and Rostagno
(2012).



2       The Model
The model incorporates the microeconomics of the debt-contracting framework of BGG into
an otherwise standard monetary model of the business cycle. The …rst subsection describes
the standard part of the model. Although these parts of the model can be found in many
sources, we include it nevertheless so that the presentation is self contained. In addition, the
presentation …xes notation and allows us to be precise about the shocks in the model. The
second subsection describes the role of the entrepreneurs in the model and the agency problems
that occur in supplying them with credit. The time series representations of the shocks, as
well as adjustment cost functions are reported in the third subsection.


2.1       Standard Part of the Model

2.1.1     Goods Production

A representative, competitive …nal goods producer combines intermediate goods, Yjt ; j 2 [0; 1];
to produce a homogeneous good, Yt ; using the following Dixit-Stiglitz technology:

                                   Z    1         1              f;t

                            Yt =            Yjt   f;t   dj             ; 1   f;t   < 1;    (2.1)
                                    0




                                                             5
where         f;t   is a shock. The intermediate good is produced by a monopolist using the following
technology:
                             8
                             <            (zt ljt )1                  if             (zt ljt )1
                                  t Kjt                        zt            t Kjt                     > zt
                     Yjt =                                                                                     ; 0<    < 1:        (2.2)
                             : 0;                                     otherwise

Here,     t    is a covariance stationary technology shock and zt is a shock whose growth rate is
stationary. Also, Kjt denotes the services of e¤ective capital and ljt denotes the quantity of
homogeneous labor, respectively, hired by the j th intermediate good producer. The …xed cost
in the production function, (2.2), is proportional to zt : The …xed cost is a combination of
the two nonstationary stochastic processes in the model, namely zt and an investment speci…c
shock described below. The variable, zt ; has the property that Yt =zt converges to a constant in
non-stochastic steady state. The monopoly supplier of Yjt sets its price, Pjt ; subject to Calvo-
style frictions. Thus, in each period t a randomly-selected fraction of intermediate-goods …rms,
1    p;   can reoptimize their price. The complementary fraction sets its price as follows:


                                                              Pjt = ~ t Pj;t 1 ;


where
                                                                    target                  1
                                                       ~t =         t          (     t 1)         :                                (2.3)

                                                                                        target
Here,     t 1          Pt 1 =Pt 2 ; Pt is the price of Yt and                           t             is the target in‡ation rate in the
monetary authority’s monetary policy rule, which is discussed below.
    There exists a technology that can be used to convert homogeneous goods into consumption
                                                                                                                                   t
goods, Ct ; one-for-one. Another technology converts a unit of homogenous goods into                                                   ;t

investment goods, where                    > 1 and        ;t   is a shock. Because we assume these technologies are
operated by competitive …rms, the equilibrium prices of consumption and investment goods
                             t
are Pt and Pt =                  ;t   ; respectively. The trend rise in technology for producing investment
goods is the second source of growth in the model, and


                                                              zt = zt ( 1 )t :


2.1.2         Labor Market

The model of the labor market is taken from Christopher Erceg, Dale Henderson and Andrew
Levin (2000), and parallels the Dixit-Stiglitz structure of goods production. A representa-
tive, competitive labor contractor aggregates di¤erentiated labor services, hi;t ; i 2 [0; 1] ; into


                                                                           6

The labor contractor sells labor services, lt ; to intermediate good producers for nominal wage
rate, Wt : The labor contractor’s …rst order condition for hi;t represents its demand curve for
that labor type. There are several ways of conceptualizing the supply of each labor type, each
of which leads to the same equilibrium conditions. We …nd it convenient to adopt the following
framework. For each labor type, i; there is a monopoly union which represents all workers of
that type in the economy. The union sets the wage rate, Wi;t ; for that labor type, subject to
Calvo-style frictions. In particular, a randomly selected subset of 1                                           w   monopoly unions set
their wage optimally, while the complementary subset sets the wage according to:


                                 Wit =            z ;t           (       z    )1        ~ wt Wi;t 1 :


Here,   z   denotes the growth rate of zt in non-stochastic steady state. Also,

                                            target       w               1          w
                             ~ w;t          t                (       t 1)               ; 0<       w   < 1:                       (2.5)


The indexing assumptions in wage setting ensure wage-setting frictions are not distortionary
along a non-stochastic, steady state growth path.


2.1.3   Households

There is a large number of identical and competitive households. Each household contains
every type of di¤erentiate labor, hi;t ; i 2 [0; 1] : By assuming that all varieties of labor are con-
tained within the same household (this is the ‘large family’assumption introduced by David
Andolfatto (1996) and Monika Merz (1995)) we avoid confronting di¢ cult - and potentially
distracting - distributional issues. Similarly, each household also has a large number of entre-
preneurs, but we defer our discussion of these agents to the next subsection. Finally, households
are the agents who build the physical stock of capital in the economy.
   After goods production in period t; the representative household constructs end-of-period
t physical capital, Kt+1 ; using the following technology:


                           Kt+1 = (1              ) Kt + 1                         S(   I;t   It =It 1 ) It :                     (2.6)




                                                                     7
To produce new capital, the household must purchase existing capital and investment goods,
It . The quantity of existing capital available at the end of period t production is (1                                                     ) Kt ,
where 0 <             < 1 denotes the rate of depreciation on capital. In (2.6), S is an increasing and
convex function described below and                                  I;t   is a shock to the marginal e¢ ciency of investment in
producing capital. The household buys It at the price described in the previous subsection:11
       In addition, the household purchases the existing physical stock of capital for the price,
QK;t : It sells new capital for the same price. The household is competitive, so that it takes the
price of capital and investment goods as given.
       The preferences of the representative household are as follows:

According to the left side of the budget constraint, the household allocates funds to consump-
tion, two types of bonds, investment and existing capital. The household’s sources of funds are
the earnings from di¤erentiated labor and bonds, as well as the revenues from selling physical
capital. Finally,             t   represents various lump sum payments. These include pro…ts from inter-
mediate goods, transfers from entrepreneurs (discussed in the next subsection) and lump sum
transfers from the government, net of lump sum transfers. Wages of di¤erentiated labor, Wi;t ;
are set by the monopoly unions as discussed in the previous section. In addition, the household
agrees to supply whatever labor of each type that is demanded at the union-set wage rate. So,
the household treats labor income as exogenous.
                                                                                                                c         l
       In (2.8), the tax rates on consumption and wage income,                                                      and       ; are exogenous and
constant. The revenues from these taxes are refunded to households in the form of lump sum
taxes via        t:   The object, Bt+1 denotes one-period bonds that pay a gross nominal return, Rt ,
  11
    The speci…cation of the production function for new capital in (2.6) is often used in DSGE models in
part because it improves their …t to aggregate data (see, e.g., CEE). Microeconomic evidence that also sup-
ports a speci…cation like (2.6) includes Janice Eberly and Sergio Rebelo (2012), Kiminori Matsuyama (1984),
and Robert Topel and Sherwin Rosen (1988). Papers that provide interesting theoretical foundations which
rationalize (2.6) as a reduced form speci…cation include Lucca (2006) and Matsuyama (1984).

which is not contingent on the realized period t + 1 state of nature. In addition, we give the
                                                 L
household access to a long term (10 year) bond, Bt+40 : These pay gross return, RtL ; in period
t + 40; at a quarterly rate. The nominal return on the long term bond purchased in period
t, RtL ; is known at time t: As discussed in the next section, the one period bond is the source
of funding for entrepreneurs and plays a critical role in the economics of the model. The long
term bond plays no direct role in resource allocation and the market for this bond clears at
 L
Bt+40 = 0: We include this bond because it allows us to diagnose the model’s implications for
the slope of the term structure of interest rates.
                                                                                                     L
       The representative household’s problem in period t is to choose Ct ; Kt+1 ; Kt ; It ; Bt+1 ; Bt+40 :
It makes this choice for each date with the objective of maximizing (2.7) subject to (2.8).


2.2        Financial Frictions

Each of the identical households in the economy has a large number of entrepreneurs.12 After
production in period t entrepreneurs receive loans from mutual funds. At this time, the state
of an entrepreneur is summarized by his net worth, N                       0. The density of entrepreneurs
with net worth, N; is denoted ft (N ) and we denote the total net worth in the hands of all
entrepreneurs at this point by                    Z    1
                                         Nt+1 =            N ft (N ) dN:                                (2.9)
                                                   0

We refer to an entrepreneur with net worth N as an N type entrepreneur. Each N type
entrepreneur purchases physical capital using his own net worth and a loan and converts
physical capital into e¤ective capital services. In period t + 1 each N type entrepreneur
earns income by supplying capital services and from capital gains; he then repays his loan
and transfers funds between himself and his household. At this point, each entrepreneur’s net
worth in period t + 1 is determined. Each entrepreneur then acquires a new loan and the cycle
continues. All markets visited by entrepreneurs are competitive.
       The general ‡ow of funds in …nancial markets is indicated in Figure 1. Households are the
source of funds to entrepreneurs. The most straightforward interpretation of our entrepreneurs
is that they are …rms in the non-…nancial business sector. However, it is also possible to
interpret entrepreneurs as …nancial …rms that are risky because they hold a non-diversi…ed
portfolio of loans to risky non-…nancial businesses (see the ‘bank!entrepreneur’ entries in
Figure 1).13
  12
     Although we think the GK2 large-family metaphor helps to streamline the model presentation, the equations
that characterize the equilibrium are, with one minor exception described below, the same as if we had adopted
the slightly di¤erent presentation in BGG.
  13
     We have in mind the banks in Gertler and Kiyotaki (2011). For a detailed discussion, see section 6 in


                                                       9
    The following subsection describes the details of one period in the life of an N type entre-
preneur. The subsection after that discusses the implications for the aggregates of all entre-
preneurs.


2.2.1     One Period in the Life of an Entrepreneur

                                          N
Each N type entrepreneur obtains a loan, Bt+1 ; from a mutual fund, which the entrepreneur
                                                   N
combines with N to purchase raw physical capital, Kt+1 ; in an anonymous and competitive
market at a price of QK;t . That is,

                                                 N          N
                                           QK;t Kt+1 = N + Bt+1 :


As explained in section 2.1.3, entrepreneurs purchase capital from households. Entrepreneurs
do not acquire capital from their own household.
    After purchasing capital, each N type entrepreneur experiences an idiosyncratic shock, !;
                             N                              N
which converts its capital, Kt+1 ; into e¢ ciency units, ! Kt+1 . Following BGG, we assume that
! has a unit-mean log normal distribution that is independently drawn across time and across
entrepreneurs: Denote the period t standard deviation of log ! by                  t:   The random variable,
!; captures the idiosyncratic risk in actual business ventures. For example, in the hands of
some entrepreneurs a given amount of physical capital (i.e., metal, glass and plastic) is a great
success (i.e., the Apple iPad or the Blackberry cell phone) and in other cases it is less successful
(i.e., the NeXT computer or the Blackberry Playbook). The risk shock,                     t;   characterizes the
extent of cross sectional dispersion in !. We allow             t   to vary stochastically over time and we
discuss its law of motion below.
    After observing the period t + 1 aggregate rates of return and prices, each N type entre-
preneur determines the utilization rate, uN
                                          t+1 ; of its e¤ective capital and supplies an amount of

capital services, uN      N                                                      k
                   t+1 ! Kt+1 ; for a competitive market rental rate denoted by rt+1 :

    At the end of period t + 1 production; the N type entrepreneur that experienced shock,
                            N
!; is left with (1     ) ! Kt+1 units of physical capital, after depreciation. This capital is sold in
competitive markets to households at the price, QK;t+1 : In this way, an N type entrepreneur
                                                                      k
who draws a shock, !; at the end of period t enjoys rate of return, !Rt+1 ; at t + 1, where

                       k           k                 (t+1)                                k

Christiano and Ikeda (2012). To interpret our entrepreneurs as …nancial …rms, it is necessary that there be no
agency problem between the entrepreneur and the bank, as in GK2 :




                                                     10
Here, the increasing and convex function, a; captures the idea that capital utilization is costly
(we describe this function below). We have deleted the superscript, N; from the capital utiliza-
tion rate. We do so because the only way utilization a¤ects the entrepreneur is through (2.10)
and the choice of utilization that maximizes (2.10) is evidently independent of the entrepre-
neur’s net worth: From here on, we suppose that ut+1 is set to its optimizing level, which is a
             k                       (t+1)                     k
function of rt+1 and                         Pt+1 . Finally,       in (2.10) denotes the tax rate on capital income
and we assume depreciated capital can be deducted at historical cost.
       Thus, each entrepreneur in period t, regardless of his net worth, has access to a stochastic,
                                    k
constant rate to scale technology, Rt+1 !:14 The loan obtained by an N type entrepreneur in

denotes leverage and Zt+1 is the gross nominal rate of interest on debt. Let ! t+1 denote the
value of ! that divides entrepreneurs who cannot repay the interest and principal from those
that can repay. In particular,

                                                 k               N      N

    In the case where the entrepreneur is interpreted as a …nancial …rm, we can follow Gertler and Kiyotaki
                             k
(2010) in supposing that Rt+1   ! is the return on securities purchased by the …nancial …rm from a non-…nancial
                                                                                             k
…rm. The non-…nancial …rm possesses a technology that generates the rate of return, Rt+1        !; which it turns
over in full to the …nancial …rm. This interpretation requires that there be no agency costs in the …nancial/non-
…nancial …irm relationship.




                                                                   11

! t+1 :
       Before describing equilibrium in the market for loans, we discuss the mutual funds. It is
convenient (though it involves no loss of generality) to imagine that mutual funds specialize
in lending to entrepreneurs with speci…c levels of net worth, N: Each of the identical N type
mutual funds holds a large portfolio of loans that is perfectly diversi…ed across N type en-
                               N
trepreneurs. To extend loans, Bt+1 per entrepreneur, the representative N type mutual fund
        N
issues Bt+1 in deposits to households at the competitively determined nominal interest rate,
Rt : As discussed in section 2.1.3, this rate is assumed not to be contingent on the realization of
date t + 1 uncertainty. We assume that mutual funds do not have access in period t to period
t + 1 state-contingent markets for funds, outside of their debt contracts with entrepreneurs.
As a result, the funds received in each period t + 1 state of nature must be no less than the
funds paid to households in that state of nature. That is, the following cash constraint
                                                       Z   ! t+1
                                  N                                          k            N      N

must be satis…ed in each period t + 1 state of nature. The object on the left of the equality
in (2.13) is the return, per entrepreneur, on revenues received by the mutual fund from its
entrepreneurs. The …rst term on the left indicates revenues received from the fraction of
entrepreneurs with !            ! t+1 and the second term corresponds to revenues obtained from
bankrupt entrepreneurs. The latter revenues are net of mutual funds’monitoring costs, which
take the form of …nal goods and correspond to the proportion, ; of the assets of bankrupt
entrepreneurs. The left term in (2.13) also cannot be strictly greater than the term on the
right in any period t + 1 state of nature because in that case mutual funds would make positive
pro…ts and this is incompatible in equilibrium with free entry.16 Thus, free entry and the cash
constraint in (2.13) jointly imply that (2.13) must hold as a strict equality in every state of
                                                                                N
nature. Using this fact and rearranging (2.13) after substituting out for Zt+1 Bt+1 using (2.11),
we obtain:
                                                                          Lt 1 Rt

                                                                            Lt Rt+1

     BGG show that t (!) is strictly increasing and concave, 0        t (!)   1; lim!!1 t (!) = 1, and t (0) = 0:
  16
     In an alternative market arrangement, mutual funds in period t interact with households via two types
of …nancial instrument. One corresponds to the non state contingent deposits discussed in the text. Another
is a …nancial instrument in which payments are contingent on the period t + 1 state of nature. Under this
complete market arrangement a mutual fund has a single zero pro…t condition in period t: Using equilibrium
state-contingent prices, that zero pro…t condition corresponds to the requirement that the period t expectation
of the left side of (2.13) equals the right side of (2.13). The market arrangement described in the text is the one
implemented in BGG and we have not explored the complete markets arrangement described in this footnote.



                                                               12
in each period t + 1 state of nature.
         The (! t+1 ; Lt ) combinations which satisfy (2.14) de…ne a menu of state t + 1 contingent
standard debt contracts o¤ered to entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs select the contract that maxi-
mizes their objective, (2.12). Since N does not appear in the constraint and only as a constant
of proportionality in the objective, it follows that all entrepreneurs select the same (! t+1 ; Lt )
regardless of their net worth.
         After entrepreneurs have sold their undepreciated capital, collected capital rental receipts
and settled their obligations to their mutual fund at the end of period t + 1; a random fraction,
1          t+1 ;   of each entrepreneur’s assets is transferred to their household. The complementary
fraction,           t+1 ;   remains in the hands of the entrepreneurs. In addition, each entrepreneur
                                e                                                                                  e
receives a lump sum transfer, Wt+1 ; from the household: The objects,                                  t+1   and Wt+1 ; are
exogenous.
         A more elaborate model would clarify why the transfer of funds back and forth between
households and their entrepreneurs is exogenous and not responsive to economic conditions.
In any case it is clear that, given our assumptions, the larger is the net worth of a household’s
entrepreneurs, the greater are the resources available to the household. This is why it is in
the interests of the representative household to instruct each of its entrepreneurs to maximize
expected net worth. By the law of large numbers, this is how the household maximizes the
aggregate net worth of all its entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs comply with their household’s
request in exchange for perfect consumption insurance.17


2.2.2         Implications for Aggregates

The quantity of physical capital purchased by entrepreneurs in period t must equal the quantity
produced, Kt+1 ; by households:
                                                            Z    1
                                                                      N
                                                   Kt+1 =            Kt+1 ft (N ) dN:                                (2.15)
                                                             0


The aggregate supply of capital services by entrepreneurs is:
                                       Z   1   Z   1
                                Kt =                   uN    N
                                                        t ! Kt ft     1   (N ) dF (!) dN = ut Kt+1 ;                 (2.16)
                                       0       0
    17
    A variety of decentralizations of the entrepreneur side of the model is possible. An alternative is the one
used in BGG, in which entrepreneurs are distinct households who maximize expected net worth as a way of
maximizing utility from consumption. In this arrangement, a fraction of entrepreneurs die in each period and
the complementary fraction are born. Dying entrepreneurs consume a fraction, ; of their net worth with
the rest being transferred in lump-sum form to households. Entrepreneurs’ motive for maximizing expected
net worth is to maximize expected end-of-life consumption. The mathematical distinction between the BGG
decentralization and the one pursued here is that BGG include entrepreneurial consumption in the resource
constraint. Since is a very small number in practice, this distinction is very small.

                                                                     13
where the last equality uses (2.15), the fact that utilization is the same for all N and that
the mean of ! is unity. Market clearing in capital services requires that the supply of capital
                                               R1
services, Kt ; equal the corresponding demand, 0 Kj;t dj; by the intermediate good producers
in section 2.1.1.
       By the law of large numbers the aggregate pro…ts of all N type entrepreneurs at the end
of period t is [1            t 1   (! t )] Rtk QK;t 1 KtN : Integrating this last expression over all N and using
(2.15) evaluated at t              1; we obtain [1                  t 1   (! t )] Rtk QK;t 1 Kt : Thus, after transfer payments,
aggregate entrepreneurial net worth at the end of period t is:


                                        Nt+1 =     t   [1           t 1   (! t )] Rtk QK;t 1 Kt + Wte :                                (2.17)


       In sum, Nt+1 ; ! t+1 and Lt can be determined by (2.14), (2.45) and an expression that
characterizes the solution to the entrepreneur’s optimization problem.18 Notably, it is possible
to solve for these aggregate variables without determining the distribution of net worth in
the cross-section of entrepreneurs, ft (N ) ; or the law of motion over time of that distribution.
By the de…nition of leverage, Lt ; these variables place a restriction on Kt+1 : This restriction
replaces the intertemporal equation in the standard model, which relates the rate of return
             k
on capital, Rt+1 ; to the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution in consumption. The
remaining two …nancial variables to determine are the aggregate quantity of debt extended to
entrepreneurs in period t; Bt+1 , and their state-contingent interest rate, Zt+1 : Note,
                     Z   1                             Z        1
                              N                                           N
            Bt+1 =           Bt+1 ft    (N ) dN =                   QK;t Kt+1       N ft (N ) dN = QK;t Kt+1                  Nt+1 ;
                     0                                      0


where the last equality uses (2.9) and (2.15): Finally, Zt+1 can be obtained by integrating
                                                           k
(2.11) relative to the density ft (N ) and solving Zt+1 = Rt+1 ! t+1 Lt :


2.3         Monetary Policy and Resource Constraint

We express the monetary authority’s policy rule directly in linearized form:

                                                                                                 1                         1 p
       Rt     R=         (Rt   1       R) + 1                        (    t+1      t)   +    y     (gy;t           ) +       ";        (2.18)
                     p                                  p
                                                                                                 4             z
                                                                                                                          400 t
  18
       The …rst order condition associated with the entrepreneur’s optimization problem is:
                                        k                0                         k
                                       Rt+1              t (! t+1 )               Rt+1
            Et [1        t (! t+1 )]        +   0 (!                                   ( t (! t+1 )        Gt (! t+1 ))   1   = 0:
                                        Rt      t    t+1 )      G0t (! t+1 )       Rt




                                                                           14
where "pt is a shock (in annual percentage points) to monetary policy and                                 p   is a smoothing
parameter in the policy rule. Here, Rt         R is the deviation of the net quarterly interest rate,
Rt ; from its steady state value. Similarly,       t+1           t    is the deviation of anticipated quarterly
in‡ation from the central bank’s in‡ation target. The expression, gy;t                                z   is quarterly GDP
growth, in deviation from its steady state.
   We complete the description of the model with a statement of the resource constraint:

                                                            It                            t
                              Yt = Dt + Gt + Ct +           t
                                                                      + a (ut )               Kt ;
                                                                 ;t


where the last term on the right represents the aggregate capital utilization costs of entrepre-
neurs, an expression that makes use of (2.15) and the fact that each entrepreneur sets the same
rate of utilization on capital, ut : Also, Dt is the aggregate resources used for monitoring by
mutual funds:
                                                                      QK;t 1 Kt
                                    Dt = G(! t ) 1 + Rtk                        :
                                                                        Pt
Finally, Gt denotes government consumption, which we model as


                                                Gt = zt gt ;                                                          (2.19)


where gt is a stationary stochastic process. We adopt the usual sequence of markets equilibrium
concept.


2.4    Adjustment Costs, Shocks, Information and Model Perturba-
       tions

Our speci…cation of the adjustment cost function for investment is as follows:

                          1n   hp                   i      h p                                    i    o
                 S(xt ) =   exp S 00 (xt          x) + exp    S 00 (xt                          x)    2 ;
                          2

where xt     I;t It =It 1   and x denotes the steady state value of xt : Note that S (x) = S 0 (x) = 0
and S 00 (x) = S 00 ; where S 00 denotes a parameter to be estimated. The value of the parameter,
S 00 ; has no impact on the model steady state, but it does a¤ect dynamics. Also, the utilization
adjustment cost function is:

                                                                                  1
                                   a (u) = rk [exp (   a (u           1))   1]        ;
                                                                                  a




                                                       15
where        a   > 0 and rk is the steady state rental rate of capital in the model. This function is
designed so that utilization is unity in steady state, independent of the value of the parameter,
 a.

       We now turn to the shocks in the model. We include a measurement error shock on the
long term interest rate, RtL : In particular, we interpret

                                                40                40
                                         RtL           ~ tL
                                                     = R                 t+1           t+40 ;



where        t   is an exogenous measurement error shock. The object, RtL , denotes the long-term
                                  ~ tL denotes the long-term interest rate in the data. If in the
interest rate in the model, while R
empirical analysis we …nd that           t
                                                                                                  ~ tL , then
                                             accounts for only a small portion of the variance in R
we infer that the model’s implications for the long term rate are good.
       The model we estimate includes 12 aggregate shocks:                                t;    t,     zt ,   f t,   t,   c;t ,     ;t ,   I;t   ,

 t,     t,   "pt and gt . We model the log-deviation of each shock from its steady state as a …rst
order univariate autoregression. In the case of the in‡ation target shock, we simply …x the
autoregressive parameter and innovation standard deviation to                                          = 0:975 and                = 0:0001,
respectively. This representation is our way of accommodating the downward in‡ation trend
in the early part of our data set. Also, we set the …rst order autocorrelation parameter on each
of the monetary policy and equity shocks, "pt and                            t,   to zero.
       We now discuss the timing assumptions that govern when agents learn about shocks. A
standard assumption in estimated equilibrium models is that a shock’s statistical innovation
(i.e., the one-step-ahead error in forecasting the shock based on the history of its past real-
izations) becomes known to agents only at the time that the innovation is realized. Recent
research casts doubt on this assumption. For example, Alexopoulos (2011) and Valerie Ramey
(2011) use US data to document that people receive information about the date t statisti-
cal innovation in technology and government spending, respectively, before the innovation is
realized. These observations motivate us to consider the following shock representation:

                                                                              =ut
                                                          z                   }|                 {
                                  xt =       x xt    1+       0;t +    1;t   1 + ::: +       p;t p ;                                  (2.20)


where p > 0 is a parameter. In (2.20), xt is the log deviation of the shock from its nonstochastic
steady state and ut is the iid statistical innovation in xt .19 We express the variable, ut ; as a
sum of iid; mean zero random variables that are orthogonal to xt j ; j                                        1: We assume that at

and Rostagno (2010).



                                                                 16

and to         j;t   as the ‘anticipated components’of ut+j ; for j > 0: These bits of news are assumed
to have the following correlation structure:

                                                   ji jj
                                                                       E     i;t j;t
                                                   x;n     =q                                ; i; j = 0; :::; p;                   (2.21)
                                                                           2           2
                                                                   E       i;t    E    j;t


where      x;n        is a scalar, with             1        x;n       1: The subscript, n; indicates ‘news’. For the sake of
parameter parsimony, we place the following structure on the variances of the news shocks:

                                                   2         2         2               2              2          2

In sum, for a shock, xt ; with the information structure in (2.20), there are four free parameters:

 x;    x;n ;         x;0   and   x;n :   For a shock with the standard information structure in which agents
become aware of ut at time t; there are two free parameters:                                                x;     x:

      We consider several perturbations of our model in which information structure in (2.20) is
assumed for one or more of the following set of shocks: technology, monetary policy, government
spending, equity and risk shocks. As we shall see below, the model that has the highest
marginal likelihood is the one with signals on the risk shock, and so this is our ‘baseline’model
speci…cation. We also consider a version of our model that we call CEE, which does not include
…nancial frictions. Essentially, we obtain this model from our baseline model by adding an
intertemporal Euler equation corresponding to household capital accumulation and dropping
the three equations that characterize the …nancial frictions: the equation characterizing the
contract selected by entrepreneur, the equation characterizing zero pro…ts for the …nancial
intermediaries and the law of motion of entrepreneurial net worth.



3       Inference About Parameters and Model Fit
This section reviews the basic results for inference on our model. We discuss the data used
in the analysis, the posteriors for model parameter values, measures of model …t and our
speci…cation of news shocks.


3.1       Data

We use quarterly observations on 12 variables covering the period, 1985Q1-2010Q2. These
include 8 variables that are standard in empirical analyses of aggregate data: GDP, consump-


                                                                                  17
tion, investment, in‡ation, the real wage, the relative price of investment goods, hours worked
and the federal funds rate. We interpret the price of investment goods as a direct observation
        t
on          ;t .   The aggregate quantity variables are measured in real, per capita terms.20
       We also use four …nancial variables in our analysis. For our period t measure of credit, Bt+1 ;
we use data on credit to non-…nancial …rms taken from the Flow of Funds dataset constructed
by the US Federal Reserve Board.21 Our measure of the slope of the term structure, RtL                       Rt ;
is the di¤erence between the 10-year constant maturity US government bond yield and the
Federal Funds rate. Our period t indicator of entrepreneurial net worth, Nt+1 ; is the Dow
Jones Wilshire 5000 index, de‡ated by the Implicit Price De‡ator of GDP. Finally, we measure
the credit spread, Zt            Rt ; by the di¤erence between the interest rate on BAA-rated corporate
bonds and the 10 year US government bond rate.22


3.2         Priors and Posteriors for Parameters

We partition the model parameters into two sets. The …rst set contains parameters that we
simply …x a priori. Thus, the depreciation rate ; capital’s share,                  ; and the inverse of the
Frisch elasticity of labor supply          L   are …xed at 0:025, 0:4 and 1; respectively. We set the mean
growth rate,          z,   of the unit root technology shock and the quarterly rate of investment-speci…c
technological change,             , to 0:41% and 0:42%; respectively. We chose these values to ensure
that the model steady state is consistent with the mean growth rate of per capita GDP in our
sample, as well as the average rate of decline in the price of investment goods. The steady state
value of gt in (2.19) is set to ensure that the ratio of government consumption to GDP is 0:20
in steady state. Steady state in‡ation is …xed at 2:4 percent on an annual basis. The household
discount rate, ; is …xed at 0:9987: There are no natural units for the measurement of hours
worked in the model, and so we arbitrarily set             L   so that hours worked is unity in steady state.
  20
      GDP is de‡ated by its implicit price de‡ator; real household consumption is the sum of household purchases
of nondurable goods and services, each de‡ated by their own implicit price de‡ator; investment is the sum of
gross private domestic investment plus household purchases of durable goods, each de‡ated by their own price
de‡ator. The aggregate labor input is an index of nonfarm business hours of all persons. These variables are
converted to per capita terms by dividing by the population over 16. (Annual population data obtained from
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development were linearly interpolated to obtain quarterly
frequency.) The real wage, Wt =Pt ; is hourly compensation of all employees in nonfarm business, divided by
the GDP implicit price de‡ator, Pt : The short term risk-free interest rate, Rt ; is the 3 month average of the
daily e¤ective Federal Funds rate. In‡ation is measured as the logarithmic …rst di¤erence of the GDP de‡ator.
The relative price of investment goods, PtI =Pt = 1= t ;t ; is measured as the implicit price de‡ator for
investment goods, divided by the implicit price de‡ator for GDP.
   21
      From the ‘‡ow data’tables we take the ‘credit market instruments’components of ‘net increase in liabilities’
for nonfarm, non…nancial corporate business and nonfarm, non-corporate business.
   22
      We also considered the spread measure constructed in Gilchrist and Zakrajcek (2011). They consider each
loan obtained by each of a set of …rms taken from the COMPUSTAT database. In each case, they compare the
interest rate actually paid by the …rm with what the US government would have paid on a loan with a similar
maturity. When we repeated our empirical anlaysis using the Gilchrist-Zakrajcek spread data, we obtained
similar results.

                                                         18
Following CEE, the steady state markups in the labor market                        w   and in the product market
 f   are …xed at 1:05 and 1:2, respectively. The steady state value of the parameter controlling
the rate at which the household transfers equity from entrepreneurs to itself, 1                                 ; was set to
1-0.985. This is fairly close to the 1-0.973 value used in Bernanke, et al (1999). Our settings of
                                                                 c       l         k
the consumption, labor and capital income tax rates,                 ;       and       ; respectively, are discussed
in Christiano, Motto and Rostagno (2010, pages 79-80). These parameter values are reported
in Table 1.
     The second set of parameters to be assigned values consists of the 36 parameters listed
in Tables 2a and 2b. We study these using the Bayesian procedures surveyed in Sungbae An
and Frank Schorfheide (2005). Table 2a considers the parameters that do not pertain to the
exogenous shocks in the model. The price and wage stickiness parameters,                             p    and        w,   were
given relatively tight priors around values that imply prices and wages remain unchanged for
on average one-half and one year, respectively. The posteriors for these parameters are higher.
The relatively large value of the posterior mode on the parameter,                        a;   governing the capital
utilization cost function implies utilization ‡uctuates relatively little. In most cases, there is
a reasonable amount of information in the data about the parameters, indicated by the fact
that the standard deviation of the posterior distribution is often less than half of the standard
deviation of the prior distribution.23
     We treat the steady state probability of default, F (!) ; as a free parameter. We do this by
making the variance of log ! a function of F (!) and the other parameters of the model. The
mean of our prior distribution for F (!), 0.007, is close to the 0.0075 value used in Bernanke,
et al (1999), or the 0.0097 percent value used in Fisher (1999). The mode of the posterior
distribution is not far away, 0.0056. The mean of the prior distribution for the monitoring cost,
 ; is 0.275. This is within the range of 0:20         0:36 that Carlstrom and Fuerst (1997) defend as
empirically relevant. The mode of the posterior distribution for                       is close, 0.2149. Comparing
prior and posterior standard deviations, we see that there is a fair amount of information about
the monitoring cost in our data and somewhat less about F (!) : The steady state value of the
               p
risk shock, = V ar(log (!)); that is implied by the mode of our model parameters is 0.26.
Section 5.1 below discusses some independent evidence on the empirical plausibility of this
result for the risk shock.
     Values for the parameters of the shock processes are reported in Table 2b. The posterior
mode of the standard deviation of the unanticipated component of the shock to log                                   t,    0;t ;   is
0.07. The corresponding number associated with the anticipated components,                               i;t ;   i = 1; :::; 8;
   23
      In this remark, we implicitly approximate the posterior distribution with the Laplace approximation, which
is Normal.


                                                      19
is 0.0283. This implies that a substantial 57 percent of the variance in the statistical innovation
in log    t   is anticipated.24 The posterior mode on the correlation among signals is 0.4. Thus,
when agents receive information,             i;t ;   i = 0; :::; 8 about current and future risk, there is a
substantial correlation in news about adjacent periods, while that correlation is considerably
smaller for news about horizons three periods apart and more.25
      For the most part, the posterior modes of the autocorrelations of the shocks are quite
large. The exception is the autorcorrelation of the growth rate of the persistent component
of technology growth,        z;t :   This is nearly zero, so that log zt is roughly a random walk. For
the most part, there is substantial information in the data about the parameters of the shock
processes, as measured by the small size of the posterior standard deviation relative to the prior
standard deviation. The exception is the anticipated and unanticipated components of the risk
shock, where the standard deviation of the posterior is larger than the standard deviation of
the prior.
      Table 3 reports the steady state properties of the model, as well as the analog objects in
the data. Overall, the model and data match well. An exception is the capital output ratio,
which is a little low. In part, the relatively low stock of capital that re‡ects the e¤ects of the
…nancial frictions in the model.


3.3       Where is the News?

In our baseline model we include ‘news shocks’ on risk and not on other variables. On the
other hand, much of the news literature includes these shocks on technology and government
consumption. This section reports marginal likelihood statistics which suggest that the most
preferred shock to put news on is the risk shock.
      Consider Table 4. According to that table the (log) marginal likelihood of our baseline
model is 4563.37. When we drop signals altogether, the marginal likelihood drops a tremendous
amount, roughly 400 log points. We then consider adding news shocks to various other shocks
(keeping the news shocks o¤ of risk shocks). When we add news shocks only to the equity
shock, ; the marginal likelihood jumps substantially, but not as much as when we add news
shocks to risk. The same is true when we add news shocks to the monetary policy shock and to
all our technology shocks. When we add news shock to government consumption shocks, the
marginal likelihood actually drops a little. Overall, the analysis favors the use of news shocks,

      In particular,

but most prefers adding them to risk, as in our baseline speci…cation.



4       The Risk Shock
Our main …nding in this paper is that the risk shock is a key driver of the business cycle. We
begin this section by describing various quantitative indicators of the importance of the shock.
We then discuss what it is about our model and data that explains our …nding. Finally, we
show what shocks are displaced with the introduction of the risk shock.


4.1       Measuring the Importance of the Risk Shock

Consider …rst the results in Figure 2. The solid line in panel a displays the year over year growth
rate in per capita, real US gross domestic product (GDP) for our sample. An interpretation of
this line is that it is the result of simulating our model’s response to all of the estimated shocks
and to the initial conditions. The dotted line shows the result of this same simulation when
we only feed our model the estimated risk shock, including its unanticipated and anticipated
components. The notable feature of panel a is how close the dotted and solid lines are to
each other. According to the results, the decline in GDP growth associated with the 2001
recession is closely associated with the risk shock. The 2007 recession is somewhat di¤erent.
The initial phase of that recession seems to have been driven by factors other than the risk
shock. However, according to the results the accelerated collapse in economic activity that
occurred in late 2008 was largely due to an increase in risk at that time. Not coincidentally,
this is also the time when the credit spread increased sharply (see panel f). The remaining
panels in Figure 2 indicate that the risk shock is even more closely associated with aggregate
…nancial variables than it is with aggregate output. Thus, panel b shows that the risk shock
alone accounts for a large portion of the ‡uctuations in the log level of per capita, real equity.
Panel c shows that a very large part of the movements in the year over year growth rate in
real per capita credit are accounted for by the risk shock. Panel d indicates that the risk shock
accounts for a substantial component of the ‡uctuations in the slope of the term structure of
interest rates. Panel e shows that the risk shock accounts for a very large part of the movements
in the credit spread. In sum, the risk shock accounts for a large part of the movements of the
key variables in our data set.
      To gain additional insight into the results in panel e, panel f displays the estimated risk
shock and our measure of the credit spread.26 Note that although the risk shock,                      t;   and
 26
      The estimated risk shock was obtained by applying the Kalman smoother and our model with its parameters


                                                      21
the credit spread are positively related, they are by no means perfectly correlated. This is so,
despite the result in panel e which shows that when we feed only the estimated anticipated and
unanticipated innovations in           t   to the baseline model, the resulting simulated credit spread
tracks the corresponding empirical measure very closely. In e¤ect, the position taken by the
model is that the credit spread is a complicated dynamic function of the signals about the risk
shock,    t;   and not just a simple function of the        t   itself.
    Our …nal indicator of the importance of risk shocks appears in Table 5. That table reports
the percent of the variance in the level of several variables at business cycle frequencies, con-
tributed by our shocks.27 This is done for several speci…cations of our model. The entries in
the …rst column of panels have a format, xjyjz; where x; y and z each denote the percent of
business cycle variance due to various components of the innovations to risk. The variable,
x pertains to both anticipated and unanticipated components,                   0;t ; :::; 8;t ;   y pertains to the
                                  0
unanticipated component,          t;   and z pertains to the anticipated component,                 1;t ; :::; 8;t :   The
sum, x + y + z; does not always add to unity because there is a small amount of correla-
tion between the shocks (see (2.21)). In each case, the model is evaluated at the mode of its
parameters, computed using the dataset indicated in the …rst column.
    Consider the results in the …rst row of each panel, which correspond to our baseline model
with the values of the parameters set at their posterior mode (subsequent rows are considered
later). The …rst column of panels pertains to the risk shock. Consistent with the evidence in
Panel a of Figure 2, over 60 percent of the business cycle variance in output is accounted for
by the risk shock. Indeed, the risk shock is by far more important for GDP than are any of the
other shocks. Again, consistent with the …ndings in Figure 2, the risk shock also plays a big
role in the business cycle ‡uctuations of …nancial variables, namely the level of the log of the
real value of each of the stock market (‘Equity’), the premium (‘Premium’), credit (‘Credit’)
and the slope of the term structure (‘Slope’). Interestingly, the risk shock makes the linear
term structure model of interest rates look good, because our term premium shock (i.e., the
‘error’in the linear term structure) only accounts for 7 percent of the ‡uctuations in the term
structure. The other rows in each panel of Table 5 provide some insight into why the risk
shock is so important, and these are discussed later.
evaluated at their posterior mode, to the data. The risk variable reported in the …gure is ( t      )= :
  27
     We compute the variance of the (log) levels of the variables in the frequency domain, leaving o¤ frequencies
lower than the business cycle.




                                                       22
4.2     Why is the Risk Shock So Important?

The simple answer to the question in the title is that when fed to our model, the risk shock
generates responses that resemble the business cycle. One way that we show this is by studying
our model’s impulse responses to disturbances in risk. In principle, model impulse responses
point to another way to evaluate a model, namely by comparing them to analogous objects esti-
mated using minimally restricted vector autoregressions (VAR). However, the model developed
here implies that standard methods for identifying VARs do not work.28 These considerations
motivate us to also consider a second type of evidence, one based on the implications of risk
shocks for the dynamic cross-correlations of aggregate output with various macroeconomic
variables. Finally, we ask which variables in our dataset account for the pre-eminence of the
risk shock over other variables.


4.2.1    Impulse Response Functions

As stressed in the introduction, the economic intuition underlying the response of the model
to a jump in the risk shock is simple. With a rise in risk, the probability of a low ! increases
and banks raise the interest rate charged on loans to entrepreneurs to cover the resulting
costs. Entrepreneurs respond by borrowing less, so that credit drops. With fewer …nancial
resources, entrepreneurs purchase less capital, which has the consequence that investment is
lower. The drop in investment leads to a fall in output and consumption. The reasons for the
drop in consumption may not be obvious at …rst, so we discuss this in detail below. The fall in
investment produces a fall in the price of capital, which reduces the net worth of entrepreneurs
and this magni…es the impact of the jump in risk through standard accelerator e¤ects. The
decline in economic output leads to a fall in costs and thus in‡ation is reduced. The decline
in credit is smaller in percent terms than the decline in net worth, because in these dynamic
responses there is a partially o¤setting e¤ect on credit. In particular, when the price of capital
drops there is an expectation that it will return to steady state. Other things the same, the
resulting higher prospective return on capital raises credit. The net impact of all these e¤ects
  28
     The results in Figure 5 (e) and in Table 3 suggest that the risk shock and the credit spread are very
similar. This might tempt one to pursue a standard identi…cation strategy to obtain an empirical estimate of
the impulse response function of macroeconomic variables to risk shocks. This strategy would interpret one-step-
ahead forecast errors in the interest rate spread computed using a limited list of standard aggregate variables
as shocks to t that are unexpected by economic agents. Under this interpretation, the estimated dynamic
responses in economic variables to the one-step-ahead forecast error in the interest rate spread would constitute
an empirical estimate of the model’s impulse response to risk shocks. But, this standard identi…cation strategy
is not justi…ed in our framework because of our assumption that components of the one-step-ahead forecast
error in risk are anticipated as much as two years in advance. Ramey (2011) in particular has emphasized
how the standard identi…cation strategy leads to distorted inference when agents receive advance news about
one-step-ahead forecast errors. See also Olivier Blanchard, Jean-Paul L’Huillier and Guido Lorenzoni (2012).

on credit is negative. However, this reasoning explains why credit falls less than net worth, in
percent terms. For a more detailed discussion of these observations, see the technical appendix,
section C.
       Figure 3 displays the dynamic response of various variables to an unanticipated shock in
risk (i.e.,        0;t ;   solid line) and to a 2 year-ahead anticipated shock (i.e.,                           8;t ;   line with circles).
(The thick solid line and thick line with circles will be discussed later.) Both shocks occur
in period 0. To simplify the interpretation of the impulse responses, each of                                                       0;0   and        8;0

are disturbed in isolation, ignoring the fact that according to our empirical analysis, these
variables are correlated. In addition, we restrict both shocks to be the same magnitude, with

 0;0   =     8;0   = 0:10.
       Panel H displays the dynamic response of                            t   to the two shocks. The response of                           t   to   8;0

is the same as the response to                   0;0 ;    except that it is displaced by 8 periods. According to Panel
A, the response of the credit spread to                         0;0   and      8;0   di¤ers in the same way that the response
in     t   to these shocks di¤ers.29 Still, the response of the credit spread is countercyclical in each
case. The dynamic responses of the other variables to                                    0;0   and to   8;0   are much more similar.
In particular, credit, investment, output and in‡ation all drop immediately and persistently
in response to both                0;0   and      8;0 :    In all these cases, the eventual response to                             8;0     exceeds
the eventual response to                 0;0 :   The slope of the term structure of interest rates, RtL                                         Rt ; is
countercyclical in response to each shock to risk. Notably, the peak response of the slope to

 8;0   is twice as big as the peak response of the slope to                               0;0 :

       Consider Panel F, which displays the response of consumption to a jump in risk. There is
perhaps a small qualitative di¤erence in the response of consumption to the                                             0;0   and     8;0   shocks.
Consumption drops immediately in response to                                   0;0   while it exhibits almost no response in the
immediate aftermath of a disturbance in                          8;0 :   Still, in both cases consumption eventually drops
sharply. We now discuss the economics of the decline in consumption in the wake of a rise in
risk.
       From the perspective of the representative household in our model, a rise in risk resembles
an increase in the tax rate on the return to investment.30 This is because as risk increases, a
  29
     Note that 0;t has a smaller impact on the period t interest rate spread than on subsequent values of the
spread. This is because the period t spread corresponds to loans extended in period t 1: Disturbances in 0;t
a¤ect t , which has a direct impact on loans extended in period t and therefore on the period t + 1 spread.
The fact that 0;t has some e¤ect on the period t spread re‡ects the state contingency in the interest rate paid
by entrepreneurs.
  30
     For a formal discussion of this point, see Christiano and Davis (2006). They show that a model like the one
in this paper is isomorphic to a real business cycle model with shocks to the tax rate on the rate of return on
capital. Christiano and Davis (2006) build on the analysis of Chari, Kehoe and McGrattan (2007), who stress
the insights one gains by mapping a given dynamic model into a real business cycle model with ‘wedges’. Chari,
Kehoe and McGrattan (2007) illustrate their point by displaying the isomorphism between a real business cycle
model with suitably constructed wedges and the model of …nancial frictions proposed by Carlstom and Fuerst


                                                                         24
larger share of the return to investment is siphoned o¤ by the monitoring costs associated with
increased bankruptcy. Of course, there is a wealth e¤ect that works in the other direction,
dragging consumption down after a rise in risk. For example, if monitoring costs absorbed
a substantial portion of output, then we would expect these wealth e¤ects to be important.
However, these wealth e¤ects play only a minor role in our model. From this perspective, one
is led to anticipate that a rise in risk induces substitution away from investment and towards
the alternatives: consumption and leisure. In particular, this intuition leads one to anticipate
that risk shocks counterfactually predict consumption is countercyclical and that they therefore
cannot be important impulses to the business cycle. So, a key challenge for understanding why
our analysis concludes risk shocks are in fact a very important source of business cycles is to
explain why the consumption response to risk shocks is procyclical.
    One way to understand the impact of risk shocks begins with the identity that total output
equals total spending. If a component of spending is reduced for some reason (say, because
of a rise in risk), then output will decline by the same amount, unless some other component
of spending on goods increases. In practice, it is desirable for other components of spending
to rise to at least partially o¤set the fall in investment because otherwise productive resources
such as capital and labor are wasted. Frictionless markets avoid this ine¢ cient outcome by
engineering a fall in the price of the goods whose demand has declined, relative to the price
of other goods. One such relative price in the present example is the price of current goods
relative to the price of future goods, i.e., the real interest rate. For example, when there is a
temporary jump in the tax on the period t+1 return to capital, then the real interest rate from
t to t + 1 drops and time t consumption rises. The market signal that encourages households
to raise consumption is a drop in the real interest rate.31
    This reasoning suggests that the dynamics of the real interest rate holds the key to under-
standing why risk shocks make consumption procyclical.32 In our model the real interest rate
(1997).
  31
     The following calculations illustrate the logic in the text. Consider an annual real business cycle model in
which the resource constraint is Ct + It         Kt0:36 h0:64
                                                         t    ; It = Kt+1 0:9Kt ; and the period utility function is
log Ct + 2:5 log (1 ht ) with h discount   factor,    =  0:97:
                                                             i The after tax rate of return on capital constructed in
                                                  0:64
period t; Kt+1 ; is (1    t )  0:36 (ht+1 =K t+1 )     + 0:9    ; where t is observed in period t; and is the tax rate
on the time t + 1 realized return on capital. Perturbations in t are a reduced form representation of shocks
to t ; according to the analysis in Christiano and Davis (2006). The revenue e¤ects of t are assumed to
be distributed in lump sum form back to households, thus eliminating wealth e¤ects associated with t : We
suppose that t = 0:9 t 1 + "t ; where "t is an iid shock. In steady state, C=Y = 0:73. We solved the model
by a standard log-linearization procedure. We set "0 = 0:01 and "t = 0 for t > 0: The shock has a substantial
negative impact on investment, which drops 16 percent in period 0. Absent a response in C0 ; output would
have fallen 2.7 percent. In fact, C0 rises by 2.7 percent so that the actual fall in output is smaller. The market
force that guides the rise in C0 is a drop in the real rate of interest.
  32
     Our discussion assumes separability between consumption and leisure in the utility function. Furlanetto
and Seneca (2011) show that consumption could fall in response to a contractionary intertemporal shock such
as a jump in risk if the marginal utility of consumption is increasing in labor.


                                                         25
is not entirely determined by market forces because the nominal rate of interest is controlled by
the monetary authority. Of course, the fact that the monetary authority controls the nominal
interest rate would be irrelevant if prices were fully ‡exible, because for the most part it is
the real interest rate that controls allocations. But, in our model prices do not adjust ‡exibly
to shocks, both because there are direct frictions in changing prices and because of inertia in
wages. As a result, the fact that the monetary authority controls the nominal rate of interest
implies that it also controls the real rate of interest. This suggests the possibility that the
response of consumption to a risk shock depends on the nature of monetary policy.
       To evaluate these ideas, Figure 4 displays the response of consumption and the real interest
rate to a positive shock in        0;0 ;   under various model perturbations. Here, we use the long-
term concept of the real interest rate.33 In both panels of Figure 4, the solid line displays
the responses in our baseline model, taken from the relevant portions of Figure 3. The lines
with circles correspond to the case of ‡exible prices and wages, i.e.,               p   =   w   = 0. Note that,
consistent with the intuition outlined above, consumption rises in the wake of a positive shock
to risk under ‡exible wages and prices. This outcome is accomplished by a greater drop in the
real rate of interest in the ‡exible wage and price case. These results suggest that if monetary
policy were to cut the interest rate more aggressively in the wake of a risk shock, consumption
would respond by rising. We veri…ed this by introducing a term,                  (   t       ), in the monetary
policy rule (recall, a variable without a subscript refers to its steady state value). In this way,
the monetary authority reduces the nominal rate of interest more sharply in response to a risk
shock than it does in our baseline speci…cation. The left panel in Figure 4 con…rms that in
this case, consumption indeed does rise in the wake of a risk shock.
       Thus, our analysis indicates that consumption is procyclical in response to risk shocks
because under our (standard) representation of monetary policy, the authorities do not cut the
interest rate very aggressively in response to a contractionary risk shock. This is so, despite
the fact that our empirical estimate of the weight on anticipated in‡ation in the policy rule,
2.4, is somewhat high relative to other estimates reported in the literature (see Table 2a).
  33
     According to the model, the period t long term real interest rate is more closely connected to period t
consumption than, for example, the one period real interest rate at period t: Our long term interest rate is the
real non-state contingent interest rate on a 10 year bond purchased in period t which pays o¤ only in period
t + 40: It is the value of rtL which solves:
                                                            40
                                              uc;t = rtL         Et uc;t+40 ;

where uc;t denotes the derivative of date t present discounted utility with respect to Ct . To see the importance
of rtL for current consumption, suppose marginal utility is a function of Ct alone and note that Et uc;t+40
does not respond to stationary shocks at time t; such as disturbances to risk. In this way the above equation
represents Ct as a function of rtL alone. In our environment, we assume habit persistence so that uc;t is not
just a function of Ct ; but the logic based on the assumption of time separable utility is nevertheless a good
guide to intuition.


                                                           26
Given that a positive shock to risk reduces in‡ation, a relatively high weight on in‡ation in the
monetary policy rule implies that the monetary authority reduces the interest rate relatively
sharply in response to such a shock. Still, the high weight assigned to in‡ation in our estimated
policy rule is not large enough to support allocations that resemble the ones that occur under
‡exible wages and prices. We have found that one must raise the weight on in‡ation to an
unrealistically high level of around 30 to support those allocations.
      The …nding that the interest rate response to risk shocks under the standard formulation
of monetary policy is too weak to support the ‡exible price and wage allocations has been
found for other shocks as well.34 Consistent with this intuition, the thick lines in Panel F of
Figure 3 show that when the weight on in‡ation in the monetary policy rule,                   ; is reduced
to 1.5, then the drop in consumption in the wake of a risk shock is stronger. The impact is
particularly noticeable for the anticipated shock,         8;0 :   The cut in the value of   does not have
an interesting impact on any of the other responses in Figure 3, and so we do not display those
in the …gure.


4.2.2      Dynamic Cross Correlations

Here, we de…ne the business cycle as the dynamic cross correlations between output and the
variables in Figure 5. Before computing the correlations in Figure 5, our data on output, credit,
investment, equity and consumption were logged and converted to year-over-year growth rates.
The grey area is a centered 95 percent con…dence interval about the empirical correlations,
which are not themselves displayed. In the …gure, ‘slope’ indicates the slope of the term
premium, RL         R; and credit spread indicates Z           R; the premium of the interest rate paid
by (non-defaulting) entrepreneurs over the risk-free rate. The circled lines in Figure 5 display
the model-implied correlations when only the risk shocks (both unanticipated and anticipated)
are activated. We emphasize two results in Figure 5. First, the dynamic correlations implied
by the model with only risk shocks resemble the correlations when all shocks are activated.
This illustrates how risk shocks are a dominant shock in the model. Second, the dynamic
correlations with only the risk shock resemble broadly the corresponding objects in the data
and in this sense, they generate what looks like a business cycle.
      Taken together the impulse response functions and cross correlation analysis quantify the
sense in which risk shocks in the model generate dynamics that resemble the business cycle.
This is the principle reason why our econometric analysis assigns such an important role in
business cycles to risk shocks.

4.2.3      Which Data Account for the Importance of the Risk Shock?

Our conclusion that the risk shock is the most important shock driving the business cycle
depends very much on the fact that we include …nancial variables in the analysis. We can see
this by examining the rows beyond the …rst one in each panel of Table 5. Those rows report
our analysis when the variable or variables in the left column are deleted from the dataset.
For example, the second row in the …rst panel reports what happens when credit is dropped
(see ‘delete credit’). Generally, the number of model parameters is invariant to which row
is considered, with two obvious exceptions. When equity is dropped from the data set, the
measurement error variance for equity drops from the set of model parameters. Similarly, when
the slope of the term structure is dropped, then the parameters governing the term structure
shock drop from the set of model parameters.
       The key thing to note is that when all …nancial variables are dropped, then the risk shock
vanishes in importance and the marginal e¢ ciency of investment shock appears to be the most
important driver of the business cycle. Thus, note that the row, ‘drop all …n. var’indicates that
risk shocks play virtually no role in ‡uctuations in output, consumption and investment. In
the absence of the …nancial variables from the dataset, the resulting model resembles, in terms
of the explanatory role of the shocks, the CEE model. In particular, the major shock driving
‡uctuations is the marginal e¢ ciency of investment shock,              I;t :   To some extent, the degree
to which the risk shock is pushed out when the …nancial variables are dropped is overstated
in Table 5. The Laplace approximation of the log marginal likelihood of the model without
…nancial variables is 3112.9. With the same dataset, we found another local maximum of the
posterior density where the Laplace approximation of the log marginal likelihood is only 6
log points lower at 3106.1. The properties of this alternative parameterization of the model
resemble those of our baseline model in that the marginal e¢ ciency of investment plays only
a modest role and the risk shock is the most important shock. For this reason, we conclude
that in the absence of …nancial variables it is hard to distinguish a parameterization of the
model in which the risk shock is important and the marginal e¢ ciency of investment is not
important, from another in which the reverse is true. When the …nancial data are introduced,
it is no longer the case that these two parameterizations are hard to distinguish.35
       According to the results in Table 5, all the …nancial variables are important for the con-
clusion that the risk shock is important. However, credit and the credit spread stand out as
  35
     Our results suggest that the posterior distribution when none of the four …nancial variables are included
is the only case where there is a local maximum near the mode. When we included some or all the …nancial
data, we never encountered a local maximum near the mode. Of course, we cannot de…nitively rule out such
alternative maxima.



                                                     28
most important. When either one of those variables are dropped individually, the role of the
risk shock decreases substantially, although not as much as when all …nancial variables are
dropped. Evidently, there are interaction e¤ects among the variables that are not apparent
when variables are dropped one at a time.


4.3     Why Do Risk Shocks Drive Out Other Intertemporal Shocks?

Our model includes three shocks that a¤ect intertemporal decisions: risk,                              t;   the marginal
e¢ ciency of investment,      I;t ;   and shocks to equity,   t:   We …nd that the risk shock is far more
important than the other two shocks. For example, according to Table 5, disturbances in                                t

account for 62 percent of the ‡uctuations in output while shocks to                        I;t   and    t   only account
for 13 and 0 percent of the business cycle component of output, respectively. We discuss the
reasons for these results below.


4.3.1   Marginal E¢ ciency of Investment Shock

Our …nding for   I;t   di¤ers sharply from results in the literature, which assign a very substantial
role in business cycles to      I;t   (see for example, Justiniano, Primiceri and Tambalotti, (2010,
2011)). We reproduced the …nding in the literature for                  I;t   by estimating the CEE model using
a version of our data set that excludes the four …nancial variables: credit, equity, the credit
spread and the term premium. The variance decomposition of the resulting model is reported
in Table 5 in square brackets. The entries corresponding to risk and equity shocks are empty,
since these shocks do not appear in the CEE model. In addition, we do not include the term
premium shock in the CEE model, so that the entry corresponding to this shock is also empty.
Consistent with …ndings reported in the literature,                It    is the most important shock driving
output in the CEE model and accounts for 39 percent of the business cycle ‡uctuations in that
variable.
   The key reason that our model prefers the risk shock over the marginal e¢ ciency of invest-
ment has to do with the information contained in our data on equity, the credit spread and
the ‡ow of credit. To see this, …rst consider Figure 6, which displays the dynamic response of
the variables in our model to several shocks. To facilitate comparison, we repeat the impulse
responses to the unanticipated component in risk,              0;0 ;      from Figure 3 (solid line). The line
with circles displays the dynamic responses to an innovation in                     It   in our model. For ease of
comparison, we have scaled this innovation so that the maximal decline in output coincides
with the maximal decline in the output response to            0;0 :      Consider Panel E, which displays the
dynamic responses in equity. Note in particular that equity is countercyclical in response to

                                                      29
the innovation in     It :   Evidently, the marginal e¢ ciency of investment shock has the strongly
counterfactual implication that the value of equity is countercyclical. This stands in sharp
contrast to the risk shock which, consistent with the data, implies that the value of equity is
procyclical.
       Another way to see the contrasting implications of risk versus the marginal e¢ ciency of
investment for the cyclical properties of equity appears in Figure 7. The solid lines indicate
historical observations on year over year output growth and on the real value of the stock
market. The dotted lines indicate the results of simulating the indicated model responses to
the indicated shocks. The left column of graphs reproduce the relevant portions of Figure 2.
It shows what output and equity would have been according to the estimated baseline model
if only the estimated risk shocks had been active in our sample. The right column of graphs
shows what output and equity would have been according to the estimated CEE model if
only the marginal e¢ ciency of investment had been active.36 Note that each shock accounts
well for the dynamics of output growth. However, when equity is brought into the picture,
the implications of the two perspectives on the sources of economic ‡uctuations di¤er sharply.
The risk shock accounts well for the ‡uctuations in equity. In contrast, the marginal e¢ ciency
of investment predicts stock market booms when there are busts, and busts when there are
booms.
       The intuition for these results is very simple. Consider a Marshallian cross representation
of the market for capital with the price of capital, QK;t+1 ; on the vertical axis and the quantity
of capital, Kt+1 ; on the horizontal (see Figure 8). The supply curve corresponds to the mar-
ginal cost of building capital, derived from the household’s technology for constructing capital
discussed just after (2.8). The marginal e¢ ciency of investment perturbs this supply curve.
Entrepreneurs are the source of demand for capital. This demand curve is perturbed by the
equity and risk shocks,        t   and   t;   that a¤ect the terms of entrepreneurial loan contracts with
banks. The price of capital is a major input determining entrepreneurs’net worth, Nt+1 ; which
we identify with the value of equity in the data.37 For purposes of intuition, we can think of
the price of capital and the value of equity as being the same thing.
       Now, suppose that there is a shock to the marginal e¢ ciency of investment which shifts the
supply curve to the left. The …gure indicates that the equilibrium quantity of capital decreases.
This in turn implies that fewer investment goods are purchased by the producers of capital
goods, so that there is a decline in production and employment. This explains why the                      It
  36
    In the CEE model, we proxy equity by the real price of capital, QK;t+1 =Pt .
  37
    The equation that characterizes net worth is given in (2.45). The price of capital enters that expression
via the rate of return on capital, (2.10).



                                                         30
shock implies that investment is procyclical. A similar logic reaches the conclusion that the                        t

and      t   shocks also imply procyclical investment. This intuition is consistent with the results in
Figure 6, Panel C.38 Although the demand and supply shocks have the same implications for
the cyclical properties of investment, they have opposite implications for the price of capital
and, hence, the value of equity. This explains the results in panel E of Figure 6, as well as the
results in Figure 8.
       Consider the implications of           It   for the credit spread. According to Panel A of Figure
6, the marginal e¢ ciency of investment predicts, counterfactually, that the credit spread is
procylical. In addition, according to Panel B of Figure 6, the                    It   shock implies that credit rises
modestly in a contraction launched by the marginal e¢ ciency of investment shock. This, too,
is counterfactual.39


4.3.2         Equity Shock

The risk shock,           t;   also drives out equity shocks,        t   (recall the variance decomposition results
in Table 5). According to Table 5, an important variable underlying this conclusion is credit.
To gain intuition into this result, consider the dynamic response of our variables to a negative
innovation in        t:   Again, the size of the innovation is normalized so that the maximal impact on
output is the same across the three shocks displayed in Figure 6. According to Panel B, equity
and risk shocks have opposite implications for the cyclicality of credit. The reason why equity
shocks counterfactually imply countercyclical credit is explored in detail in Appendix C of the
online appendix. The idea is that a drop in                    t;   by reducing the net worth of entrepreneurs,
causes a drop in the demand for capital at the end of period t (panel E of Figure 6 shows the
response of net worth to a decline in                t ).   Because the price of capital is expected to return
back up to steady state over time, the period t drop in the price of capital triggers a jump
in the expected return to capital. This can be seen in panel H, which shows the immediate
drop in the excess return to capital, 1 + Rtk = (1 + Rt 1 ) ; in period t as the price of period t
capital drops, followed by a persistently high excess return. The jump in the expected return
on capital causes entrepreneurs to receive more credit in period t: Although credit expands, it
does not expand by enough to o¤set the initial decline in net worth that causes the contraction

     The dynamic responses to an innovation in t are displayed with the curve indicated by *’s and the equity
innovation has been scaled so that the maximal decline in output coincides with the maximal decline in output
in response to a risk shock.
  39
     Note from Panel F that consumption is countercyclical in the …rst two years after a It shock. However,
this failure of the model is not robust to alternative parameterizations. For example, when we reduce the
coe¢ cient on in‡ation in the interest rate rule to 1.5, then consumption falls after a It shock, for the reasons
discussed in section 4.2.1 above.

5        Various Measures of Model Out-of-Sample Performance
The key …nding of this paper is that variations in risk are the most important impulse to
business cycles. Whether this …nding should be taken seriously depends on how seriously we
take the underlying model. In this section we o¤er a defense of the model based on various
measures of out-of-sample …t.
       We begin by examining two variables not used in our formal econometric analysis. The
…rst of these is a measure of uncertainty recently proposed by Bloom (2009). The second is
an indicator of bankruptcy rates. We use our model to project these two variables onto the
sample data used in model estimation. If our analysis overstates the importance of risk shocks
in the business cycle, then we expect the model to overstate the degree of cyclical variation
in Bloom’s measure of uncertainty and in the bankruptcy rate. We show that, in fact, the
predicted and actual degrees of cyclical variation in these two variables are very similar.
       We then turn to the Federal Reserve’s survey of senior loan o¢ cers to test another aspect
of our analysis. Our model stresses that the origins of business cycle ‡uctuations lie in cyclical
variations in the cross section dispersion of a technology shock experienced by agents in the
non-…nancial business sector. In addition, in the empirical analysis of the model we make the
assumption that the agency problems which propagate the cyclical variation in risk also lie
with non-…nancial …rms.40 Although it is the standard debt contract o¤ered by the …nancial
system that is crucial in propagating the risk shock, that role is smaller than the role assigned
to …nancial …rms in several recent studies of the 2008 …nancial crisis.41 We display evidence in
the survey of senior loan o¢ cers that lends support to the approach taken in this paper.
       Finally, we examine more conventional measures of model …t and …nd that the model
performs well on these too.


5.1       Implications for Uncertainty

In an in‡uential paper, Bloom (2009) pointed to cyclical variation in the cross-sectional stan-
dard deviation of …rm-level stock returns as evidence of the importance in business cycles of
what he called uncertainty. These data, for non-…nancial business …rms, is displayed in Figure
9a.42 In order to focus on the cyclical component of this measure of uncertainty, we also show
  40
     In section 2.2 we indicate that in principle some of our entrepreneurs could be interpreted as …nancial
…rms. However, our measure of credit in the data corresponds to borrowing by non-…nancial …rms. So, in the
empirical analysis we in e¤ect assume that our entrepreneurs are non-…nancial …rms.
  41
     See Christiano and Ikeda (2012) as well as the studies that they cite.
  42
     There are two di¤erences between the data studied by Bloom (2009) (see row 2 of his Table I) and our data.
First, the time period in our model is quarterly while the Center for Research in Securities Prices (CRSP) data
used by Bloom (2009) are monthly. To ensure comparability, we use the data constructed in Ferreira (2012)


                                                      32
its Hodrick-Prescott trend. The trend rises in the earlier portion of the data set and then
generally falls until 2007. As Bloom (2009) emphasized, this measure of uncertainty is rela-
tively high during recessions. In the 1990 and 2007 recessions it is highest near to the business
cycle trough, while in the 2001 recession it rose sharply somewhat before the recession started
(vertical grey bars indicate NBER recession periods).
    We computed the analog of Bloom’s measure of uncertainty in our model. Conditional on
the period t aggregate shocks, an entrepreneur with idiosyncratic shock ! earns the following,
as a ratio to his net worth:


                                    Rte (!)       max f0; [!              ! t ]g        Rtk Lt 1 :


Here, Lt   1   denotes leverage and Rtk is the cross-sectional average return on capital. According
to the model, Rte (!) is not a function of the entrepreneur’s level of net worth, N . The standard
deviation, std; of the entrepreneurial return on equity in a cross section which only includes
non-bankrupt entrepreneurs (i.e., those with ! > !) is:

                                                                          p
                          std (Rte (!) j! > ! t ) = Rtk Lt            1       V ar (!          ! t j! > ! t ):


Here, V ar (xjD) denotes the variance of x conditional on the event, D:43 We computed the
projection of std onto the dataset used in the formal econometric analysis of our model. The
results are displayed in Figure 9b. Although the levels and trends of the variables in panels
a and b are di¤erent, the cyclical and higher frequency movements appear more similar. The
cyclical components of the two series are compared in panel c. Note that in both the data and
the model, uncertainty is high towards the end of the 1990 and 2007 recessions. In the case of
the 2001 recession the model implies that uncertainty is high before the onset of the recession,
as in the data. We conclude that our model is reasonably consistent with a key measure of
uncertainty proposed in Bloom (2009).
which aggregates the monthly CRSP returns to quarterly returns. Second, we work speci…cally with data on
non-…nancial …rms rather than all …rms, as in Bloom (2009). This choice of data is more consistent with
our analysis, given the way we map from entrepreneurial credit and interest rate spreads into the data in
our econometric analysis. However, there would have been virtually no change to Figure 4 if we had instead
reported results based on CRSP data for non-…nancial and …nancial …rms.

     Ferreira (2012) shows that
                                                                                                                       2

                                                                 33
5.2       Implications for Bankruptcy Rates

For our second out-of-sample test of the model we use the two-sided Kalman smoother to
estimate the period t default rate, Ft       1   (! t ) ; implied by our model and compare it with the
deliquency rate on all loans extended by commercial banks.44 The results are reported in
Figure 10. Note that the default rate implied by our model rises and falls with each of the
three recessions in our sample, just like the loan delinquency rate. However, the match between
our model’s default rate and the delinquency rate is not perfect since the latter lags recessions
somewhat. Still, the two variables are reasonably similar, bearing in mind that empirical
measures of default played no role in model estimation.


5.3       Senior Loan O¢ cer Opinion Survey

Each quarter, the Federal Reserve surveys the opinions of senior loan o¢ cers at commercial
banks. We focus on a key question in this survey: "If you have tightened or eased over the
last three months, what are the reasons?" Loan o¢ cers are referred to the following seven
considerations for tightening or easing bank credit: (1) Bank capital position; (2) Liquidity
conditions in secondary markets for loans; (3) Current and expected liquidity position; (4) Less
favorable or more uncertain macroeconomic outlook; (5) Tolerance to risk; (6) Industry speci…c
developments; (7) Banks competition. For each of these 7 considerations, the respondent is
asked to report whether it was ‘Very important’, ‘Somewhat important’, or ‘Not Important’
in the decision to tighten or ease bank credit. We collected the reasons into three categories:
factors having to do with banks’own balance sheets (considerations 1, 2, 3), factors associated
with macroeconomic conditions not related to banks’balance sheets (considerations 4, 5, 6),
factors related to microeconomic conditions (consideration 7).
       We summarize respondents’ answers in Figure 11, which covers the period from the …rst
quarter of 2008 to the second quarter of 2011.45 There are potentially four bars associated
with each quarter in Figure 11. The length of the bars above the zero line indicate how many
banks reported that they were tightening credit. The length of the two bars extending below
the zero line indicate how many banks reported that they were easing credit. Evidently, in
late 2008 and early 2009 no bank was easing credit. In each quarter, the left bars summarize
the importance assigned to factors having to do with the banks’balance sheets and the right
bar summarizes the importance assigned to macro factors originating outside the banks. Each
  44
     The data were obtained from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank’s online database, FRED. The FRED
mnenomic is DRALACBS.
  45
     The survey of loan o¢ cers begins before 2008. However, the Fed did not publish how many banks responded
to each question prior to 2008.


                                                      34
bar has a black part, a grey part and a white part. The length of the black part indicates the
average number of ‘very important’responses across the three considerations in the associated
category. Similarly, the length of the grey part indicates the average number of ‘somewhat
important’responses and the length of the white part indicates the number of ‘not important
responses’. The sum of the average responses is equal to the number of banks tightening or
easing. This is why the length of the bars on the right and the left is always equal.
       The key result is that the black and grey areas extend further for the bars on the right
than for the bars on the left. That is, changing conditions outside banks’balance sheets are
relatively more important that changes in banks’own balance sheets in determining whether
banks tighten or ease credit conditions.
       We view the evidence in Figure 11 as providing some support for our choice to leave
out considerations strictly related to banks’balance sheets from the model. It is important,
however, to stress the limitations of the evidence in Figure 11. First, the evidence applies
to a relatively short subperiod of our dataset. At the same time, this evidence is perhaps
notable because it covers a period when many think problems in banks’balance sheets were
a principle reason for the business cycle contraction.46 Second, the loan o¢ cer survey only
covers a portion of the …nancial system, namely the commercial banks. What is true about the
commercial banks need not necessarily be true for …nancial …rms as a whole. Still, we regard
the evidence in Figure 11 as supportive of our model.


5.4       Conventional Out-of-Sample Measures of Fit

Figure 12 displays out-of-sample root mean square errors (RMSE’s) at forecast horizons, j =
1; 2; :::; 12 for various variables. Our …rst set of 12 forecasts is computed in 2001Q3 and our
last set of forecasts is computed in 2008Q1. We include forecasts for each of the 12 variables in
our dataset. We consider forecasts of quarterly growth rates for the variables which our model
predicts are not covariance-stationary and of levels for the variables which our model predicts
are stationary. We include two benchmark RMSE’s for comparison. The …rst benchmark
corresponds to the RMSE’s implied by a Bayesian vector autoregression (BVAR), constructed
using the procedure applied in Smets and Wouters.47 The second benchmark corresponds to
the RMSE’s implied by the version of our DSGE model labeled CEE and discussed in section
  46
    For this view, see Christiano and Ikeda (2012) and the references they cite.
  47
    In particular, we work with a …rst order vector autoregression speci…ed in levels (or, in case of the real
quantities, log levels) of all the variables. With one exception we implement the so-called Litterman priors. In
particular, for the variables that our model predicts are non-startionary, we center the priors on a unit root
speci…ation. For the variables that our model predicts are stationary, we center the priors on the …rst order
autoregressive representation with autoregressive coe¢ cient 0.8.



                                                      35
2.4. Forecasts of the BVAR are based on the posterior modes of the parameters updated each
quarter. In the case of the DSGE models, we update the parameters every other quarter. The
grey area in the …gures is centered on the RMSE’s for the BVAR. It is constructed so that if the
RMSE of our baseline model lies in the grey area for a particular variable and forecast horizon,
then the classical null hypothesis that the two RMSE’s are actually the same in population
fails to be rejected at the 95 percent level at that horizon.48
       Our baseline model’s performance is the same or better than that of the CEE model and
- in the case of variables not in the CEE model - the baseline model does about the same or
better than the BVAR, with the exception of the credit spread. In the case of in‡ation, the
baseline model does noticeably better than the CEE and BVAR models. Overall, the model
does reasonably well in terms of RMSE’s.



6          Conclusion
We started with a model that combines CEE with BGG and added the assumption that the
cross sectional standard deviation of an idiosyncratic productivity shock varies over time, as
in Christiano, Motto and Rostagno (2003). We call this cross-sectional standard deviation a
‘risk’shock. When we study US macroeconomic data over the period 1985-2010, we conclude
that the risk shock accounts for a large share of the ‡uctuations in GDP and other macro-
economic variables. It is the fact that we include …nancial variables in an otherwise standard
macroeconomic data set that allows us to di¤erentiate the risk shock from more standard
macroeconomic shocks. To evaluate the credibility of our result, we study the implications of
our model for variables not included the database used to estimate the model. In particular,
we examine the implications of the model for loan deliquency rates, for out-of-sample forecasts,
and for features of the cross-sectional dispersion of …rm-level stock returns recently stressed by
Bloom (2009) and others. We infer that the risk shock deserves to be taken seriously because
the model does well on these out-of-sample tests.
       Our analysis suggests that understanding the countercyclicality of the credit spread holds
the key for understanding business cycles. What moves the credit spread in the model is vari-
ations in risk,     t.   While these variations are exogenous in our model, endogenous ‡uctuations
in     t   would presumably also move the spread and other aggregate variables in a similar way.
To think about this further requires contemplating the possible interpretations of our …nding
about the importance of variations in        t:   One possibility is that changes in    t   re‡ect changes
  48
    The procedure we use is the one proposed in Christiano (1989). The sampling theory we use does not take
into account that the test is executed for multiple horizons.


                                                     36
in the type of investment projects favored by entrepreneurs. For example, we might expect                   t

to be determined by the proportion of investment projects that involve technologies in which
only one standard can ultimately survive (e.g., Betamax versus VHS). This proportion is pre-
sumably endogenous and ‡uctuates over time. Another possibility is that our …nding re‡ects
the e¤ects of variations in uncertainty about the level of the net worth of potential borrowers.
Though this kind of uncertainty is not literally present in our model, its economic e¤ects can
be expected to resemble those of variations in            t.   This is because increased uncertainty about
the level of net worth has the e¤ect of increasing the likelihood of adverse outcomes from the
perspective of lenders, just like an increase in      t   does. In the recent …nancial crisis uncertainty
about the net worth of borrowers shot up as potential lenders became less certain about the
market value of potential borrowers’mortgage backed securities. This increase in uncertainty
is clearly an endogenous response to the collapse in housing prices. Still, its e¤ects may be
the same as those of an increase in       t:   Understanding the mechanisms by which          t   varies over
time is an important task for research.49

With exception of panels b and f, the grey solid line is the data. Panel b is the smoothed equity data which differs from the actual data by a small
estimated measurement error. The dashed line is the result of feeding only the estimated risk shock to the model. Panel f displays the demeaned credit
spread and the risk shock (the latter expressed as a ratio to its steady state value, minus unity).
