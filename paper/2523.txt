  Some Empirical Evidence on the Production Level and Production             Cost
                Smoothing Models of Inventory Investment



                                     ABSTRACT



        The production smoothing model of inventories has long been the basic paradigm
within which empirical research on inventories has been conducted. The basic hypothesis
embedded in this model is that inventories of finished goods serve primarily to smooth
production levels in the face of fluctuating demand and convex cost functions. However
once we allow for shocks to technology and the costs of producing output firms will also use
inventories to shift production from periods in which production costs are relatively high to
periods in which production costs are relatively low. In this sense inventories can serve to
smooth production costs rather production levels. In this paper we examine the empirical
plausibility of the production level and production cost smoothing models of inventories.
Our basic strategy is to derive and contrast a set of unconditional moment restrictions
implied by these models in a way that minimizes the role of auxiliary assumptions
regarding market structure and industry demand. We find overwhelming evidence against
the productionlevel smoothing model and very little evidence against the production cost
smoothing model. We conclude that the variance of production exceeds the variance of
sales in most manufacturing industries because the production cost smoothing role of
inventories is quantitatively more important than the production level smoothing role of
inventories.

 1.   Introduction


       The production smoothing model of inventories has long been the basic paradigm
within which empirical research on inventories has been conducted. The basic hypothesis
embedded in this model is     that inventories of finished goods serve primarily to smooth
production levels in   the face of fluctuating demand and convex cost functions, In fact, the
variance of production exceeds the variance of shipments in virtually all manufacturing

industries (see for exampleBlanchard (1983), Blinder (1986a) and West (1986)).
       Broadly speaking the responses to this finding fall into one of two categories. First,
a variety of authors have modified the traditional linear quadratic production smoothing
model to allow for an "accelerator" target inventory level, which arises because it is costly

for firms to allow inventories to deviate from some fraction of actual or expected sales (see

for example Blanchard (1983), Eichenbaum (1984) and West (1986) for empirical

formulations of this accelerator inventory target level). Kahn (1987a, 1987b) formally

demonstrates that this accelerator effect can be justified by modeling the stockout
avoidance motive for inventory accumulation. Once this effect is embedded in otherwise

standard production smoothing models there is no a priori reason to expect the variance of
sales to exceed the variance of production.

       Second, a variety of authors have sought to modify   the basic production smoothing
models in ways which imply that firms hold inventories primarily to smooth production

costs rather than production levels per se. For example Remy (1987), following a
suggestion made in Blinder (1986a), argues that if imperfectly competitive firms operate in
a region of declining marginal costs, then cost minimizing firms will choose to make

production more variable than sales.
       Other authors like Eichenbaurn (1984), Maccini and Rossana (1984), Blinder

(1986b), Christiano and Eichenbaum (1987), Miron and Zeldes (1987) and West (1987)
retain the assumption of convex cost functions but convert the production level smoothing

model into a productioncost smoothing model by allowing for shocks to technology and the

costs of producing outpot. Here firms use inventories to shift production to periods in
which production costs are relatively low.    In this sense inventories serve to smooth
                                                                               an
production costs rather than levels and there is no a priori reason to expect
                                            of production and sales. The relative
unambiguous ordering between the variance
magnitudes   of these two unconditional moments will depend on all of the structural
                                                             the preferences underlying
parameters which describe agents' production possibilities,
demand for the goods in question, market structure and the laws of motion for the shocks
to demand and costs.
       It is difficult to judge the plausibility of these alternative responses based on the
                                                                             Blinder (1986b),

                                                                and Miron and Zeldes
(1983), Eichenbaum (1984), Christiano and Eichenbaum (1987)

(1987) is obtained from models which are formally over—identified. Unfortunately,
 these over—identifying restrictions are tested, they are decisively rejected.   In our view,

 these rejections ought to be interpreted with a great deal of caution, at least with respect

 to the issue of the importance of technology shocks. The models considered by Blanchard
                                            and Eichenbaum(1987) embed a host of strong

        The purpose of this paper is to examinethe empi'rical plausibilityof the production
 level and productioncost smoothingmodels of inventories. Our basic strategy is to derive

 and contrast a set of unconditional moment restrictions implied by these models in a way
 that minimizes the role of auxiliary assumption regarding market structure and industry

                                              2
 demand. Consequently we focus our analysis on the necessary conditions for cost

 minimization when firms can meet sales, at least in part, out of inventories.

         We use art empirical methodology that was suggested by Hansen (1982) and Hansen
and Singleton (1982) who show how to exploit conditional moment restrictions which

emerge from economic theory to estimate and test representative consumer models using

generalized method of moments estimators. As Garber and King (1983) have emphasized,
many applications of this methodology have assumed the absence of shocks to agents'
criterion functions. So for example, in their analyses of the intertemporal capital asset

pricing model, Hansen and Singleton (1982), Dunn and Singleton (1986), Eichenbaum and
Hansen (1988) and Eichenbaum, Hansen and Singleton (1988) do not allow for shocks to
the representative agent's preferences. Under these circumstances the economic theory

being investigated generates relationships between the data and the parameter vector of
interest which would be exact abstracting from the fact that the econometrician does not
directly observe agents' conditional expectations. The only source of error terms in these
econometric analyses is    the difference between agents' conditional expected values of
various functions of observable state variables and their ex post values. When we rule out

shocks   to firms' costs our analysis maps directly into this estimation and testing strategy.
However, when we investigate the production cost smoothing model we must modify              that
strategy to allow for the fact that while agents' observe the shocks to their cost functions,
the econometrician does not. Since the relationships which we investigate are linear in the
state variables, we are able to utilize a strategy discussed in Cumby, Huizinga and Obstfeld
(1983) and Hansen and Sargent (1982) to overcome the difficulties associated with
unobserved shocks to agents' criterion functions.

         The remainder of this paper is organized as follws. In section     2, we describe   the
technology facing firms and then, using this specification, derive relations among
inventories, sales and technology shocks. In section 3, we describe   a strategy for estimating
and testing the two versions of our model. In section 4, we discuss our data and present our

empirical results. Finally, concluding remarks are containedin section
2.      The Model


       In this section we accomplish two tasks. First, we display a simple parameterization
of the total cost function faced by firms which embodies both the production level and

production cost smoothing motive for holding inventories. We then derive a first order
condition for cost minimization which must be met in equilibrium.

         Since we wish to accommodate two different types of inventory costs that have been
considered in the literature, we assume that total inventory costs, denominated in units of

some numeraire consumption good, are given by



(2.1)     C1
               = (b/2)[S — cIJ2 +eiI + (e2/2)I,

where b, c, and e2 are nonnegative scalars,
                                            eit is a nonnegative deterministicscalar which
may depend on time while S and denote the representativefirm's time t sales and stock
of inventories at the beginning    of   time t. The last two terms in (2.1) correspond to the
inventory holding cost function adopted by Blinder (1982, 1986a, 1986b), among others.
This term reflects  the costs of storing inventories of finished goods. The term (b/2)[St —

cI]2 represents the costs associated with allowing inventories to deviate from some fixed
proportion of sales. This "accelerator"term has been used in a variety of empirical analyses

(see for example Blanchard (1983), Eichenbaum (1984), Christiano and Eichenbauni

(1986), West (1986,1987) and Remy (1987)).
         We assu.me   that the cost function,    of                can be approximated
                                              CQt producing output
by the quadratic function


               =
(2.2)    CQt       '(t)Q + (a/2)Q.

inventories emphasized by Blinder (1986a). When the scalar a is negative, the marginal

cost of producing output Is decreasing. This is the case emphasized by Remy (1987).

Finally, when               is stochastic, (22) embodies the production cost smoothing role of

inventories    considered         by Blanchard (1983), Eichenbaum (1984), Christiano arid
Eichenbaum (1987), West (1987) and Miron and Zeldes (1987).
         The firm's time t total costs are given by


(2.3)'    C = CQt               C1.

The link between production, inventories of finished goods and sales is given by,


(24)           =        +
                   St


where      denotes the first difference operator. Substituting (2.1), (22) and (2.4) into (2.3)'

we can write       C as

(2.3)     Ct
               =            +         + (a/2)[S +   ij2 + (b/2)[SItJ2 + eiI + (e2/2)I.
         Consider the problem of a firm which seeks to maximize the expected discounted

value of its profits:

where       is the time t price of the good, measured in units of the nuzneraire good and       is a

                                                                              ltl
conditional expectationsoperator,where denotes the firm's time t informationset, t 0.

Throughout we assume that              includes the values of all variables which appear in   the
model dated t—j, V j 0.
        In order to provide a complete solution to this problem we must impose strong
restrictions on the nature of market structure and industry demand (see for example
Eicheribauxn (1983)). Since we seek to minimize the role of auxiliary assumptions in our

empirical analysis we work only with the necessary condition for cost minimization. For

any given sales (and revenue) process, the first order necessary condition for cost
minimization is given by the expectational difference equation:



(2.6)   E{(l—AL)(l_AL)1t+i} =
                          —
                              ut+i/a

        Using methodsin Hansen and Sargent (1980,1981) it is straightforwardto show that
the optimal plan for   I must satisfy
(2.8)   It = Altl + a(1_A)Et[X (A0)Jvt+j]

follows that [I—A(l—bc/a)J > 0. Consequently relation (2.8) implies that is an increasing

function of current and expected future sales. This captures the notion that firms hold
inventories in order to smooth production levels in the face of fluctuating demand. Also

according to (2.8)   It depends negatively on the current value of sales. Agaln this captures
the notion that, in the presence of an increasing marginal cost function,firms would rather
meet current sales out of current inventories than increasecurrent output.
       Relation (2.8) also implies that desired inventories depend negatively on u, the
time t shock to production costs, This is because firms wish to lower production levels in
periods when marginal production costs are high. In addition        I depends positively on
current and expected future shocks to costs. This motive for inventory accumulation
reflects the fact that firms wish to build up inventories (via production) in periods when

costs are relatively low, and meet future sales out of these stocks of inventories. In this
sense inventories can serve to smooth production costs rather than production levels.

3. Testing the ProductionLevel and ProductionSmoothing Versions of the Model


        In this section we accomplish three tasks. First, we derive the set of testable

implications which the model of section 2 imposes when there are no shocks to costs.
Second, we derive the analogous restrictions which      that model imposes when the marginal
costs of production are stochastic. Finally, we show how to simultaneouslyestimate and
test both versions of the model using the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM)

procedure discussed in Hansen (1982) and Hansen and Singleton (1982).


                      Estimating The ProductionLevel Smoothing Model


        When there are no shocks to the marginal cost of production, relation (26) can be
written as,


(31)    Et{(l-AL)(1_AflL)It+i +S1 _(1_bcfa)St//3_eit/afi}= 0.

(3.2)   X1 = ['+ 't

(3.3)         = {J3,,bc/a}.



With this notationrelation(3.1) can   be   written as

                                     to model these trends as polynomial functions of
empirical inventory literature has been
time and apply the models to detrended data. It is possible to justify this practice in our
context given the the linearity of (3.1). To see this suppose that inventories and sales do in
fact have trends which are deterministic polynomial functions of time. Let the superscript
  and    S denote the time t demeaned and detrended value of      and S, respectively. Then

(3.1) can be written as


(3.1)'    Et{(1_AL)(l_1L)I+i                   l—bc/a)S/ + g(t)_e1/a} = 0,

where g(t) is  a deterministic function of time. Suppose we assume g(t)       eitfa.
Alternatively we could allow    to be a nonstochastic function of time. Then we could
impose  the assumption that g(t) equals eit/a/l pius a linear function of v. Either of these
restrictions amount to assuming that the observable state variables in the system inherit
the trend properties of the unobserved exogenous shocks to the system. This type of
assumption has been extensively used in maximum liklihood analyses of linear rational
expectationsmodels (see for example Sargent (1978)). Under this (untestable) assumption,
relation (3.1)' implies that the estimation methodology discussed above can be applied to
detrended (and demeaned) inventory and sales data.



                      Estimating The Production Cost Smoothing Model


         Consider now the situation in which we do not impose the a priori restriction that
the cost function is deterministic. To see the nature of the problem that emerges here
suppose for the moment that the shock to marginal costs,     u, is serially uncorrelated over
time. Then (2.6) can be written as:


                                                                          =

Then the random variable

does

implied by the production level smoothing model summarizedby (3.7) do not hold for any
version of the production cost smoothing model. The previous argument also shows                        that
the presence of any stochastic measurement error in
                                                                I or St will overturncondition(3.7).

to derive moment restrictions analogous to those given by (3.7) for the production cost

smoothing model. In our empirical analysis we proceedas in Eichenbaum(1984), Blinder
(1986b) and Christiano and Eichenbaum (1987), among others, and assume that                         has the

It is convenient to write (3.17) as

obtain

According to (3.21) kt+i is orthogonalto any random variable in       t'1tI'   Consequently any

element of      can be used as an instrumentin estimating a0.
       More generally, if    followed an AR(q) process, p(L)ut =         then the random

variable kt÷j = p(L)H(Xt+i,c0) would be orthogonal to         Thus the presenceof shocks

to technology systematicallychange the nature of the set of variables which can be used as
 legitimateinstruments in the estimation procedure.
        Absent any restrictions on the time series process for      it is not in general possible
 to use          and    as instruments for any finite value of j. Under these circumstances, the

analyst must use as instruments variables which are plausibly argued to be uncorrelated
with all current and lagged values of the cost shocks. (See for example Remy (1987) who
uses current and lagged values of aggregate militarr expenditures in her empirical

analysis.)
         Proceeding as before we define the R dimensional function


                            T
(3.22)    gT() = (1/T)[Zt_1 •

Unlike the disturbance term in      the estimation equation for the productionlevel smoothing
model the random variable              is not serially uncorrelated. However, it follows from
                                 kt+i
(3.20) and the restrictions
                                        = 0 and         = 0 V t 0, that

Consequently,



(3.25)       Y0    k=_l(t+k_1t+1)(t+k_1t+k+1

Again we can estimate Y0 by replacing the           the population moments in (3.25) by their


                                                  15
sample analog moments evaluated     at 5T   Using the same arguments as we made for the

production cost smoothing model we can rationalize applying our estimation strategy            to
demeaned and detrended inventory and sales data.

        The estimation strategy discussed above also gives rise to    a   straightforward test of
the production level and production cost smoothing models. Hansen (1982) shows tbat the
minimized value of the GMM criterion function,      T'    is asymptotically distributed as a

chi—square random variable    with degrees of freedom    equal   to the   difference between the

total   number   of unconditional moment restrictions and the number of        coordinates   in c.
This fact oan be exploited to test the over—identifying restrictions imposed by the two
models.

4.   Empirical Results


           The models discussed in sections   2   and 3 were stimated and tested using monthly
sales and inventory data from aggregate nondurables manufacturingand the six (two digit

SIC) industries identified by Beisely (1969) as being of the production to stock type
Tobacco Rubber, Food, Petroleum, Chemicals and AppareL The data on inventories and

sales were obtained from the Department of Commerce and cover                 the period 1959:5 —
1984:12.    The inventory data are end of month inventoriesof finished goods, adjusted by the
Bureau of Economic Analysis from the book value reported by firms in constant dollars

The data were also adjusted using a procedure suggested by West (1983) which ensures

that inventories and shipments are measured in comparable units. Unfortunately,
seasonally unadjusted data on inventories and sales are not available. Miron and Zeldes

(1987) suggest an approximateprocedure for reinsertingthe seasonal factors back into the
data. They find, however, that their results are quite insensitive to this correction.
Consequently, we proceeded as much of the empirical literature does and used seasonally

adjusted data which were demeaned and detrended using a second order polynomial
function of time..
           In implementing the estimation procedure discussed in section       3   to the production
level smoothingmodel we specified the instrument vector Z to be:



(4.1)      Z = [1, S_ It_j      j = 1,21


In addition we set       3 a priori equal to .995. With five unconditionalmoment restrictions
and a two dimensional parameter vector, the             statistic is asymptotically distributed as a

chi—square        with three degrees of freedom. We report our results in the right hand column
of Tables through 4 labelled Production Level Smoothing Model", A number of results
              1

are worth mentioning. First, and perhaps most importantly, there is overwhelming


                                                   17
evidence against the over—identifying restrictions implied by                    the production level
smoothing model. For every industry these can be rejected                 at even the .001 significance
level. In light of these results, we did not re-estimate the model for specifications of
which included values of
                                  S   and
                                            't—j'
                                                    j>   2, Second, the estimated values

are quite large, although in no instance do they exceed he madmum admissible value of
                                                                                           of c =   1—bc/a



1.0. Third, with the exception of the Tobacco industry, the estimated values of A are

estimated to     be   quite large.
      To provide a behavioral interpretation for A it is convenient to show how the
standard stock adjustment model can be mapped into our framework. According to that
model inventories evolve according to



(4.2)           = (1_A)[I     1
                                  —
                                      I]
where
         I      denotes the actual or "target" stock of inventories at

parameter A governs the speed of adjustmentof actual to target inventories.
                                                                              the end of time t—1. The


     Let the target level of inventories    be the Iev. of inventories such that                1_1 =
         then   actual inventoryinvestment,               equals zero. Relation(2.8) implies that



(4.3)     I_ = a'E[E (A)JL1t+jIt] _avt/(1_A)
                                                     It]/(l—A)
                                                                 - S/(l—A).

Substituting(4.3) into (2.8) and subtracting    from both sides of the resulting equation
                                                          1_
we recover the stock equation specification for    given by (4.2). According to relation
 (4.3) the number of days to close 95% of a gap between actual and target inventoriesis



 (4.4)    T5    = —3Olog(.05)/Iog(A),

                                                         18
where 30 isthe approximate number of days in a r Dnth. TS turns out to be a useful
summary statistic of the speed with which actual inv itories adjust to their target levels.
The estimated values of     A   reported in Tables      1   t   imply that for all industries,
                                                                 4

excluding, Tobacco,   it takes more than    300   days to close 95% of the gap between actual
and target inventories. These results are implausible to say the least. Overall we conclude,
both on the basis of the formal statistical tests and the behavioral interpretations of the
estimated parameter values, that there is overwhelming evidence against the production
level smoothing model.
       In implementing the estimation procedure discussed in section 2                to the production
cost smoothing model we specified the instrument vector     to be:


(4.5)   Z = [1, S_i_ It_1_j: j =       l,2,...,Klag]


where Klag equaled 2, 3   or 4. As before we set       a priori equal to .995. With (2xKlag +1)
unconditional moment restrictions and        a three dimensional parameter vector, the
statistic is asymptotically distributed as a chi—square with (2xKlag.—2) degrees of freedom.
        We report our results in the left hand column                of Tables   1   through 4 labelled
"Production Cost Smoothing Model". First, notice that there is very little evidence against

this version of the model, While the probabilityvalues          of the   T statistics varied across the
values of Klag and industries, we cannot reject,       at the five percent significance level, the
over—identifying restrictions implied by the model in           aiy case except for the      Chemicals

industry when Klag equals    3.   In the large majority of cases we cannot reject the model at
even the 10% significance level.

        Second, while imprecisely estimated,in the large majority of cases,            the parameter a
= (1—bc/a) is estimated   to be less than than zero. In no case was            a estimated to be larger
than one. Assuming that c > 0, these estimates are consistent with decreasing marginal
costs only if we believe that b is negative, so that firms are actually rewardedfor allowing


                                                  19
inventories to deviate from (1/c)St each period.      In our view a more plausible interpretation
of the estimated values of a is that both     b and    and a are positive, i.e. marginal costs are
increasing and the accelerator effect is operative,
       Third, the parameter p is estimated quite accurately and indicates substantial serial
correlation in the stochastic component of marginal thsts. Fourth, the parameter A is

estimated quite accurately and for most industries is cnnsistent with the notion that firms
close any gap between actual and target inventories quite quickly. For example when Kiag

equals 3, the estimated values of A imply the values of T5 summarized below:




                  Nondurabies4'2   56 (37,77)

                  Tobacco4'3       41(0,77)
                  Rubber            59 (42,77)

                  Food             79 (71,88)

                  Petroleum         73 (65,81)

                  Chemicals         133 (101,181)

                  Apparel           133 (81, 195)



In all cases the point estimatesindicate that firms      close 95%   of a gap between actual and
target inventories within approximately4 months. Excluding Chemicals and Apparel this
adjustment occurs weU within three months. Overall we conclude, both on the basis of our
formal statistical tests and the behavioral interpretations of the estimated structural

parameters, that there is very little evidence against the production cost smoothing model
of inventories.

       We conclude this section by discussing an important caveat concerning our results,
namely   the power of the statistical tests used to asses the empirical plausibility of the

                                                 20
production cost smoothing model. As we indicated in       ction 3 the presence of cost shocks

(or for that matter measurement error) imples that ra dom variables which are contained
in agents' time t—-l information set but which are not contained in agents' time

information set cannot be used as instrumentsin testing and estimating the model.

       One possible interpretation of our test results is that while the production cost
smoothing is false, our test is simply not sufficiently power to detect this fact. Needless to

say this interpretation of our results cannot be ruled   ot a priori.   Given   a well specified
alternative model of inventory investment it would be possible to investigate the power of
our tests using a variety of Monte Carlo methods. Unfortunatelythere does not seem to be

any well developed alternative model of inventory investment which would violate the

optimality conditions investigated in this paper (at least if we abstract from functional
form considerations). Absent such an alternative, we take our results to be suggestive
rather than definitive.

5.   Conclusion



       In this paper we investigated the empirical plausibility of the production level and
production cost smoothing models of inventory investme4t. We find overwhelming evidence

against the former model and very little evidence against the latter model, West (1987),
working from an exactly identified model, also finds evidence that cost shocks play at least
as important a role as   demand shocks in determining the time series properties of inventory
investment. In this sense our study is complementary to his. Based on this evidence we
conclude that the variance of production exceeds the variance of sales because one of the

primary functions of inventories is to allow firms to shift production from periods in which
production costs are relativelyhigh to periods in which production costs are relatively low.
       As we noted in the introduction,a variety of authors have incorporated cost shocks

into their empiricalanalyses. Yet when those models are tested they are decisively rejected.
The results in this paper suggest that what is being rejected are subsets of the auxiliary
assumptions maintained by those authors, not the basic production cost smoothing model
of inventories. Results in Lichenbaum (1983) and Aiyagari, Eckstein and Eichenbaum

(1988) suggest that the empiricalimplications of a large class of inventory models are not

very sensitive to specification of industry structure. In our view a more promising avenue
for improving the empirical performance of fully specified empirical models of inventory
investment lies in a more careful analysis of industry demand and the impact of
measurement errors.

3   1.    In our model the shock      is perhaps best to awed as an exogenous technology or

productivity shock. Of course there are a variety of interpretations to the stochastic
component of flrms marginal costs. For example, these costs will be stochastic as long as
the prices Of factors of production, such as labor, are stochastic. In order to be consistent
with our formulation, the representative firm must view these prices parametrically.
However  it is possible to construct stochastic processes for these prices in which the
univariateinnovation, is orthogonal to lagged values of the prices, but for which it is not
the case that Ft lEt = 0.
4.1 We experimented with a variety of values of /3 between .95 and .999. We found that

our results were almost completely insensitive to the specification of /3.

4.2      Standard errors for T5 were calculated by evaluating (4,4) at values of A plus one and
minus one estimated standard errors of the corresponding point estimates of A.
4.3      For the Tobacco industry our point estimate A minus one standard error results in     a
negative number so that      T5 is undefined. Consequently we   report a value of TS equal to
zero, which is appropriate for values of A winch are arbitrarily close to zero but positive.
