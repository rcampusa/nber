                                               ABSTRACT

We find that over the period 1950-1990, US states absorbed increases in the supply of schooling due
to tighter compulsory schooling and child labor laws mostly through within-industry increases in the
schooling intensity of production. Shifts in the industry composition towards more schooling-intensive
industries played a less important role. To try and understand this finding theoretically, we consider
a free trade model with two goods/industries, two skill types, and many regions that produce a fixed
range of differentiated varieties of the same goods. We find that a calibrated version of the model can
account for shifts in schooling supply being mostly absorbed through within-industry increases in
the schooling intensity of production even if the elasticity of substitution between varieties is substantially
higher than estimates in the literature.

1    Introduction

Between 1950 and 1990, many US states tightened compulsory schooling and child labor
laws. As shown by Acemoglu and Angrist (2000), this encouraged students in the aﬀected
age range to stay in middle and high school. As a result, US states that tightened compulsory
schooling and child labor laws saw the schooling attainment of their labor force grow faster
than nationwide schooling attainment. The evidence indicates that compulsory schooling
and child labor laws were determined by social forces unrelated to future wages or past
increases in schooling (Acemoglu and Angrist, 2000; Lochner and Moretti, 2004). This has
led many researchers to treat increases in schooling attainment due to stricter compulsory
schooling and child labor laws as exogenous shifts in the supply of schooling (e.g. Acemoglu
and Angrist, 2000; Lochner and Moretti, 2004; Lleras-Muney, 2005; Oreopoulos and Page,
2006; Iranzo and Peri, 2009).
    According to the trade theories of Heckscher and Ohlin and Helpman and Krugman
(1985), an exogenous increase in the supply of schooling is absorbed through a shift in the
industry composition towards industries that use schooling more intensively (for textbook
treatments of these trade theories see Krugman et al., 2011). To see whether the increase
in US states’ schooling supply due to tighter compulsory schooling and child labor laws
was absorbed by shifts in the industry composition, we proceed in two steps. We first
decompose the increase in schooling at the state-decade level between 1950 and 1990 into
the part absorbed through shifts in the industry composition and the part absorbed through
within-industry changes in the schooling intensity of production. We then use compulsory
schooling and child labor laws as instruments for state-decade increases in schooling supply
to estimate how much of the increase in schooling supply is absorbed through shifts in
the industry composition and how much through within-industry increases in the schooling
intensity. Because compulsory school and child labor laws mainly aﬀected middle-school and
high-school students, we measure the supply of schooling as the ratio of workers with at least

                                              2
a high-school degree to workers without a high-school degree. Our instrumental-variables
estimates indicate that between 68 and 100% of the increase in the supply of schooling was
absorbed through within-industry increases in the schooling intensity and between 0 and
30% through shifts in the industry composition.
    Hence, increases in US states’ schooling supply due to tighter compulsory schooling and
child labor laws were mostly absorbed through within-industry changes in the schooling in-
tensity of production. Moreover, as shown by Ciccone and Peri (2005), these increases in
schooling supply also led to lower relative wages of workers with higher levels of schooling.
To explain these eﬀects of increases in schooling supply on relative wages, industry compo-
sition, and the schooling intensity of production within industries, we propose a model that
can be seen as a variation of the Heckscher-Ohlin or the Helpman-Krugman trade model.1
Our model aims at capturing the eﬀect of shifts in schooling supply on the schooling inten-
sity of production within industries, the industry composition, and relative wages of workers
with higher schooling when the range of imperfectly substitutable goods produced in a state
is unaﬀected by schooling supply shifts. A main diﬀerence with the standard Heckscher-
Ohlin model is that diﬀerent states produce varieties of the same good that are less than
perfect substitutes in consumption. The degree of substitutability between varieties will be
calibrated using the estimates of Broda and Weinstein (2006). A main diﬀerence with the
standard Helpman-Krugman trade model is that the range of varieties produced in each state
    1
      In the standard version of these models, exogenous increases in schooling supply would be fully absorbed
by shifts in the industry composition and neither aﬀect the schooling intensity of production within industries
nor the relative wages of workers with higher schooling. There are many ways to generate a failure of factor
price equalization (FPE) in the Heckscher-Ohlin or the Helpman-Krugman model. For example, assume that
factor proportions lie outside of the FPE set or introduce costs to international trade (e.g. Romalis, 2004).
In these scenarios, an increase in the local supply of a factor may lower its price and, as a result, some of the
increase in factor supply will be absorbed within industries. When FPE equalization fails in our framework it
is because diﬀerent regions produce a fixed range of varieties of the same good and diﬀerent varieties are less
than perfect substitutes in consumption (e.g. Armington, 1969) and workers with high and low schooling are
imperfect substitutes in production. An advantage of this framework is that it is straightforward to calibrate
and therefore allows us to assess how much of the increase in local supply will be absorbed within industries
for plausible parameter values.

is taken to be fixed.2 The two key parameters of the model are the elasticity of substitution
between varieties of the same good and the elasticity of substitution in production between
workers with diﬀerent levels of schooling. The predictions of our model are well known
in special cases. For example, when the elasticity of substitution between varieties of the
same good is infinity, increases in schooling supply are fully absorbed by shifts in industry
composition and do not aﬀect the relative wages of workers with more schooling as long as
workers with diﬀerent schooling are substitutes in production. On the other hand, increases
in schooling supply are fully absorbed by within-industry changes in the schooling intensity
and lead to lower relative wages of workers with more schooling when the elasticity of substi-
tution between varieties is zero. We find that a calibrated version of the model can account
for shifts in schooling supply being absorbed mostly through within-industry increases in
the schooling intensity of production even if the elasticity of substitution between varieties
is substantially higher than the estimates in Broda and Weinstein, as long as the elasticity
of substitution between schooling levels in production is not too low (not below 0.1).3
       While our main empirical results use compulsory schooling and child labor laws as in-
struments for changes in US states’ schooling supply, we also implement an alternative iden-
tification strategy based on Mexican immigration following Card (2001) and Lewis (2011).
This identification strategy exploits the fact that new immigrants are attracted by existing
   2
      The assumption that the number of varieties produced in a region is exogenous is the simplest way of
capturing the case where the number of varieties produced in a region does not increase with the supply
of schooling. Acemoglu and Ventura (2002) and Gancia and Epifani (2009) make a similar assumption to
explain the stability of the world income distribution and the link between trade openness and government
size respectively. The assumption that the number of varieties produced in a region is exogenous and that
varieties of the same good produced in diﬀerent countries or regions are imperfect substitutes in consumption
is sometimes referred to as the Armington (1969) assumption.
    3
      An alternative explanation for our empirical findings would be that the additional schooling induced by
compulsory schooling and child labor laws did not lead to the acquisition of the skills that typically come
with middle and high school. But Acemoglu and Angrist (2000) find that the private rate of return of the
additional schooling due to compulsory school attendance and child labor laws is quite high, between 8.1 and
11.3% for the 1950-90 period. For comparison, the OLS estimate of the private return to schooling for the
same period is 7.5%. And when Acemoglu and Angrist follow Angrist and Krueger (1991) in using quarter
of birth as an instrument for schooling, they find a private return to schooling between 6.3 and 9%. Hence,
there is no evidence that the extra schooling induced by compulsory schooling and child labor laws led to
less-than-average skill acquisition

                                                     4
immigrant communities from the same country. The approach yields a valid instrument for
the supply of schooling if the size of existing immigrant communities in a region is indepen-
dent of subsequent changes in labor demand and if immigrants and natives with the same
schooling are perfect substitutes. We adapt the identification strategy to US states over the
1950-1990 period to see how the results compare to those using compulsory schooling and
child labor laws as instruments. Overall, the two identification strategies yield similar results
for the absorption of changes in schooling supply. The Mexican-immigration instrumenta-
tion strategy yields that between 70 and 100% of the increase in the supply of schooling is
absorbed via within-industry increases in the schooling intensity and between 0 and 19% via
shifts in the industry composition. The finding that shifts in the industry composition play
a secondary role for the absorption of low-schooling immigration is consistent with Card and
Lewis (2007), Gonzalez and Ortega (2010), and Dustmann and Glitz (2011) for example.4
    Our paper relates to two main strands of literature. The first is the literature on the
eﬀect of factor supply — including the supply of schooling — on industry composition and
exports see, for example, Davis, Bradford, and Shimpo (1997), Harrigan (1997), Hanson
and Slaughter (2002), Romalis (2004), Ciccone and Papaioannou (2009), and Hendricks
(2010). Our main contribution is that we focus on changes in the supply of schooling that
are arguably exogenous (unrelated to shifts in labor demand). Our work is also related
to the labor economics literature on the adjustment of production following the inflow of
(low skilled) immigrants, see, for example, Card and Lewis (2007) and Gonzalez and Ortega
(2010). As already noted, immigrant inflows predicted by existing immigrant communities
can be used as an instrument for the supply of schooling if the size of existing communities
is independent of subsequent labor demand shifts and immigrants are perfect substitutes
    4
      It is interesting to note that the Mexican immigration instruments yield point estimates of the eﬀect
of schooling supply on the relative wages of workers with higher schooling that are similar to the estimates
using compulsory schooling and child labor laws in Ciccone and Peri (2005). But estimates are much less
precise and not statistically significant; see Appendix Table 1 for a comparison of the eﬀect of schooling
supply on the relative wages of workers with higher schooling using the diﬀerent identification strategies.

for natives with the same schooling attainment. Our empirical approach diﬀers in that our
instruments aﬀect the supply of schooling of natives. This is useful as there is some evidence
indicating that immigrants may not be perfect substitutes for natives with the same schooling
attainment (e.g. Peri and Sparber, 2009). Another diﬀerence with the immigration literature
is that our empirical work based on the compulsory schooling and child labor laws (policies)
can be seen as a policy evaluation.
    The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents our theoretical
results on skill absorption in a model with two goods/industries, two skill types, and many
regions that produce diﬀerentiated varieties of the same goods. Section 3 presents our data
and estimating equations and also explains the two identification strategies we use. Section
4 presents our empirical results. Section 5 concludes.



2     Theoretical Framework

We develop a model with two goods/industries, two types of workers, and many regions
that produce diﬀerentiated varieties of the same goods to examine under what conditions
exogenous changes in the regional skill supply are absorbed through changes in the skill
intensity within industries rather than shifts in the industry composition. The goal of the
model is to help us interpret our empirical results on the absorption of (arguably) exogenous
increases in schooling at the US state level.


2.1    Model

    Regions and labor supply The economy consists of a measure  of regions indexed by
 ∈ [0 ]. Each region is inhabited by a measure 1 of workers. There are two types of labor,
skilled and unskilled, whose region-specific supply is denoted by  and  respectively. The
ratio of skilled to unskilled labor in region  is denoted by  . Labor and goods markets are

two diﬀerent goods.5 Household preferences over the diﬀerent goods and varieties are given

    The assumption that the number of varieties produced in a region is exogenous is the simplest way of
capturing the case where the number of varieties produced in a region does not increase with the supply of
schooling. Our qualitative results would go through even if the number of varieties increased with schooling
supply as long as regions with an increase in schooling experience a fall in the relative price of the more
schooling-intensive good/industry. But calibration of such a model would be be much more diﬃcult.

   From (4) and (10) it can be seen that the industry composition  and ratio of skilled to
unskilled wage   in a region  depend on the wages and the industry composition in other
regions only through . Notice also that changes in the supply of skills in a single region do
not aﬀect  as each region is assumed to be small. Hence, the eﬀect of the regional supply
of skills on the industry composition and wage (and hence within-industry skill intensity) in
a region can be analyzed using (4) and (10) only.


2.2       Analysis

Suppose there is a (small) increase in the skilled to unskilled labor ratio  in region .
From the labor market clearing equation (4) it follows that this increase may be absorbed
through a shift in the industry composition towards the skilled-labor intensive industry or
through an increase in the skill intensity within industries. Diﬀerentiating both sides of (4)
with respect to  yields

where the first term in brackets is skill absorption through shifts in the industry composition,
   , and the second term in brackets is skill absorption through within-
industry shifts in the skill intensity,    . The question we want to examine is
how much of the skill absorption operates through shifts in the industry composition and

                                                        9
how much through within-industry changes in the skill intensity within industries.
       Our focus, as reflected in equation (11), is on shifts in the industry composition and the
within-industry skill intensity of production due to changes in the supply of skills. In general,
shifts in the industry composition and the skill intensity of production may also be due to,
for example, changes in the demand for varieties produced in diﬀerent industries or changes
in the available production technologies. See Hanson and Slaughter (2002) for a study that
also considers demand and technology shifts.


2.2.1      Examples with Analytical Solutions

We now turn to some special cases where the magnitude of    and   
in (11) can be determined analytically.


       The case of perfect substitutability among varieties As is well known, if the
varieties produced by diﬀerent regions are perfect substitutes,  → +∞, and the region is
not completely specialized in one industry, then the increase in the supply of skills at the
regional level is entirely absorbed through a shift in the industry composition towards the
more skill-intensive industry (Rybczynski, 1955). There is no eﬀect on the regional wage  
in this case and hence no within-industry change in the skill intensity,6

                                      
                                             = 1;            = 0                                    (12)
                                                  

       The case of perfect complementarity between skilled and unskilled labor in
production Another simple special case where the increase in the supply of skills is ab-
sorbed entirely through changes in the industry composition is when skilled and unskilled
labor are perfect complements in production,  = 0 while   0 In this case, the regional
   6
    This can be seen by raising both sides of (10) to the power of 1 and taking the limit  → +∞. In the
limit,  drops from the equation and (10) determines   independely of  .



                                                   10
wage   drops from (4) and changes in  are therefore fully absorbed through changes in
 .


       When varieties are imperfect substitutes A special case where the increase in the
supply of skills is absorbed entirely through changes in the skill intensity of production at the
industry level is  =   0 In this case,  drops from (10) and  is therefore independent
of   Hence, the increase in skills does not aﬀect the industry composition and must be
absorbed fully through increases in the skill intensity of production within industries,

                                    

                                                

       The case of perfect substitutability between skilled and unskilled labor in
production Another simple special case, in which the increase in the supply of skills is
absorbed entirely through changes in the skill intensity of production at the industry level,
is when skilled and unskilled labor are perfect substitutes in production, i.e.,  → +∞.


2.2.2      Numerical Simulations

Analytical solutions for skill absorption through within-industry changes in the skill intensity
and shifts in the industry composition, as defined in (11), are only available for a few values
of the elasticities of substitution  and . We therefore turn to numerical simulations for
   and    as a function of  and .


       Simulation setup We focus on symmetric regions and proceed as follows: (i) fix values
for  and ; (ii) set values for  and  based on US data; (iii) set  1 and  2 to match key
model statistics with US data; (iv) increase the skill supply in one region by 1% and examine
how much of the increase in skills is absorbed through increases in the skill intensity within
industries and how much through shifts in the industry composition.

where (16) combines (6) and (7). Within-industry skill absorption is defined in (11). Using

To obtain within-industry absorption in the symmetric equilibrium we therefore need to
calculate the elasticity of  in a region with respect to  in the region. This can be done by
calculating ()() using (14) and (15) holding  constant at the value determined
by (16). Skill absorption through shifts in the industry composition is obtained as 1 minus
(17).
      The parameters required for our calculations are , , , ,  1 , and  2 . For the elasticities
of substitution  and  we consider a range of values. The relative supply of skills, , is
calibrated to the ratio of workers with at least a high-school degree over workers without a
high-school degree in the 1980 US Census, which yields  = 3477 Calibrating the share of
expenditures of the less skill-intensive industry, , is trickier as there are many industries
  7
    We use the 5% sample from the Intergrated Public Use Microdata Sample of Census 1980 (Ruggles et
al. 2010) and only consider workers outside of the agricultural and public sector who have worked for at
least one week in the year.

                                                       12
in the data. We divide industries into two groups using the following approach: (i) we
rank industries from less to more skill intensive using data from the 1980 US Census on
the ratio of workers with a high-school degree to workers without a high-school degree by
industry; (ii) we draw a dividing line so that each of the two groups has half of the workers
with a high-school degree. We then set  equal to the expenditure share of the group of
less schooling intensive industries according to the 1984 Current Expenditure Survey, which
yields  = 0618 The share of workers without a high-school degree in the group of less
schooling-intensive industries is 0.67. We calibrate the distribution parameters  1 and  2 to:
(i) match this value with the equilibrium share of workers without a high-school degree in
the less schooling-intensive industry, ; (ii) obtain an equilibrium wage premium for workers
with a high-school degree, , of 1.3, which is the average weekly wage of workers with a high-
school degree relative to the average weekly wage of workers without a high-school degree in
the 1980 Census.


       Simulation results Estimates of the elasticity of substitution across varieties in the
same industry,  are available from Broda and Weinstein (2006). They estimate average
values of  across industries of between 6 and 11 for the 1972-2001 period. The lower value
corresponds to the level of industry detail that is closest to the industry detail available for
our empirical work; the higher values are obtained for much finer levels of industry detail.9
Our simulations focus on three diﬀerent scenarios for . In the low scenario,  is set to 3; 4;
or 5. In the baseline scenario,  is set to 6, Broda and Weinstein’s estimate corresponding
to the industry detail available for our empirical work. In the high scenario,  is set to 8;
   8
     The expenditure categories in the Current Expenditure Survey diﬀer from the Census industries. The ex-
penditure categories that correspond to the less skill-intensive industries are: household operations, tobacco,
apparel, apparel services, shelter, food, alcoholic beverages, and transportation. The expenditure categories
that correspond to the more skill-intensive industries are: household equipment, reading, entertainment,
personal care, health-care, utilities, personal insurance, and education.
   9
     To obtain clean estimates of the elasticity of substitution between two varieties of the same good, Broda
and Weinstein’s empirical framework controls for the range of other varieties available in the market. As a
result, their estimates can be interpreted as the elasticity of substitution between two varieties of the same
good when holding the range of varieties available constant.

       As far as we know, there are no estimates of the elasticity of substitution in production
between workers with low and high levels of schooling within industries,  in the literature.
The literature does however contain a variety of estimates of the elasticity of the relative wage
of workers with more schooling with respect to the supply of schooling, (  ) (  )
in our notation; see Katz and Murphy (1992), Ciccone and Peri (2005), and Caselli and
Coleman (2006) for example. As can be seen in (17),  can be inferred by combining such
estimates with estimates of the within-industry absorption of schooling,    
Our estimates below of    for US states 1950-1990 using compulsory schooling
and child labor laws as instruments for schooling are between 0.68 and 1. Ciccone and
Peri (2005) use the same identification strategy to estimate (   ) (   ) for US states
1950-1990 and obtain values between −0.57 and −0.65.10 Combining these estimates yields
values for  between 1.05 and 1.75. Our baseline values for  are therefore between 1 and 2.
But for robustness we will calibrate the model for values of  as low as 0.1 and as large as 3.
       In Figure 1 we plot the share of the schooling increase absorbed through within-industry
changes in the schooling intensity of production against  for six values of  : 01; 05; 1; 2; 25;
and 3 The values for  range from 3 to 33. It can be seen that more than 90% of the
increase in schooling is absorbed through within-industry changes in the schooling intensity
of production as long as  is greater or equal than 05. For  = 01, schooling absorption
through within-industry changes in the schooling intensity of production is around 85% for
our baseline scenario for the elasticity of substitution between varieties ( = 6) and around
50% for  equal to 33 Hence, more than half of the increase in schooling is absorbed through
within-industry changes in the schooling intensity of production as long as  stays above 01.

     Appendix Table 1 summarizes the empirical approach used by Ciccone and Peri (2005) to estimate
(   ) (   ) and their results. The table also contains estimates of (   ) (   ) using the
Mexican-immigration instruments detailed below instead of the compulsory-schooling and child-labor-law
instruments. The Mexican-immigration instruments yields a somewhat lower, and statistically insignificant,
(   ) (   ). In our theoretical framework, a lower (   ) (   ) translates into a larger value
of  and therefore more within-industry absorption of increases in schooling.

    Figure 2 zooms in on very small values of  To do so we plot the schooling increase
absorbed through within-industry changes in the schooling intensity of production against
 for three values of : 6; 14; and 33 The values for  range from 001 to 02. For our
baseline scenario ( = 6), more than 70% of the schooling increase is absorbed through
within-industry changes in the schooling intensity of production as long as  is greater than
or equal to 005. And around 50% of the schooling increase is absorbed through within-
industry changes in the schooling intensity of production even when  drops to 001. Hence,
for our baseline scenario — which corresponds to the estimate that Broda and Weinstein
(2006) obtain at a level of industry detail that is closest to the industry detail available
for our empirical work — more than half of the increase in schooling is absorbed through
within-industry changes in the schooling intensity of production as long as  stays above
001.
    Figure 3 illustrates the increase in schooling absorbed within industries for a very high
values of . As predicted by theory, the absorption of schooling through within-industry
changes in the schooling intensity tends to zero and the absorption of schooling through
changes in the industry composition tends to unity.
    Summing up, our simulations show that, if the elasticity of substitution between schooling
in each industry is not very low, shifts in the supply of schooling are largely absorbed through
changes in the schooling intensity of production within industries even if the elasticity of
substitution between varieties is high.



3       Data and Empirical Framework

Our empirical work examines the extent to which (arguably) exogenous increases in the
supply of skills in US states over the 1950-1990 period are absorbed through within-industry
changes in the skill intensity rather than shifts in the industry composition. Our data


                                              15
come from the (five) 1950—1990 decennial censuses of the US Census Integrated Public Use
Microdata Sample (Ruggles et al., 2010). We first define the most important concepts used
in our empirical work and then turn to our estimating equations and identification strategies.


3.1       Data and Definitions

       Skilled and unskilled workers We define individuals with at least a high-school
degree as skilled and those without a high-school degree as unskilled workers. This definition
is driven by two considerations. First, our main instruments for the supply of skills in US
states are state-level compulsory school attendance laws as well as child labor laws over the
1950-1990 period and these laws primarily shift the distribution of schooling in middle- and
high-school grades (see Acemoglu and Angrist, 2000). Second, a rising share of workers
with at least a high-school degree was an important aspect of the increase in US schooling
attainment over the 1950-1990 period. For instance, 60% of white males aged 21 to 59 did not
have a high-school degree in 1950. This share dropped to 50% in 1960, to 35% in 1970, and
to 22% in 1980; as of 1990, only 12% of males between 21 and 59 did not have a high-school
degree (see Ciccone and Peri, 2005).
       We focus on individuals older than 18 who worked at least one week in the year before
the Census. The quantities of labor are measured using either the number of workers or the
number of hours worked.11


       Skill absorption Denote the change of any variable  during the decade from  to
 + 10 by ∆ = +10 −  and the average value of  over the period as   Recall that 
refers to the ratio of skilled to unskilled workers and  to the share of unskilled workers. With
this notation, the change in the ratio of skilled to unskilled workers in a set of  industries
  11
    Following the literature, we calculate hours worked as the product of hours worked in a week and the
number of weeks worked and drop individuals living in group quarters as they are either institutionalized or
in the military.

in a state  over a decade, ∆  can be decomposed as,

                               X                                    X
                    ∆ =             (∆ − ∆ )  +               ∆ 
                               ∈                                   ∈
                               |              {z          }         |         {z    }
                                         ∆             ∆ 

where ∆ is the change in the share of unskilled workers in sector  of state  while ∆
is the nationwide change in the share of unskilled workers in sector . The first term on the
right-hand side of (18), ∆ , captures the absorption of skills through changes in
the state’s industry composition, while the second term, ∆  captures
changes in the industry composition that are common across states. The third term on the
right-hand side of (18), ∆ , captures the absorption of skills through changes in the
state’s skill-intensity of production, and the fourth term, ∆  changes in
the skill-intensity of production that are common across states.


   Industry employment We work with two diﬀerent industry classifications. The first
is the 2-digit standard industry classification (SIC), which results in 20 manufacturing in-
dustries and 33 industries when we follow Hanson and Slaughter (2002) and also include
agriculture, mining, business services, finance, insurance, real estate, and legal services. The
second classification is the 3-digit SIC, which results in 57 manufacturing industries and 73
industries when we include agriculture, mining, business services, finance, insurance, real
estate, and legal services.


3.2    Estimation

   Estimating equation Our main interest is in quantifying skill absorption through
within-industry changes in the skill intensity of production versus skill absorption through

                                                     17
shifts in the industry composition. Our two main estimating equations are therefore


               ∆  =  +    ∆ +                   (19)


                   ∆  =  +    ∆ +                      (20)

where ∆  and ∆  are defined in (18), and ∆ is the change in
the ratio of skilled to unskilled labor in state  over the period  to  + 10 in the  indus-
tries considered.   denote regression residuals. We also estimate analogous equation for
∆  and ∆  


   Main identification strategy The change in skills ∆ is an endogenous variable
in our framework as workers can decide to stay in school longer or move across states. We
therefore use instruments to isolate state-level shifts in the supply of skills. Our main identi-
fication strategy follows Acemoglu and Angrist (2000), who instrument changes in state-level
schooling using data on state-and year-specific compulsory school attendance and child labor
laws. The identifying assumption in our context is that changes in these laws are unrelated
to subsequent shifts in the demand for schooling. Acemoglu and Angrist explain that this as-
sumption is likely to be satisfied as changes in child labor and compulsory school attendance
laws appear to be determined by sociopolitical rather than economic forces. In particular,
they show that changes in child labor and compulsory school attendance laws aﬀected school-
ing primarily in those grades that were directly targeted, which is unlikely to be consistent
with changes in laws being driven by expected shifts in the demand for schooling in general.
In addition, Lochner and Moretti (2004) show that changes in compulsory school attendance
and child labor laws did not reflect pre-existing trends towards changes in schooling.
   Acemoglu and Angrist (2000) also show that the private rate of return of the additional
schooling due to compulsory school attendance and child labor laws is quite high, between


                                               18
8.1 and 11.3% for the 1950-1990 period. For comparison, the OLS estimate of the private
rate of return to schooling for the same period is 7.5%. And when Acemoglu and Angrist
follow Angrist and Krueger (1991) in using quarter of birth as an instrument for schooling,
they find a private return to schooling between 6.3 and 9%.
       Our implementation of the Acemoglu and Angrist instruments for state-level changes in
the supply of schooling is very close to that in Ciccone and Peri (2005).12 The information on
compulsory school attendance and child labor laws is summarized in four dummies, CL=6,
CL=9, CA=8 and CA=11, associated with each individual in our sample. The dummy
CL (with  equal to = 6 = 9) is equal to 1, and the other child-labor-law dummy is
equal to 0, if the state where the individual is likely to have lived when aged 14 had child
labor laws imposing a minimum of years of schooling that satisfies the inequality expressed
by . And the dummy CA (with  = = 8 = 11) is equal to 1, and the other
compulsory attendance dummy is equal to 0, if the state where the individual lived when
aged 14 had compulsory attendance laws imposing a minimum of years of schooling satisfying
inequality . The four dummies are aggregated across individuals within each state and year
to calculate the share of individuals for whom each of the CL=6, CL=9, CA=8 and
CA=11 dummies is equal to 1. The data do not include information on where individuals
lived when aged 14, which is why we follow Acemoglu and Angrist in assuming that, at
age 14, individuals lived in the state where they were born (state-of-birth approach). One
could construct the instrument assuming alternatively that individuals already lived in their
current state of residence when aged 14 (state-of-residence approach). This yields results
that are very similar to the state-of-birth approach (not reported but available upon request).
  12
    Several other papers have used the compulsory school attendance laws and child labor laws as an instru-
ment for schooling. For example, Lleras-Muney (2005) uses them to analyze the impact of education on adult
mortality; Oreopulos and Page (2006) use them to analyze the impact of parental education on the schooling
of children; and Iranzo and Peri (2009) use them to analyze the impact of schooling on productivity.

    An alternative identification strategy Our second identification strategy follows
the immigration literature. This literature obtains an instrument for the increase in the
supply of immigrants in a region by combining the size of existing immigrant communities
in the region with total immigration to the country. The instrument consists of the (coun-
terfactual) increase in the number of immigrants in the region if total immigration to the
country were distributed across regions in proportion to the size of existing immigrant com-
munities. This approach, usually referred to as the enclave approach, was first proposed by
Altonji and Card (1989) and has been used many times since, see Card (2001), Card and
Lewis (2007), Cortes (2008), Saiz (2008), and Lewis (2011), for example. The identification
strategy is valid under the assumption that the size of existing immigrant communities in a
region is independent of subsequent changes in labor demand in the region. If immigrants
are perfect substitutes for natives with the same schooling attainment, immigrant inflows
predicted by existing immigrant communities can also be used as an instrument for the
supply of schooling.
    To use this alternative identification strategy in our context we obtain the (counter-
factual) increase in the population share of Mexican-born in each US state for 1950-1960,
1960-1970, 1970-1980, and 1980-1990 if the number of Mexican-born had grown at the same
rate in each state since 1950. We then use this variable as an instrument for the change in
the supply of skills ∆ in (19) and (20). As Mexican immigrants had relatively low levels
of schooling, this instrument has a negative eﬀect on the supply of skills.



4     Results

    Main results Table 1 reports our results for the 1950-1990 period using the Acemoglu
and Angrist (2000) compulsory school attendance laws and child labor laws as instruments.
Recall that the supply of schooling is measured as the quantity of labor with at least a high-


                                             20
school degree relative to the quantity of labor without a high-school degree. Quantities are
the number of workers in specifications (1), (2), (5) and (6) and hours worked in specifications
(3), (4), (7) and (8). The table reports two-stage least-squares (2SLS) regressions for each of
the four components on the right-hand side of (18) on the change in the supply of schooling at
the state-decade level. All regressions include decade fixed eﬀects. The first stage regressions
include the share of individuals for whom each of the CL=6, CL=9, CA=8 and CA=11
dummies are equal to 1 as well as the CL-CA variables squared. As expected, the change in
the supply of schooling depends positively on the shares CL=9 and CA=11 and negatively
on the shares CL=6 and CA=8 in the relevant range. The first-stage F-statistics for the
exclusion of the instruments in the bottom row are greater than 10 and therefore indicate
that compulsory school attendance laws and child labor laws predict changes in the supply
of schooling.
   Columns (1) and (2) report results for 2-digit industries. The results for the 20 manu-
facturing industries in column (1) indicate that only 3% of the increase in schooling supply
is absorbed through shifts in the industry composition. Moreover, the eﬀect of the supply of
schooling ∆ on production-structure absorption ∆  is statistically insignif-
icant at the 90% confidence level. On the other hand, 78% of the increase in the supply of
schooling is absorbed through changes in the schooling intensity within industries, and the
eﬀect of schooling supply ∆ on within-industry absorption ∆  is statistically
significant at the 99.9% confidence level. The absorption through changes in the industry
composition increases to 27% in column (2) where we consider 33 2-digit industries in man-
ufacturing, agriculture, mining, business services, finance, insurance, real estate, and legal
services. Yet, the within-industry absorption of schooling remains the largest component,
with 68% of the increase in schooling supply absorbed through a higher schooling intensity
within industries. Columns (3) and (4) contain analogous results when labor quantities are
measured as hours worked instead of workers. These results indicate that 84% of the in-


                                              21
crease in schooling supply is absorbed through a higher schooling intensity of production
within manufacturing industries, and 93% of the increase in schooling supply is absorbed
through increases in the schooling intensity of production when we consider manufacturing
plus agriculture, mining, business services, finance, insurance, real estate, and legal services.
Absorption through shifts in the industry composition plays no role in both cases.
   Columns (5), (6), (7), and (8) report results for 3-digit industries. The results continue
to indicate that the increase in the supply of schooling is mostly absorbed through a higher
schooling intensity within industries, whether we consider the 57 manufacturing industries
in columns (5) and (7) or the 73 industries in manufacturing, agriculture, mining, business
services, finance, insurance, real estate, and legal services in columns (6) and (8). Between
75 and 100% of the increase in schooling supply is absorbed within industries. Absorption
through shifts in the industry composition plays no role when we measure labor quantities as
hours worked and when we consider manufacturing industries only. Only specification (6),
where labor quantities are measured as the number of workers and the industries consid-
ered include agriculture, mining, business services, finance, insurance, real estate, and legal
services, yields a non-negligible share of the increase in schooling supply absorbed through
shifts in the industry composition.
   Table 2 re-estimates the specification in Table 1 using OLS. Overall, OLS results point
into the same direction as the 2SLS results in Table 1 when it comes to the absorption
of schooling through within-industry changes in schooling intensity vis-a-vis the absorption
through shifts in the industry composition. But OLS yields that a smaller percentage of
the increase in schooling supply is absorbed through within-industry changes in schooling
intensity or shifts in the industry composition, especially at the 3-digit level. On the other
hand, and again in contrast to our 2SLS results, OLS often yields a large and statistically
significant positive eﬀect of state-decade changes in schooling ∆ on ∆  .
Recall that ∆  is the increase in the schooling intensity in each industry


                                               22
at the national level between  and  + 10 weighted by the industry composition of state  at
. Hence, if ∆ were an exogenous change in the supply of schooling between  and  + 10
there would be no reason to expect a statistically significant positive correlation between
∆ and ∆  . On the other hand, if ∆ partly reflected an increase
in schooling supply due to a greater demand for schooling in the state, then a significantly
positive correlation between ∆ and ∆  would be easy to explain. To
see this, note that ∆  can be interpreted as the increase in the demand
for schooling in states that are specialized in industries experiencing a greater increase in
the demand for schooling at the national level. Hence, the significantly positive correlation
between ∆ and ∆  can be explained by workers with higher schooling
moving to states that are specialized in industries experiencing larger increases in schooling
demand.


   Results from an alternative identification strategy Table 3 contains our results
for schooling absorption using the alternative identification strategy based on Mexican im-
migration. The first-stage regression includes a cubic function of the imputed increase in
the share of Mexican workers. As expected, the increase in the share of Mexican immigrants
depends positively on the imputed share in the relevant range. The first-stage F-statistics for
the exclusion of the instruments in the bottom row are greater than 10. Overall, the 2SLS
regressions for the four components of schooling absorption in (18) confirm that increases
in schooling supply are mostly absorbed through a within-industry increase in schooling in-
tensity rather than shifts in the industry composition. This continues to be the case when
we use a first-stage regression that is linear in the imputed increase in the share of Mexican
workers (not shown). But in this case the first-stage F-statistics fall to around 5.

5     Conclusion

We find that over the 1950-1990 period, US states absorbed increases in the supply of school-
ing due to tighter compulsory schooling and child labor laws mostly through within-industry
increases in the schooling intensity of production. Shifts in the industry composition towards
more schooling-intensive industries played a less important role. To try and understand this
finding theoretically, we consider a model with two goods/industries, two skill types, and
many regions that produce a fixed range of diﬀerentiated varieties of the same goods. We
find that if the elasticity of substitution between skills in each industry is not very low,
shifts in the supply of skills are largely absorbed through changes in the skill intensity of
production within industries even if the elasticity of substitution between varieties is high.
As a result, a calibrated version of our model can account for shifts in schooling supply being
mostly absorbed through within-industry increases in the schooling intensity of production
even if the elasticity of substitution between varieties is substantially higher than estimates
in the literature.
    US schooling attainment today is substantially higher than over the 1950-1990 period,
and the most relevant schooling attainment margin today is between high school and college
rather than between middle and high school. Hence, our results cannot be used to predict
the eﬀects of further increases in schooling on the production structure in the US. But it is
interesting to note that the US started the 1950-1990 period with close to 8 years of schooling
on average (of the population older than 25). This exceeds average years of schooling of
almost all developing countries in the year 2000 (Barro and Lee, 2010). Hence, our empirical
results should be useful for thinking about the eﬀects of additional schooling on the industry
composition and schooling intensity of production in today’s developing countries.

Note: Each cell corresponds to a different regression. The explanatory variable in each regression is the decennial change of human capital h=H/L
for 50 states plus DC over 4 decades. H indicates the labor input (employment or hours worked) of workers with at least a high school degree and
L is the labor input of workers without a high-school degree. The method of estimation is 2SLS. All regressions include decade fixed effects.
Standard errors are heteroskedasticity-robust and clustered at the state level. The first-stage regressions also include the CA-CL variables squared.
The F-statistic refers to the joint significance of all instruments. Mfct Plus includes agriculture, mining, business services, finance, insurance, real
estate, and legal services. ** indicates significance at a 1% confidence level.

Note: The results are based on the estimating equation ln(wHst/wLst)= γ * ln(Hst/Lst) +t +s +ust. We report the coefficient  in the table. State
fixed effects (s) and year fixed effects (t) control for state- and year-specific technological change. wH /wL in the regression is the ratio
between the weekly wage of more educated full-time white male workers 40 to 50 years of age and the wage of less educated full-time white
male workers 40 to 50 years of age. H, the supply of workers with more than a high-school degree is calculated in two different ways. Either as
the sum of employment of all workers with more than a high school degree (columns 1-3) or as the weighted sum of workers with a high-school
degree, workers with some college, and workers with college with weights equal to the wage of each group relative to high school graduates
(columns 4-6). L is total employment of workers without a high-school degree. See footnote 10 in the main text and Ciccone and Peri (2005)
for further details.
** indicate significant at a 5% level. Standard errors are heteroskedasticity-robust and clustered at the state level.
