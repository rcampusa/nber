the College Application Process

                                                ABSTRACT

Recent research suggests that the college application process itself prevents access. This paper reports
results from a large school-based experiment in which application assistance is incorporated into the
high school curriculum for all graduating seniors at low-transition schools. Over three workshops,
students were guided to pick programs of interest that they were eligible for, apply for real, and complete
the financial aid application. The goal was to create a college option for exiting students to make the
transition easier and more salient. On average, the program increased application rates from 64 to 78
per cent. College enrolment increased the following school year by 5.2 percentage points with virtually
all of this increase in two-year community college programs. The greatest impact was for students
who were not taking any university-track courses in high school: the application rate for these students
increased by 24 percentage points with a nine per cent increase in two-year college enrolment. A second
experiment was conducted two years later to explore several variations of the program. Offering personal
assistance without waiving application fees had a negligible or even negative impact on applications
and enrollment. Using laptops in homeroom classrooms instead of sending students to computer labs
while combining the initial 2 workshops into one full-morning session increased application rates.
However, subsequent enrollment effects were negligible. We provide some evidence consistent with
the possibility that decreased guidance in choosing eligible programs was responsible for the second-experiment's
decline in enrollment impacts.

I. Introduction



       In most school systems, the transition from Grade 7 to 8 is straightforward. Students who

complete Grade 7 are automatically enrolled in Grade 8 and can show up the following

September at the same school, confident that there will be a spot waiting for them. Even for the

transition from Grade 8 to 9, when students switch from elementary to high school, resources are

provided to make the adjustment simple. Since all students experience this transition, much of

the process has become automatic, and school staff guide students (often in class) and parents

through any remaining non-automatic choices, such as choosing courses or choosing schools

outside default catchment areas. Administrators help ensure everyone gets to the right place the

following year.

       The same cannot be said for moving from Grade 12 to college. Students who plan to

attend college must complete prerequisite courses in high school with sufficient grades to qualify

for acceptance into a program. But sufficient grades do not guarantee a spot: even qualified

students still must choose which programs and colleges to apply, complete each application and

pay application fees, and often must take standardized readiness assessment tests (like the ACT

or SAT) and write entrance essays. Those in financial need must complete an application for

federal assistance and may benefit from applying elsewhere for scholarships, awards, and

additional financing. Finally, at the end of the transition period, students must receive and accept

an offer, receive and manage financial aid, register and pay fees, choose courses, and upend their

daily routine to begin classes at their new school.

       Historically, the majority of students ended their education with high school. College

was left to a small elite, and if an exceptional student wanted to go to college, she was left to
figure things out on her own. But times have changed. Most developed countries have seen a

steady rise in the number of youth with college intentions: for example, by 2015, 70 percent of

recent high school graduates in the United States were enrolled in postsecondary education. 1

Despite this trend, the transition process from high school to college has largely remained

unchanged. Support varies greatly by school and region, with less support often in poorer

neighborhoods. 2

         Transition barriers to college and other programs are usually ignored in economics and

public policy. For decisions such as college attendance involving large, long-term costs and

benefits, the marginal costs of taking action and applying are often perceived as “too small to

matter.” However, research in behavioral economics, psychology, and neuroscience provides

clear evidence to the contrary. 3 It is in our nature to sometimes focus too much on the present,

or stick too much to routine. 4 Actions that require taking time out of our routine, that are

complex and without social support, and whose benefits are very long-term and uncertain are

tempting to put off. Stress -- for example, from lack of time or money -- exacerbates these

leanings. 5

         The FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) provides a prototypical example

of how seemingly small differences in take-up procedures can lead to differences in

participation. 6 The form contains more than 100 questions, including ones about parents' exact

  The need to save for retirement is commonly mentioned as another example. Standard models assume that
individuals are forward looking, able to forecast how much they will need to save (or that they have access to
services that help them do this), and face little difficulty following through with their plans. Simply changing the
default action (from having to opt-into pension plans to being automatically enrolled), or requiring individuals to
income, social security numbers, highest level of education, students' savings, working income

and other untaxed income. Anyone needing college aid must complete this form. Researchers

and government officials have speculated that some fail to apply and to go to college because

they are either unaware of the FAFSA, or cannot overcome its complexity or inconvenience. 7

         To test this theory, Bettinger et al. (2012) partnered with H&R Block, a large tax

preparation company that helps millions of low-income households file tax forms each year in

the United States. Much of the information needed to complete the FAFSA -- including the most

difficult to collect -- is the same information collected during a visit at H&R Block. Parents

whose income likely qualified their Grade 12 children for college aid were randomly selected

into the FAFSA assistance group. They were invited to continue to work with a tax professional

for an extra 10 minutes to receive help with the FAFSA for their child. 8 Complete or near-

complete FAFSAs were then sent home with a pre-paid envelope and instructions for the child to

sign and mail the form to the Department of Education. Parents selected into the control group

were given only a booklet about college, and parents selected into the information group were

given an outline of tuition costs at local public colleges along with the likely grant and loan aid

available if a FAFSA was filed, but were not given filing assistance.                      Grade     12    students

whose parents were assigned to the information group were no more likely to file a FAFSA or

attend college the following school year than the control group. Those assigned to the FAFSA

assistance group, however, were 16 percentage points more likely to file and 8 percentage points



make an active decisions regarding their contributions, or just simplifying the application process increases savings
significantly (Beshears et al., 2013; Carroll et al., 2009; Chetty et al., 2014).
7
  The 2005 Congressional Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance concluded that "millions of students
and adult learners who aspire to college are overwhelmed by the complexity of student aid. Uncertainty and
confusion rob them of its significant benefits. Rather than promote access, student aid often creates a series of
barriers - a gauntlet that the poorest students must run to get to college".
8
  The FAFSA study also examined impacts from offering application assistance to young adults out of school with
no more than a high school education. The assistance increased college enrollment by about 2 percentage points.
more likely to attend. They were also just as likely to attend for two years, which is notable

given that the FAFSA assistance was only provided during the transition year.

        Offering personal assistance to complete the FAFSA in this way can affect college

enrollment through several channels. The assistance increases visibility of the form and

makes parents more aware of financial aid possibilities. It reduces complexity by avoiding

the need to review detailed instructions and uncertainty around whether the form is filled

out correctly. Offering support while already at an office minimizes disruption and lowers

the opportunity cost of time. It generates reassurance and encouragement from having a

professional promote the form. The assistance also makes the FAFSA more salient, reminding

parents of the time-sensitive benefits of filling it out.

        The program examined in the FAFSA study, however, only helped with one component

of the transition to college - applying for financial aid. Applicants still had to determine which

colleges and programs to apply to. They still had to pay program application fees, register for

courses, and complete the SAT or ACT. And only children of parents visiting H&R Block who

agreed to receive $20 to participate in a study vaguely about college were affected.

        This paper presents results of an experiment motivated by the FAFSA study to explore a

more scalable program called LifeAfterHighSchool, which offered personal assistance for both

financial aid and program applications, and provided this support directly to students at low-

transition high schools (where fewer than half of graduating seniors enter college the following

school year). The first pilot of the experiment was conducted in 2011-12 across the Canadian

province of Ontario, where there are typically no additional essay or standardized test

requirements for postsecondary applications. Principals agreed to give up 3 classes over the

school year for the program. During the first class, Grade 12 students were guided through
browsing local college programs for which they would likely be accepted into, and were asked to

choose up to 5 for which they would like to keep the option to attend open. They also walked

through a simple financial aid and budget calculator to determine how they could afford to go to

college. In the second class (about three weeks later), students were guided through completing

their applications on the actual central application website, with LifeAfterHighSchool waiving

the regular application fees. In the final class, students were guided to begin an application for

government student aid. Parents were mailed and emailed instructions on how to complete the

remainder of the form.

       LifeAfterHighSchool increased the college application rate for graduating seniors from

64 to 78 percent, with most of this increase coming from 2-year college applications. College

enrollment correspondingly increased the following school year by 5.2 percentage points, and

virtually all of this increase was due to additional enrollment at 2-year colleges. The program

had similar effects for males and females, and for rural and urban schools. Its largest effects

were on graduating students who were not taking any university-track courses. The application

rate for these students increased by 24 percentage points. The 2-year college enrollment

rate for them increased by 9 percentage points..

       A second LifeAfterHighSchool experiment was conducted two years later to explore

variations on the first program setup. Offering personal assistance without waiving application

fees had a negligible or even negative impact on applications and enrollment. Offering fee

waivers and providing only instructions to school staff for how to implement the program led to

similar increases in applications and enrollment as in the first program.       Using laptops in

homeroom classrooms instead of sending students to computer labs, while simultaneously

combining the initial 2 classes into one full-morning session, increased application rates.
However, subsequent enrollment effects were negligible. We provide some evidence consistent

with the possibility that decreased guidance in choosing eligible programs was responsible for

the decline in enrollment impact. Better guidance in picking appropriate programs and waiving

application fees are clearly important conditions for providing college transition support directly

to low-transition high schools.

       The next section provides more details of the LifeAfterHighSchool program design. In

section III, we discuss actual program fidelity to the original design. Section IV describes our

data and randomized difference in differences methodology. Sections V and VI present results

from the experiment's first and second pilots respectively. We discuss results in Section VII,

placing them in context with other recent studies and discussing their implications for scaling up

given relatively low implementation costs.




II. Program Design



       The underlying goal of the LifeAfterHighSchool program was to help, during class time,

virtually all graduating seniors at low transition schools through the college application process

so that they left school in June with an offer of acceptance from a program they helped choose,

and with guaranteed financial aid. The premise was that the program would make crossing the

bridge from high school to college an easier path to take.          The program was deliberately

inclusive: all students at participating schools with at least 4 years of high school education (call

them Grade 12 students) were eligible to receive the program's application assistance. We

adopted this inclusive approach to make the program easier for schools to implement; rather than
having to target individual students on the basis of their likelihood of graduating, whole classes

could be scheduled together. The use of class time as well as the covering of application fees

minimized students' opportunity cost.      We also targeted all students regardless of their

postsecondary intentions to avoid stigmatizing students who were not on track to continue on to

college, but also to expose students at the margin to possible positive peer effects. We tried to

communicate the message that whether a student was sure she wanted to go to college or not, she

could not keep open the option to go without applying now.            Hence, the slogan of the

LifeAfterHighSchool program was 'Keep Your Options Open'.




School Selection

       The LifeAfterHighSchool pilot was funded and supported by the Ontario Ministry of

Training, Colleges, and Universities (MTCU) in partnership with the Ministry of Education.

The province of Ontario is a particularly attractive region to consider application assistance

because no additional standardized tests or essays are required to be considered for most

college and university programs. In theory, students need only identify which programs they

wish to be considered for, and agree to have their high school transcripts sent for evaluation. In

reality, students are usually invited to attend college information sessions outside class time to

learn how to navigate through the program and financial aid applications. Two centralized

application services offer websites - one for 2-year community colleges and one for 4-year

universities – for applying to virtually all programs in the province, with one fee covering up to
five applications. 9 A separate website allows students to create accounts to apply for Ontario

student aid.

         We targeted schools with the lowest college transition rates in the province, conditional

on 1) being commuting distance from a college (within 50km), 2) having at least 100 Grade 12

students recorded in 2007-08 (the latest data we had at the time of recruiting), and 3) not being

an adult or alternative education center. 126 schools, generally with under half of Grade 12

students going on to college the following year, were invited to participate for a random chance

to be offered LifeAfterHighSchool. Most of the principals responded enthusiastically, although

12 declined to participate for various reasons, including resource or timing concerns, insufficient

computer lab space, or feeling that the program was not appropriate for their particular school.

Some failed to respond in time to the offer to be in the study. A few additional schools were

dropped for budgetary reasons, leaving a total of 86 schools.

         Half of these schools were randomized to receive the program, and the other half were

assigned to the control group. In cases where there was more than one school within a district, at

least one school was assigned to the program, and at least one was assigned to the control group.

Table 1 provides descriptive means for the cohort of Grade 12 students at program and control

schools in the year prior to the program's implementation, and shows that random assignment

successfully balanced mean characteristics between the two groups. The data are from student

files from the Ministry of Education, aggregated at the school level (and described in more detail

in Section IV). In column one, Grade 12 course grades in 2010-11, weighted by student size,

averaged 64.7 percent for control schools, compared to 64.3 percent for program schools. Only

about half these students took university-level courses, which are required pre-requisites for

admission into 4-year programs. 10 Less than half applied to postsecondary programs that year,

and 30 percent subsequently enrolled by the following school year.

        Note that only 52.4 percent of the entire 2010-11 Grade 12 sample in the control group

actually graduated and left high school the following year. The main reason appears to be that

many had fewer than 21 credits at the start of the year, making it unlikely they would have

attained the 30-credit graduation requirement by the end of the year. Another reason is that some

graduates stay for another year to boost their grade average before applying to college. Since we

cannot directly help these students apply or get accepted into a program the following year,

average treatment effects with them in the sample will be smaller than without. Consequently,

we estimate treatment effects for students with at least 21 credits at the start of Grade 12, and for

students that left high school the following year (a behavior that we show that is not determined

by the treatment). In all sample specifications, background characteristics appear to be well

balanced between program and control schools, as is expected with random assignment.




The Workshops

        The LifeAfterHighSchool program included three classes, or 'workshops', each about 60

to 70 minutes in length, in which Grade 12s were directed to computer labs instead of their


10
   In Ontario, it is more difficult to enroll in university-level courses in Grade 12 for students who did not follow
academic level course progressions throughout high school. Grade 9 students choose whether to take 'applied' or
'academic' level courses, such as in English or Math. Students that successfully complete the Grade 9 academic
course may proceed to either the Grade 10 academic or the Grade 10 applied course. Those who successfully
complete the Grade 9 applied course may proceed to the Grade 10 applied course, but must successfully complete
a transfer course if they wish to proceed to the Grade 10 academic course. The Grade 10 academic and applied
courses prepare students for particular destination-related courses in Grade 11. The Grade 11 and 12 mathematics
curriculum offers preparation courses for university, college, and the workplace. These courses affect the
postsecondary programs students are eligible to apply for. Students cannot apply to university programs without
university-level courses. Students taking workplace-type courses still have 2-year community college options, but
far fewer than if they had taken college-type courses instead.
regularly scheduled classes. Schools were asked to keep students grouped together with their

regular classmates, so that each teacher could redirect their entire class to a computer lab to

participate. A key tool used in the workshops was the LifeAfterHighSchool website, which was

designed to provide students a ‘one-stop-shop’ with directed access to application websites,

informational videos, tools for identifying suitable programs for each student, and a financial aid

and budget calculator.

        The class that was most often substituted with LifeAfterHighSchool workshops was

English – an obvious choice, being the only mandatory Grade 12 course in Ontario.

Unfortunately, not all Grade 12 students were enrolled in English in the first semester, and some

had already completed the course.           Staff, therefore, tried to schedule workshops as direct

substitutes for classes as much as possible, but sometimes invited only a subset of students from

a class to attend a workshop. Make-up workshops were added when possible for students who

missed earlier ones. Schools were given the choice to have workshops administered by external

facilitators (many of whom had teaching degrees) or to deliver the program with internal staff

after receiving training. Approximately half of the treated schools chose each option.




Workshop One

        Delivery of the first workshop began in October 2011. Students were first shown a 5

minute video promoting the possible benefits of college, and describing the program. 11 The

video emphasized a variety of fields of study, especially vocational options. Students then

created a personal account using an assigned registration card. After verifying their email

11
  The introductory video can be located here: https://vimeo.com/30165296 (accessed on May 4, 2016). The
material was based, in part, on the information experiment used by Oreopoulos and Dunn (2013), which generated
increased educational aspirations, aid expectations, and interest in obtaining further college information.
addresses, students were shown a follow-up video introducing them to the first workshop. On

the LifeAfterHighSchool website, they were instructed to click on the link 'Where Would You

Go?' and enter previous Grade 11 and expected Grade 12 course marks (transcripts were

provided by facilitators in case students could not remember). The website then produced a

comprehensive list of 2- and 4-year programs at nearby colleges and universities (within 40km)

for which students likely met eligibility requirements. 12 Each program included a link to its

official website, the name of the associated college (and a link to the college’s main site), the

degree type, program requirements for eligibility, and a list of the most common occupations

associated with workers with the same degree. Students could filter or expand their list to show

programs by length (2 years or less versus more than 2 years), programs farther than 40km away,

programs based on their personalized interests, and programs that would (or would not) lead to

office-type jobs. They were asked to click on programs of possible interest and indicate their

preferred choice and other favorites in a personal folder on the web page and email it to

themselves.

        A second component of Workshop 1, for students that had time, involved exploring a

simple financial aid and budget calculator. After clicking 'How Would You Go?', students were

asked five questions that could be answered using a drop-down menus about family status,

number of siblings and number already attending college, approximate parents' income, and

whether they would live at home or in residence during college. The calculator produced a

rough estimate of the students' grant and loan eligibility, and displayed these amounts as part of

an overall monthly and annual budget specific to enrolling in the students' preferred program of


12
   Many students seemed pleasantly surprised with the variety of options listed. They may have initially associated
college mostly with a bachelor's program in Arts. Initially listing only programs for which students would likely be
accepted if they applied may have helped reduce anxiety and other challenges surrounding sorting through longer
lists. Students could relatively quickly assess which interesting programs would be worth seriously considering.
interest. Students could then modify cost and revenue assumptions to see how their overall

budget would be affected, and could then email a copy of the budget to themselves.



Workshop Two

           To allow time for students to browse possible college programs outside of class,

Workshop 2 was scheduled several weeks after Workshop 1, in November and December. 13 All

Grade 12 students were again assigned to computer labs instead of attending regularly scheduled

classes. They were shown a 5 minute video introducing the actual application process, and were

asked to log on to the LifeAfterHighSchool website and click on either a link to OCAS (the

Ontario College Application Service) for applying to 2-year community colleges or to OUAC

(the Ontario Universities' Application Centre) for 4-year universities.    The website offered

guidance and videos to help students through the process. Facilitators were also on hand to

answer questions and help out during the workshop. Like the FAFSA, many questions – such as

date of birth and address – were straightforward to answer, but other questions – such as

students' Ontario Education Number – may have required the assistance of a guidance counselor

or facilitator. Uncertainty about how to navigate through sections asking questions about work

experience (which usually students need not complete), type of program, expected start dates, or

citizenship may have also slowed students down or caused hesitation. With the facilitators’

assistance, most students were able to apply to multiple programs during the workshop.

Programs could be added, deleted, or changed until the application deadline in January (OUAC)

or February (OCAS).

           An important part of Workshop Two was the waiving of the application fee. Students

could apply for up to five community college or three university programs and bypass the
13
     Few students, however, logged into the web site between workshops.
approximately $100 fee. This component was expected be especially important to persuade

students that they had “nothing to lose” by applying, especially for those who were doubtful

about wanting to enroll in post-secondary education. The application fee could act as a

significant barrier to disadvantaged students’ learning about their actual eligibility and likelihood

of acceptance. To administer the fee waiver, students were asked to indicate on their application

an option to pay via online banking. Online banking payments were not due immediately.

Students could then copy their application number (whether the application was finalized or not)

and paste it into the 'Pay for Free' section of the LifeAfterHighSchool webpage, and not have to

pay on their own.



Workshop Three

       The third workshop took place shortly after the Ontario Student Aid Program (OSAP)

website became available in May.        This session focused on guiding students through the

financial aid application process. In the same year that the program was implemented, the

province introduced a tuition tax credit for any student with household income less than

$150,000. The application process for the credit and for the financial aid was similar, so

virtually all students at program schools could be motivated to attend Workshop 3 to keep their

financial aid options open. Parents were notified in advance through a school letter that during

the workshop their Grade 12 child would partially complete the financial aid application form,

and that their input would likely be required to enter the remaining information (such as

household income).

       Students watched a short video about college affordability and the OSAP application.

The workshop emphasized at least opening an account to start an application, and completing the
form as far as possible. Opening an account required entering a students' Social Insurance

Number (SIN). Email, snail mail, and morning announcements were used to remind students to

bring their SIN. Students that did not were sometimes given the option of sitting in on the

session and observing another student, or were told to attend a later workshop with their SIN, or

to follow-up directly with a guidance staff once they had obtained it.



Additional Support

       In cases where students did not attend a workshop or were not able to finish an

application, school counselors provided rescheduled opportunities or even one-on-one assistance

(at the counselors' discretion, and depending on time constraints). Counselors were informed of

students who had registered but not yet completed a program application and were encouraged to

follow-up, especially with those thought to benefit. Counselors at about half of the program

schools reported using active individual follow-up to help students complete applications.

       Promotional material was used to advertise LifeAfterHighSchool. Posters were displayed

at the start of the school year. Brochures describing the program and its goals were distributed to

students in advance of the workshops, and personalized letters were sent to all parents of Grade

12 students to inform them about the workshops.

       The LifeAfterHighSchool website could be accessed at any time with an account. In

addition to material for the workshops, it contained links to additional financial resources (such

as non-governmental scholarships and bursaries) and videos labelled 'True Stories' about the

experiences of other young people who had applied and registered for postsecondary education

programs across Ontario.
III. Implementation 14



           Designing and implementing the LifeAfterHighSchool program involved making

thousands of decisions. We paid attention to many small details, such as the content of each

video, the hiring and training of facilitators, the design of posters and brochures, the script used

for talking with principals and counselors, and the availability of on-site delivery and technical

support. We also took measures to block web access to social media, ensure that internet

bandwidth was sufficiently high during workshops, communicate with each schools' program

coordinator, respond to early program feedback, avoiding students applying to programs and

getting rejected, and obtain all useful data for analysis. With only one treatment arm in the first

phase of the pilot and five additional treatment arms in the second phase (discussed in Section

VI), knowing which of the other decisions mattered to the overall results is not possible. In cases

where trade-offs may have existed, priority was given to making make the college application

free, attractive, and more convenient for students at the margin of applying, while avoiding

coming across as patronizing to any student.

           Table 2 displays online workshop activity at program schools and provides some

indication of the program fidelity. Panel A shows that a total of 11,356 students at the 43

program schools in 2011-12 had taken at least 4 years of high school. Only about half began the

school year with at least 21 credits, which largely explains why only 6,950 Grade 12 students

actually completed 30 credits by the end of the year to graduate and exit grade-school education.

Panel B shows that 7,436 students created an account on the LifeAfterHighSchool website.

While this is more than the total number of graduates that left high school that year, it is far
14
     More implementation details can be found in Reuben et al., 2016a
fewer than the total number of Grade 12s who were eligible to participate in the program. There

are a few possible explanations for this less-than-full participation. Counselors may have placed

more emphasis on ensuring graduating seniors attended the workshops. There were portions of

students for whom staff believed participation would not be appropriate, including students with

learning disabilities and other special needs, and those who were in Grade 12 but who were far

short of the number of credits required to graduate. Another explanation is that some students,

when asked to move from a classroom to computer lab, went elsewhere. Others did not attend

because they were not at school on the day of their scheduled workshop.

       Conditional on creating a LifeAfterHighSchool account, participation in Workshop 1 was

relatively high. Almost 90 percent of account holders worked at the 'Where Would You Go?'

exercise and entered previous or expected grades, and almost half had time to try out the

financial aid calculator after choosing their lists of programs of interest. Most importantly, a full

three-quarters of LifeAfterHighSchool registered account holders used the site to pay for a

college application (by entering their application number).        Around half applied to 2-year

community colleges, and the other half applied to 4-year universities.

       A relatively small fraction of students in Workshop 3 emailed a parent or recorded their

financial aid application numbers on our website. These outcomes may not be representative as

indicators of overall participation because they were not required to actually complete the aid

application. Still, other feedback from the field suggests there were limitations in trying to

simplify the aid application process in class. A month delay in the launch of the online OSAP

application form created scheduling challenges and led to Workshop 3 competing with many

end-of-year activities. Guidance personnel reported that teachers were much less eager to allow

their students to miss a class to attend the workshop, and students were also reluctant to do so,
especially those who had not applied to college earlier. Students also needed to use their Social

Insurance Numbers to open an OSAP account, and – despite emails sent to LifeAfterHighSchool

account holders, letters sent to parents, and school reminders – many did not have them on hand.

Students were instead given a paper version of the application and were encouraged to complete

the form at home, or asked to follow-up with staff once they had obtained the information.

Overall, 35 percent of school coordinators said that Workshop 3 attendance of graduating Grade

12 students was higher than 80 percent, and 55 percent said that attendance levels were at least

50 percent. In comparison, 80 and 70 percent of coordinators said that Workshop 1 and 2

attendances rates were at least 80 percent, respectively.

       The overall reaction to LifeAfterHighSchool was quite positive.          We surveyed 99

counselors, principals, and vice-principals from all 43 program schools about their perceptions of

students' impressions of the program, and about their own perceptions. Respondents said that

graduating students had high levels of interest in the program. A large majority said that

graduating students found each workshop useful in helping them 1) locate a postsecondary

program to apply for, 2) apply to a postsecondary program, and 3) understand the associated

costs and benefits of postsecondary. Even for Workshop 3, 83 percent of respondents agreed

that it helped students understand and apply for financial aid. Several educators noted that

LifeAfterHighSchool had “kick-started” students’ thinking about postsecondary education,

helped them become more aware and informed about their options, and encouraged them to

explore more programs and ask many more questions. Several respondents noted how this in turn

had increased students’ confidence about applying to postsecondary education and OSAP, and

decreased related anxiety for both students and parents.
       Educators reported that they liked the resources and structure of the program. Some also

implied the program had desirable behavioral effects. For example, some stated that having

workshops in class time allowed counselors to ensure students received immediate or timely

answers to their questions, “as opposed to [them] doing it at home and having to come to me for

help the next day.” Similarly, one said, “We went through the process as a group, so a sense of

community, ‘we’re in this together’ mindset was established – this provided some

encouragement for our reluctant (less confident) students as well.” According to educators, this

structured approach particularly helped students who were indecisive or lacked the confidence or

motivation to engage in the application process, and those who were otherwise disadvantaged:

“[LifeAfterHighSchool] forces students to start the process rather than relying on their initiative

– [this is] especially helpful for those who don’t have parents urging them to apply.”

       Many counselors emphasized how important the payment of the application fee was to

their students, many of whom lived in lower-income households. One Guidance Head said their

application numbers were “way up”, and another said, “This has been so great for our kids. I

wish you could see our neighborhood — there are boarded up houses all over the place… For

them to hear, ‘you have potential, you can do this.’ And when they saw the OSAP calculation,

and realized, ‘I can do this,’ you should see their faces light up.”




IV. Data and Methodology



       The Ontario Ministry of Education keeps individual high school records on students in

Grades 9 to 12 on a range of demographic and achievement variables. Individual level secondary
and postsecondary application and registration data were linked at the Ministry of Education and

made available for the purpose of analyzing the effectiveness of LifeAfterHighSchool. We

received data for all Grade 12 students (with at least 4 years of high school) at program and

control schools in the academic years 2009-10, 2010-11, 2011-12 (the year the program was

administered), and 2012-13, including all of their associated achievement records for the

academic years preceding and during their respective Grade 12 enrollment.

       Three data sets were supplied, all linkable via a depersonalized student identification

numbers. The first dataset comprised the Student Biographical File, with information on student

gender, year of birth, whether a diploma was issued (and if so, when), and an indicator for

students who were in Grade 12 for the first time. The second dataset was the Student Marks File,

with information on each course taken, the credit value for each course, and the final course

marks earned. The third file was the Student Application and Registration to Postsecondary

Education in Ontario File, with information on the number of postsecondary applications filed

each year and on any postsecondary registrations. “Registering” for a program means having

paid the college tuition fees for the program (usually due by mid-September) and not dropping

out by November 1st of the school year. For first-year students, being registered is very similar

to being enrolled, since “enrollment” is a count of every student still registered in a program on

November 1. We therefore use registered and enrolled outcomes interchangeably. The linked

file does not contain information on students who applied to colleges outside the province of

Ontario, though this number is likely small.

       Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain reliable information regarding who applied for

financial aid.   The OSAP application does not systematically collect information about an

applicant's high school, nor does it require an applicant's Ontario Education Number, which
could have been used to link with our files. The Ministry of Training, Colleges, and Universities

tried to link their administrative data on OSAP recipients attending college with other data in

order to identify students from our program and control schools, but researchers concluded that

the match quality was too poor to be of use. Our main outcomes, therefore, are college program

applications college enrollment, but not financial aid applications.

        The main econometric model for estimating average program effects is the following

randomized difference-in-differences model:




Yisc = δ s + δ c + βTsc + eisc                                                                    (1)



where Yisc is the outcome for student i, from school s, in the Grade 12 cohort c, and Tsc is an

indicator variable for whether LifeAfterHighSchool was administered at school s for cohort c

and eisc is the residual. For the 2011-12 cohort, since Tsc was randomly assigned, estimating

program effects by comparing differences in mean outcomes between program and control

schools that year generates unbiased results.          But with only 86 schools and school-level

heterogeneity, we can increase precision by conditioning on prior school-level differences using

school ( δ s ) and cohort ( δ c ) fixed effects, and by clustering standard errors at the school level.

        Figure 2A displays this approach graphically. In the 2011-12 school year, the college

application rate among graduating seniors from control schools was 65.4 percent. For program

schools, the rate was 11.9 percentage points higher (77.3 percent). The standard error around

this difference using student-level data is 2.5 percentage points. In the two years prior to

LifeAfterHighSchool, application rates were slightly lower for program schools, though not by

much (64.8 versus 66.0 percent). Taking these lower rates into account using equation (1)
above, the estimated average program effect is an increase in application rates by 13.5

percentage points, with a standard error of 1.5 percentage points (a 40 percent decrease

compared to the standard error using only one cohort). A similar pattern arises when looking at

college enrollment rates in Figure 2B. The enrollment rate for graduating seniors in program

schools in the program year was 5.3 percentage points higher than that for seniors in control

schools (57.5 versus 52.2 percent with a standard error of 3.5 percentage points). Using equation

(1) instead, the standard error is smaller at 1.3 percentage points, and the estimated effect is an

increase in college enrollment by 5.0 percentage points.

       Given the binary nature of our two main outcomes, we estimate equation (1) using a

probit model, and present implied discrete changes in the probability of applying or enrolling in

college due to receiving the program. Appendix Tables A3 and A4 present alternative estimates

(which are similar to our main ones) using only the program year (comparing mean outcome

differences), and using the randomized difference in differences approach but while also

including the following linear control variables: a dummy for having taken university-track

courses in high school interacted with high school grade average, number of credits earned at the

start of a student's last year of high school, total number of courses failed in high school, age

fixed effects, and dummy variables for gender, for taking university-track or workplace-track

courses in grade 11, for whether the student was ever in special education classes, for being an

immigrant, and for whether their mother tongue is neither French nor English.

       We do not use subsequent cohorts as part of the estimating equation in case younger

students benefit from having older schoolmates go through the program. Interestingly, we do

not observe this impact: after the program ends in 2011-12, application and college enrollments
rates for the next cohort of graduating seniors in program schools drop back to previous levels,

similar to the observed rates for the next cohort of seniors in control schools.




V. Results



       We begin by exploring whether LifeAfterHighSchool had any impact on high school

outcomes. For example, it is possible that the program increased interest or awareness in

postsecondary options, and led some seniors to strive for better grades, take different courses, or

adjust their graduation plans. Table 3 shows estimated program effects on high school outcomes

on all Grade 12 students using the randomized difference-in-differences approach outlined

previously. The first column indicates the mean of the outcome variable for Grade 12 seniors in

the control schools in 2011-12. The second column shows the estimated program effects, which

are generally zero and insignificant. LifeAfterHighSchool caused no discernible change to the

type of courses taken (e.g. university-track or college-track courses) or the number of courses

taken. This is not surprising given that most students picked their course schedule well before

the start of the first workshop. What is surprising is an estimated negative program effect on

average grades (5 percent of a standard deviation lower). It is not clear why the program would

have led to students performing worse. Given the 12 separate estimates in the table and the

unintuitive direction of the effect, we suspect this result is due to chance.

       The program also had no noticeable impact on time to high school completion or

graduation outcomes. In the control group, the fraction of Grade 12 students that graduated by

the end of the school year was 62.9 percent, and nearly all of them exited high school (53.2
percent of all Grade 12s). Some stayed, along with other Grade 12s who did not satisfy enough

requirements to graduate (30.9 percent stayed overall). The program effects on graduation and

leaving high school are both estimated with small confidence bands around zero.

       Table 4 shows the overall program effects of LifeAfterHighSchool on postsecondary

application and enrollment rates. For reference, Columns 1, 3, and 5 list these rates for the

control schools in the 2011-12 Grade 12 cohort. Among all Grade 12s, applications to any

college or university increased 13.9 percentage points, relative to the control application rate of

39.5 percent. Most of this increase came from applications to 2-year colleges (a 10.4 percentage

point increase compared to only a 3.6 percentage point increase in 4-year programs applications).

The program did not significantly change the small rate at which students applied to both college

and university application centers.    Turning     to   enrollment,     the   program      increased

postsecondary attendance the following year by 2.9 percentage points among all Grade 12

students (with a standard error of 0.8 percentage points).       As with the concentrated 2-year

college application effects, all of the enrollment effects come from increased enrollment at 2-

year community colleges (with no increase in 4-year university enrollment).

       These effects, averaged over the entire Grade 12 sample, are diminished by the fact that

many students have not yet met graduation requirements, and stay in high school another year.

Thus, in Columns 3 and 4, we condition on the pre-program characteristic of beginning Grade 12

with at least 21 credits. Students in this category are far more likely to graduate after taking a

full course load than students with less than that amount. The overall college application rate

effect for this group is slightly higher than that for the full sample, at 19.1 percentage points. As

expected, enrollment effects is also higher, with an estimated increase in postsecondary
attendance of 4.4. percentage points. This increase occurs almost exclusively through changes in

community college enrollment.

         Even for students that start the year with 21 credits, some fail courses and cannot

graduate. Some may take a smaller load and spread their remaining courses over two years.

And some may prefer to stay another year to take additional courses and increase their grade

averages. Motivated by these cases and the earlier finding that the program had no impact on

high school exit or graduation, the rest of our main results focus on the sample of students that

left school with a high school certificate, since only these students could apply and go to college

in the subsequent school year. 15 For these Grade 12 graduates, LifeAfterHighSchool increased

college applications by 13.6 percentage points (relative to the control group rate of 64.2 percent)

and college enrollment by 5.2 percentage points (relative to the control group rate of 53.0

percent).

         Table 5 shows applications and enrollment effects for different subgroups of exiting

Grade 12 graduates.          By gender, it is interesting to note the much higher application and

enrollment rates for females over males –almost a 20 percentage point difference in both cases.

The program effects by gender, however, are similar. College enrollment increases by 5.4

percentage points for males and 4.4 percentage points for females. Effects split by urban and

rural high schools also lead to similar results: a 5.6 percentage point increase in enrollment at

urban schools and a 4.6 percentage point increase at rural, although the rural estimate is less

precisely estimated and significant only at the 10 percent level. 16



15
   For sensitivity analysis, we also show the estimated program effects for the full sample and for students
beginning Grade 12 with at least 21 credits, because these students are more likely to have met the requirements
to graduate by the end of the year.
16
   A rural high school is defined as a high school with zero as its 2nd alpha-numeric digit in its postal code, in line
with Canada Post's definition.
        Ontario provides three types of courses in Grade 12 - university, college, and workplace –

which are catered to preparing students for these respective next destinations. University courses

are more academic and theoretical, while College and Workplace courses are more applied.

University programs in Ontario require at least some university-type course prerequisites. Most,

but not all, Grade 12 graduates taking university-type courses applied and went to postsecondary

the following year (83.0 and 70.3 percent respectively for the control group).                                Still,

LifeAfterHighSchool raises application rates for these students by 7.9 percentage points, and

enrollment by 3.6 percentage points. Fewer students without university-type courses applied and

enrolled, but the program has a significantly larger impact on them. College application rates

increase from 40.9 to 64.4 percent, and enrollment increases from 31.8 to 40.9 percent (a 9

percentage point increase).         And for the small subset of students that take vocational-type

courses in Grade 12 (1,753 out of 38,352),significantly limiting their postsecondary program

options, LifeAfterHighSchool doubles relative application and enrollment rates (from 16.7 to

33.0 percent for application rates, and from 10.8 to 20.7 percent for enrollment).

        Cut by grade average, LifeAfterHighSchool significantly affect three broad groups.

Those with low Grade 12 grade averages - lower than 60 percent - see increases to application

rates by 16 percentage points and enrollment rates by 5.8 percentage points. Those with grade

averages at least 75 percent experience application increases from 77.7 to 88.6 percent and

enrollment increases from 66.8 to 70.2 percent. The largest enrollment effects are for the group

in the middle - with grade averages between 60 and 75 percent. Their enrollment effect is 6.4

percentage points. 17



17
   This is notably larger than the impacts found in a rigorous evaluation of a popular academic program for US high
schools that targets middle-achieving youth called AVID, that requires 3-4 years of weekly classroom time (Ford et
al 2014)
           In summary, LifeAfterHighSchool was broadly influential in raising enrollment rates

across all different types of students at low-transition high schools. It was impressively effective

for students 'in the middle' - neither with above nor below-average grades, and neither taking

courses that put them on a university or workplace trajectory.




VI. Phase Two 18



           LifeAfterHighSchool increased Grade 12 college application rates from about 65 to 80

percent. From an operational perspective, these results were initially disappointing, since the

goal of the program was to simplify the process to help virtually all exiting seniors to apply to

and get accepted into at least one program they helped choose, and to secure financial aid

packages. It is possible that the remaining 20 percent of students who did not apply never

would, regardless of how simple the process was. On the other hand, given the implementation

issues we experienced such as workshop absences and running out of time, perhaps we could

have done better in helping these students become more interested in postsecondary options.

           To explore this and a number of additional efficiency issues, the Ontario Ministry of

Training, Colleges, and Universities supported our efforts to implement a second pilot two years

later, which we call Phase II. We changed the baseline design of LifeAfterHighSchool to use

wireless laptops, instead of school computer labs, so that we could better deliver the program in

classrooms that students were supposed to be in. 19 We also combined the first two workshops to

deliver them simultaneously to all Grade 12s over an entire morning in the Fall. This reduced


18

19
     Internet access was undertaken via Wifeless Hub Hotspots provided to each school.
disruption and increased total workshop time by not having students transition between morning

classes. Students were given headphones to proceed through choosing programs, learning more

about financial aid, and applying at more of their own speed. Social media and other distracting

websites were blocked. Another feature of the Phase II program is that it relied on third-party

career planning software for helping students choose programs to apply. The 'Where Would You

Go?' component of the program in Phase I that provided a list of local college options based on

student grades and minimum requirements was deemed too expensive to redevelop, so instead

we directed students to software already available in schools. As discussed, below, this may

have altered the types of programs participants considered and applied for.

       Phase II was also implemented to test four more variants of the program model for scale-

up consideration. The first was 1) Baseline + 'Mop-up', in which paid facilitators returned to

schools after the workshops to offer additional individual or small-group help to the students

who had not completed their applications in class. This intervention was set up to explore how

much more application rates would increase from providing additional support outside the

workshops. The second was 2) Internal Staff + Fee Waivers, in which schools were provided

access to the program web site and fee-waiver system, but not external support was provided to

administer the program (including no laptops). This treatment arm was to explore whether

school staff could be used to implement LifeAfterHighSchool instead of paid external

facilitators. School staff were given instructions on how to implement the program, and were

left on their own to do so. The third was 3) Baseline But No Fee Waiver, in which students

received the full baseline program and external facilitator support, but were required to pay for

college applications with credit or debit cards, or to ask their parents to do so. Since the largest

cost item of the program was covering the approximate $100 fee per student, the Ontario
government wanted to test whether application rates would change if students received in-class

assistance but were left to pay on their own. Finally, the fourth was 4) Internal Staff with No Fee

Waiver, in which access to the LifeAfterHighSchool web site was made available but without fee

waivers, and school staff were required to implement the program.

        These variant models were tested by returning to 66 of the 86 Phase I schools (a smaller

number for budget reasons).            Rather than re-randomizing program and control groups, the

original program schools were switched to control group status. We switched statuses (a) in

order to still operate in the lowest-transition schools; (b) in order to avoid asking Phase I schools

to implement modifications on the design they were used to (possibly asking them to no longer

receive outside assistance or allow for fee waivers), and (c) after observing application rates fall

back to control group levels between Phase I and Phase II (as displayed in Figure 2A). Statistical

power in Phase II is lower than Phase I because of the smaller number of total schools and the

smaller number of schools testing each variant (7 baseline schools, 4 in the Baseline + 'Mop-up'

model, 5 for Internal Staff + Fee Waivers, 3 for Baseline But No Fee Waiver, and 9 for Internal

Staff + No Fee Waiver).              We employ the same randomized difference in differences

methodology using additional data for the new treatment year (2013-14) and the two Grade 12

cohort years prior to Phase I treatment (2009-10 and 2010-11) to allow for school fixed effects.

           Table 6 shows the different Phase II program effects on postsecondary applications for

Grade 12 graduates leaving high school. 20 The new baseline model met its goal of generating a

larger application rate increase than the Phase I treatment did (a 19.3 percentage point compared

to a 13.6 percentage point increase), although 16.0 percent of students still did not apply even

under the new approach of entire morning workshops with laptops. Under the ‘Baseline + ‘Mop-


20
  Similar results for the sample of Grade 12 students beginning the year with at least 21 credits are shown in
Appendix Tables A5 and A6.
up’” model, when we provided facilitators to return to schools to offer additional assistance for

students who had not applied during workshops, application rates increased 20.7 percentage

points – only a marginal improvement to the estimated effect without 'Mop-up', and not a

statistically significant difference. Encouragingly, school staff in the 'Internal Staff + No Fee

Waivers' group were able to increase applications by as much or more than schools that were

provided facilitators and laptops. In particular, applications for students with no university-track

courses in Grade 12 increased by 38.7 percentage points - almost double - at schools with no

external help. All three of these models also generated similar increases in applications for

students taking university-track courses in Grade 12, and for students taking vocational courses.

       But the Internal Staff + No Fee Waivers model did not fare as well. Offering application

assistance while still requiring students to pay the $100 fee had a zero, or even negative, impact

on application rates. Perhaps students felt that the task they were being encouraged to do should

have been free and became offended when they realized it was not. Or perhaps, after being

notified about the program, parents relied more on the school to get their children through the

process. The point estimates for college enrollment the following year at schools without fee

waivers (shown in Table 6) are correspondingly negative and, in some cases, significant at the 10

percent confidence level. Removing application fees appears to be an important necessary

condition for encouraging more students to apply.

       Surprisingly, although Phase II models with fee waivers raised application rates more

than Phase I effects, college enrollment effects were mostly not significantly different from zero.

Table 7 shows these effects for the different Phase II treatment arms for Grade 12 graduates and

other subgroups. The baseline estimated effect was -.036 with a standard error of 0.025. The

Baseline + 'Mop-up' effect was exactly zero with a standard error of 0.03, and the estimate for
the model with Internal staff + Fee waivers was 0.031 with a standard error of 0.37. The

combined sample generates an estimated effect within a 95 percent confidence interval of -4.1 to

2.6 percentage points. The only positively significant impact came from the schools with

internal staff running the program and with fee waivers provided: for these schools, the main

sample effect and the effect on students with no university-track courses (an 8.1 percentage point

increase) were closest in line with the program effect estimates in Phase I.

           The larger college application effects in Phase II juxtaposed against the smaller

enrollment effects raises the interesting question, 'why the difference?'. One possibility is that

the program effects are actually equal for all versions of LifeAfterHighSchool with fee waivers,

and that we can obtain a more precise estimate by combining the two samples. Assuming this,

the program effect is a 2.3 percentage point increase in enrollment, with a standard error of 1.0

percentage points. However, we easily reject equal effects (0.044 (se=0.013) for Phase I, -0.007

(se=0.019) for Phase II), especially for the sample of students with no university-track courses

(0.086 (se=0.016) for Phase I, -0.011 (se=0.020) for Phase II). Another possibility is that

economic conditions changed between the two treatment years, and students in Phase II were

less interested in going to college. This also seems unlikely, since the province's unemployment

rate fell only by .6 percentage points between the two years. 21

           A more plausible reason is that although Phase II further increased application rates, it

may also have inadvertently affected the types of programs where students applied. One key

difference between the two phases was the tool used for helping students choose where they

might go. In Phase I, we asked students their grades and developed software to display a

comprehensive list of local programs for which students would likely be accepted; in contrast, in

Phase II we relied on external software that required students to sift through programs based on
21
     From Statistics Canada's Labour Force Survey: 7.9 percent in 2012 and 7.3 percent in 2014.
their career interests. To explore whether this made a difference to where students applied, we

make use of available data separating 2- and 4-year colleges (we do not have data on program of

study). Table 8 shows estimated effects for Phase I and Phase II designs (that included fee

waivers), separated by whether students took university-level or vocational courses in Grade 12

and whether effects are for 2- or 4-year programs. Among students taking no university-level

courses, the entire application impact was on 2-year colleges and not 4-year colleges. The higher

application rate increase in Phase II also led to a proportional increase in 2-year applications.

The same happened for students with only vocational courses - all of the increase in overall

application rates was driven by increases in 2-year college applications, which is reassuring since

these students were unlikely to be accepted to any university programs.

        In contrast, Phase I and Phase II application effects differ for students with university-

level courses. In Phase I, both 2- and 4-year college applications increased for students with

university-level courses (by 3.7 and 6.7 percentage points respectively), but in Phase II, only

applications to 4-year colleges increased significantly (by 14.2 percentage points). We also

observe a significant decrease in 2-year college enrollment for these students [-0.049 (se=0.018)]

and an offsetting increase in 4-year enrollment [0.036 (se=0.027)]. The greater emphasis Phase

II appears to have placed on 4-year colleges may have led students to submit applications to

programs that were subsequently rejected from, or to programs from which they received offers

and declined.

       We do not have information on application rejections at the 4-year postsecondary level,

but we do at the 2-year level from the Ontario College Application Service (OCAS). Table 9

shows estimated Phase I and II program effects for the total number of students in a school who

applied to a 2-year college, applied and received at least one offer, applied and received no
offers, and applied and accepted one offer. In Panel A, the outcome (at the school-year level) is

regressed on a treatment dummy, along with cohort and program school fixed effects, weighted

by Grade 12 school size. For Phase I, the cohorts are 2009/10, 2010/11, and 2011/12 (the year of

treatment). For Phase II, the cohort years are 2009/10, 2010/11, and 2013/14 (the year treated).

In Panel B, the outcome variables are divided by Grade 12 school size (the number of Grade 12s

in each school, calculated from Ministry of Education data) to convert the estimated effects into

percentage point changes.

       LifeAfterHighSchool in Phase I, on average, increased applications to 2-year colleges by

35 students per school, and following-year college enrollment by 15 students per school. This

translates to an estimated increase in applications by 9 percentage points and in enrollment by

3.4 percentage points, which is very similar to the results reported in Table 4 (which used

Ministry of Education Data). Importantly, Phase I did not significantly affect the number of

students applying and receiving no offers. In contrast, although we estimate that Phase II

increased the fraction of college applications by more than in Phase I, some of these additional

applications were rejected. On average, Phase II increased the number of students who applied

but received no offers by 11 per school, or 3.3 percentage points.

       In short, relatively small changes in implementation of LifeAfterHighSchool successfully

increased college application rates even further, but may also have altered the types of programs

participants considered and applied for. Supporting evidence includes the finding that, for Phase

II university-track students, application effects were driven only by increases in 4-year college

applications, whereas we saw no subsequent enrollment effects in Phase I or II. For non-

university track students, more students applied due to exposure to the Phase II over Phase I

program, but some of these additional applicants were rejected. Guidance in choosing programs
that will accept students, along with application fee waivers, therefore appear to be important

prerequisites for successfully helping with the college transition.




VII. Conclusion



       This paper presents results from a school-level randomized trial evaluating a new

program that incorporates college application assistance directly into the high school classroom

activities. Students at low-transition schools are encouraged to keep options open by going

through the actual application process. Those who do may realize a variety of programs of

interest exist that they were not initially aware of, or become more informed about college costs

and opportunities. Over three classes, students were guided to choose college programs they

would likely be eligible for, shown a basic college budget and financial aid calculator, given help

applying without having to pay the fee, and introduced to the financial aid application (with

follow-up requests sent to parents). Among all Grade 12 graduates, the program increased

program application rates by 13 percentage points, and college enrollment rates by about 5

percentage points. Impacts were concentrated among those not already taking university-track

courses.

       These results are quite comparable to those of studies examining other ways to simplify

the college transition. In the FAFSA study by Bettinger et al. (2012), low-income parents who

went to H&R Block received assistance in completing their Grade 12 child's financial aid

application, and were provided information about local colleges. Application rates and college

enrollment increased by 15 and 8 percentage points, respectively. Another study by Carrell and
Sacerdote (2013) involved counselors identifying particular Grade 12 students as possible

beneficiaries from receiving individual support with undergraduate students to help and

encourage them through all application steps, along with application fee waivers. Program

applications increased 29 percentage points and college enrollment 5 percentage points.

Castleman and Page (2015) examined sending text reminders and offering phone-support for

getting through remaining college transition tasks over the summer. Fall enrollment rates for

recent high school graduates who had at least started the FAFSA increased, on average, by 3

percentage points. A related study by Hoxby and Turner (2013) looked at helping disadvantaged

students with high SAT scores transition to more selective schools. Mailing these Grade 12

students suggestions for selective schools they were likely to be accepted into, along with fee

waiver vouchers, increased the number of applications sent and the enrollment rate at more

selective colleges by 5 percentage points.

       Collectively, these studies clearly demonstrate that complexity and lack of support in the

college transition process affect whether some individuals enroll or not. It remains to be seen

whether those affected by simplifying the transition benefit. We cannot tell for sure at the

individual level or even the average level since no experiment has yet looked at longer-term

outcomes like arnings. But the finding that low-cost assistance matters suggests for some

students enrollment decisions do not represent well-thought-out investments decisions.

Reviews of existing research on returns to higher education suggests high rates of return to

college, even for marginal students (Oreopoulos and Peteronjevic, 2013, Hout, 2012,

Barrow and Malamud, 2015). 22 The FAFSA study also shows students than enrolled in

college because of the program persisted into second year and had to navigate subsequent

financial aid and registration requirements on their own.

        To maintain even an option of going to college when exiting high school, students must

get through the application process. How best to help students do so depends on context and

feasibility.   Some changes, like sending text reminders, are relatively straightforward to

introduce without significant disruption to the process' existing framework. Other changes, like

using parental income information from tax files instead of asking for it on applications, require

reinvention and even new legislation. Small details matter as well: our inability to assist some

students in opening a financial aid application because they did not have on hand their Social

Insurance Number is but one example; not being able to assist all Grade 12s in class at the same

time is another.    We also learned that waiving application fees is an important necessary

condition for making in-class assistance worthwhile, as students were not willing to respond to

in-class support if required to pay to submit an application. Clearly the effectiveness of a

program in simplifying the application process depends on addressing multiple potential

bottlenecks simultaneously.

        Personalization matters too, as we learned from implementing LifeAfterHighSchool a

second time. Completing the financial aid application only involves answering factual questions,

but completing the program application involves considering what programs will accept and

interest students. The degree of personal assistance in helping students find suitable programs to

apply seems to make a large difference for actual enrollment outcomes. Students given a

succinct set of program options that would accept them if they applied were much more likely to

later enroll than those left to consider minimum requirements on their own. Other personalized
variants of the program, such as adding follow-up text reminders, may also be useful and could

be evaluated based on cost-effectiveness, operational feasibility, and experience.

       For   schools    that   wish   to   offer   in-class   college   transition   assistance,   the

LifeAfterHighSchool experiments suggest two starting points. Firstly, waiving application fees

for at least the first 3 applications can be very helpful and encouraging for students, especially

those in low-transition schools. Secondly, a simple 'one-stop' website that guides students and

parents through each step (including identifying best program matches, and help with the

financial aid process) can be helpful in simplifying and de-mystifying the application process.

These two changes could enable high schools to incorporate effective application assistance

during class time, and help students keep the “college option” open.

students includes all students with at least 4 years of high school at program and control schools
in 2009/10, 2010/11 and 2011/12 (the year treated). The control mean reported is for the
2011/12 year. The effects are estimated from a probit model of the outcome variable regressed
on a treatment dummy, along with fixed effects for cohort year and school. Marginal effects at
mean values are reported. Standard errors are clustered by school and shown in square brackets.

Notes: Data are from Ontario Ministry of Education student records. The sample includes students with at least 4
years of high school at program and control schools in 2009/10, 2010/11 and 2013/14 (the year Phase II was
implemented). The control mean reported is for the 2013/14 year. The increase in probability of applying from
exposure to the program is estimated from a probit model of the outcome variable regressed on a treatment
dummy, along with fixed effects for cohort year and school. Marginal effects at mean values are reported.
Standard errors are clustered by school and shown in square brackets. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance
at the 10, 5, and 1 percent levels respectively.

cohort and program school fixed effects, weighted by Grade 12 school size. For
Phase I schools the cohorts are 2009/10, 2010/11, and 2011/12 (the year of
treatment). For Phase II schools the cohort years are 2009/10, 2010/11, and
2013/14 (the year treated). In Panel B the outcome variable is divided by the
fraction of Grade 12 Graduates in that school, calcuated from Ministry of Education
data. Standard errors are in square brackets, clustered by school. *, **, and ***
indicate statistical significance at the 10, 5, and 1 percent levels respectively.

Notes: Same as in Table 4. The only difference in setup for this table compared to Table 5 is that the regression also
includes the following conditional variables: : a dummy for having taken university-track courses in high school interacted
with high school grade average, number of credits earned at the start of a student's last year of high school, total number
of courses failed in high school, age fixed effects, and dummy variables for gender, for taking university-track or
workplace-track courses in grade 11, for whether the student was ever in special education classes, for being an
immigrant, and for whether their mother tongue is neither French nor English.
