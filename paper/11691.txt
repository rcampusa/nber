Real Exchange Rate Volatility and the Price of Nontradables in Sudden-Stop-Prone Economies

NBER Working Paper No. 11691

                                           ABSTRACT

The dominant view in the empirical literature on exchange rates is that the high variability of real
exchange rates is due to movements in exchange-rate-adjusted prices of tradable goods. This paper
shows that this dominant view does not hold in Mexican data for the periods in which the country
had managed exchange rate regimes. Variance analysis of a 30-year sample of monthly data shows
that movements in the price of nontradables relative to tradables account for up to 70 percent of the
variability of the real exchange rate during these periods. The paper proposes a model in which this
stylized fact, and the Sudden Stops that accompanied the collapse of Mexico's managed exchange
rates, could result from an endogenous amplification mechanism operating via nontradables prices
in economies with dollarized liabilities and credit constraints. The key feature of this mechanism is
Irving Fisher's debt-deflation process. Numerical evaluation suggests that the Fisherian deflation
effects on consumption, the current account, and relative prices dwarf those induced by the standard
balance sheet effect typical of the Sudden Stops literature.

1. Introduction

       The dominant view in the empirical literature on real exchange rates is that exchange-

rate-adjusted relative prices of tradable goods account for most of the observed high variability

of CPI-based real exchange rates (see the classic article by Engel (1999) and earlier work by

Jenkins and Rogers (1995)). In an application of the variance analysis of his 1999 article to

Mexican data, Engel (2000) concluded that this dominant view also applies to Mexico. Using a

sample of monthly data from 1991 to 1999, he found that the fraction of the variance of the peso-

dollar real exchange rate accounted for by the variance of the Mexico-U.S. ratio of prices of

tradable goods adjusted by the nominal exchange rate exceeds 90 percent, regardless of the time

horizon over which the data are differenced.

       Engel’s finding raises serious questions about the empirical relevance of a large literature

that emphasizes the nontradables price as a key factor for explaining real exchange rates and

economic fluctuations in emerging economies. The studies developed in the research program on

“non-credible” exchange-rate-based stabilizations surveyed by Calvo and Vegh (1999) model the

real exchange rate as a positive, monotonic function of the relative price of nontradables (with

the latter determined at equilibrium by the optimality conditions for sectoral allocation of

consumption and production). Lack of credibility in a currency peg leads to a temporary increase

in tradables consumption and to a rise in the relative price of nontradables, and hence to a

temporary real appreciation of the currency. More recently, the literature on Sudden Stops in

emerging economies has emphasized the phenomenon of liability dollarization (i.e., the fact that

debts in emerging economies are generally denominated in units of tradable goods, or in hard

currencies, but partially leveraged on the incomes and assets of the large nontradables sector

typical of these economies). With liability dollarization, real-exchange-rate collapses induced by

sharp declines in the price of nontradables can trigger financial crashes and deep recessions. For

example, Calvo (1998) showed how a sudden loss of world credit market access triggers a real
                                                 -2-

depreciation of the currency and systemic bankruptcies in the nontradables sector. The real

depreciation occurs because the market price of nontradables collapses as the lack of credit

forces a reduction of tradables consumption, while the supply of nontradables remains unaltered.

       If nontradables prices account only for a negligible fraction of real exchange rate

variability in emerging economies like Mexico, however, the above theories of Sudden Stops and

of the real effects of exchange-rate-based stabilizations would lack empirical foundation.

Moreover, the key policy lessons derived from these theories regarding strategies to cope with

the adverse effects of non-credible stabilization policies, or to prevent Sudden Stops with their

dramatic consequences for economic performance and welfare, would be rendered irrelevant.

For example, the push to develop foreign debt instruments better protected from the adverse

effects of liability dollarization, by indexing debt to output or commodity prices or by issuing

debt at longer maturities or in domestic currencies, would be a costly effort that a key piece of

empirical evidence does not support, despite the benefits that it could seem to have in theory.

Thus, determining the main sources of the observed fluctuations of real exchange rates in

emerging economies is a central issue for theory and policy.

       A closer look at the empirical evidence suggests, however, that the relative price of

nontradables may not be irrelevant. Mendoza and Uribe (2001) reported large variations in

Mexico’s relative price of nontradables during the country’s exchange-rate-based stabilization of

1988-1994. They did not conduct Engel’s variance analysis, so while they showed that the price

of nontradables rose sharply, their findings cannot establish whether or not the movement in the

nontradables price was important for the large real appreciation of the Mexican peso.

Nevertheless, their results suggest that one potential problem with Engel’s analysis of Mexican

data is that it did not separate periods of managed exchange rates from periods of floating

exchange rates. There is also panel data evidence on the role that liability dollarization has

played in Emerging Markets crises, which suggests that a link between the relative price of
                                                 -3-

nontradables and the real exchange rate exists and is systematically related to the occurrence of

Sudden Stops (see Calvo, Izquierdo and Loo-Kung (2005) and the analysis of credit booms in

Chapter 4 of International Monetary Fund (2004)).

       This paper has two objectives. The first objective is to conduct a variance analysis to

determine the contribution of fluctuations in domestic prices of nontradable goods relative to

tradable goods, vis-a-vis fluctuations in exchange-rate-adjusted relative prices of tradable goods,

for explaining the variability of the real exchange rate of the Mexican peso against the U.S.

dollar. The results show that Mexico’s nontradables goods prices display high variability and

account for a significant fraction of real-exchange-rate variability in periods of managed

exchange rates. In light of these results, the second objective of the paper is to show that a

financial accelerator mechanism at work in economies with liability dollarization and credit

constraints produces amplification and asymmetry in the responses of the price of nontradables,

the real exchange rate, consumption, and the current account to exogenous shocks. In particular,

the model predicts that sudden policy-induced changes in relative prices, analogous to those

induced by the collapse of managed exchange rate regimes, can set in motion this financial

accelerator mechanism. Thus, the model predicts that, because of the effects of liability

dollarization in credit-constrained economies, economies with managed exchange rates can

display high volatility in the real exchange rate driven by the relative price of nontradables.

       The variance analysis is based on a sample of monthly data for the 1969-2000 period.

The results replicate Engel’s (2000) results for a sub-sample that matches his sample. The same

holds for the full sample and for all sub-sample periods in which Mexico did not follow an

explicit policy of exchange rate management. The results are markedly different in periods in

which Mexico managed its exchange rate (including periods with a fixed exchange rate and with

crawling pegs). In these periods, the fraction of real-exchange-rate variability accounted for by

movements of tradable-goods prices and the nominal exchange rate falls sharply and varies
                                                 -4-

widely with the time horizon of the variance ratios. Movements in Mexico’s nontradables

relative prices can account for up to 70 percent of the variance of the real exchange rate. In short,

whenever Mexico managed its exchange rate, the country experienced high real-exchange-rate

variability but movements in the price of nontradables contributed significantly to explain it.

       The Mexican data also fail to reproduce two other key findings of Engel’s work. In

addition to the overwhelming role of tradables goods prices in explaining real exchange rates,

Engel found that (a) covariances across domestic nontradables relative prices and cross-country

tradables relative prices tend to be generally positive or negligible and (b) variance ratios

corrected to take into account these covariances generally do not change results derived using

approximate variance ratios that ignore them. Contrary to these findings, in periods in which

Mexico had a managed exchange rate, the correlation between domestic nontradables relative

prices and international tradables relative prices is sharply negative. The standard deviation of

Mexico’s domestic relative prices is also markedly higher during these periods. As a result,

measures of the contribution of tradables goods prices to real-exchange-rate variability corrected

to take into account these features of the data are significantly lower than those that do not.

       Recent cross-country empirical studies provide further time series and cross sectional

evidence indicating that the relative price of nontradables explains a significantly higher fraction

of real exchange rate variability in the presence of managed exchange rates. Naknoi (2005)

constructed a large data set covering 35 countries and nearly 600 pairs of bilateral real exchange

rates. She found that for many of these pairs Engel’s (1999) result hold but there are also many

for which it does not, and in some the relative price of nontradables accounts for about 50

percent of real exchange rate variability. She also found that the variability of the relative price

of nontradables rises as that of the nominal exchange rate falls, and in some cases it exceeds the

variability of exchange-rate-adjusted relative prices of tradable goods. Parsley (2003) examined

the cross-paired and U.S.-dollar-based real exchange rates of six countries of South East Asia
                                                 -5-

using monthly data. He found that in subsamples with managed exchange rates for Hong Kong,

Malaysia and Thailand, the relative price of nontradables could explain up to 50 percent of the

variability of the real exchange rate. All these findings are also related to the well-known

findings of Mussa (1986) and Baxter and Stockman (1989) showing that the variability of the

real exchange rate is higher under flexible exchange rate regimes, although they did not study the

decomposition of this variability in terms of the contributions of the relative prices of tradables

vis-a-vis nontradables.

       A common approach followed in the recent International Macroeconomics literature is to

take the above empirical evidence as an indication of the existence of nominal rigidities affecting

price or wage setting. This approach has been the focus of extensive research examining the

interaction of nominal rigidities with alternative pricing arrangements (e.g., pricing to market,

local v. foreign currency invoicing) and with different industrial organization arrangements (e.g.,

endogenous tradability). Unfortunately, the ability of these models to explain the variability of

real exchange rates, even amongst country pairs for which the “dominant view” holds, is limited.

Chari, Kehoe and McGrattan (2002) found that models with nominal rigidities cannot explain the

variability of real exchange rates in industrial countries unless the models adopt preferences

separable in leisure and values for coefficients of relative risk aversion and capital adjustment

costs, and for the periodicity of staggered price adjustments, that are at odds with empirical

evidence. Moreover, theoretical analysis shows that it does not follow from the observation that

the variance analysis of the real exchange rate changes in favor of the price of nontradables

under managed exchange rates that nominal rigidities must be at work. This is because the

equilibria obtained for monetary economies under alternative exchange rate regimes, and with or

without nominal rigidities, can be reproduced in monetary economies with flexible prices, or

even in non-monetary economies, with appropriate combinations of tax-equivalent distortions on

consumption and factor incomes (see Adao, Correia and Teles (2005), Coleman (1996),
                                                 -6-

Mendoza (2001) and Mendoza and Uribe (2001)).

       Instead of emphasizing the role of nominal rigidities, this paper shows, using a simple

non-monetary model of endogenous credit constraints with liability dollarization, that a strong

amplification mechanism driven by a variant of Fisher’s debt-deflation process can induce high

variability in the price of nontradables and in the real exchange rate in response to exogenous

shocks. In particular, policy-induced shocks to relative prices akin to those triggered by a

currency devaluation can set in motion this amplification mechanism. The financial accelerator

that amplifies the responses of consumption, the current account, and the price of nontradables to

shocks of “usual” magnitudes combines a standard balance sheet effect (because of the mismatch

between the units in which debt is denominated and the units of the assets or incomes on which

some of this debt is leveraged) with the Fisherian debt-deflation process (because an initial fall in

the price of nontradables triggered by an exogenous shock tightens further credit constraints

leading to a downard spiral in access to debt and the price of nontradables).

       A set of basic numerical experiments suggests that the quantitative implications of this

financial accelerator are significant. The Fisherian debt-deflation process is a powerful vehicle

for inducing amplification and asymmetry in the responses of the economy to exogenous shocks

(particularly to changes in taxes that approximate the relative price effects of changes in the rate

of devaluation of the currency). The magnitude of the effects that the Fisherian deflation has on

the nontradables price, the real exchange rate and the current account dwarf those that result

from the standard balance sheet effect that has been widely studied in the Sudden Stops

literature. In this way, the model can account simultaneously for high variability of the real

exchange rate and key features of the Sudden Stop phenomenon as the result of (endogenous)

high variability of the relative price of nontradables.

       The model is analogous to the models with liquidity-constrained consumers of the closed-

economy macro literature and to the Sudden Stop dynamic, stochastic general equilibrium
                                                 -7-

models reviewed by Arellano and Mendoza (2003). The setup provided in this paper is simpler in

order to focus the analysis on the amplification mechanism linking Sudden Stops and real

exchange rate movements driven by the relative price of nontradables.

       The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 conducts the variance analysis of

the Mexico-U.S. real exchange rate. Section 3 develops the model of liability dollarization with

financial frictions in which “excess volatility” of the real exchange rate is caused by fluctuations

in the relative price of nontradables. Section 4 presents conclusions and policy implications.

2.     Variance Analysis of the Peso-Dollar Real Exchange Rate

       This section presents the results of a variance analysis that follows closely the

methodology applied in Engel (1999) and (2000). The analysis uses non-seasonally-adjusted

monthly observations of the consumer price index (CPI) and some of its components for Mexico

(MX) and the United States (US) covering the period January, 1969 to February, 2000. Mexican

data were retrieved from the Bank of Mexico’s web site (http://www.banxico.org.mx), and those

for the U.S. from the site maintained by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (http://stats.bls.gov).

Three price indexes were retrieved for each country: the aggregate CPI (P i for i=MX, US) and

the consumer price indexes for durable goods (PD i for i=MX, US) and services (PS i for i=MX,

US). The dataset also includes the nominal exchange rate series for the monthly-average

exchange rate of Mexican pesos per U.S. dollar (E) reported in the IMF’s International Financial

Statistics. The real exchange rate was generated using the IMF’s convention: RER=PMX/(EPUS).

The data were transformed into logs, with logged variables written in lowercase letters.

       Durable goods are treated as tradable goods and services are treated as nontradable

goods. This definition is in line with standard treatment in empirical studies of real exchange

rates, and is also roughly consistent with a sectoral classification of Mexican data based on a

definition of tradable goods as those pertaining to sectors for which the ratio of total trade to

gross output exceeds 5 percent (see Mendoza and Uribe (2001)).
                                                  -8-

       Following Engel (2000), simple algebraic manipulation of the definition of the real

exchange rate yields this expression: rert = xt + yt. The variable xt is the log of the exchange-

rate-adjusted price ratio of tradables across Mexico and the United States: xt = pdt MX-et - pdt US

(this is the negative of Engel’s measure because the real exchange rate is defined here using the

IMF’s definition). If the strong assumptions needed for the law of one price to hold in this

context were satisfied, xt should be a constant that does not contribute to explain variations in

rert. The variable yt includes the terms that reflect domestic prices of nontradables relative to

tradables inside each country: yt = bt MX(pst MX-pdt MX) - bt US(pst US-pdt US), where bt MX and btUS

are the (potentially time-varying) weights of nontradables in each country’s CPI. The logs of the

relative prices of nontradables are therefore: mxpnt ≡ pst MX-pdt MX and uspnt ≡ pst US-pdt US.


       The results of the variance analysis of the peso-dollar real exchange rate are summarized

in the four plots of Figure 1, which are based on the detailed results reported in Table 1 of

Mendoza (2000). This Table reports, in addition to the variance ratios for the real exchange rate,

the standard deviations and correlations of rer, y, x, mxpn, and uspn. As argued below, changes

in these moments are useful for explaining the changes in the results of the variance analysis

across fixed and floating exchange rate regimes. The discussion of the results below refers to the

changes in the relevant moments, but the reader is referred to Mendoza (2000) for the complete

set of moments.

       Each plot in Figure 1 shows curves for five different sample periods: (1) the full sample,

(2) the sample studied by Engel (2000), which is a sample retrieved from Datastream for the

period September, 1991 to August, 1999, (3) a sample that includes only data for the post-1994

floating exchange rate, (4) a fixed exchange rate sample covering January, 1969 to July, 1976,

and (5) a sample that spans the duration of the managed exchange rate regime that anchored the

stabilization plan known as El Pacto (March, 1988-November, 1994). This regime included an
                                                  -9-

initial one-year period with a fixed exchange rate followed by a crawling peg within a narrow

band (the boundaries of which were revised occasionally).

        Each of the four plots shows results for an alternative measure of the variance ratio that

quantifies the fraction of real exchange rate variability explained by xt (i.e., the relative price of

tradables). The ratios are plotted as functions of the time frequency over which the data were

differenced (1, 6, 12, 24 and, for the samples with sufficient observations, 72 months). The four

variance ratios considered are the following:

    (1) Engel’s (2000) basic ratio σ 2(x)/σ 2(rer). Since in general σ 2(rer) = σ 2(x) + σ 2(y)

        +2 cov(x,y), where cov(x,y) is the covariance between x and y, this basic ratio is accurate

        only when x and y are independent random variables (i.e., when cov(x,y) = 0). For this

        reason, Engel (1995) computed the following second and third ratios as alternatives that

        adjust for covariance terms.

    (2) The independent variables ratio, σ 2(x)/[ σ 2(rer) - cov(x,y)] , deducts from the variance

        of rer in the denominator of the variance ratio the effect of cov(x,y).

    (3) The half covariance ratio, [σ 2(x) + cov(x,y)] / σ 2(rer), measures the contribution of x to

        the variability of rer by assigning to x half of the effect of cov(x,y) on the variance of rer.

        Since this half covariance ratio can be written as the product of the basic ratio multiplied

        by 1+ρ(x,y)(σ(y)/ σ(x)), where ρ(x,y) is the correlation between x and y, the basic ratio

        approximates well the half covariance ratio if ρ(x,y) is low and/or the standard deviation

        of x is large relative to that of y.

    (4) The nontradables weighted covariance ratio, controls only for the covariance between x

        and the domestic relative price of nontradables in Mexico by re-writing the variance ratio

        as [σ 2(x)/σ 2(rer)] {1 + ρ(x,mxpn) [bMXσ (mxpn) / σ (x)] }. The basic ratio approximates

        accurately this fourth variance ratio when the correlation between x and mxpn is low
                                                      -10-

         and/or the standard deviation of x is large relative to that of mxpn.

        The motivation for the fourth ratio follows from the fact that, while the half covariance

ratio aims to correct for how much of the variance of rer is due to variables x and y taking their

covariance into account, it is silent about the contributions of the various elements that conform y

itself. The latter can be important because y captures the combined changes in domestic relative

prices of nontradables in Mexico and the United States, as well as the recurrent revisions to the

weights used in each country’s CPI (which take place at different intervals in each country).

Moreover, since the aggregate CPIs include nondurables, in addition to durables and services, y

captures also the effects of cross-country differences in the prices of nondurables relative to

durables. Computing an exact variance ratio that decomposes all of these effects requires to

control for the full variance-covariance matrix of y, x, mxpn, uspn, bMX and bN . Since data to

calculate this matrix are not available, the nontradables weighted covariance ratio is used as a

proxy that isolates the effect of the covariance between mxpn and rer. The complement (i.e., 1

minus the fourth variance ratio) is a good measure of the contribution of Mexico’s relative price

of nontradables to the variance of the real exchange rate to the extent that: (a) movements in the

CPI weights play a minor role, and (b) the correlation between mxpn and uspn is low and/or the

variance of mxpn largely exceeds that of uspn.2

        The potential importance of covariance terms in the calculation of a variance ratio, and

hence the need to consider alternative definitions of this ratio, is a classic problem in variance

analysis. Engel considered this issue carefully in his work on industrial country real exchange

rates and on the peso-dollar real exchange rate, and he concluded that it could be set aside safely.

As shown below, however, the features of the data that support this conclusion are not present in

the data for Mexico’s managed exchange rates, and hence in this case the variance ratios that


2
Computing this variance ratio requires an estimate for a constant value of bMX, which was determined using 1994
weights from the Mexican CPI, extracted from a methodological note provided by the Bank of Mexico (bMX = 0.6).
                                                  -11-

control for covariance effects play a crucial role. Engel (1995) argued that in the case of the

components of the real exchange rate of the United States vis-a-vis industrial countries,

“comovements between x and y are insignificant in all cases, except when we use the aggregate

PPI (producer price index) as the traded goods price index” (p. 31). In addition, Engel (2000)

noted that the basic ratio “tends to underestimate the importance of the x as long as the co-

variance term (between x and y) is positive (which it is at most short horizons), but any

alternative treatment of the covariance has very little effect on the measured relative importance

of the x component” (p. 9). Under these conditions, the basic ratio is either very accurate (if

ρ(x,y) is low) or in the worst-case scenario it represents a lower bound for the true variance ratio

(if ρ(x,y) is positive). In either case, a high ratio σ 2(x)/σ 2(rer) indicates correctly that real-

exchange-rate fluctuations are mostly explained by movements in tradable goods prices and in

the nominal exchange rate.

        The results shown in the four plots of Figure 1 for the full sample period are firmly in line

with Engel’s findings, except in the very long horizon of 72 months. At frequencies of 24

months or less, the basic ratio always exceeds 0.94, and using any of the other ratios to correct

for covariances across x and y, or across x and mxpn, makes no difference. These results reflect

the facts that, for the full sample, the correlations between x and y and between x and mxpn are

always close to zero, and the standard deviation of x is 3.5 to 3.7 times larger than that of y and

2.9 to 3.7 times larger than that of mxpn (see Table 1 in Mendoza (2000) for details).

Covariances of x with uspn are also irrelevant because the correlations between these variables

are generally negligible and the standard deviations of uspn are all small. Moreover, the

correlations between mxpn and uspn are also negligible.

        A very similar picture emerges for Engel’s (2000) sample and for the post-1994 floating

period. The one notable difference is that at frequencies higher than 1 month there are marked

negative correlations between x and uspn and between mxpn and uspn. These correlations could
                                                -12-

in principle add to the contribution of domestic relative price variations in explaining the

variance of rer. However, they can be safely ignored because the standard deviation of x dwarfs

those of uspn and mxpn at all time horizons, and the latter still have to be reduced by the

fractions bMX and bUS respectively. In summary, in periods in which the Mexican peso is

floating, the variability of exchange-rate-adjusted tradables goods prices is so much larger than

that of nontradables relative prices that covariance adjustments cannot alter the result that the

relative price of nontradables is of little consequence for movements in the real exchange rate.

       The picture that emerges from Mexico’s managed exchange-rate regimes is very

different. For both the fixed rate sample and the sample for El Pacto, the basic ratio is very high

but it often exceeds 1, indicating the presence of large covariance terms. The other three

variance ratios show dramatic reductions in the share of real-exchange-rate variability

attributable to x compared to the results for periods without exchange rate management. For

instance, the half covariance ratio for the fixed exchange rate sample shows that the contribution

of x to the variability of the real exchange rate reaches a minimum of 0.29 at the 6-month

frequency and remains low at around 0.36 for 12- and 24-month frequencies. The nontradables

weighted ratio, which corrects for the covariance between x and mxpn, is below 0.61 at

frequencies higher than one month. In the sample for El Pacto, the independent variables and

half covariance ratios indicate that the contribution of x to the variability of the real exchange

rate is below 0.6 at all frequencies (except for the half covariance ratio at the 12-month

frequency, in which case it increases to 0.7). The nontradables weighted ratio shows that, if only

the covariance between x and mxpn is considered, the variance of rer attributable to x reaches a

lower bound of 0.55 at the one-month frequency (although it increases sharply at the 24-month

frequency before declining again at the 72-month frequency).

       These striking differences in the outcome of the variance analysis for periods of exchange

rate management reflect two critical changes:
                                                -13-

   (a) The standard deviations of the Mexican relative price of nontradables and the composite

       variable y increase significantly relative to the standard deviations of x (the ratios of the

       standard deviation of x to that of y now range between 0.7 and 1.2).

   (b) The correlations between x and y, and between x and mxpn fall sharply and become

       markedly negative (approaching -0.6 in most cases).

       Two other important features are worth noting in comparing periods of managed and

floating exchange rates: (a) The correlation between x and rer is much lower in the former than

in the latter (the correlation between x and rer is almost 1 at all time horizons in periods of

floating exchange rates, while it ranges between 0.29 and 0.7 in the samples of managed

exchange rates), and (b) in some of the managed exchange rate scenarios, particularly the 12-

and 24-month horizons of the sample for El Pacto, the correlation between nontradable goods

relative prices in Mexico and the United States is positive (it can be as high as 0.32). This

second result actually reduces the share of fluctuations in rer that can be accounted for by y

because, as U.S. and Mexican relative prices of nontradable goods are more likely to increase

together, differences in these domestic relative prices across countries tend to offset each other

more, and hence are less important for real-exchange-rate fluctuations.

       It is also worth noting that the only feature of the statistical moments of the data

examined here that is robust to changes in the exchange rate regime is the fact that the variability

of nontradables relative prices in Mexico always exceeds by a large margin that of the United

States. For the full (El Pacto) sample, the ratio of the standard deviation of mxpn to that of uspn

ranges from 3.7 (3.4) at the one-month frequency to 4.9 (7.1) at the 24-month frequency. It is

also true, however, that Mexico’s nontradables relative prices tend to be more volatile during

currency pegs than when the exchange rate floats. The ratio of the standard deviation of mxpn for

the sample for El Pacto to that for the post-1994 floating period doubles from 1 at the one-month

frequency to about 2 at the 24-month frequency. The higher volatility of the relative price of
                                                -14-

nontradables in Mexico than in the United States, and when Mexico manages the exchange rate

than when the peso floats, are significant features of the data that, according to the theoretical

analysis of the next section, can play a central role in explaining why the price of nontradables

accounts for a nontrivial fraction of the variability of Mexico’s real exchange rate in periods of

exchange rate management.

3.     Sudden Stops & Nontradables-Driven Real Exchange Rate Volatility

       Section 2 showed that in periods in which Mexico managed its exchange rate, the relative

price of nontradables accounted for a significant fraction of the high variability of the real

exchange rate. This evidence raises the question: should we be concerned about volatility of the

real exchange rate driven by nontradables goods prices? This Section argues that we should. The

main argument is that, in economies that suffer from liability dollarization, the Sudden Stop

phenomenon and the high variability of the real exchange rate may both be the result of high

volatility in nontradables goods prices. To make this argument, the Section examines a simple

model in which endogenous credit constraints and liability dollarization produce a financial

accelerator mechanism that amplifies the responses of consumption, the current account, the

price of nontradables and the real exchange rate to exogenous shocks.

       Credit frictions and liability dollarization have been widely studied in the Sudden Stops

literature. The goal here is to provide a basic framework that highlights how balance sheet effects

and the Fisherian deflation process interact to trigger high volatility of the real exchange rate and

Sudden Stops. The mechanism is similar to the ones that have been explored in more detail in the

studies reviewed by Arellano and Mendoza (2003), particularly the two-sector dynamic

stochastic equilibrium setup of Mendoza (2002).

       Consider a conventional non-stochastic intertemporal equilibrium setup of a two-sector,

representative-agent small open economy with endowments of tradables (ytT ) and nontradables

(ytN ). The households of this economy solve the following problem:

Utility is defined in terms of a composite good c that depends on consumption of tradables (ctT )

and nontradables (ctN ). This composite good takes the form of a standard constant-elasticity-of-

substitution (CES) function, and the utility function u(⋅) is a standard increasing, twice-

continuously-differentiable and concave utility function. Since c is a CES aggregator, the

                                                                                        c2 ( cTt , ctN   )      ⎛ cT ⎞

where Φ is an increasing, strictly convex function of the ratio ctT / ctN. The price of tradables is

determined in competitive world markets and normalized to unity without loss of generality. ptN

denotes the price of nontradable goods relative to tradables.

       As is evident from the budget constraint (2), international debt contracts are denominated

in units of tradables, so this economy features liability dollarization. The only asset traded with

the rest of the world is a one-period bond that pays a constant gross real interest rate of R in units

of tradables.

       World credit markets are imperfect. In particular, constraint (3) states that foreign

creditors limit their lending to the small open economy so as to satisfy a liquidity constraint up to

a debt ceiling. The liquidity constraint limits debt to a fraction κ of the value of the economy’s

current income in units of tradables. The debt ceiling requires the debt allowed by the liquidity

constraint not to exceed a maximum level Ω. This maximum debt helps rule out “perverse”

equilibria in which agents could satisfy the liquidity constraint by running very large debts that

finance high levels of tradables consumption and prop up the price of nontradables.
                                                        -16-

        The above credit constraints can be the result of informational frictions or institutional

weaknesses affecting credit relationships (such as monitoring costs, limited enforcement, costly

information, etc). The contracting environment that yields the constraints is not modeled here

for simplicity. Instead, following the line of the studies on endogenous borrowing constraints

surveyed by Arellano and Mendoza (2003), we take the credit constraints as given to focus on

their implications for equilibrium allocations and prices. Note also that credit limits set in terms

of the debt-income ratio as in (3) are common practice in actual credit markets, particularly in

household mortgage and consumer loans.

        The government imposes a tax τt on private consumption of nontradable goods, which is

intended to approximate some of the effects of a change in the rate of depreciation of the

currency that would emerge in a monetary model in which money economizes transaction costs

or enters in the utility function (see Mendoza (2001)).3 The government also maintains time-

invariant levels of unproductive government expenditures in tradables and nontradables,

(g T , g N ) , and it is assumed to run a balanced budget policy for simplicity. Hence, any movements

in the primary fiscal balance due to exogenous policy changes in the tax rate, or endogenous

movements in the price of nontradables, are offset via lump-sum rebates or taxes Tt. The

government’s budget constraint is therefore:

                                           τt ptN ctN = g T + ptN g N + Tt                                      (4)

        A competitive equilibrium for this economy is a sequence of allocations ⎡⎣ cTt , ctN ,Tt , bt +1 ⎤⎦ 0

and prices ⎡⎣ ptN ⎤⎦ 0 such that: (a) the allocations represent a solution to the households’ problem

  Adao, Correia and Teles (2005), Coleman (1996), and Mendoza and Uribe (2001) provide other examples in which
the equilibria of monetary economies with alternative exchange rate regimes, and with or without nominal rigidities,
can be reproduced in non-monetary economies with appropriate combinations of tax-equivalent distortions.

expenditures, private consumption of nontradables and the relative price of nontradables, and (c)

the following market-clearing condition in the nontradables sector holds:

                                             ctN + g N = ytN                                     (5)

Note also that given (2), (4) and (5), the resource constraint in the tradables sector is:

                                       cTt + gt = yTt − bt +1 + Rbt                              (6)

       The analysis that follows shows that, in the economy described by equations (1)-(6), the

responses of consumption, the current account, the real exchange rate, and the price of

nontradables to exogenous shocks exhibit endogenous amplification via a financial accelerator

mechanism when the credit constraints bind, and that this mechanism operates via balance-sheet

and Fisherian-deflation effects triggered by movements in the relative price of nontradables.

Since other studies have examined the quantitative implications of more sophisticated variants of

this model that incorporate uncertainty, incomplete financial markets, and labor demand and

supply decisions in the nontradables sector (see Mendoza (2002)), we focus here on the key

aspects of the economic intuition behind the model’s financial accelerator.

Equilibrium when the Credit Constraints Never Bind: Perfectly Smooth Consumption

       Consider first a scenario in which the credit constraints never bind. In this case, the

model yields an equilibrium identical to the one that would be obtained with perfect credit

markets. The economy borrows or lends at the world-determined interest rate with no other

limitation that the standard No-Ponzi-Game condition, which requires the present value of

tradables absorption to equal the tradables sector’s wealth. The latter is composed of

nonfinancial wealth (W0) and financial wealth (Rb0), so that the economy faces this intertemporal

budget constraint:
                     ∞           ∞
                     ∑ R−tcTt =∑ R−t ( yTt − g T ) + Rb0
                     t =0       t =0
                                                           = W0 −     ( R R− 1 )g   T
                                                                                        + Rb0    (7)


       Next we adopt a set of assumptions that imply that, when the credit frictions never bind,
                                                              -18-

the equilibrium reduces to a textbook case of perfectly smooth consumption. In particular,

assume that the economy satisfies the traditional stationarity condition βR=1 and that the

nontradables output is time invariant ( ytN = y N for all t). Hence, it follows from (5) and the

standard Euler equation for tradables consumption that cTt = c T for all t. The intertemporal

constraint in (7) implies then that the equilibrium sequence of tradables consumption is perfectly

smooth at this level:

                                         c T = (1 − β )[W0 + Rb0 ] − g T                                      (8)

In addition, the optimality condition that equates the marginal rate of substitution in consumption

of tradables and nontradables with the after-tax relative price of nontradables implies that the

equilibrium price of nontradables is:

                                  c2 ( c T , y N − g N      )                   ⎛ cT         ⎞⎟
                   ptN = pt N =                               (1 + τt )−1   = Φ ⎜⎜ N          ⎟ (1 + τt )−1   (9)
                                  c1 ( c , y
                                       T       N
                                                   −g   N
                                                            )                   ⎜⎝ y − g N   ⎠⎟


Since consumption of tradables is perfectly smooth and both the endowment and government

consumption of nontradables are time-invariant by assumption, the result in (9) states that any

variations in the relative price of nontradables result only from government-induced variations in

the tax on nontradables consumption. Tax policy is neutral in the sense that variations in the tax

alter the price of nontradables but not consumption allocations or the current account. Thus, if

credit constraints never bind, tax-induced real devaluations are neutral (i.e., changes in the

exchange rate regime make no difference for the behavior of the real exchange rate).

       As long as the credit constraints do not bind, the results in (8) and (9) hold for any time-

varying, deterministic, non-negative stream of tradables endowments. To compare this perfectly

smooth equilibrium with the equilibrium of the economy with binding credit constraints, we

study a particular stream of tradables income that provides an incentive for the economy to

borrow at date 0. Using standard concepts from the Permanent Income Theory of consumption,

we can define an arbitrary time-varying sequence of tradables endowments as an equivalent
                                                         -19-

sequence with a time-invariant endowment (or “permanent income”). Hence, the level of

nonfinancial wealth in (7) satisfies: y T = (1 − β )W0 , where y T is the time-invariant tradables

endowment that yields the same present value of tradables income (i.e., the same wealth) as a

given time-varying sequence paid to households. Define then a “wealth neutral” shock to date-0

tradables income as a change in the date-0 endowment offset by a change in the date-1

endowment that keeps the present value of the two constant (leaving the rest of the sequence of

tradables income in W0 unchanged). Thus, wealth neutral shocks to date-0 income satisfy:

                                           yT
                                            1 −y
                                                 T
                                                   = β −1 ( y T − yT0   )                            (10)

Condition (10) states that, if the date-0 endowment falls below permanent income, the date-1

endowment increases above permanent income by enough to keep the present value constant.

        Clearly, for any 0 < yT0 < y T < y1T that satisfies (10) and for which the credit constraints

do not bind, the economy maintains the perfectly smooth equilibrium with these results:

                    c T = ( 1 − β )[W0 + Rb0 ] − g T
                               ⎛ cT        ⎞⎟
                     pt N = Φ ⎜⎜ N          ⎟ ( 1 + τt )−1                                           (11)
                              ⎜⎝ y − g N   ⎠⎟
                    b1 − b0 = yT0 − y ,         b2 − b1 = − ( b1 − b0 ) , bt = b0 for t ≥ 2


Hence, consumption allocations and the price of nontradables remain at their first-best levels,

and there is a current account deficit at date-0 of equal size as the current account surplus at date

1. Thus, the economy reduces asset holdings below b0 at date 0 (i.e., borrows), and returns to its

initial asset position at date 1. Policy-induced real devaluations of the currency are still neutral

with respect to all of these outcomes.

The Economy with Binding Credit Constraints

        Now consider unanticipated, wealth-neutral shocks to y0T that satisfy condition (10). If

the shock to y0T is not large enough to trigger the credit constraints, the solutions obtained in (11)

still hold, but if the shock lowers y0T to a level at or below a critical level, it will make the

liquidity constraint bind. This critical level is given by:
                                                              -20-

                                                      y T − b0 − κp0N y N
                                              yˆT =                                                                (12)
                                                             1+κ

Since we restrict the analysis to strictly positive endowments, condition (12) also implies an

                               ⎛     b ⎞ ⎛p y         N   N   ⎞⎟
upper bound for κ : κ < κh = ⎜⎜⎜ 1 − T0 ⎟⎟⎟ ⎜⎜⎜ 0 T            ⎟.   If κ exceeds this critical value, the model
                               ⎝    y ⎠ ⎝ y                   ⎠⎟


allows for enough debt so that the liquidity constraint never binds for any positive value of y0T.

On the other hand, κ has a lower bound at the level at which satisfying the liquidity constraint

would make tradables consumption and the nontradables price fall to zero:

           g T − yT0 − Rb0
κ > κl =
                 yT0

         A critical observation about the result in (12) is that, for a given wealth-neutral pair (y0T,

y1T ), a sufficiently large and unanticipated tax increase at date 0 (i.e., a policy-induced real

depreciation) can also move the economy below the critical level of tradables income, and thus

trigger the credit constraints, because it lowers the price of nontradables and the value of the

nontradables endowment. Since, as shown below, this affects the equilibrium outcomes of

consumption, the current account, the price of nontradables, and the real exchange rate, a policy-

induced real depreciation of the currency is no longer neutral once the credit constraints bind.

Now alternative policy regimes yield very different outcomes for real exchange rate behavior.

         Assume a debt ceiling set at Ω = −b1 for simplicity. For shocks that put y0T below its

critical level, triggering the liquidity constraint, equilibrium allocations and prices for date 0 are:

                                      cT0 = yT0 − g T + κ ⎡⎣ yT0 + p0N y N ⎤⎦ + Rb0                                (13)

                                                    ⎛    cT           ⎞⎟
                                           p0N = Φ ⎜⎜ N 0 N            ⎟( 1 + τ 0 )−1                              (14)
                                                    ⎜⎝ y − g          ⎠⎟


                                     b1 − b0 = −κ ⎡⎣ yT0 + p0N y N ⎤⎦ − b0 > Ω − b0                                (15)

Since b1 = −κ ⎡⎣ yT0 + p0N y N ⎤⎦ > b1 , it is clearly the case that cT0 < c T , p0N < p0N , b1 − b0 > b1 − b0 .

Thus, when the credit constraint binds, tradables consumption and the price of nontradables are
                                                 -21-

lower than in the perfectly smooth case, and the current account is higher. In other words, for

shocks that put the tradables endowment below the critical level, the economy responds with a

drop in tradables consumption, a real depreciation and a current account reversal (i.e., a Sudden

Stop takes place).

       The above argument is similar to Calvo’s (1998): if the country cannot borrow, tradables

consumption falls and this lowers the price of nontradables, which via a balance sheet effect and

the liability dollarization feature of the credit constraint validates the country’s reduced

borrowing ability. The difference with Calvo’s setup is that the equilibrium characterized by

conditions (13)-(15) features also Fisher’s debt-deflation mechanism.

       The Fisherian deflation amplifies the responses of quantities and prices. In particular, the

date-0 tradables consumption and price of nontradables are determined by solving the two-

equation system formed by (13)-(14). Equation (13) shows that tradables consumption depends

on the nontradables price when the credit constraint binds because of liability dollarization:

changes in the value of the nontradables endowment affect the agents’ ability to borrow in

tradables-denominated debt. Equation (14) shows that the price of nontradables depends on the

consumption of tradables via the standard optimality condition for sectoral consumption

allocations. The Fisherian deflation occurs then because, as tradables consumption falls, the price

of nontradables falls, and as this price falls the credit constraint tightens, which makes tradables

consumption fall more, which then makes the price of nontradables fall more.

       Figure 2 illustrates the determination of the date-0 equilibrium when this Fisherian

deflation process is at work. The vertical line TT represents the perfectly smooth tradables

consumption allocation, which is independent of the price of nontradables. The PP curve

represents the optimality condition for sectoral consumption allocations, which equates the

marginal rate of substitution between tradables and nontradables with the corresponding after tax

relative price (i.e., equation (14)). Since the consumption aggregator is CES and nontradables
                                                   -22-

consumption is constant at y N − g N , PP is an increasing, convex function of tradables

consumption. TT and PP intersect at the equilibrium price of the perfectly smooth consumption

case (point A).

        The SS line represents equation (13), which is the tradables resource constraint when the

liquidity constraint binds. SS is an upward-sloping, linear function of tradables consumption with

a slope of 1 κy N . Since the horizontal intercept of SS is Rb0 − g T + (1 + κ)yT0 , SS shifts to the left

as y0T falls. In Figure 2, SS corresponds to the case when yT0 = yˆT , so that tradables output is just

at the point where the credit constraint is marginally binding. In this case, SS intersects TT and

PP at point A, so that the outcome with constrained debt is the same as the perfectly smooth case.

        Consider a wealth-neutral shock to the date-0 tradables endowment such that yT0 < yˆT .

The SS curve shifts to SS’ and the new equilibrium is determined at point D. If prices did not

respond to the drop in consumption, or if the borrowing constraint were set as a fixed amount

independent of income and prices, the new equilibrium would be at point B. At B, however,

tradables consumption is lower than in the perfectly smooth case, so equilibrium requires the

price of nontradables to fall. If the credit constraint were independent on the nontradables price

(as, for example, in the setup of Calvo (1998)), the new equilibrium would be at point C, with a

lower nontradables price and lower tradables consumption. This outcome reflects the balance

sheet effect induced by liability dollarization. But at C the Fisherian deflation is not yet taken

into account. With the lower price at C in the PP line, the liquidity constraint tightens because

the value of the nontradables endowment falls, forcing tradables consumption to fall so as to

satisfy the constraint at a point in SS’, but at that point the nontradables price must fall again to

re-attain a point along PP, but at that point tradables consumption falls again because the credit

constraint tightens further. This Fisherian debt-deflation process continues until it converges to

point D, at which the liquidity constraint is satisfied for a nontradables price and a level of
                                                  -23-

tradables consumption that are also consistent with the equilibrium condition for sectoral

consumption allocations. In short, the response to the tradables endowment shock, which would

be at point A for any shock that satisfies yT0 ≥ yˆT , is amplified to point D because of the

combined effects of the balance sheet effect and the Fisherian deflation.

        The above results apply also to the case in which there is no shock to the tradables

endowment but the government increases τ0 by enough so that the resulting fall in p0N puts
            T
yˆT above y0 . In this case, a policy change that could be intended to yield a “small” real

depreciation of the currency can trigger the credit constraint, and result in a large current account

reversal and collapses in tradables consumption, the price of nontradables and the real exchange

rate. The policy neutrality of the perfectly smooth case no longer holds.

        One caveat of this analysis is that for low enough y0T the economy would not be able to

borrow at the competitive equilibrium. This occurs when y0T is so low that the level of debt that

satisfies the liquidity constraint exceeds Ω (or, in this case, the debt that would be contracted in

the perfectly smooth equilibrium). Setting debt at this debt ceiling would imply a nontradables

price at which the liquidity constraint is violated, but on the other hand, the debt level that

satisfies (13)-(14), so that the liquidity constraint holds, would violate the debt ceiling. At

corners like these, debt is set to zero and the economy is in financial autarky. In the remainder of

this paper we concentrate on situations in which shocks result in values yT0 ≤ yˆT such that there

are internal solutions with debt (i.e., solutions for which Ω is not binding).

        Further analysis of Figure 2 could raise questions about the existence and uniqueness of

the equilibrium with Fisherian deflation, depending on assumptions about the position and slope

of the SS line and the curvature of the PP curve. The model produces results that shed light on

this issue, but these are highly dependent on the simplicity of the setup, which was motivated by

the interest in deriving tractable analytical results to illustrate the effects of the Fisherian
                                                         -24-

deflation. Hence, the following results regarding the conditions that can produce or rule out

multiple equilibria need to be considered with caution, as they may not be robust to important

extensions of the model (like including uncertainty, capital accumulation or a labor market).

         Figure 2 suggests that a sufficiency condition to ensure a unique equilibrium with

Fisherian deflation (for cases with yT0 ≤ yˆT that yield internal solutions with debt) is that the PP

curve be flatter than the SS line around point A. Since SS is an upward-sloping, linear function

and PP is increasing and strictly convex, this assumption ensures that the two curves intersect

only once in the interval between 0 and c T .4

         Given (13) and (14), the assumption that PP is flatter than SS around A implies that:

                                                                        ⎛ c T ⎞⎟

where 1/(1+μ) is the elasticity of substitution in consumption of tradables and nontradables.

This condition sets an upper bound for the liquidity coefficient κ (different from the upper bound

identified earlier, which determined a value of κ that is high enough to make the liquidity

constraint irrelevant). Since in most countries the nontradables sector is at least as large as the

tradables sector, and consumption of tradables is lower than tradables output, it follows that z <1.

Hence, (16) states that the sufficiency condition for a unique equilibrium with Fisherian deflation

requires the liquidity coefficient to be lower than the fraction z of the elasticity of substitution.

         Existing empirical studies for developing countries show that the elasticity of substitution

is less than unitary, ranging between 0.4 and 0.83 (see Ostry and Reinhart (1992), Mendoza

(1995), Gonzales and Neumeyer (2003) and Lorenzo, Aboal and Osimani (2003)). The sectoral

data for Mexico reported by Mendoza (2002) show that, on average over the 1988-1998 period,

estimates of the elasticity of substitution (i.e., 1/(1+μ) = 0.83). With this elasticity and z =0.43,

condition (16) implies κ < 0.357. This result also meets the condition required for the credit

which the model yields a unique equilibrium with Fisherian deflation is in line with the data.

Quantitative Implications: Balance Sheet Effect v. Fisherian Deflation Effect

              What are the relative magnitudes of the balance-sheet and Fisherian-deflation effects that

move the economy from A to D in Figure 2? The Figure suggests that, for a given value of the

tradables endowment shock, the magnitude of the two effects depends on the curvature of the SS

and PP curves, which in turn depends on the relative magnitudes of the liquidity coefficient and

the sectoral elasticity of substitution in consumption.

              A lower liquidity coefficient increases the slope of the SS curve. This strengthens the

balance sheet effect but its effect on the Fisherian deflation is not monotonic. Starting from a

high κ at which the credit constraint was just marginally binding (and hence the Fisherian

deflation effect was irrelevant), lowering κ strengthens the Fisherian deflation. As κ falls further,

however, the Fisherian deflation weakens because the feedback between the nontradables price

and the ability to borrow weakens (in the limit, for κ = 0 there is no Fisherian deflation, but this

is also the case when κ is too high for the credit constraint to ever bind). A higher elasticity of




to finance this high consumption. This outcome is not an equilibrium, however, because the resulting debt level
violates the debt ceiling (which is the debt of the perfectly smooth case implicit at point A).
                                                                 -26-

substitution between tradables and nontradables makes the PP curve flatter, which strengthens

both the balance sheet effect and the Fisherian deflation.

         The following numerical experiments illustrate the potential magnitudes of the balance-

sheet and Fisherian-deflation effects, using a set of parameter values and calibration assumptions

that match some empirical evidence from Mexico. We consider a Constant Relative Risk

Aversion (CRRA) period utility function, u(c ) = ( c1−σ ) /(1 − σ ) , and a CES aggregator for sectoral

                                                     −1/ μ
consumption, c = ⎣⎡ a(cT )−μ + (1 − a )(c N )−μ ⎦⎤           .

         The subjective discount factor and the coefficient of relative risk aversion are set to

standard values of β =0.96 and σ =2. We take Mendoza’s (2002) estimate of the share parameter

of the CES aggregator for Mexico, a =0.342. The elasticity of substitution between tradables and

nontradables is set to the upper bound of the range of estimates cited earlier (0.83), which

implies μ =0.204.

         The model is calibrated to match Mendoza’s (2002) estimates of Mexico’s ratio of

nontradables GDP to tradables GDP at current prices (1.543), and the sectoral shares of tradables

(nontradables) consumption in tradables (nontradables) GDP, which are 66 and 71 percent

respectively. Total “permanent” output is normalized to 1, so that the results of the quantitative

experiments can be interpreted as shares of “permanent” GDP. We also allow for “permanent”

absorption of tradables and nontradables that include government purchases and private

investment, so that the model can match the observed consumption-output ratios. The tax rate is

set to zero, which implies a baseline scenario in which government expenditures are financed

with lump sump taxation. Initial external debt is set to 1/3 of permanent GDP, in the range of the

time series of the net foreign asset-GDP ratio produced for Mexico by Lane and Milesi-Ferretti

(1999). With these calibrated parameter values, the perfectly smooth equilibrium yields

consumption allocations c T = 0.26, c N = 0.56 , and an equilibrium price of nontradables of
                                                   -27-

p N = 0.77 , so that the aggregate consumption-output      ratio matches the ratio from Mexican data:

(c T   + p N c N ) / ( y T + p N y N ) = 0.69 .


           Figure 3 illustrates the quantitative predictions of the model for a range of values of the

liquidity coefficient 0.21<κ<35, assuming a shock that lowers yT0 to a level 3 percent below its

permanent level. The lower bound of the liquidity coefficient is the lowest value of κ that can

support positive tradables consumption with a binding liquidity constraint. The upper bound is

the highest value of κ at which the constraint still binds (higher values would imply that the

credit constraint does not bind for the 3 percent shock to tradables income, so that the perfectly

smooth equilibrium would be maintained).

           Figure 3.a shows the bond position of the economy at date 0 in three situations: the

continuous curve is for the economy with the binding credit constraint, the dotted line is for the

economy with perfect credit markets, and the dashed line is the value of the fraction κ of income

valued at tradables goods prices in this same economy (i.e., it shows the value of bonds that

would satisfy the liquidity constraint at the nontradables price of the perfectly smooth

equilibrium). The credit constraint binds whenever the dashed line is above the dotted line. The

vertical distance between the dashed line and the continuous curve represents the effect of the

endogenous collapse in the price of nontradables on the ability to contract debt. This effect

grows very rapidly as κ falls, and it can imply a correction in the debt position (and in the current

account) of over 10 percentage points of permanent GDP.

           Figures 3b and 3c illustrate the effects of the credit constraints on tradables consumption,

the relative price of nontradables, and the real exchange rate (measuring each as a percent

deviation from their values in the perfectly smooth equilibrium). The plots decompose the total

effect of the constraints on tradables consumption and the nontradables price into two

components, one that represents the balance sheet effect and another representing the Fisherian
                                                 -28-

deflation. The total effect corresponds to a comparison of points A and D in Figure 2. The

balance sheet effect compares A and C, and the Fisherian deflation compares C and D.

        The negative effects of the liquidity constraint on tradables consumption and the relative

price of nontradables are large and grow rapidly as κ falls. With κ set at 33 percent, tradables

consumption and the price of nontradables fall by nearly 50 percent, and the CPI-based measure

of the real exchange rate (i.e., the CES price index associated with the CES aggregator of

sectoral consumption) falls nearly 37 percent. These declines are driven mainly by the Fisherian

deflation, as the contribution of the pure balance sheet effect is less than 7 percent for both

tradables consumption and the price of nontradables.

        The effect of the Fisherian deflation is strongest with κ around 30 percent, and it becomes

weaker for lower values of κ. In the worst-case scenario, with κ at 20 percent, tradables

consumption and the nontradables price approach zero. However, even for these low values of

the liquidity coefficient, the contribution to the collapses in consumption and prices are split

about 50-50 between the balance sheet effect and the Fisherian deflation. Hence, the contribution

of the Fisherian deflation process is at least as large as that of the balance sheet effect.

        Figure 3d shows the welfare cost of the Sudden Stops shown in Figures 3a-3c. Welfare

costs are computed as compensating variations in a time-invariant consumption level that equates

lifetime utility in the economy with credit constraints with that of the economy with perfect

credit markets (in which the perfectly smooth equilibrium prevails at all times). With κ at 33

percent, the welfare loss measures 1.1 percent, and the loss increases rapidly as κ falls.

         Figure 4 shows a similar set of results as Figure 3 but for adverse shocks to the date-0

tradables endowment of different magnitudes, fixing κ at 34 percent. The shocks range between

0 and 12.4 percent of the permanent tradables endowment (1-0.124 = 0.876 and 1 in the

horizontal axes of the plots). Notice that in this experiment the smallest shock for which the
                                                 -29-

liquidity constraint begins to bind is 1.9 percent, so shocks between 0 and 1.9 percent do not

trigger the constraint and yield the perfectly smooth equilibrium. The upper bound of the shocks

at 12.4 percent is the largest shock that satisfies the maximum debt constraint (i.e., the constraint

stating that debt must not exceed the level corresponding to the perfectly smooth equilibrium).

       The adjustment in the debt position is severe and increases rapidly with the size of the

shock. A 5 percent shock to the tradables endowment implies a reduction in debt of about 15

percentage points of permanent income. Tradables consumption and the price of nontradables

fall about 60 percent below the levels of the perfectly smooth equilibrium, with most of the

decline accounted for by the Fisherian deflation. The CPI-based measure of the real exchange

rate falls by about 47 percent. The welfare loss implied by the Sudden Stops triggered by this 5

percent shock measures 1.7 percent in terms of a compensating variation in a lifetime-utility-

equivalent level of consumption. All these effects (except the contribution of the Fisherian

deflation) grow rapidly as the size of the shock increases.

       Finally, consider a policy experiment that switches from the tax rate consistent with a

fixed exchange rate (i.e., τ =0) to a floating rate for which the rate of depreciation of the currency

settles at levels consistent with a fixed, positive value of τ (alternatively, this experiment can be

viewed as a case in which the government aims to induce a real depreciation by increasing τ).

This experiment sets yT0 = yˆT , which by construction implies that at a zero tax rate the credit

constraint is marginally binding (i.e., at τ = 0 the economy is at point A in Figure 2). Figure 5

shows the results of tax increases varying from 0 to 5 percent. Note that, since for a zero tax rate

and yT0 = yˆT the credit constraint is marginally binding, and since with a non-binding credit

constraint the tax hike would induce at most a real depreciation of 3 percent (if the tax were

raised to the 5-percent maximum), the government could have good reason to expect that the tax

hike should induce a “small’ real depreciation. As the plots in Figure 5 show, however, the actual
                                                -30-

outcome would deviate sharply from this expectation because increasing the tax triggers the

credit constraint. Increasing the tax rate by 5 percentage points induces a correction of 8

percentage points of permanent tradables income in the net foreign asset position of the

economy. Consumption falls by 30 percent relative to the perfectly smooth equilibrium, the

relative price of nontradables falls by 35 percent, and the real exchange rate depreciates by about

23 percent. As in the other two experiments, the amplification in the declines of consumption,

the price of nontradables, and the real exchange rate is largely due to the Fisherian debt-deflation

effect, with a negligible contribution of the balance sheet effect. This policy-induced real

depreciation results in a welfare loss of nearly 0.4 percent in terms of a stationary tradables

consumption path.

       In summary, the results of these numerical experiments suggest that, in the presence of

liability dollarization and credit-market frictions, the Fisherian deflation mechanism can be an

important source of amplification and asymmetry in the response of emerging economies to

negative shocks. The Fisherian deflation causes large declines in consumption and the price of

nontradables, as well as large real depreciations and large reversals in the current account.

Moroever, in this environment, policy-induced real depreciations can trigger the credit

constraints and the Fisherian deflation mechanism, and therefore they can induce collapses in the

price of nontradables and large real depreciations of the currency. These results suggest that the

Fisherian deflation mechanism may help account for the empirical observation that the relative

price of nontradables accounts for a significant fraction of the variability of the real exchange

rate in economies with managed exchange rate regimes.

4.     Conclusions

       This paper reported empirical evidence based on Mexican and U.S. monthly data for the

1969-2000 period showing that fluctuations in Mexico’s relative price of nontradable goods

account for 50 to 70 percent of the variability of the Mexico-U.S. real exchange rate when
                                                 -31-

Mexico was under a managed exchange rate regime. The main lesson drawn from this evidence,

and from cross-country studies by Naknoi (2005) and Parsley (2003) showing that this is a robust

result across developing countries, is that the behavior of the determinants of the real exchange

rate differs sharply between countries with features similar to Mexico’s and the industrial

countries to which variance analysis of real exchange rates is normally applied. In particular, the

overwhelming role of movements in prices of tradable goods and nominal exchange rates found

in industrial countries, or in developing countries with floating exchange rates, is sharply

diminished in developing countries with managed exchange rates.

       The finding that in a typical emerging economy like Mexico, large fluctuations in the real

exchange rate can be driven by movements in the relative price of nontradables during periods of

exchange rate management, suggests that the phenomenon of liability dollarization emphasized

in the Sudden Stops literature deserves more attention. This paper proposed a basic model to

illustrate how liability dollarization introduces amplification and asymmetry in the responses of

the economy to adverse shocks via a financial accelerator that combines a balance sheet effect

with Irving Fisher’s debt-deflation mechanism. The balance sheet effect and the Fisherian

deflation result in collapses in the real exchange rate that are driven by collapses in the relative

price of nontradables. A set of basic numerical experiments suggests that the quantitative

implications of these frictions, particularly the effects of the Fisherian deflation, can be

significant. Of particular interest are the results for a policy-induced real depreciation (or a shift

from a fixed exchange rate regime to a constant, positive rate of depreciation), showing that this

paper’s financial accelerator can produce large collapses in the relative price of nontradables, the

real exchange rate and consumption, together with a large current account reversal (starting from

a situation in which credit constraints were marginally binding).

       The results indicating that roughly a half of the variability of the real exchange rate can

be attributed to movements in nontradables goods prices are in line with the quantitative findings
                                                -32-

that the recent literature on the business cycle implications of exchange rate management has

produced (see Mendoza and Uribe (2001)). Further empirical research along the lines of the

studies by Naknoi (2005) and Parsley (2003) should focus on comparing the experiences of

industrial and developing countries so as to shed more light on whether variance analysis of

other real exchange rates pairing emerging markets with industrial countries display similar

sensitiveness to the exchange-rate regime as the peso-dollar real exchange rate. In addition,

further analysis is needed to examine whether the role of the nontradables price in accounting for

real-exchange-rate variability depends on the degree of liability dollarization of the economy.

       The analysis undertaken here avoided intentionally taking a position on the best modeling

strategy to account for the nontrivial fraction of real-exchange-rate variability explained by

movements in tradable goods prices and the nominal exchange rate. In particular, the evidence

reported here for periods without exchange rate management, in which a large fraction of real-

exchange-rate variability is due to changes in relative prices of tradable goods and the nominal

exchange rate, does not suggest per se that one should view fluctuations in the variable x as

deviations from the law of one price or evidence of price or wage stickiness. It simply shows

how much x (i.e., the ratio of exchange-rate-adjusted CPI prices of durable goods across Mexico

and the United States) contributes to explain the variance of the ratio of exchange-rate-adjusted

aggregate CPIs. This is distant from the ideal scenario needed to interpret changes in x as

deviations from the law of one price. The law of one price applies to single, homogeneous goods

sold in a freely-accessible market and in the absence of frictions like transportation costs and tax

or tariff distortions. Clearly, aggregate data for the CPIs of Mexico and the United States violate

these conditions. The goods included in these indexes are different, carry different weights, and

the weights change a different intervals. Access to a “common market” has varied widely over

the sample period and across goods, and similar caveats apply to transportation costs and tariffs.

       There are detailed studies on purchasing power parity (PPP) and the law of one price that
                                                -33-

take the above issues into account, and still find evidence of large price differentials for highly

disaggregated consumer goods. Some researchers are concerned with the impossibility of

defining a pure concept of “tradable” goods as required by the law of one, and are thus studying

the “degree of tradability of goods” (see Betts and Kehoe (2000)) or distribution costs (see

Busrtein, Neves, and Rebelo (2000)).

       The treatment of the data in the empirical analysis conducted here abstracts from

medium- to low-frequency considerations, including those related to mean-reverting properties

of real exchange rates and to the long-run determination of real exchange rates. However,

research in this direction is also inconclusive, as the survey by Froot and Rogoff (1995) shows.

For example, Asea and Mendoza (1994) find that while the data support predictions of long-run

neoclassical models in which cross-country differences in the relative price of nontradable goods

reflect differences in productivity across sectors that produce tradables and nontradables,

measures of the long-run relative price of nontradables do poorly in explaining cross-country

differences in CPI-based measures of the real exchange rate. At medium time frequencies, it is

interesting to note that the variance ratios based on 72-month differences of the data, which

correspond to the six-year periodicity of recent Mexican business cycles, the contribution of

variable x to the variance of the real exchange rate is about 65 percent (both for the full sample

and for the period of the managed exchange rate that ended in 1994).

       The findings of this paper provide an argument in favor of policies that seek to stabilize

the real value of the currency. Traditional exchange rate management is not useful because

currency collapses trigger large movements in relative prices together with Sudden Stops in

consumption and the current account. Instead, the model favors policies that can be successful at

preventing large fluctuations in the real exchange rate. The setup of the model suggests in

particular the use of sectoral tax policy, which would seek to contain the deflationary pressure on

the relative price of nontradables as this pressure builds up. However, this policy can be
                                                 -34-

interpreted more broadly to consider policies that can remove the liability dollarization problem

(for example, the full adoption of a hard currency as the domestic currency) or monetary policies

under “de jure” floating exchange rates that can prove effective to prevent large swings in the

real value of the currency (as many emerging countries that claim adherence to inflation

targeting rules could be showing in practice).

       An alternative to policies that prevent large fluctuations in the relative price of

nontradables is to consider changing the nature of emerging economies’ debt instruments to

make them less susceptible to the adverse effects of balance sheet and Fisherian deflation effects.

This is in line with recent proposals favoring issuing bonds only in domestic currencies or

indexed to the evolution of output or key commodity prices (as was done by Argentina in its

recent debt conversion using partially bonds indexed to output). However, whether emerging

economies can be successful at establishing liquid markets for these instruments unilaterally, or

whether there is enough interest in them in world financial markets, remains an open question.

Clearly, if creating markets for the state-contingent claims that can neutralize financial

accelerator mechanisms driving Sudden Stops is feasible, this is the most preferable policy. But

assuming that this is not feasible, domestic policies aimed at stabilizing the relative price of

nontradables are an appealing alternative.
