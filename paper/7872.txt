1. Introduction: Currency Unions and “Home Bias”

        Is “dollarization” associated with enhanced international economic integration?1 We

examine the behavior of countries that are or have been members of international currency unions,

and ask whether existing currency unions replicate the desirable features of optimal currency areas

as set out by Mundell (1961). Specifically, we ask whether the countries and political units that

constitute currency unions are as integrated economically as regions within nations. We find that

while a common currency enhances economic integration, the degree of integration is far smaller

than within nations

        A number of studies have shown that national borders inhibit economic integration. Internal

trade is disproportionately large compared to international trade; relative prices are more stable

inside countries than across national boundaries; domestic assets tend to be held disproportionately,

and so forth. Perhaps the large size of this “border effect” is mostly the result of exchange rate

volatility or, more generally, the consequence of having different national moneys. The objective of

this paper is to investigate this hypothesis.

        This paper is empirical. Our strategy is to exploit data on the many existing currency unions.

We differentiate between intranational political unions (i.e., sovereign states with a single currency

but also common laws, political environments, cultures, and so forth), and international currency

unions (i.e., sovereign countries that have delegated monetary policy to some international or foreign

authority but retain sovereignty in other domains). The United States, France, and the United

Kingdom are examples of political unions. Behavior of regions within these countries is the focus of

the emerging literature on intranational economics (Hess and van Wincoop (2000), Bachetta, Rose

and van Wincoop, 2001). The CFA Franc Zone, and the East Caribbean Currency Area are

examples of currency unions.
                                                        2


        Our approach is to ask whether currency unions exhibit the type of economic integration that

Mundell (1961) argues is desirable for an “optimum currency area”. We measure a number of

economic characteristics for international monetary unions, intranational political unions and other

countries. Mundell’s framework implies that the gains from a common currency are proportional to

the size of international transactions. Using disaggregated international trade data, we find that

currency unions are more open and more specialized than non-currency union countries of

comparable size. More directly, we examine international trade patterns. Using a gravity equation,

we find that trade between members of a currency union (e.g., Brunei and Singapore) is indeed much

higher than trade between comparable countries with their own currencies, by a factor of over three.

However, even this sizable effect is small in comparison with the “home market bias” which shows

that intranational trade is higher than international trade by a factor of almost twenty, even for units

of comparable economic size. That is, our estimates show that a hypothetical country which is as

large (in terms of population, GDP, geographic area and so forth) as Brunei and Singapore combined

would engage in much more intranational trade than Brunei and Singapore do in reality.

        We examine real exchange rates and deviations from purchasing power parity.2 The

volatility of real exchange rates is lower for members of currency unions than for countries with

independent currencies. But much of this effect stems from the fact that no currency union has

experienced a hyperinflation; low inflation countries with sovereign currencies have real exchange

rate volatility that is only modestly higher than that of currency union members. Currency union

members do not have detectably different rates of mean-reversion in their real exchange rates.

Compared to the benchmark of exchange rates between cities in comparably sized countries,

currency unions exhibit slightly more integrated prices.

        We also investigate other characteristics of currency unions. We find that business cycles are

systematically more highly correlated between members of currency unions than between countries
                                                        3


with sovereign currencies, but not as much as regions of a single country. Finally, we examine risk

sharing between members of currency unions and countries with independent currencies, by

examining consumption and income, and find only a small impact of currency union on risk

sharing.3

        We conclude that members of a common currency area are more economically integrated

than non-currency union members, but not nearly as much as those that are fully politically

integrated. That is, dollarized countries are more likely to satisfy Mundell’s criteria for being

members of an optimum currency area, but not nearly as much as regions within a single country.

        International trade entails foreign exchange transactions, unless it occurs between members

of common currency areas. While we ordinarily think of such costs as being small (at least for

OECD countries facing deep liquid foreign exchange markets), avoiding it seems to have non-trivial

consequences.4 So, currency unions may encourage integration. We are concerned with the

association between integration and currency unions. We do not consider whether causality flows

from integration to currency union (integrated countries are more likely to join and remain in

currency unions), in the reverse direction (currency union induces integration), or both.5

        In section 2 below, we provide a gross characterization of currency union members, taking

special note of their openness and specialization. We analyze the impact of currency union

membership on international trade in section 3, and the impact on prices in the section that follows.

Section 5 examines the international synchronization of business cycles, while section 6 looks at risk

sharing. The paper concludes with a brief summary and conclusion.



2. Characterizing Currency Union Members

        We begin our analysis of common currency areas by providing an aggregate description of

their members.
                                                       4




2.1 Openness

        Our first (macroeconomic) data set consists of annual observations for 210 “countries”

between 1960 and 1996 extracted from the 1998 World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI)

CD-ROM. The list of countries is tabulated in the appendix Table A2. This data set includes all

countries, territories, colonies and other entities covered by WDI (all are referred to as “countries”

for simplicity), and is extremely comprehensive.6 The data set has been checked and corrected for

mistakes.

        In this data set, some 1891 (country-year) observations (24% of the sample) were members

of a common currency area; the list of countries is tabulated in Table A1. We include: members of

common currency areas (such as Benin, a member of the CFA franc zone); countries which operated

without a sovereign currency (such as Panama which uses the US dollar); long-term 1:1 fixers where

there is substantial currency substitution and essentially no probability of a move from parity (such

as the Bahamas); and colonies, dependencies, overseas territories/departments/collectivities (such as

Guadeloupe). Anchor countries (such as the US and France), whose currencies are used by others,

are tabulated solely for reference (i.e., they are not included as currency-union members in our

empirical analysis).7

        Table 1 shows some descriptive statistics for both the whole sample of available

observations, and for (periphery) currency union members. The number of available observations is

tabulated along with the means and standard deviation. There is also a p-value for a t-test of equality

of means for currency union members and non-members.

        Table 1 indicates that members of currency unions tended to be poorer and smaller than non-

currency union members. Currency unions are associated with lower and more stable inflation.

However, they have lower ratios of M2 to GDP (a standard measure of financial depth), which may
                                                         5


be because they tend to be poor. A better indicator of their financial markets may be the fact that the

spread of the domestic loan rate above LIBOR tends to be lower (even after one has excluded high

inflation observations). The country-specific standard deviation of the output growth rate, a crude

measure of output volatility, seems to be similar for currency union members and non-members.

Finally, there is little indication that currency unions are associated with either more or less fiscal

discipline.

        What of openness? Currency unions are more open than countries with their own currencies.

Both exports and imports are larger as percentages of GDP to a degree that is both statistically

significant and economically important. Interestingly, while export duties are lower, import duties

are higher for currency union members, as is the importance of trade taxes. This is probably

because most currency union members have poorly developed income and value added tax bases.

Currency union members run current accounts that are larger (in absolute value) as a percentage of

GDP, and also more variable. Currency unions are also more open to private capital flows, and to

foreign direct investment. That is, both the intertemporal and the intratemporal evidence indicate

that currency union members are more open to capital than non-members.

        Succinctly, members of currency unions seem to be more open to international flows of

goods, services, and capital than countries with their own currencies. But one can overstate the

importance of these differences. Currency union members tend to be small countries, which are well

known to be more open than larger countries. Accordingly, in section 3 we control for size and

income in determining whether membership in a common currency area is systematically associated

with more intense trade.
                                                           6


2.2 Specialization

        Given that members of currency unions are more open to international influences than

countries with their own currencies, it is natural to ask if members of common currency areas are

also more specialized and therefore potentially more vulnerable to asymmetric industry shocks.

Kenen (1969) first discussed specialization in this context.

        One way to examine this question would be to compare production structures and see if

currency union members are more specialized in production. However the data set necessary to

examine this question does not exist. Nevertheless, it is possible to examine the patterns of

specialization exhibited by countries engaging in international trade. To examine specialization

patterns manifest in international trade, we exploit the “World Trade Data Base” (WTDB), the

second data set that we exploit extensively in this paper.

        The WTDB is a consistent recompilation of United Nations trade data, discussed in Feenstra,

Lipsey and Bowen (1997).8 The WTDB is estimated to cover at least 98% of all trade. Annual

observations of nominal trade values (recorded in thousands of American dollars) are available in the

WTDB for some 166 countries from 1970 through 1995; the countries in the WTDB data set are

tabulated in Appendix Table A3.9 These observations are available at the four-digit (“sub-group”)

Standard International Trade Classification (SITC) level (revision 2). There are a total of 897,939

observations in this three-dimensional panel (goods x countries x years). A typical observation is the

exports (totalling $740,000) from South Africa of SITC good 11 in 1970.10

        For each country-year observation, we compute the Herfindahl index, a measure of

specialization. The Herfindahl index is the sum of squared shares of the individual goods, defined

as:



                                  H it ≡ ∑ j ( xijt / X it ) 2   j = 1,K , J
                                                          7




where x ijt denotes the exports for country i of SITC subgroup j in year t, X it denotes total exports

for i in year t, and the summation is taken over all SITC subgroups. H is bounded by (0,1]; a high

value of H indicates that the country is specialized in the production of a few goods.

        We have some 3,045 country-year observations of the Herfindahl index for the WTDB. Of

these, 388 (some 13%) are for countries that are members of currency unions. As Table 2a shows,

Herfindahl indices for countries with their own currencies are systematically lower (averaging .23)

than those for members of currency unions (which average .31). That is, members of common

currency areas tend to be more specialized. The difference is not only of economic importance; it is

also statistically significant (the t-test for a difference in means is 5.7). Currency union members

also export (122) fewer sub-goods on average than countries with their own currencies, consistent

with the hypothesis of greater specialization (again, the difference is statistically significant with a t-

statistic of 17.7).

        It might be objected that currency union members are smaller and poorer than other

countries, so that more specialization is to be expected. We control for these other factors by

regressing the Herfindahl index on the Penn World Table (mark 5.6) measure of real GDP per capita,

population, and a dummy variable that is unity if the country-year observation is for a currency

union member. The results are tabulated in Table 2b. They show that our conclusions are

insensitive to the addition of controls for real GDP per capita, country size, and either country- or

time-specific fixed effects. Currency union members consistently have higher Herfindahl indices

and export smaller numbers of goods.11

        To summarize, members of currency unions are more open than countries with their own

currencies. They are also more specialized.12

3. Trade Integration

           In this section of the paper, we show that members of currency unions systematically engage

in more international trade. This question is of obvious interest since the benefits from using a

single money in terms of saved transactions costs depend on the amount of trade between two

regions, as recognized since at least Mundell (1961). We follow Rose (2000) in using a “gravity”

model of international trade as our framework. In particular, we ask whether bilateral trade between

two countries is higher if they both use the same currency, holding constant a variety of other

determinants of international trade.

           The large literature which employs the gravity model of international trade points to distance,

income levels and country size as being the most critical drivers of bilateral trade flows, a result

which we corroborate here. The precise model we employ is completely standard and can be

written:



       ln( X ij ) = γ CU ij + β0 + β1 ln( Dij ) + β2 ln( YiY j / Popi Pop j ) + β3 ln( YiY j ) + δ • Z ij + ε ij




where X ij denotes the value of bilateral trade between countries i and j, CU is a binary dummy

variable which is unity if i and j use the same currency and zero otherwise, Dij denotes the distance

between countries i and j, Y denotes real GDP, Pop denotes Population, Z denotes a vector of other

controls, the β and δ coefficients are nuisance coefficients, and ε denotes the residual impact of all

other factors driving trade . The coefficient of interest to us is γ, which measures the impact of a

common currency on international trade. A positive coefficient indicates that two countries that use

a common currency also tend to trade more.

           We begin by estimating this equation using 1995 data from the WTDB, augmented by data

from the UN International Trade Statistics Yearbook. Over 150 countries, dependencies, territories,
                                                          9


overseas departments, colonies, and so forth (referred to simply as “countries” below) for which the

United Nations Statistical Office collects international trade data are included in the data set.

Country location (used to calculate Great Circle distance) is taken from the CIA’s web site, which

also provides observation for other variables of interest such as: contiguity, official language,

colonial background, area, and so forth. 13 Real GDP and population are taken from the 1998 World

Bank World Development Indicators CD-ROM.14

        Estimation results are contained in Table 3. OLS is used, and robust standard errors are

recorded parenthetically. At the extreme left of the table, the simplest gravity model is employed;

that is, no auxiliary Z’s are included. The β coefficients indicate that the gravity model works well,

in two senses. First, the coefficient estimates are sensible and strong. Greater distance between two

countries lowers trade, while greater economic “mass” (proxied by real GDP and GDP per capita)

increases trade. These intuitive and plausible effects are in line with the estimates of the literature;

they are also of enormous statistical significance with t-statistics exceeding 20 (in absolute value).

Second, the equation fits the data well, explaining a high proportion of the cross-sectional variation

in trade patterns.

        While it is reassuring that the gravity model performs well, its role is strictly one of auxiliary

conditioning. We are interested in understanding the relationship between currency union

membership and trade flows after accounting for gravity effects. Even after taking out the effects of

output, size, and distance, there is a large effect of a common currency on trade. The point estimates

indicate that two countries that share a common currency trade together by a factor of exp(1.88) ≅

6.5! This effect is not only economically large, but also statistically significant at traditional

confidence levels (the t-statistic is 3.3).

        One can think of a number of reasons for this strong result. At the top of the list would be

model mis-specification, implying that the currency union variable is picking up the effect of some
                                                       10


other omitted variable(s). But this hunch is mistaken; the results are robust. Four different

perturbations of the gravity model are included in Table 3; they augment the basic results with extra

(Z) controls. These extra effects are usually statistically significant and economically sensible,

though they add little to the overall explanatory power of the model. Being partners in a regional

trade agreement, sharing a common language, having the same (post-1945) colonizer, being part of

the same nation (as e.g., France and an overseas department like French Guiana), and having had a

colonizer-colony relationship all increase trade by economically and statistically significant

amounts. Landlocked and large countries tend to trade less; islands trade more. But inclusion of

these extra controls does not destroy the finding of an economically large and statistically significant

positive γ. While the coefficient falls somewhat with extra controls, the lowest estimate of γ in

Table 3 indicates that trade is some 285% higher for members of a common currency than for

countries with sovereign currencies.

        Rose (2000) estimated a number of gravity equations with a comparable data set spanning

1970 through 1990, and found similar results; his point estimate of γ was 1.2. He also showed his

results to be robust to: the exact measurement of CU, the exact measure of distance, the inclusion of

extra controls, sub-sampling, and different estimation techniques.

        To summarize: members of a currency union trade more, ceteris paribus. A reasonable

estimate is that trade is three times as intense for members of a common currency area as for

countries with their own currencies. While this estimate seems provocatively high, it is actually

quite low compared with the well-documented size of “home bias” in international trade. McCallum

(1995) and Helliwell (1998) find home bias in goods markets to be on the order of 12x to 20x, far

greater than our estimates here. While membership in a common currency area does intensify trade,

it does not intensify it nearly enough for common currency areas to resemble countries.

4. Price Integration

        Obstfeld and Rogoff (1996, p. 633) mention two of the main benefits of currency union as:

        •   Reduced accounting costs and greater predictability of relative prices for firms
            doing business in both countries and
        •   Insulation from monetary disturbances and speculative bubbles that might
            otherwise lead to temporary unnecessary fluctuations in real exchange rates
            (given sticky nominal prices)


        In this section, we explore whether real exchange converge in currency unions are more

stable in the sense of converging more quickly and having lower short-run volatility. To answer the

first question, we estimate the equation



                                    qroot ij = α + βCU ij + δ • Zij + ε ij .




Here, qrootij is the estimated autoregressive coefficient in an AR1 regression for the (log of the) real

exchange rate of country i relative to country j. A large value of qroot ij indicates slow adjustment

of the real exchange rate. CU ij is a dummy variable that takes the value of one if countries i and j

were in a currency union for the entire post-1960 period, and a zero otherwise. Zij is a vector of

auxiliary conditioning variables (such as the distance between countries i and j, the volatility of the

nominal exchange rate, etc.) that are included in the regression as controls, but that are not directly

of interest to us. ε ij is a random error that contains factors that affect the speed of adjustment of real

exchange rates that are not included in our regression.

        We hypothesize that βij is negative: that the persistence of real exchange rates is lower for

currency union countries. If currency unions are successful in their objective of reducing real
                                                          12


exchange rate volatility, one measure of success is the speed at which real exchange rates converge

to equilibrium.

        Our real exchange rate data is based on annual consumer price indices and exchange rates

from our World Bank macroeconomic data set. For each country in the data set, we first estimate an

AR1 regression (with intercept, given that the price data is in index form) for (log) real exchange

rates from 1960-1996.15 We use the slope coefficient in these time-series regressions as the

regressand in the cross-section regression defined above.

        The results reported in Table 4 indicate no support for the hypothesis that real exchange rates

adjust more quickly in currency unions. The first column of the table reports results for the basic

regression. In addition to the currency union dummy variable, the regression contains the log of

distance (in miles) between countries i and j; a dummy variable for whether i and j are divisions of

the same country (e.g., metropolitan France and Guadeloupe); the standard deviation of the first

difference of the log of the nominal exchange rate; and a constant. The currency union dummy

variable has a positive sign, but is not statistically significant at conventional levels.

        The other variables in the regression are not directly of interest to us, but we note that two

variables are highly significant in this and each of our other specifications: the same-country

dummy, and the nominal exchange rate volatility. As we expect, the coefficient on the same-country

dummy is negative, indicating that real exchange rates adjust more quickly for these pairs. Also

unsurprisingly, the speed of adjustment is significantly faster when nominal exchange rate volatility

is higher. Transitory real exchange rate volatility is closely associated with volatile nominal

exchange rates. When shocks to nominal exchange rates are very large and lead to large

misalignments of real exchange rates, there is rapid adjustment.

        The other specifications in Table 4 introduce other control variables (not reported in the

table.) The second column introduces average inflation rates in countries i and j; their presence does
                                                       13


not appreciably alter the effect of the other regressors. The third column includes all of the control

variables as the second column, but also includes a dummy variable for each country. In this

specification, the currency union dummy variable is significant, but with a positive sign. That is,

real exchange rates are more persistent in currency-union countries. The fourth and fifth regressions

reported in Table 4 control for high inflation in alternative manners. The regression in the fourth

column includes the maximum annual inflation rate of each country, while the regression of the fifth

column is identical to the base specification reported in column 1 but excludes all countries that have

experienced high inflations. (High inflation is defined here as average inflation that exceeds 100 per

cent.) We find the coefficient on the currency union dummy is not changed under these

specifications. The bottom line from Table 4 is that being a member of a currency union does not

increase the speed of adjustment of real exchange rates.

        There is a logical inconsistency in the approach taken in Table 4. We want to allow for

differing speeds of adjustment of real exchange rates. But if we model the real exchange rate of

countries i and j as an AR1, and the real exchange rates of countries i and k as an AR1 with a

different speed of adjustment, then the real exchange rate of countries j and k cannot follow an AR1.

More generally, we would want to model the adjustment of the real exchange rate of two countries i

and j as depending not only on its own lags, but on the lags of real exchange rates of countries that

are economically integrated.

        To handle this problem, Table 5 reports results from first-order VARs of real exchange rates

for groups of countries. The real exchange rates for members of currency unions are grouped

together. Countries that are not members of currency unions are grouped by continent. The statistic

reported in Table 5 for each group of countries is the largest (in absolute value) eigenvalue of the

matrix of coefficients from the first-order VAR. The largest eigenvalue ultimately determines the
                                                        14


persistence in the vector of real exchange rates. The larger is this eigenvalue, the more slowly the

group adjusts.

         There are several advantages to using this statistic to measure the speed of adjustment of real

exchange rates. First, as we have alluded to, the VAR specification does not suffer from the

inconsistency that modeling all real exchange rates as AR1s does. Second, as is well known, OLS

estimation is efficient even with errors that are correlated across real exchange rates. Third, while

the real exchange rates for each group of countries are all calculated relative to a base country, the

eigenvalues are independent of the choice of base country.

         If the real exchange rate system is stationary, the asymptotic distribution of the largest

eigenvalue is standard. But we cannot be certain of stationarity. Even if the system is stationary,

we cannot be certain that the asymptotic distribution is reliable in small samples. So we undertake

Monte Carlo and bootstrap exercises. The most straightforward null hypothesis to test for each VAR

is that all real exchange rates in the group are simple random walks.16

         The test statistics are reported in Table 5a. First, notably, these tests do not have enough

power to reject the unit root hypothesis for the vast majority of country groups. Only for the

European group and the ECCA currency union can we reject the unit-root null at the 95 percent level

of confidence, and then only with the bootstrap test. We never reject the unit-root null with the

Monte Carlo test. Moreover, Table 5 reveals little difference in the persistence of real exchange

rates among currency-union and non-currency-union groups. There is no clear difference in the

persistence (as measured by the largest eigenvalue), or in the p-values of the test statistics for the

unit root null.

         Table 5b reports similar statistics for groups of cities within each of seven countries. This

data set is monthly, in contrast to the country-level data that are annual. So, the measures of the
                                                       15


speed of adjustment are not comparable.17 But, even with the city data, there is only one country for

which we can clearly reject the unit-root null: Canada.

        To sum up, Tables 4 and 5 suggest that the speed of adjustment of real exchange rates is not

clearly related to monetary union, or even political union. This result is perhaps not surprising. The

literature has found mixed results concerning the speed of adjustment of prices within countries and

across borders. Parsley and Wei (1996) find that prices converge rapidly between cities in the U.S.

The speed of convergence is much greater than is typically found for real exchange rates between

countries (see Rogoff (1996).) But, their data is for prices of very narrowly defined goods (as

opposed to the aggregate price indexes used in international comparisons), and they have no

comparable data for countries other than the U.S. In contrast, Rogers and Jenkins (1995) and Engel,

Hendrickson and Rogers (1997) find no significant difference between intranational and

international speeds of convergence of aggregate real exchange rates.

        In contrast, there is a well-known “border” effect for short-term volatility of real exchange

rates. For example, Engel and Rogers (1996) find that U.S.-Canadian relative prices are far more

volatile than relative prices between cities within each country, even taking into account distance

between cities. We ask here whether currency unions have a similar effect in reducing real exchange

rate volatility. In Table 6 we report results from regressions of the form:



                                      qvolij = α + βCU ij + δ • Zij + ε ij .




Here, qvolij is a measure of the volatility of the real exchange rate of countries i and j. We use as

our measure the standard deviation of the residual from the AR1 regressions discussed above. This

measures the volatility of shocks to real exchange rates, as distinct from variance arising from slow

adjustment. As before, CU ij is a dummy variable that takes the value of one if countries i and j were
                                                        16


in a currency union. Zij is a vector of other variables that are included in the regression as controls,

and ε ij is a random error.

        The regression specifications across the five columns of Table 6 are identical to those of

Table 4, except that the regressand is the volatility of the real exchange rate rather than its

persistence. In all specifications, the currency union dummy variable is negative and is highly

significant in all but the last. The specification that appears most plausible here is the third

specification, which contains dummy variables for each country. In this regression, the log of

distance has a positive and significant sign, indicating that more distant countries have greater real

exchange rate volatility. The variance of the change in the (log) nominal exchange rate is a highly

significant variable in this regression (and all others.) Our interest is focussed on the currency union

dummy, which is very statistically significant: being a member of a currency union reduces the

standard deviation of annual real exchange rates by 6 percentage points.

        We conclude that real exchange rates have much lower short-term volatility among currency-

union countries, even holding constant the volatility of the nominal exchange rate. That is, the

reduction in real exchange rate variance is not solely attributable to fixed exchange rates; currency-

union membership appears to stabilize real exchange rates through other channels as well. But, real

exchange rate volatility of currency union members is still higher on average than for cities within

countries. The average annual standard deviation of real exchange rates among currency union

countries in our sample is 3.6 percent, compared to 1.1 percent for city pairs within the seven

countries listed in the lower panel of Table 5.



5. Business Cycle Synchronization

        We now examine whether countries that use the same currency tend to have more highly

synchronized business cycles. This has been a natural question to ask since Mundell (1961);
                                                        17


countries with highly synchronized business cycles forego little monetary independence if they share

a common currency. Thus countries with highly synchronized business cycles have a higher

propensity to adopt a common currency. Of course, since a common monetary policy also

eliminates idiosyncratic monetary policy, causality flows in the reverse direction. That is, members

of a common currency union should experience more synchronized business cycles since they do not

experience national monetary policy shocks. Rather than try to determine either part of the

relationship structurally, we are simply interested here in seeing whether members of a common

currency area in fact experience more synchronized business cycles. It is especially interesting to us

since we have already found that currency union members are quite specialized in international

trade, making them potentially subject to asymmetric shocks.

        The regressions we estimate take the form:



                                  Corr ( s ) ij = α + βCU ij + δ • Z ij + ε ij



where: Corr(s)ij denotes the estimated correlation between real GDP for country i and real GDP for

country j de-trended with method s, CU is a binary dummy variable which is unity if countries i and

j are members of the same currency union, α and δ are nuisance coefficients, Z is a vector of

controls, and ε denotes omitted residual factors. The coefficient of interest to us is β; a positive β

indicates that two countries with a common currency tend to have more tightly correlated business

cycles. Since our analysis is reduced-form in nature, we are not able to tell whether countries with

more tightly synchronized business cycles tend to belong to common currency areas, or whether

membership in a currency union tends to synchronize business cycles (or both).

        In forming the regressand, we take advantage of our macroeconomic data set (the list of

potential countries is tabulated in Table A1). In particular for each pair of countries in the sample,
                                                       18


we estimate the bivariate correlation between de-trended annual real GDP for countries i and j over

the sample period 1960-1996 (or the maximum available span of data).18 We use two different time-

series models to de-trend the data: (country-specific) first-differences of natural logarithms; and a

log-linear time trend model. After (the natural logarithm of) each country’s real GDP has been de-

trended, we then estimate simple bivariate correlations between the de-trended GDP series.19

        Results are tabulated in Tables 7a and 7b. Table 7a contains results where the regressand is

constructed from GDP series de-trending via growth rates; Table 7b is the analogue with linear de-

trending.

        The extreme left column of each of the tables presents a simple OLS regression of business

cycle synchronization on the currency union dummy variable. We find a positive β coefficient,

indicating that business cycles are more highly synchronized for countries that trade more. The size

and statistical significance of the estimate depends on the de-trending method employed.

        Six perturbations of the basic model are also displayed in Tables 7a and 7b to check the

sensitivity of the analysis. The first five perturbations (all estimated with OLS) simply add extra

control regressors to the right hand side of the equation (i.e., extra Z’s). We choose the five different

sets of regressors used in Table 3, (this encompasses the controls used by Clark and van Wincoop

(2000); other controls sets, including country fixed effects, deliver similar results). Robust t-

statistics are displayed in parentheses.

        The estimates in the tables indicate that business cycles are in fact more tightly synchronized

for members of a currency union. The exact point estimate depends on both the de-trending method

and the exact set of auxiliary regressors. But the coefficient is consistently positive and almost

always statistically significant at conventional levels. Being a member of a common currency area

increases international business cycle correlations by perhaps .1, an economically significant

amount.20
                                                       19


        In the extreme right column, the natural log of bilateral trade between countries i and j is

used as the sole control regressor, following Frankel and Rose (1998). This is an important test of

the model, since Clark and van Wincoop find that inclusion of trade as a control destroys the border

effect. When trade is included, its coefficient is estimated with IV, using the first nine regressors of

the gravity equation as instrumental variables.21 Trade appears to have a strong positive effect on

business cycle synchronization. This result twins well with the literature. For instance, Frankel and

Rose (1998) found that increased international trade induces more tightly synchronized business

cycles, using data for the OECD; our result is consistent with theirs. However, controlling for trade

does not destroy the significance of β.

        To summarize, countries that are members of a common currency union tend to have more

highly synchronized business cycles; the correlation is perhaps .1 higher on average for currency

union members than for non-members. While economically and statistically significant, the size of

this effect is small in an absolute sense. Most recently, Clark and van Wincoop (2000) compare the

coherences of business cycles within countries and across countries, using annual data for both

employment and real GDP. They show that intranational business cycle correlations are

approximately .7 for regions within countries, but in the range of (.2,.4) for comparable regions

drawn across countries. That is, the effect of international borders on business cycle synchronization

ranges between .3 and .5. Thus, only a small part of the “border effect” is explained by membership

in a common currency area.



6. Risk sharing

        In this section, we turn to international risk sharing. It is well known that the apparent degree

of international risk sharing is low. In a classic contribution, Feldstein and Horioka (1980) found

that national saving and investment rates are highly correlated, apparently inconsistent with
                                                         20


international risk sharing. Alternatively, if risk-sharing opportunities were widespread, there should

be little country-specific idiosyncratic consumption risk. As Backus, Kehoe and Kydland (1992)

noted, consumption should be more highly correlated across countries than output in the presence of

risk sharing. In fact, the data show the opposite. Furthermore, as French and Poterba (1991) and

others have reported, there is strong home bias in asset holdings. There seems to be very little

international diversification of portfolios.

           Obstfeld and Rogoff (2000) have argued that international risk sharing might be diminished

in the presence of transactions costs. Specifically, they cite costs of trading goods (rather than

assets) as an impediment to risk sharing. They also note that these costs might conceivably be

related to the need to make foreign exchange transactions in order to buy and sell goods

internationally. In other words, countries that are members of currency unions might do more risk

sharing.

           We run a cross-section regression of the form:



                                    ccorrij = α + βCU ij + δ • Z ij + ε ij .




where, ccorrij is calculated as the correlation of the first difference in the log of consumption per

capita for country i with the analogue for country j. The right-hand-side of the regression is of the

same generic form as the regressions of the previous two sections. Thus, CU ij is a dummy variable

which is unity if countries i and j were in a currency union; Z ij is a vector of control variables; and

ε ij is a random error. The consumption data in this section is taken from the Penn World Tables,

and is adjusted for purchasing power parity. The data are annual, and the maximum data span

available is 1960-1992.22
                                                          21


        Table 8 reports the regression results. If risk sharing is greater among currency unions, we

expect a positive coefficient on the currency union dummy. If more distant countries find it more

difficult to share risks, we also expect a negative coefficient on the log of distance. We report results

from six regressions. All regressions include the currency union dummy and log distance as

explanatory variables. The first regression (reported in the first column) uses a single intercept. The

second regression uses a comprehensive set of country-specific fixed effects, so that both the

dummies for i and j take on a value of one when the regressand is ccorrij . The third regression is

identical to the first regression, but is estimated with weighted least squares.23 The second set of

three regressions repeats the analysis, but augments the regression with the bivariate correlation

between the growth rates of output (that is, the correlation of the first difference in the log of output

for country i with the analogue for country j, the analogue to the regressand).

        The results are weak. The log of distance always enters significantly with the correct sign.

The currency union dummy always enters with the correct sign. However, it is not significant in the

first specification; it is only of marginal significance in the second; and it is highly significant only

in the third. In all three estimates, the economic size of the effect of currency unions is small. For

instance, the currency union effect is to increase the consumption correlation by .04 percentage

points with weighted least squares. Since the intercept term in the regression is 0.31, then ignoring

the effect of distance (that is, for two countries whose log distance is zero), being in a currency union

raises the consumption correlation from 0.31 to 0.35.

        Even these modest results may overstate the risk sharing opportunities within currency

unions. A high correlation of consumption for a pair of countries may not actually reflect greater

risk sharing opportunities between those two countries. It may simply reflect less idiosyncratic risk.

That is, the consumption of two countries may be correlated simply because their output is

correlated. Thus, even in the absence of avenues for risk sharing, there may be a high consumption
                                                        22


correlation that should not be interpreted as indicating substantial international risk sharing.

        This concern is particularly relevant since in the previous section we found that business

cycles are more highly correlated for currency union countries. So controlling for the degree of

output correlation is a potentially important robustness check. We pursue this by adding the actual

correlation of (detrended) GDP per capita as a control in the right-hand columns of Table 8. As it

turns out, the output correlation coefficient is always statistically and economically significant as a

control variable, but its presence has little effect on our estimate of β.

        To summarize, we have found little statistically and economically significant evidence that

international risk sharing is enhanced by membership in a currency union. This is perhaps

unsurprising, given the absence of substantive international fiscal transfer arrangements and the

shallow private financial markets of most currency union members.



7. Conclusion

        This paper contributes to the dollarization dialogue by quantifying some of the features

associated with common currencies, using actual data. Using the historical record, we have found

that the extra degree of integration associated with a common currency is substantial but finite.

Members of international currency unions tend to experience more trade, less volatile exchange

rates, and more synchronized business cycles than do countries with their own currencies. Of

course, since well-integrated countries are more likely to adopt a common currency, some of these

integration “effects” of currency union may be illusory. That is, the causality may flow from

integration to currency union rather than the reverse. In any case, while members of international

currency unions are more integrated than countries with their own monies, they remain far from

integrated compared with the intranational benchmark of regions within a country.

   We define “dollarization” as a situation where a country does not have its own sovereign money; the currency it
uses need not be a dollar (US or other).
2
   McKinnon (1963) has argued that in practice real exchange rate behavior does not appreciably depend on the
choice of monetary regime, and the desire to influence real exchange rate behavior is not a justification for having
an independent currency.
3
   We disregard labor mobility since it is so difficult to construct an appropriate data set, and since monetary policy
can only be used to offset transitory nominal shocks where labor movement is probably inappropriate. We also
ignore asset and financial market integration.
4
  Our investigation is in the spirit of Obstfeld and Rogoff (2000) who urge the profession to examine the
consequences of (presumably small) costs of international trade. Frankel and Rose (1998) raise the possibility that
the degree of integration among economies (and hence their suitability for membership in a currency union) might
increase upon the formation of a common currency area.
5
   It is difficult to examine the direction of causality since currency unions are long-lived. Rose (2000) provides
more analysis which supports the idea that currency union tends to promote trade integration rather than the reverse.

   There are however many missing observations for variables of interest.

   In the case of multilateral currency unions, there is no clear anchor

    SITC Code 11 denotes “Animals of the Bovine Species, incl. Buffaloes, live.” Other examples of 4-digit sub-
groups include: “Tyres, pneumat. new, of a kind used on buses, lorries” (SITC code 6252), and “Int. combustion
piston engines for marine propuls.” (SITC code 7133).

    Our findings are not affected by the inclusion of quadratic terms for income as in Imbs and Wacziarg (2000).

    This specialization makes them more vulnerable to industry-specific shocks, and might be expected to increase
the idiosyncratic nature of their business cycles.

    We sometimes include a control for common membership in a regional free trade agreement. We include a
number of such agreements, including: the EU; the Canada-US FTA; EFTA; the Australia/New Zealand closer
economic relationship; the Israeli/US FTA; ASEAN; CACM; PATCRA; CARICOM; SPARTECA; and the
Cartagena Agreement, all taken from the WTO’s web site (http://www.wto.org/wto/develop/webrtas.htm).
15
    We only estimate the AR1 if there are at least fifteen observations for each country.
16
    Under the Monte Carlo experiment, we assume that the errors have a Normal distribution, with a covariance
matrix equal to the sample covariance of the first-differences of the (logs) of the real exchange rates. We measure
the frequency with which the largest eigenvalue is smaller than the estimated largest eigenvalue for each group,
based on 5000 replications with sample sizes equal to the sample size of our data. Under the bootstrap experiment,
we use the first differences of the actual (log) real exchange rates to construct our bootstrap sample. We sample,
with replacement, the vector of real exchange rate changes at each date, thus maintaining the structure of correlation
across real exchange rates within each group. As with the Monte Carlo statistics, we measure the frequency with
which the largest eigenvalue is smaller than the estimated largest eigenvalue for each group, based on 5000
replications with sample sizes equal to the sample size of our data.
17
    It might be natural to compare the eigenvalues by raising the city-level eigenvalues to the twelfth power, but that
would only be a rough approximation given that the annual CPI data is average for the year, not end-of-period.
18
    We only estimate the bilateral correlation if we have at least five matching GDP observations for each country.
19
    Thus, we first separately de-trend Afghani and Australian real GDP with linear time trend models. Then we
estimate the correlation between the two de-trended real GDPs over time (the actual correlation is -.002). We then
repeat this procedure for all possible country pairs, resulting in a vector of correlations. De-trending via taking
deviations of growth rates (first-differences of natural logarithms) from the average (country-specific) growth rate
yields another measure of the regressand. For regressors, we use the same set of regressors used in the gravity
model of trade. That is, we model business cycle synchronization as being a function of the distance between the
countries, the product of their real GDPs, the product of their real GDP per capitas, and so forth.
20
     As a robustness check, we have substituted the correlation between labor forces for the correlation between
GDPs (employment, unemployment, and industrial production data are simply not available for many countries even
at the annual frequency). This regressand also delivers a consistently positive, statistically significant effect of
currency union on business cycle coherence.
21
    This is necessary because while trade may effect business cycle synchronization, it is equally plausible that
causality flows in the reverse direction, as pointed out by Frankel and Rose (1998).
22
    Again, we only estimate the bilateral correlation if we have at least fifteen matching observations for each
country.
23
     Specifically, we give proportionately greater weight to observations in which the correlation is based on more
data. That is, when we can base a correlation on thirty-two years of data, that correlation in the cross-section
regression receives double the weight of a correlation based on only sixteen years of data.
