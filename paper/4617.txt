       We present a new approach to estimating minimum wage effects on employment. In
contrast to most previous research, we account for the possibility that the relationship between
minimum wages and employment depends on the magnitude of the minimum wage relative to
the equilibrium wage in the absence of the legislated minimum. In particular, estimating the
employment effects of binding minimum wages requires separation of sample observations into
those that are on the labor demand curve but off the labor supply curve, and those that are at
labor market equilibria. The paper implements an endogenous switching regression model with
unknown sample separation that yields these estimates. The approach also yields estimates of
the impact of labor market characteristics on the probability that minimum wages are binding.
       We also extend the disequilibrium approach to monopsony, which introduces a third
regime, between the equilibrium monopsony wage and the equilibrium competitive wage, in
which observations are on the labor supply curve but off the labor demand curve and minimum
wages are therefore positively related to employment. Minimum wage effects under monopsony
are estimated in a three-regime endogenous switching regression model with unknown regimes,
and the monopsony characterization of low-wage labor markets is tested against the competitive
characterization.

I. Introduction

       The competitive view of minimum wages, enshrined in numerous textbooks, is that

they reduce employment. This paper presents a new approach to testing this prediction. In

contrast to many previous studies, which estimate a single regression of the employment

rate on a minimum wage variable (as well as other controls), we use the predictions of

standard theoretical models to take explicit account of the possibility that the relationship

between minimum wages and employment depends in a discrete fashion on the magnitude

of the minimum wage relative to the equilibrium wage in the absence of the legislated

minimum. Specifically, we attempt to distinguish observations for which the legislated

minimum is below the equilibrium competitive wage--and thus unrelated to employment--

from observations for which the minimum wage is above the equilibrium competitive wage

and negatively related to employment. To achieve this separation, we implement an

endogenous switching regression model with unknown sample separation, with the switch

point defined as the intersection of the labor demand and supply curves.

       In addition, we extend this disequilibrium approach to account for the possibility of

monopsony power in low-wage labor markets.1 In the monopsony model, as in the

competitive model, the minimum wage should be unrelated to employment when the

legislated minimum is below the equilibrium monopsony wage. Similarly, in either model,

the minimum wage is predicted to be negatively related to employment when the minimum

wage is above the equilibrium competitive wage. However, the competitive and monopsony


   'The plausibility of monopsony power in low-wage labor markets has generally been
dismissed in the past (see, e.g., Brown, 1988). But recent evidence of positive effects of
minimum wages on employment has renewed interest in the monopsony model (Card,
1992b; Rebitzer and Taylor, 1991).
models differ in their implications for minimum wage effects when the minimum wage is

between the equilibrium monopsony wage and the equilibrium competitive wage (Stigler,

1946). In this region, a minimum wage can increase employment by moving the labor

market away from the monopsony outcome--where the labor demand curve intersects the

marginal cost of labor curve--along the supply curve. In contrast, the competitive model

predicts that minimum wages should be unrelated to employment over this range.

      To assess the relevance of monopsony power in low-wage labor markets, we set up a

model of minimum wage effects on employment with three regimes, with each

corresponding to the alternative possibilities implied by the monopsony model. Given

specifications of the labor demand and labor supply curves, and given an assumption

regarding the relationship between the marginal cost of labor curve (under monopsony) and

the labor supply curve, the switch points again arise naturally as functions of the parameters

and variables in the labor demand and labor supply curves. We estimate the resulting

three-regime endogenous switching regression model with unknown regimes, and test the

monopsony characterization of low-wage labor markets against the two-regime competitive

characterization.

       One rationale for our approach stems from the recent round of studies on the

employment effects of minimum wages, some of which challenge the prediction of the

standard textbook model. This recent research has greatly expanded the types of data used

to estimate minimum wage effects, including: extending time-series data into the 1980s

(Wellington, 1991); focusing on minimum wage increases in particular labor markets (Card,

1992b; Spriggs, 1992; Katz and Krueger, 1992; Taylor and Kim1 1993; Card and Krueger,

1993); conducting panel data experiments on state-level observations (Card, 1992a;

                                              2
Neumark and Wascher, 1992; Williams, 1993), and using individual-level data (Currie and

Fallick, 1993). Compared with the earlier time-series studies which, by and large, found

similar effects, the findings from this recent research have been quite varied, with some

studies finding the conventional negative employment effects of minimum wages, some

finding no employment effects, and some even finding positive effects.

      A potential explanation for the more disparate findings from recent research may be

that the samples used in this research vary with respect to whether minimum wages are

binding. For example, even if low-wage labor markets are competitive, it is possible that

some studies will reveal no effects of minimum wages on employment simply because they

are based on samples in which most of the variation in minimum wages is in the range for

which minimum wages are non-binding, while the reverse may be true of studies revealing

negative effects. Similarly, if low-wage labor markets are characterized by monopsony, we

might nonetheless generally expect to find negative effects of minimum wages on

employment, in samples that do not capture minimum wage movements over the perhaps

narrow range for which a higher minimum wage raises employment, but instead capture

variation along the binding demand regime. On the other hand, we might sometimes expect

to find a positive (or non-negative) association between minimum wages and employment.2

       Thus, the approach developed in this paper offers at least three potential advantages
relative to existing single-equation estimates: it leads to estimates of the employment effects

of minimum wages when they are binding; it yields a (probabilistic) classification of



   3This also implies that we cannot test the monopsony model by asking whether
minimum wage increases are associated with increases in employment (as claimed, for
example, by West and McKee, 1980).

observations based on whether or not minimum wages are binding; and it provides a test of

the monopsony characterization of low-wage labor markets.

IL The Data and Single-Equation Results

       The data used in this paper are the same as those used in Neumark arid Wascher

(1992), a panel data set on the 50 states and Washington, DC, covering the period 1977-

1989, as well as the subperiod 1973-1976 for those states separately identified in the CPS

before 1977. The data set includes information on federal arid state minimum wage levels,

estimates of coverage by federal minimum wage statutes,3 and state averages of wages,

unemployment rates, employment rates, and age composition variables. In that paper, we
followed the literature and estimated regressions of the form

                                (1) E aMW + R,j3         +


E is an employment-to-population ratio either for teens aged 16-19 or young adults aged
16-24. MW is a coverage-adjusted relative minimum wage, constructed as federal coverage

for the state, multiplied by the higher of the federal or state minimum wage level, divided

by the average wage in the state. Rd is a vector of control variables, possibly including

fixed state and year effects.

       Numerous specification issues arise with respect to equation (1), which we explored

in our earlier paper, and which have been further discussed by other researchers and

ourselves (Card, et al., 1993; Neumark and Wascher, 1993). In this paper we are interested

in highlighting an econometric approach that is an alternative to that commonly used in



   3Published coverage estimates refer to all workers, not the young age groups usually
considered in minimum wage studies.
                                              4
research on minimum wages, not in revisiting these specification issues. Consequently, we

focus on a set of specifications and an age group that are, in our view, least controversial.

       One issue that has been raised in this context is the appropriate use of supply

variables in single-equation estimates. In our case, we explicitly specify the labor demand

and labor supply curves in a disequilibrium model. We therefore have a way to introduce

supply variables, even when workers are homogeneous and there is no uncovered sector,

because supply variables will affect employment when the minimum wage is non-binding.4

However, we include only the proportion of the population in the age group being studied,

and Omit the more problematic school enrollment rate, since it may be partly endogenous

with respect to labor market conditions. We also work with contemporaneous minimum

wage variables, although our earlier paper indicated that specifications using laggedvalues

of the minimum wage variable provided stronger evidence of disemployment effects. In
addition, in our earlier paper we allowed for fixed state and year effects. In this paper,

though, the econometric approach that we use precludes the inclusion of these effects,

although we give some attention to the heterogeneity problem that may arise from their

omission. Finally, we study young adults (aged 16-24), for whom the results in our previous

paper were much less sensitive to these specification issues than were those for teenagers

(aged i6-i9).
       To see the consequences of these specification choices, Table I reports estimates of



    4Brown, et al. (1982) argue that supply variables affect employment in the presence of
 minimum wages when workers are heterogeneous and there is an uncovered sector.

     5This may be in part because for the broader young adult age group we have larger cell
 sizes with which to estimate employment rates and other control variables.
                                                5
equation (1) for young adults aged 16-24. The top panel reports the basic specifications
with which the estimates from the disequilibrium models will be compared. The estimated

coefficient of the minimum wage variable is significant and negative. The demand variable

--the prime-age male unemployment rate--also has an estimated coefficient that is negative

and significant. The supply variable measuring the proportion of the age group in the

population has the expected negative coefficient, although the estimate is not significantly

different from zero.6 Note that fixed state and year effects are excluded from these

specifications.

       The lower panel presents the estimated minimum wage coefficients for specifications

that alternatively include fixed state and year effects, and substitute the lagged minimum

wage variable for its contemporaneous counterpart. The first row shows, as did our 1992

paper, that including fixed state and year effects leads to some diminution of the minimum

wage effects. The second row shows that the estimated disemployment effects of minimum

wages are stronger when the lagged minimum wage variable is used. Broadly speaking,

however, the estimated minimum wage effects for young adults are not especially sensitive

to these specification issues. All of the specifications indicate a significant (or nearly so)

negative effect of minimum wages on the employment rate.7




    6The expected coefficient is negative because this variable measures relative supply.
Higher relative supply reduces the equilibrium wage, resulting in a lower employment tai
(but not level).
    7The estimates for young adults are also insensitive to the inclusion of measures of
enrollment rates. In contrast, for teenagers the estimated minimum wage effect is very
sensitive to these specification issues (Neumark and Wascher, 1992 and 1993).

Ill. Disequilibrium Models of Employment Effects

I/l.a. The Comtitive Model
      We consider first the two-regime model corresponding to the competitive model of

minimum wage effects. Let the labor demand equation be given by

                              (2)    ED=aW+X+eD

and let the (inverse) labor supply equation be given by

                              (3)    W=yEs_Y6_yeS

where the "it" subscripts have been dropped. Consistent with most minimum wage

research, W is interpreted as a relative wage measure, in particular the wage of young

adults relative to the average wage for all workers. Also, following most existing minimum

wage research, we assume that the coverage-adjusted relative minimum wage measures the

effective minimum wage. Then if the minimum wage (MW) is binding, employment is

determined by the demand curve with W set to MW,

                              (4)    E=aMW+X13+€'

if instead the minimum wage is non-binding, then employment is given by the intersection



    8The inverse supply equation is specified with the vector 6 having a negative coefficient
so that the signs of the coefficients of the supply variables Y in the reduced-form
employment equation (given below) agree with those in equation (1). (Note that equation
(3) can be rewritten as E = (1/y)W + (ô/y)Y + €.) in addition, throughout the ensuing
discussion, we assume that the labor supply schedule is positively sloped. This is because
the empirical work focuses on the employment rate, on which, at least in a one-period
model, wage increases exert a positive substitution effect, but not a negative income effect.

                                               (y      +   X3)   +




       The error term e in equation (5) could be specified as the reduced form error term

involving ED and fS However, we use a less restrictive specification, which allows for the

possibility that in the non-binding regime other factors affect employment, and for the

possibility that   and   do not necessarily reflect demand or supply factors that carry over

into the reduced form in the same way as the observable variables. This woi.ild be the case,

for example, if    and fS contain measurement      error in the employment rate.

       Finally, an observation will be classified on the binding regime (equation (4)) if the

minimum wage is greater than the competitive equilibrium wage given by the intersection of
the labor demand and labor supply curves (i.e., the reduced form for the wage), and vice

versa. Thus, an observation is on the binding regime if


                          (6)     MW>            (X - Y8) +
                                          1-wy

and is on the non-binding regime otherwise. Again, the error term & is not restricted to

have the form implied by the reduced form for the wage, in terms of D and          i.   However,

we do allow for E1 to be correlated with both €' and       €, and these correlations can reflect
the appearance of (1) and e in the reduced form for the wage.

       Equations (4), (5), and (6) constitute a disequilibrium model with unknown regimes.

The model differs from standard cases in the literature (see Quandt, 1988) in that the

switching equation (6) depends on the minimum wage and the variables and parameters in

the labor demand and labor supply equations. The availability of the minimum wage as an

                                               8
"indicator' of the regime in which an observation lies makes the application of

disequilibrium models to minimum wage effects unique.9 In addition, because the

dependent variable in the switching equation is not a latent variable, the variance of E' is

identified.

       Letting f denote density functions, and Zip > €' be a short-hand for the switching

equation (6), we can write the likeithood for an observation as


                              (7)                     Zip) + fle,e'      Zip) =

Assuming that f1), NI3, and €' have a tnvariate normal distribution, we can use results for

conditional distributions of bivariate normal random variables to obtain the likelihood

        Note that the coefficients of the demand function are identified regardless of which

variables appear in the demand and supply functions, since the parameters of the demand

function are identified from the binding regime. In contrast, the supply function parameters

 are not identified without some exclusion restrictions. Variables that appear in both the


    9In most of the standard market disequilibrium literature, the question is whether a
 market is in excess supply or excess demand, and the "indicator" of these alternatives is
 whether prices are rising or falling (Quandt, 1988). Bowden (1978) considers the
 implications for such models of taking an approach closer to ours, by specifying the
 equilibrium price in terms of the underlying demand and supply curves.
                                                              9
demand and supply equations have coefficients (-cr6   + 13)7(1 -   ay) in the reduced-form

employment equation, and (y13 - c5)/(1 - ay) in the switching equation. Thus, while a and B

are identified from the binding regime, some simple algebra shows that y and 6 are not

separately identified unless there is at least one variable that is excluded from the supply

function but appears in the demand function; the coefficient of such a variable in the

reduced-form employment equation, for example, is 137(1 - cry), which identifies y. This, of

course, is the necessary condition for identification in the usual simultaneous equations case.

In this particular model, we identify y and 6 by excluding the prime-age male

unemployment rate from the supply function.1°

        In addition to obtaining estimates of employment effects of minimum wages (a) in

the binding regime, the model can be used to estimate the probability that observations are

on the alternative regimes, as functions of the minimum wage variable and the variables

that determine the equilibrium wage. For example, the probability that minimum wages are

binding is


               P( MW>            (yX - Y)    +   e) = PC Z* > €1) =
                          1-ay

Such   probabilities are informative as to how the overall minimum wage effect is likely to

vary with changes in the minimum wage and other labor market variables.'


    10We also follow the existing literature in assuming that the variable measuring the
proportion of the age group in the population is a supply variable, and does not appear in
the demand function, although this is not necessary for identification.
    "In the multiple-regime approach, minimum wage effects vary depending on labor
market characteristics that affect the probability that minimum wages are binding for an
observation. In this sense, heterogeneity across workers is introduced. However, this
heterogeneity is limited to variation in minimum wages and labor market conditions across
                                                 10
      Finally, the two-regime model can be tested against two nested alternatives, one in

which all observations are on the demand curve, and one in which all observations are on

the reduced form for employment (i.e., at equilibrium employment).'2

III.b. The Monopsony Model

      In contrast to the competitive model, there are three regimes implied by the

monopsony model. The first regime is that in which the minimum wage is non-binding, so

that minimum wages have no effect on employment. The second regime, which arises

uniquely in the monopsony model, is one in which minimum wages increase employment.

This regime corresponds to the labor supply curve, between the monopsony wage (the wage

along the labor supply curve at the employment level where the marginal cost of labor

curve intersects the labor demand curve), and the competitive equilibrium wage. Finally,

the third regime is the demand curve above the competitive equilibrium wage, along which

minimum wages decrease employment, as in the competitive model.

       In addition to the supply regime (in which the minimum wage effect is lIy), we need

to specify a switching equation between the non-binding regime and the supply regime.




states and years; within a state and year labor is treated as homogeneous, with an
observation assumed to be on one regime or the other. A richer approach, which is beyond
the scope of this paper, would attempt to account for the fact that minimum wages are
binding for some individuals but not for others. As it now stands, our approach should not
be interpreted as equivalent to one with heterogeneous workers, in which the cumulative
probability expressions in equation (8) measure the proportion of workers in a state on one
regime or the other.
    '2The coefficients of the reduced form involve all of the coefficients of the labor
demand and supply curves. However, if all observations are on this regime these
coefficients cannot be identified solely from the employment equation. Thus, in testing this
restriction employment is specified simply as a linear function of the demand and supply
variables.
                                             11
(Equation (6) continues to describe switches between the supply regime and the demand

regime, at the intersection of the demand and supply curves.) If we assume that under

monopsony the inverse labor supply curve facing firms is the aggregate inverse supply curve,

then the marginal cost of labor curve is13

                                    (9)    MC=2yE-Y6
Using this, we can solve for the employment level at which marginal cost equals marginal

product (the wage on the labor demand curve)

Then we can find the wage that prevails at this level of employment, from the labor supply

curve, which is

    13th contrast to the standard monopsony model, the Rebitzer and Taylor (1991)
efficiency wage model does not suggest any simple relationship between the labor supply
and marginal cost of labor curves. In that model, the supervisory input is assumed to be
fixed, so that, ceteris paribus, shirking increases with employment. Thus, the marginal cost
of labor curve rises above the labor supply curve, because as employment increases firms
must raise the wages of all workers to increase the cost of job loss in order to deter
shirking.

       In contrast to the two-regime competitive model, the parameters are identified in the

three-regime monopsony model even if all variables appear in both equations, since we

have separate observations (with some probability) along the demand and supply regimes.

Nonetheless, to maintain comparability we impose the same exclusion restrictions as in the

two-regime case.

       Because the two-regime and three-regime models are not nested, testing the

competitive model against the monopsony model is not as straightforward as testing whether

a second regime is needed, relative to a single-regime model.14 Thus, to compare the

models we use the non-nested test procedure developed by Vuong (1989). The applicable

test statistic is n"2(L3 -   L-2)/ , where L3 and L2 are the log-likelihoods for the three- and
two-regime models respectively, evaluated at the maximum likelihood estimates. 2 is the

sample variance of the difference between the log-likelihoods for the three-regime and two.

regime models evaluated at each data point. This statistic is distributed asymptotically as

N(O,1). Thus, if both models have the same number of parameters, then at the five-percent

significance level, if this test statistic exceeds 1.96 we reject the two-regime model in favor



          see that the models are non-nested, note that although the three-regime model
involves more parameters than the two-regime model, the three-regime model may be more
restrictive than the two-regime model because observations are forced to be on the supply
regime, and hence to be unaffected by the demand variables, with some non-zero
probability.

of the three-regime model, and vice versa if it is below -1.96. Between these critical values,

the models have statistically indistinguishable fits. However, the three-regime monopsony

model has two more parameters than the two-regime competitive model, necessitating an

upward adjustment of the lower and upper critical values by 2/(2 . n"2).

IV. Results

IV.a. Results from the Disequilibrium Endogenous Switching Models

       Results for the two-regime model corresponding to the competitive model of low-

wage labor markets are reported in column (1) of Table 2. The estimated minimum wage

effect in the binding regime is -33, considerably stronger than the corresponding single-

equation estimate in Table 1. However, it is important to recognize that this effect applies

to different observations with probabilities depending on the value of the minimum wage

and other labor market variables, and that a sizable proportion of the observations may

come from the non-binding regime.15 Calculations based on the estimated model

parameters indicate that the estimated mean probability that an observation is on the

binding regime is .48. Another metric, the proportion of observations for which the

probability of being on the binding demand regime is higher than the probability of being

on the non-binding regime, shows a similar value of .46.

       The two-regime model can be tested relative to two nested models, one in which all

observations lie on the binding regime, and one in which all observations lie on the non-

binding regime (the reduced form for employment). These nested models are based on the


    15This is similar to what Brown (1988) calls the "fallacy of the inflated denominator," by
which he means the possibility that standard minimum wage equations convey small
minimum wage effects because many of the workers for whom they are estimated are not
affected by minimum wages.
                                               15
exclusion restrictions discussed previously. Thus, the binding regime includes the minimum

wage variable and excludes the supply variable(s), while the non-binding regime includes all

variables except the minimum wage variable. The log-likelihoods for these alternative

models, and the number of restrictions implied, are also reported in the table. Likelihood-

ratio tests indicate that both nested models are rejected at less than the five-percent

level.16

           Finally, we can use the estimated parameters to solve for the mean competitive wage

above which minimum wages are binding. The estimate, expressed relative to the average

wage for all workers, is .35.

           Column (2) of Table 2 reports estimates of the three-regime model, adding the

supply regime implied by the monopsony model. The estimated minimum wage effect

along the binding demand regime falls to -.21, while remaining significant. The minimum

wage effect along the binding supply regime is equal to 1/y, the estimated value of which is

1.75. The other signs are as expected.17

           Even if the monopsony characterization of low-wage labor markets is correct, we

would not expect a large number of observations to be classified on the supply regime with



    16We also tested the restriction that the proportion of age group in population variable
could be excluded from the demand curve, by estimating the model without imposing this
restriction, in which case the parameters are still identified. The estimated coefficient
(standard error) of this variable in the demand curve was -.01 (.11).
    "Partly as a specification check, we also estimated the model including the proportion
of population in the age group in the demand function, and the prime-age male unemploy-
ment rate in the supply function, in which case the parameters are still identified. The
estimated coefficient (standard error) of the population proportion variable was .06 (.11),
and that of the unemployment rate was .38 (.24). The log likelihood was 1071.5, compared
with a value of 1070.7 in the table, so the exclusion of these variables is not rejected.
                                                16
a high probability. This turns out to be the case. The mean probability that an observation

is on the supply regime is .20, and for only one observation is the probability of being on

the supply regime higher than that of being on one of the other regimes. This is also

reflected in the mean competitive and monopsony wages implied by the estimates of the

structural parameters. At .34 and .31 respectively, these estimates indicate that the region

over which minimum wages might increase employment is relatively small. Corresponding

to these findings, the likelihood for the model restricting all observations to lie on the

supply regime is extremely low compared to the three-regime model. The two other nested
models restricting the observations to lie solely on the demand regime or solely on the non-

binding regime are also rejected at the five-percent level.

        We can also assess the fit of the monopsony model relative to the competitive model

by means of the non-nested test outlined above. As the table shows, the likelihood is in

fact higher for the three-regime monopsony model than for the two-regime competitive

model. However, the Vuong test statistic (1.34), along with the critical values reported in

 the table, indicate that the statistical fit of the three-regime model is not significantly better.

 Nonetheless, the data clearly do not reject the restriction that, for some observations,

 employment is best characterized as determined only by the minimum wage and supply

 variables.'8

 IV.b. Accounting for Stare and Year Effects

        The results in Table 2 ignore the possibility that heterogeneity across states and years


     '8As an additional specification check on the modeL we computed the implied
 equilibrium competitive and monopsony wages for each observation. This is potentially
 informative since nothing restricts these wages to be positive. For both the two- and three-
 regime models, no observations had implied equilibrium wages that were negative.
                                                  17
may bias the estimated minimum wage effects. In single-equation estimates this issue has

typically been dealt with by including fixed state and year effects in the regression equations

(e.g., Neumark and Wascher, 1992). Thus, to assess the importance of heterogeneity bias in

these results, we add a set of dummy variables for the nine Census regions to the demand

equation, and a time trend to the supply equation. We include the Census dummies in the

demand equation, since the standard argument is that demand shocks may generate a

negative correlation between employment rates and the minimum wage variable, through a

positive correlation between employment rates and wage levels (Freeman, 1982). We put

the time trend in the supply equation because we assume that this trend stems from supply

facto rs.9

       The results are reported in Table 3. For the two-regime model, but not the three-

regime model, the negative minimum wage effect falls by about one-half relative to the

estimate in Table 2, to -.18, but remains negative and significant. For both models, the

proportion of observations classified on the binding demand regime is well above that in

Table 2. Finally, for this specification, the Vuong test statistic indicates that the likelihood

for the three-regime monopsony model is significantly higher than that for the two-regime




    19Not surprisingly, we could not get the models to converge with dummy variables for
each state or each year. Specifications with Census region dummies introduced into both
the demand and supply equation also led to convergence problems. Substituting a time
trend for year dummies seems appropriate because the estimated coefficients of year
dummies in single employment equations fit a linear trend relatively well. For the purposes
of comparison, when the standard minimum wage equation reported in Table I (Panel A)
was estimated using these region dummy variables and the time trend, the estimated
minimum wage effect (standard error) was .01 (.05). Thus, the inclusion of these variables
does at least as much as the inclusion of fixed state and year effects to reduce the negative
employment effects of minimum wages.

IV.c. Variation in Minimum Wage Effects and the Probability that Minimum Wages are

Binding
      The disequilibrium framework for estimating minimum wage effects emphasizes that

the employment effects of minimum wages may vary ui systematic ways depending on

whether the minimum wage is binding. This suggests that if we estimate the single

employment equation using observations with a relatively higher probability that minimum
wages are binding, we should find relatively stronger disemployrnent effects of minimum

wages. On the other hand, when we apply our multiple-regime approach to subsamples of

observations with different probabilities that minimum wages are binding, we should find

two results: the estimated probability that minimum wages are binding should reflect this

difference; and estimated minimum wage effects along the binding regime (a) should differ

less across the subsamples than do the single-equation estimates.

      We carry out this experiment using subsamples with high and low probabilities that

minimum wages are binding, based on estimates of the two-regime model for the whole

sample. We restrict attention to the two-regime model, since in the estimates of the three-

regime model, there were virtually no observations for which the probability that

observations were on the binding supply regime were highest.

      Table 4 reports results for subsamples of observations based on whether the

estimated probability of being on the binding demand regime was greater or less than .5.

As expected, in the subsample with high probabilities that minimum wages are binding the


   20For these specifications, there was one observation for which the three-regime model
implied a negative equilibrium monopsony wage.
                                             :19
single-equation estimate of the minimum wage effect (-.56) is negative and significant. In

contrast, in the subsample with low probabilities that minimum wages are binding, this

estimate is actually positive and significant. The multiple-regime approach satisfies both of

the predictions described above. First, the two-regime estimates for each subsample

produce very different estimates of the probability that minimum wages are binding. These

estimates exceed .9 for the high probability subsample, and are less than .1 for the low-

probability subsample.2' Second, the estimated minimum wage effects for the two

subsamples on the binding regimes are much more consistent than the single-equation

estimates, as both are negative and significant.

      Finally, it seems worthwhile to assess the validity of the estimated probabilities of

lying on alternative regimes. One way to do this is to compute for each state and year the

proportion of young adults paid hourly wages equal to or less than the prevailing minimum

wage. This proportion should be positively related to the probability that minimum wages

are binding. This is confirmed, with an estimated correlation of .31 between the estimated

probability from the two-regime model, and the proportion at or below the minimum.22

      More generally, the estimates from the multiple-regime models can be used to



    21The mean estimated probabilities of being on the binding demand regime based on the
estimates for the full sample are .80 and .21 for the two subsamples.

    This exercise may also suggest the possibility of estimating the two-regime employment
model with the proportion paid at or below the minimum wage replacing the probability
that a state's minimum wage is binding. However, this approach is invalid, since it fails to
account for the employment at or below the minimum wage that would have occurred in
the absence of the minimum. This same argument explains why we cannot make any
prediction as to the magnitude of the correlation between the estimated probability that
minimum wages are binding, based on the two-regime model, and the proportion at or
below the minimum wage; in particular, it need not be near one.
                                              20
compute minimum wage effects for alternative scenarios regarding minimum wages and

labor market conditions, which in turn may be useful in interpreting variation in single-

equation estimates of minimum wage effects across different samples. In this context, Table

5 reports the average probabilities that observations are on the binding regime and the

average elasticities of employment rates with respect to minimum wages, for each year in

our sample period and for each Census division, based on the estimates in Table 2. The

elasticity for each observation is estimated as the product of the probability of being on the

binding regime, the estimated minimum wage effect, and the ratio of the minimum wage
variable to the employment rate.

       For the two-regime model, the estimated average probabilities of being on the

binding regime, shown in column (2), vary considerably over both years and regions, ranging

from .05 to .87. Reflecting this variation, the average elasticities shown in column (3) also

vary considerably, ranging from -.01 to -.24. The estimated minimum wage elasticities rise

(in absolute value) as the federal minimum wage increases (relative to the mean wage)

through 1982, and then fall as the federal minimum wage declines in real terms over the

remainder of the 1980s. The variation in the elasticities across regions also corresponds to

variation in the coverage-adjusted relative minimum wage (to which it is related by

construction). In the low-wage East South Central, West South Central, and South Atlantic

states the relative minimum wage variable is high, and the estimated minimum wage

elasticity ranges from -.15 to -.24. In contrast, in the high-wage Pacific region the relative

minimum wage variable is lowest, and the estimated minimum wage elasticity is only -.05.

These calculations, coupled with the single-equation estimates in Table 4 for the subsamples

of observations with high and low probabilities of binding minimum wages, suggest that

                                               21
estimated minimum wage effects are quite sensitive to the probability that minimum wages

are binding.
      As a final exercise, the last two columns of Table 5 report results based on the three-

regime monopsony model. Column (4) reports the estimated probabilities that observations

are on the binding demand regime, along which minimum wages are estimated to reduce

employment. These probabilities are similar to those estimated from the competitive

model. Column (5) reports the estimated probabilities of being on the regime that is unique

to the monopsony model, namely the binding supply regime along which minimum wages

are estimated to increase employment. Except for 1973, the average estimated probability

of being on the binding supply regime never exceeds the average estimated probability of

being on the binding demand regime. Nonetheless, the probabilities of being on the binding
supply regime are clearly non-negligible, and in many cases are above .2. Thus, our results

admit the possibility that some minimum wage studies produce positive effects of minimum

wages on employment because they use samples for which observations are concentrated

along the monopsony regime.

IV.d. A Non-Structural Approach

       To gauge the dependence of our results on the assumed structure for the demand,

supply, and marginal cost curves, we also consider a non-structural approach that allows the

parameters of the standard minimum wage-employment equation (1) to vary depending. in

 a simple way, on how likely the minimum wage is to be binding. As an analog to the two-

 regime competitive model, we first allow the coefficient estimates of equation (1) to take on

 two distinct sets of values, one for observations for which the coverage-adjusted relative

 minimum wage is relatively low, and one for observations for which it is relatively high.

                                               22
Rather than specify a priori "high' and "low" values, we use a grid search over the possible

range of the coverage-adjusted relative minimum wage, and select the 'switch point" for this

variable that maximizes the likelihood for the sample.23

      Estimates in which the equations in each of the two regimes are unconstrained are

reported in the first column of Table 6. For the binding regime, which refers to those

observations with values of the coverage-adjusted relative minimum wage above the switch

point chosen by the grid search, the estimated minimum wage effect is -.4 1, more than

double that from the single-equation estimates, and is significant. For the non-binding

regime the estimated minimum wage effect is positive and significant. 58 percent of the

observations are classified as being on the binding regime, and the remaining 42 percent as

being on the non-binding regime.
      In columns (2) and (3) we constrain some of the parameters in each of the regimes

in ways suggested by theory, to attempt to increase the correspondence between the theory

and the regimes chosen by the grid search procedure. First, in column (2), we constrain the

minimum wage effect to be zero in the non-binding regime (and recompute the grid search).

The chosen sample separation is the same as in column (1), with, accordingly, the same

estimated minimum wage effect in the binding regime. In column (3) we further constrain

the model to exclude the supply variable (the proportion of population) from the binding

regime, which is supposed to be the demand curve. Since the non-binding regime is the



   For each iteration of the grid search, we define a dummy variable B,, = 1 if the
minimum wage variable was above the switch point, and 0 otherwise, and then estimate the
model

       E=    (aBMW + RBB)•Bfl +      (aNBMWI, +   RB)(1 - B)
                                             23
reduced form for employment, it should include both demand and supply variables, so no

further constraints are imposed on this regime. The estimates are again little changed with

this additional restriction. The likelihood-ratio tests of any of the two-regime models in

Table 6 relative to the constrained one-regime model in Table I lead to rejection of the

latter.

          The two-regime estimates from the non-structural approach correspond to those from

the structural approach along a number of dimensions. First, the classification of

observations on the binding vs. the non-binding regimes is similar, with the non-structural

approach assigning .58 of the observations to the binding regime (for all three models in

Table 6), while the structural estimates imply that the probability of being on the binding

regime exceeds one-half for .46 of the observations. Second, the estimated switch point for

all three models in Table 6 is .34. This is close to the mean equilibrium competitive wage

of .35 implied by the structural estimates in Table 2. Finally, the parameter estimates for

the binding regime from the non-structural approach should correspond to the labor demand

curve, and hence can be compared directly to the estimated parameters of the demand

curve from the structural approach. These parameter estimates are quite close, as can be

seen from comparing the estimated coefficients of the minimum wage variable and the

 unemployment rate in the top panel of column (3) of Table 6 with the demand curve

 estimates in colunm (I) of Table 2. Together, these similarities boost our confidence in the

 structural approach.
           Next, we extend the non-structural approach to three regimes, corresponding to the

 monopsony model, by allowing two switch points for the coverage-adjusted relative

 minimum wage. Results for unconstrained equations are reported in the first column of

                                                24
Table 7. As the monopsony model would lead us to expect, there are positive minimum

wage effects in the middle regime, on which 39 percent of the observations are classified.

As in the two-regime model, 58 percent of the observations are classified on the binding

regime above the higher switch point (i.e., the demand curve), so the estimated minimum

wage effect for this region is again -.41. Finally, only three percent of the observations are

classified on the non-binding regime (below the lower switch point); the estimated minimum

wage effect for this regime is positive but not significant.

       In column (2) the model is constrained so that there is no minimum wage effect in

the non-binding regime. The estimates are little changed. In column (3) the proportion of

population variable is again excluded from the regime that should correspond to the

demand curve, and the unemployment rate is excluded from the regime that should

correspond to the supply curve. This results in a substantial reduction (to .06) in the

proportion of observations classified on the supply curve. In addition, the estimated

positive minimum wage effect in this regime is now insignificant, with the standard error

rising more than ten-fold.

       Again, the estimates from the non-structural approach can be compared with those

from the structural approach along a number of dimensions. First, using the column (3)

non-structural estimates, the classification of observations on the alternative regimes is

similar. The non-structural approach assigns .84 of the observations to the upper binding

regime, and .06 to the lower binding regime, while the structural estimates imply that the

probability of being on the binding demand regime is highest for .70 of the observations,

and the probability of being on the binding supply regime is highest for .001 of the

observations. Second, the estimated switch points of .31 and .30 correspond closely to the

                                               25
mean equilibrium competitive and monopsony wages implied by the structural estimates,

reported in Table 2, of .34 and .31. Third, the parameter estimates for the upper binding

regime from the non-structural approach should correspond to the labor demand curve, and

those from the lower binding regime should correspond to the labor supply curve.

Comparing the non-structural estimates in column (3) of Table 7 with those in column (2)

of Table 2, the correspondence holds in terms of the estimated signs of all of the

parameters, and many of the estimated coefficients are quite close.

      Finally, the structural and non-structural approaches can be compared with respect to

testing the monopsony vs. the competitive model. In the non-structural approach, for the

constrained model the likelihood-ratio test of the three-regime model vs. the two-regime

model (which has two fewer parameters) leads to a rejection of the two-regime model at

the ten-percent significance level, but not the five-percent level. Thus, the non-structural

approach provides a bit more support for the monopsony characterization of low-wage labor

markets than did the structural approach, although the structural approach also rejected the

competitive model in the specifications including region and year effects.

       Although we have presented results from the nonstructural specification for purposes

of comparison, in our view this approach has several weaknesses as compared with the

structural approach on which the endogenous switching model is based. First, the

nonstructural approach classifies observations as unambiguously on one of the alternative

regimes, whereas the structural approach produces a probabilistic classification of being on

the alternative regimes, which captures the inherent uncertainty in classifying observations.

Second, the classification indicated by the nonstructural approach depends solely on the

value of the minimum wage variable. Although whether or not the minimum wage is

                                              26
binding should depend only on the minimum wage relative to the market-determined wage

for affected workers in the absence of minimum wages, the latter is of course unobserved.

Therefore, factors affecting the demand for and supply of young workers are likely to

provide some information on the likelihood that the minimum wage is binding. The

structural approach incorporates this information explicitly by specifying the switching

equation in terms of the minimum wage relative to the equilibrium competitive (and

monopsony) wage, which are functions of the demand and supply determinants. Finally,

while the non-structural approach is intended to identify switch points associated with the

structural regimes in the model, we cannot rule out the possibility that it has instead

identified switch points associated with nonlinearities in the equation or outliers. The

structural approach, in contrast, explicitly specifies the "switch points" in terms of

intersections of the demand, supply, and marginal cost of labor curves.

V. Conclusions

       In the competitive model of low-wage labor markets, a legislated minimum wage

below the equilibrium competitive wage should be unrelated to employment. In contrast, a

minimum wage higher than the equilibrium competitive wage should be negatively related

to employment. Like the competitive model, the monopsony model implies that there is a

region below which minimum wages are non-binding and do not affect employment, and a

region above which minimum wages trace out the labor demand curve and reduce

 employment. In addition, there is a region between these two, along which minimum wages

 trace out the labor supply curve, and raise employment. We therefore may learn more

 about minimum wage effects by separating sample observations into these various regimes,

 and estimating minimum wage effects along the appropriate regimes. This paper develops

                                                27
and implements such an approach, using methods adapted from the market disequilibrium

literature.

       We claimed at the outset that this approach has three potential advantages relative to

existing single-equation estimates: it leads to estimates of the employment effects of

minimum wages when they are binding; it yields a (probabilistic) classification of

observations based on whether or not minimum wages are binding; and it provides a test of

the monopsony characterization of low-wage labor markets. We summarize the results in

terms of each of these potential advantages.

       First, the two-regime competitive model and the three-regime monopsony model

yield significant negative estimated effects of minimum wages on employment in the

binding demand regimes, under a variety of alternative specifications. Not surprisingly,

these estimated disemployment effects are generally stronger than single-equation estimates.

        Second, calculations using the estimated probabilities of lying on alternative regimes

implied by the models suggest that the effects of minimum wages on employment may vary

considerably depending on the prevailing minimum wage and other labor market conditions.

This may help to explain some of the variation in estimated minimum wage effects in

recent research.

        Third, estimates of the three-regime monopsony model suggest that a small fraction

of observations may lie on a supply regime along which minimum wages increase
employment. The three-regime monopsony model never fits the data worse than the two-

regime competitive model, and sometimes fits the data significantly better.

        Finally, the sensitivity of minimum wage effects on employment to the relative

magnitude of the minimum wage, and to other labor market conditions, implies that the

                                               28
multiple-regime, disequilibrium approach is useful even if we simply want to predict the

employment effects of minimum wages, rather than to uncover the structural estimates of

the labor demand and supply curves. In particular, single-equation estimates may be

unreliable when the minimum wage and other labor market conditions diverge from those

prevailing in the sample from which the estimates are computed. In contrast, the

disequilibrium approach can provide a richer set of information about the effects of

minimum wages, including whether or not minimum wages are likely to be binding, how

changes in other labor market conditions influence minimum wage effects, and how

minimum wages are likely to affect employment under a variety of scenarios regarding the

minimum wage and other labor market characteristics.

There are 751 observations covering the period 1977-1989 for all states, and 1973-1989 for 22 slates identified in the CPS
beginning in 1973. Standard errors are reporied in parentheses. Probabilities of observations lying on alternative regimes
are based on unconditional probabilities. Implied equilibrium competitive and monopsony wages are computed at sample
means. Standard errors are computed by linearizing the expression for the equilibrium wage, treating the means as fixed,
and applying the estimated variances and covariances of the parameters. The critical values for the Vuong test statistic arc
not centered around zero because they have been adjusted for the greater number of parameters in the three-regime model.

Nunsbcrs reported in columns (2) and (3) are based on average effects for the availablc observations based on probabilities
and elasticities evaluated at the state-by-year level. The increased coverage-adjusted relative minimum wage in 1985 is
partly attributable to a rise in coverage owing to a court ruling that state and local government workers were subject to the
minimum wage. For some of the earlier years, minimum wage level is for workers previously covered under the ELSA,
whereas ncwly covered workers came in at lower minimum wages. All means are unweighted.
