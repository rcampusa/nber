       By double taxing the income of corporate firms but not unincorporated firms, taxes can play an
important role in a firm's choice of organizational form. The sensitivity of the organizational form
decision to tax rates can also be used to approximate the efficiency cost of the corporate income tax. This
paper uses new cross-sectional data on organizational form across states compiled in the Census of Retail
Trade to estimate this sensitivity. The results document a significant impact of the relative taxation of
corporate to personal income on the share of economic activity that is done by corporations including
sales, employment, and the number of firms. The impacts are substantially larger than those found in the
previous empirical literature based on time-series data.

1. Introduction
        The corporate income tax generates a distortion by double taxing corporate income. In

other words, corporations typically pay income tax on income earned at the corporate level and

then shareholders pay personal income tax upon the income when it is distributed to them. The

fact that the taxation of corporate income generally exceeds that of personal income raises the

question of how distortionary the corporate income tax is—the magnitude of the deadweight loss

(DWL) of the corporate income tax.

       The issue is central to standard work on the subject such as Harberger (1966), Shoven

(1976) or Ballard et al. (1985). In these models, some sectors (e.g., manufacturing) are assumed

to be corporate sectors and other sectors to be non-corporate. A tax on the corporate sector will

lead to shifting to other sectors and this generates a deadweight loss (DWL). The models are

then simulated in computable general equilibrium models and tend to suggest relatively small

efficiency costs—less than 20 percent of the revenue generated.

       A more recent literature has sought to consider the efficiency costs of the corporate

income tax in a different setting. In particular, Gravelle and Kotlikoff (1988; 1989; 1993) point

out that there can be both corporate and noncorporate production in the same sector. Taxing

corporate income may lead to much more shifting within sector between organizational forms

than across different sectors. Using such a model they predict an extremely large DWL from the

corporate income tax, frequently in excess of 100 percent of the revenue generated. The key

determinant of the DWL in these models is how much firms in the same industry shift to non-

corporate forms in response to the corporate income tax and this is an empirically testable idea.

       In principle, it should be possible to estimate the efficiency loss from the corporate

income tax by examining how much a corporate tax increase induces firms to shift out of
corporate form. This is the subject of Gordon and Mackie-Mason (1990; 1994; 1997) and

Goolsbee (1998) specifically. It is also implicit in the large literature on how corporate taxes

affect organizational form decisions such as Ayers et al. (1996), Carroll and Joulfaian (1997),

Gentry (1994), Fullerton and Rogers (1993), Scholes and Wolfson (1990; 1991; 1992), and

Plesko (1995; 1997). The results in Gordon and Mackie-Mason and in Goolsbee indicate that

across different time periods, there does not seem to be much shifting in response to tax rates,

suggesting that the DWL of the corporate income tax is relatively modest overall. (i.e., low

shifting implies low distortions).

        An underlying empirical problem in much of this literature comes from data constraints.

Variation in corporate tax rates over the past 30 years has been almost. Further, the standard

approach has been to look at time-series type regressions, typically at a highly aggregated level,

though sometimes with a limited panel of firm level data. The problem is that when the

corporate tax rate changes, such as in 1986, many other aspects of the tax code change, as well,

making it difficult to be sure that one is picking up the effect of tax rates.

        This paper turns to a new data source to identify the impact of the corporate income tax

using cross-sectional variation in corporate tax rates in order to avoid the typical problems of the

time-series based literature. It does this by looking at variations in corporate income taxes across

states and combining that with unpublished data from the Department of the Census on the

organizational form by 3 and 4 digit SIC code in the retail trade sector across states in 1992.

        Although the census data have some problems that traditional tax data do not have, and

although there the impact of state and federal corporate income taxes may differ (since firms

have an easier time moving to different jurisdictions to avoid state taxes, for example) this cross-

sectional approach allows for a direct estimate of the impact of tax rates on corporate incentives
to incorporate while controlling for aggregate factors. As a further matter, there is considerable

interest in the subject of state corporate income taxes themselves.

          This paper will examine the impact of corporate income taxes on firms' choice of

organizational form decisions and the implied efficiency cost of the corporate income tax in 5

sections. Section 2 gives an overview of the way taxes may affect the organizational form

choice and presents a simple model deriving the relative tax term. Section 3 summarizes the

specification estimated in the paper and the data used. Section 4 presents the regression results.

Section 5 concludes.



2. Overview of organizational form choices

A. Institutional Background

          An enterprise that conducts business does not have to declare itself to be a corporation

and thus can avoid any double taxation. The firm can be organized as a sole proprietorship or as

a partnership in which case any income earned will flow through to the partners' or proprietor's

individual income tax. Although this type of flow through entity would appear to have a tax

advantage for most types of business entities, there are important non-tax factors that lead most

business assets to end up in corporate form. The two most important are limited liability and

access to capital markets. The investors and managers of corporations do no t risk their

individual assets or income when they take part in a firm. They are only liable for the amount

that they have invested in the company. Corporations also have the right to trade on organized

exchanges and typically have easier access to both debt and equity. Discussion of other non-tax

factors relating to organizational form choices can be found in Guenther (1992) or Scholes et al

(2002).
          It is important to note some exceptions to this simple dichotomy of form choice. The

first is that within the corporate sector, starting in 1958, certain firms could become S

corporations (as opposed to the traditional C corporations). Income from S corporations are flow

through entities like traditional partnerships, eliminating the double taxation without losing the

limited liability. S corporations limit the number of shareholders to . More details on the

comparison of S and C corporations can be found in Gordon and Mackie-Mason (1997). Recent

years have seen a considerable expansion in hybrid organizational forms such as the Limited

Liability Partnership, etc. which somewhat blur the lines between forms. At the time of this

sample (1992), all such forms other than S corporations were rare or non-existant and, as I will

indicate below, S corporations were not especially numerous in the retail sector.



B. A Simple Theory of Organizational Form

          The stylized model of a firm's decision about whether to incorporate here follows the

work of Gordon and Mackie-Mason (1994) with some extensions. Assume, for simplicity, that

the income generated by a firm, Y, is the same regardless of organization type and that there is

some relative non-tax benefit G associated with being a corporation which is itself a function of

firm characteristics, x. The non-tax benefit is assumed to be non-taxable (e.g., something like

the value of limited liability). The after-tax income from operating as a corporation each period

is then

                                 I C = G ( x ) + Y (1 − t CST )(1 − t CF )(1 − t e )
where t CST is the state corporate income tax rate, t CF is the federal corporate income tax rate and te

is the tax rate on equity income.1 That is, a firm gets G plus income net of corporate and equity

taxes and the state tax is deductible from the federal. 2

        The after tax income from a noncorporate firm is then

                                           I NC = Y (1 − t PST )(1 − t PF ) .

where t PST is the state personal income tax rate facing the marginal investor and t PF is the federal

personal income tax rate facing the marginal investor. In words, a noncorporate firm gets no G

but pays only personal income taxes on the income.

        Clearly, the firm will prefer the corporate form whenever

                                        G( x) > Y (~tC + (1 − ~tC )t e − ~tP )

where ~
      ti is the full marginal tax rate on income type i—i.e., accounting for state and federal

taxation—according to

                                             ~
                                             ti = t iST + t iF − t iST t iF .

        In the case where the effective rate of taxation on equity is zero, all that matters is the

relative taxation of corporate versus personal income. The model illustrates that the key tax

determinant of the decision of whether to incorporate is the relative taxation of corporate versus

personal income. While each of these tax components can, to some degree, be measured, the

sign of the relationship depends on whether taxable income is greater than zero and this fact that




1 I will exclude discussion of the payroll tax whose method of payment differs for corporations versus
partnerships/proprietorships but whose total burden is equal.
2 This is sufficient for almost all states. In five small states, however, at the time of the sample—Alabama, Iowa,
Louisiana, Maryland, and North Dakota—the previous year's federal taxes are also deductible from the state taxes. I
account for this in the empirical work.
is not observed in the census data. I will have to use proxies for profitability to examine whether

this prediction is born out in the data.

          This model is most relevant for small, entrepreneurial type firms. In particular, it is not a

good approximation for multi-state firms. When a firm conducts business in multiple states, its

marginal tax rate becomes a weighted average of tax rates in all the states it does business in

according to the apportionment formula (see Gordon & Wilson, 1986; Goolsbee and Maydew,

2000). The evidence will, indeed, show that the empirical model fits much better in industries

with a small number of establishments per firm.

say employment or revenue, for state s and industry i according to

gains to incorporation, and Z is a vector of state level factors that may influence the likelihood of

incorporation. 3



B. Data on Organizational Form Across States and Industries



3 The right hand side share variable is censored at 0 and 1 in a few cases (1-3 percent or the state-industries). In the
results below I will use the linear regression model for simplicity, especially in dealing with the fixed effects. I have
checked the results but using a Tobit estimator with censoring at 0 and 1 and the results were virtually identical.
       The data on organizational form come from the Census of Retail Trade for 1992. This

economic census is conducted every five years and is meant to provide comprehensive coverage

of the sector. Retail trade, being primarily a non-tradeable, may not be representative of other

sectors of the economy. It may, for example, be more sensitive to organizational form decisions

than other industries are (for those industries, it is easier to change the location of production).

That said, retail trade is an enormous sector on its own accord. In 1992, total sales in the retail

trade sectors included in this sample exceeded $1.7 Trillion and employment was almost 17.5

million. This was divided between 8 broad classes of retail trade as shown in table 1. According

to the BEA, in 1992 retail trade made up almost 9 percent of national GDP and the BLS reports

that it employed about 16.5 percent of the nation's workforce.

       The census of retail trade asks firms about their organizational form. The choices are

corporate, partnership, sole proprietorship, and other. I will use the sum of all the non-corporate

categories as the non-corporate share. One drawback of the Census data compared to tax return

data is that the Census does not distinguish any of the hybrid organizational forms, most

importantly, it does not differentiate S corporations from C corporations. The S corps are flow

through entities so changes to the relative tax term may lead businesses to shift from C to S

corporations in response to the tax but this will not show up as a change in the Census data since

the firm will remain a corporation in both cases. This will no doubt bias the estimated impact of

taxes on organizational form choices toward zero in the current sample. It is not possible to

determine how important a factor this is because there is no publicly available information on the

share of S corporations by state. The Statistics of income for 1992 for the entire nation,

however, shows that the share of corporate returns in the wholesale and retail trade sector that

are S corporations is about 20 percent. The share of total revenues in the corporate sector from S
corporations is about 5 percent. On average, then, the misclassification of corporations is

relatively small, though they may be more sensitive on the margin than are other corporations.

       Similarly, there is no income information in the data because it is establishment based

and income is fundamentally a firm- level concept. This will prevent all but the most crude proxy

for the differential responses of gain versus loss firms.

       I received a special tabulation from the Census Bureau for each reported SIC code and

each variable (employment, payroll, sales, firms, establishments) the totals by organizational

form type. I will use the corporate share of the industry total as the dependent variable in the

regressions. These special tabulations are subject to non-disclosure requirements meaning that

the Census does not reveal information that could be used to learn about specific companies. So,

for example, SIC code 5943, Stationery Stores is missing information on employment and sales

in several smaller states. The missing observations are concentrated among the small states and

the small industries, of course. In the 76 industries 3-digit industries, of the 1900 possible

industry-state combinations, 15 have data on the number of corporate firms and establishments

withheld for disclosure reasons. More of the employment, payroll and sales observations are

withheld with about 210 of the 1900 possible observations missing for the corporate sector in

these areas.

       The data include information on the SIC codes listed in the Appendix table. I will mainly

focus on the 3 digit SIC code level, though I will also present some results at the 2- and the 4-

digit level. At lower levels of aggregation, not all the industries are covered. One of the big

advantages of looking at the retail trade data is that there are many industries with a great deal of

non-corporate activity, unlike manufacturing and some other prominent sectors. There is also a

great deal of variation in the corporate share.
B. Data on Taxes and Other Control Variables

       The components of the tax term are computed as follows: the combined federal and state

tax on personal income for the marginal investor is the highest marginal rate in the state,

combining federal and state taxation, as computed by the NBER TAXSIM for the year 1992 as

reported in NBER (2002). For the corporate rate, I use the information in the Book of the States

(1994) as well as Significant Features of Fiscal Federalism (ACIR, 1994) and compute the

highest corporate marginal rate in the state, taking account of the deductibility of state taxes from

the federal and the reverse in the relevant states. Michigan does not have conventional corporate

income tax so I exclude it from the results.

       The model above seems to outline the decision of the organizational choice of a small

entrepreneur. For such a person, the tax on equity is different than for a larger company. Since

small firms are unlikely to pay any dividends, however, and because there are several aspects of

capital gains that are highly favorable to small entrepreneurs (greater deductibility of losses from

ordinary income, for example), it it probably more accurate to assume the tax rate on equity is

zero. I will do that here. Results were similar assuming equity taxation at the highest state

capital gains rate, discounted for delayed realization as in Feldstein et al. (1983), instead, as

demonstrated in an earlier version of this paper (Goolsbee, 2002).

       Figure 1 plots ~tC for each state on the y-axis and ~t P on the x-axis. The difference

between the two is the tax term so states well above the 45 degree line like Alaska, Pennsylvania

and Connecticut tax corporate income relatively heavily compared with personal income and
places closer to or actually below the 45 degree line like South Carolina, Kansas and Vermont

tax corporate income relatively lightly. 4

         Industry characteristics that might influence the probability of incorporation (through,

say, increasing the value of limited liability or access to capital markets) might be average firm

size, pay, number of establishments per firm and the like. To keep things as general as possible,

I will include the log of total industry sales, employment, payroll, number of firms and number

of establishments. I tried including various ratios such as population density, sales per firm and

so on, instead of the logs and the results were the same. Note that because there are dummies for

every SIC code, the specifications fully account for any industry level variation in non-tax

reasons for incorporation.

         There may also be state characteristics that might influence the probability of

incorporation in all industries. It is impossible to include state dummies since the tax rate does

not vary across industries but I will include information on the log of the Gross State Product in

the state in the year of the sample (1992) and the previous year (1991) from the BEA, the log of

the land area and the log of population in the state from the U.S. Statistical Abstract and the

share of the state population born outside the state (either domestic or foreign born) and the share

of the people born in the state that are still living in the state both at the time of the 1990 census,

calculated from U.S. Department of the Census (2002) as well as the share of the state that is

rural. The view is that state income levels or growth rates, concentration of population, tax

competition pressures from neighboring states or a higher transient/new population all might

influence the probability of incorporation. I also include the share of the state that has some

4 . The regressions will take these tax rates as exogenous. Though I do not have information about how the state
tax rates were determined, I did try including other types of taxes which might be correlated with the unobserved
business climate in the state such as the sales tax rate and generally did not find that it changed the results presented.
college education in the spirit of the theoretical work of Levin and Tadelis (2002). All of the

state level data, including the tax rates, summarized in Table 2.



4. Results

A. Basic Results

        Results from the basic specification explaining the corporate share of firms,

establishments, employment, payroll, and sales in a given industry in a given state as a function

of the relative tax term and the other control variables are reported in table 3. This is for 38

different industries at the 3-digit SIC code level. There are SIC code dummies for the industries

so the coefficients indicate the impact that a state having a higher relative tax on corporations has

on its share of corporate activity relative to other states in that same industry. For each of the

types of economic activity, the coefficient on taxes is negative (and significant for all but one)

indicating that increasing the relative burden on corporations reduces the corporate share of

activity.

        The coefficient on firms indicates that every .01 rise in the corporate income tax reduces

the corporate share of firms by .006. Interestingly, the results indicate that the share of firms

responds much more to the tax term than does the share of establishments. Similarly, the share

of employment, payroll and sales responds negatively, as well, but by less than does the number

of firms (this is especially true considering that the corporate share is higher for these variables

than for the number of firms). The number of firms may be more responsive than other

categories because state corporate tax rates are frequently progressive and a small firm can

remain in the lower marginal tax rate by simply starting a new firm rather than by growing.
        The magnitudes of the tax coefficients are not precisely comparable to the effects

estimated in the literature by Gordon and Mackie-Mason (1994; 1997) or Goolsbee (1998)

because those papers dealt with the corporate share of capital or the share of reported income

whereas these are for the number of firms and establishments and the level of sales, employment

and payroll. That said, the coefficients on the tax term here are substantially larger than on the

same tax term in those papers. The coefficients of the tax term on the share of industrial activity

done by corporations here ranges from -.17 to -.60. The equivalent coefficients in the previous

literature (on the overall corporate share of capital assets) generally ranged from -.001 to -.15.



B. Robustness

        Next, in table 4, I examine the results at different levels of aggregation. For brevity, I

will look at the corporate share of firms, employment and sales and leave establishments and

payroll out of the tables. The results are highly related, just as in the previous table. At the 2-

digit SIC code level, there is data is available for all of the industries, although there are only 8

SIC codes so the estimates are not estimated very precisely. The results, presented in columns

(1)-(3) show a similar pattern with similar magnitudes but larger standard errors. For a subset of

industries, there is more detailed data, i.e., down to the 4-digit SIC code level. These are

concentrated only in the 2-digit SIC codes 57, 58 and 59. Looking at these 30 industries in

columns (4)-(6) shows even larger effects than the 3-digit results did, especially for the ‘real’

factors of employment and sales.

        In table 5, I deal with the robustness questions that might arise from weighting state-

industries equally despite dramatically varying sizes. In theory, since the regressions are

controlling for size of population of the state and the size of the sector, this should not matter but
there may be differences in the responsiveness for different sized industries. Columns (1)-(3)

reestimate the regressions but weight them by state population size. The coefficients are of

greater magnitude than before. Columns (4)-(6) present results from a median regression on the

same data which again show that the magnitudes are not being driven by a small number of

outliers or a few small states. The results here are even more sensitive to tax rates.



C. Explaining Differing Tax Sensitivities

        Table 6 examines the issue of multi-establishment firms. Because of the higher

probability of being multi- state firms (and thereby having tax rates that differ from the tax rates

in the one state), firms with more establishments should appear less sensitive to state relative tax

rates than do single establishment firms. The data do not go down to that level of detail but I can

divide the observations between industries with average establishments per firm less than 2 and

those with greater than or equal to 2. As the number of observations indicate, the majority of

firms are in the few-establishments group, though there are about 10-15 percent in the multiple

establishment group. As predicted, the corporate share of firms, employment and sales is quite

significantly related to taxation among firms with a low number of establishments. This is

presented in columns (1), (3) and (5). For firms with many establishments, presented in columns

(2), (4) and (6), there is no significant effect of the tax rate in an individual state and the

coefficients are much smaller.

        Table 7 explores two things that ought to influence the tax sensitivity of various state-

industries. The theory demonstrated that the impact of the tax term should have opposite signs

for tax loss firms as for tax gain firms. In the Census data, of course, there is not even

accounting profit information, much less reported taxable income. As a proxy, though, I will use
the ratio of total operating expenses relative to sales. Total operating expenses include payroll,

benefits, costs of goods sold, materials and supplies, depreciation, leases, fuel and electricity but

not capital expenditures. The payroll information is in the state level census data, the other

operating expenses come from the national edition of the Census of Retail Trade-Assets and

Expenditues Series. Some of those data are given at only the 2-digit level so I assume all SICs in

the same 2-digit category have the same operating expense ratio in these cases. The measure of

total expenses ranges from 71 percent of sales for Department Store Retailers to more than 98

percent of sales for Radio, Television and Music stores and for Grocery Stores.

        Columns (1)-(3) interact this measure of operating expenses with the relative tax term. If

the percent of sales revenue remaining after subtracting total operating expenses is a crude

measure of profitability then the tax term should be less important in industries with higher

expense ratios. In other words, the interaction term should be positive if the measured tax term

is less important for firms making losses (i.e., with high expense ratios). The results have the

correct signs although they are clearly noisy, especially as regards employment and sales.

        The last 3 columns then explore whether sensitivity to tax rates is related to the physical

size or to the population of the state. At the outset, I noted that the sensitivity to state corporate

income taxes might be greater than to federal income taxes because corporate firms can move

locations as well as change organizational status in response to local variation. In small or

sparsely populated places like Vermont, firms may react very negatively to a tax increase

whereas in a place like California they may want to remain in the market and as corporations no

matter what the cost. To explore this, I interact the tax term with the log of population and the

log of land area in the state. For the corporate share of firms in the state- industry, both variables

matter. For employment and for sales, only the physical size of the state matters. In every case,
the smaller the state, the greater is the sensitivity to relative tax differentials. The magnitudes are

quite large. Take corporate employment. For a state in the 5th percentile of the size distribution

(Connecticut), raising the relative tax term by .01 reduces the share of corporate share of firms in

the state- industry by .014. For a state in the 95th percentile, the effect is zero (the point estimate

is -.001).



5. Conclusion

        Using new, cross-sectional census data across states and industries in the retail trade

sector, this paper has shown that the relative taxation of corporate to personal income plays an

important role in the share of firms, employment and sales that are done by corporations versus

partnerships and sole proprietorships. An increase in the corporate tax rate by .10 reduces the

corporate share of firms by 5-10 percent and the corporate share of sales and employment by 2-6

percent. Given the lack of data on S corporations in the census data, this is likely to be an

underestimate of the true shifting. This impact of tax rates is an order of magnitude larger than

previous estimates based on time-series variation in the tax rate and suggests a larger DWL from

corporate taxation but is still relatively modest.
