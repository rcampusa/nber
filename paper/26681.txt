Unpacking Skill Bias: Automation and New Tasks
Daron Acemoglu and Pascual Restrepo
NBER Working Paper No. 26681

                                           ABSTRACT

The standard approach to modeling inequality, building on Tinbergen's seminal work, assumes
factor-augmenting technologies and technological change biased in favor of skilled workers.
Though this approach has been successful in conceptualizing and documenting the race between
technology and education, it is restrictive in a number of crucial respects. First, it predicts that
technological improvements should increase the real wages of all workers. Second, it requires
sizable productivity growth to account for realistic changes in relative wages. Third, it is silent on
changes in job and task composition. We extend this framework by modeling the allocation of
tasks to factors and allowing richer forms of technological changes in particular, automation that
displaces workers from tasks they used to perform, and the creation of new tasks that reinstate
workers into the production process. We show that factor prices depend on the set of tasks that
factors perform, and that automation: (i) powerfully impacts inequality; (ii) can reduce real
wages; and (iii) can generate realistic changes in inequality with small changes in productivity.
New tasks, on the other hand, can increase or reduce inequality depending on whether it is skilled
or unskilled workers that have a comparative advantage in these new activities. Using industry-
level estimates of displacement driven by automation and reinstatement due to new tasks, we
show that displacement is associated with significant increases in industry demand for skills both
before 1987 and after 1987, while reinstatement reduced the demand for skills before 1987, but
generated higher demand for skills after 1987. The combined effects of displacement and
reinstatement after 1987 explain a significant part of the shift towards greater demand for skills in
the US economy.

Introduction
Tinbergen's (1974) approach to inequality, based on the race between technological change
increasing the demand for skills and the rise in the supply of skills due to education, has
been a mainstay of labor economics. Its canonical formalization in the SBTC (skill-biased
technological change) model of, inter alia, Katz and Murphy (1992) and Goldin and Katz
(2008) has transformed the study of inequality and skills. In this model, technological
change takes a factor-augmenting form and increases the productivity of skilled workers
more than those of less skilled workers. In its most common version, changes in the
demand for skills can be expressed as

                               wH    1     H   -1      AH
                        d ln      = - d ln   +    d ln    .
                               wL          L           AL

where wH wL is the skill premium, H L is the relative supply of skills,  is the elasticity of
substitution between skilled and unskilled workers and AL and AH are factor-augmenting
technologies for unskilled and skilled workers respectively. In Katz and Murphy's seminal
paper,  is estimated to be around 1.4, and, combined with a steady growth path for
AH AL , this model accounts for the time-series of the college premium in the US fairly
successfully.
   As argued in Acemoglu and Autor (2011), however, this framework is restrictive in
some crucial respects. It does not help us understand the occupational trends in the labor
market of most advanced economies, whereby, rather than general skill upgrading, we see
the disappearance of middle-skill occupations, such as production and clerical jobs. More
importantly, as pointed out in Acemoglu and Restrepo (2019), the economic mechanism
in the canonical SBTC model is the substitution of the tasks and goods produced by
skilled workers who are becoming more productive for those produced by less skilled
workers (and is thus mediated by the elasticity of substitution  ). This implies that the
canonical SBTC model cannot account for major changes in the US labor market without
technological regress. First, without technological regress, real wages of unskilled workers
should be rising, whereas, in the US over the last four decades, they have declined notably.
Second, even if AL were constant, this model could only generate the rise in the US college
premium between 1963 and 1987 with a growth of 11.3% per annum in AH . But this would
translate into at least a 1.9% increase in TFP, whereas the US TFP over this time period
grew only by 1.2% per annum (the same applies for the more recent 1992­2008 period;
see the Appendix).
   Acemoglu and Autor (2011) and Acemoglu and Restrepo (2018, 2019) propose a task-
based model that redresses some of these problems and extends the types of technological
changes that impact the demand for skills (see also Autor, Levy and Murnane, 2003). At


                                             2
the center of the framework are (1) the allocation of tasks to different factors of produc-
tion (skilled labor, unskilled labor and capital); and (2) new technologies that affect the
productivity of factors in specific tasks and, as with automation, change the task content
of production. In this framework, the effect of technology on the demand for skills and
wages is not mediated via the elasticity of substitution; the impacts of technology on
productivity and wages are decoupled; and new technologies can easily reduce wages for
some workers. In this paper, we develop a flexible version of this conceptual framework,
study the impact of different types of technologies on productivity and wages, and provide
evidence on the link between automation and inequality.1


1        A Model of Tasks, Output and Inequality
We start with a single-industry model. The unique final good is produced from a mass M
of tasks x  T combined via a CES aggregator:
                                                                         
                                      1                        -1        -1
                                  Y =             (M y (x))         dx        ,
                                      M       T


where   0 is the elasticity of substitution between tasks. Tasks are performed by unskilled
labor, (x), skilled labor h(x), or capital k (x):

                          y (x) = L (x) (x) + H (x)h(x) + K (x)k (x),

where j (x)  Aj  j (x) for j  {L, H, K } denotes the productivity of factor j at task x.
        We assume k (x) is produced using q (x) units of the final good, while skilled and
unskilled labor is supplied inelastically, with market-clearing conditions L = T (x)dx
and H = T h(x)dx. We denote by TL , TH and TK the set of tasks performed by each
factor. A competitive equilibrium is represented by an allocation of tasks to factors and
production of capital goods that maximizes net output Y - x q (x)k (x)dx. The Appendix
shows that net output is given by
                                                                                  -1
                                       1          -1       1             -1       
                                                         
                            N Y = L (AL L)             + H (AH H )                     ,

where the share parameters, L and H , are endogenously determined and represent the

     Our companion paper, Acemoglu and Restrepo (2020b), develops a multi-sector model with multiple
skill types and estimates the contribution of factor-augmenting technological changes and changes in the
task content of production to the evolution of US wage structure. It finds that the bulk of the changes are
due to the task content of production.

                                    1              -1
                                    M   Tj j (x)         dx
                         j =                                  for j  {L, H }.

                               1-   M   TK   q (x)    dx

Analogously to equation (1) in the canonical SBTC model, the effects of various technolo-
gies on the skill premium can be expressed as

                      wH    1     H   -1      AH  1     H
(1)            d ln      = - d ln   +    d ln    + d ln                                   ,
                      wL          L           AL        L                          AH H
                                                                                   AL L



where the last term--the main difference from (1)--is evaluated at the initial ratio of
                                        AH H
effective skilled to unskilled labor,   AL L ,   and captures the effect of changes in the allocation
                                                                                   ln(H L )
of tasks to factors on the skill premium. Moreover,  =                    1-     ln(AH H AL L)     is
the derived elasticity of substitution between skilled and unskilled labor. This elasticity
reflects two types of substitution: substitution between tasks, represented by  (with
more productive skilled labor, there is greater production of skill-intensive tasks); and
substitution at the extensive margin whereby some tasks are reallocated from unskilled
labor and capital to skilled labor. It is because of this second type of substitution that
  .
      In addition to factor-augmenting changes--the AL , AH and AK terms--that increase
the productivity of a factor in all tasks, this framework enables us to analyze the impact
of technologies that affect the productivity of a factor in some tasks. Particularly rele-
vant is automation --changes that enable capital to be used in tasks that were previously
performed by labor (or equivalently increase the productivity of capital in such tasks).
For example, robots can become more productive in welding, a task that was previously
performed by human welders. The effects of automation and other technological changes
impacting the allocation of tasks to factors work through the last term in (1).
      Formally, consider an increase in K (x) for a set of tasks currently not in TK . This type
of advance in automation technology will lead to an expansion in the set of tasks allocated
to capital, TK . Automation can displace skilled or unskilled labor. In the context of
industrial robotics technology, the evidence presented in Acemoglu and Restrepo (2020a)
suggests that most of the automated tasks used to be performed by less skilled workers,
and we start with this case. We also simplify the analysis by assuming that K (x) = 0 for
all x  TK and that if a task can be automated and produced by capital it will be produced
by capital in equilibrium (see the Appendix for primitive conditions that ensure this).

Proposition 1 Consider an improvement in automation technologies such that the pro-

                                                       -1
                                              wH   1 A L    dx
                                       d ln      =         1
                                                               .
                                              wL    TL L dx
                                                         -


Moreover, wH increases, while wL may increase or decrease.

       Several points are worth noting. First, the effect of automation technologies on the skill
premium is completely driven by the set of tasks (weighted by their effective productivity)
that unskilled labor loses relative to the entire set of tasks previously performed by these
workers (and is not mediated by the elasticity of substitution, and  does not need to be
greater than one). This close connection between the set of tasks reallocated and factor
price changes is the main conceptual insight of this class of models. Second, advances in
automation technologies increase TFP, but these effects, coming from cost savings due to
automation, may be small (see the Appendix). Third, the magnitude of the change in
the skill premium is decoupled from productivity increases.2 Fourth, the unskilled wage
may decline, and this happens precisely when the increase in TFP is small (Acemoglu
and Restrepo, 2018), but the skilled wage always increases because tasks produced by
other factors, which are q-complements to those produced by skill workers, are becoming
cheaper.3
       This framework also allows us to study the implications of new labor-intensive tasks.
The role of new tasks was emphasized in Acemoglu and Restrepo (2018, 2019) in both
maintaining a stable labor share in GDP in the face of steady automation and as a source
of productivity growth. For example, design tasks, most manufacturing engineering tasks,
most back-office activities and all programming occupations are new relative to the first
half of the 20th century and have been major drivers of the growth of labor demand.

Proposition 2 Suppose a small set of new tasks (expanding M ) is introduced. If skilled
workers have comparative advantage in these tasks--that is, wH H (x) < wL L (x) at
   2
       Specifically, in the canonical SBTC model, we have      d ln T F P
                                                            d ln(wH wH ) A
                                                                              = sH   ( - 1), where sH is the
                                                                          L
share of skilled labor in value added. Thus, to get the demand for skilled labor to increase by 1%, one needs
a 0.83% increase in productivity. Instead, in our model, in response to automation, d d     ln T F P
                                                                                          ln wH wL
                                                                                                     =   sL   ,
where  > 0 is the average proportional cost reduction in automated tasks. This expression shows that,
when   0, our model generates large swings in the skill premium from very small changes in TFP.
Because of this difference, our framework generates sizable changes in the skill premium for reasonable
changes in TFP. For example, if automation reduces the cost of producing a task by  = 30%, as in the
case of industrial robots, then the increase in the college premium between 1963 and 1987 can be explained
with as little as 0.54% per annum growth in TFP.
   3
     Some of the automated tasks in A may be previously performed by skilled workers: AI may replace
tasks currently employing skilled workers, and many of the iconic innovations of the Industrial Revolution
automated spinning, weaving and knitting tasks previously performed by skilled artisans. If so, automation
may have the opposite effect on the skill premium.




                                                      5
current wages--then the skill premium increases by

                                                     -1
                                            wH   1 N H    dx
                                     d ln      =         1
                                                             .
                                            wL    TH H dx
                                                       -


If, on the other hand, unskilled workers have comparative advantage in these tasks--that
is, wL L (x) < wH H (x) at current wages--then the skill premium will decline by

                                            wH   1   -1 dx
                                    d ln       =- N L-1 dx
                                                           .
                                            wL    TL L

    The interpretation of this proposition is similar to that of Proposition 1. In particular,
the effect on the skill premium is again a function of the set of tasks reallocated across
factors. Analogously, these changes always increase TFP, but small changes in TFP can
go hand-in-hand with sizable changes in the skill premium. Also notable is that new tasks
may increase or reduce the skill premium, depending on whether they are allocated to
skilled or unskilled labor.4
    Two other types of technological changes can be studied in this framework. The first
is "standardization," which involves the simplification of previously complex and skilled
tasks so that they can now be more cheaply performed by unskilled workers. The second
is "skill upgrading," which involves the transformation of unskilled tasks so that they can
be more productively performed by skilled workers. We derive the implications of these
two types of technological changes in the Appendix.


2     Empirical Evidence from US industries
We next suppose that the model outlined in the previous section describes production at
the industry level and then use industry-level data from the US to investigate whether
automation and new tasks are associated with changes in the relative demand for skills.
We follow Acemoglu and Restrepo (2019), who show how changes in the task content of
production across industries can be estimated. We use data from the BEA, BLS, and
NIPA on factor shares, factor prices, and capital stocks for 1947­1987 and 1987­2016 at
3-digit industry level, and exclude industries heavily dependent on commodity prices, in
particular, oil and gas, mining, and agriculture, which exhibit large temporary fluctuations
in factor shares. This leaves us with 44 industries. We combine these with data on wage
bill and hours of work by college and high school workers from the US Censuses and the
ACS.5
   4
     This is in contrast to the extension considered in Acemoglu and Restrepo (2018), where we assumed
that new tasks were always performed by skilled workers.
   5
     We follow Acemoglu and Autor (2011) and define college workers as those with a college degree and
half of those with some college. High school workers are therefore those with a high school degree or less



                                                    6
      We follow Acemoglu and Restrepo (2019) in constructing estimates of displacement
and reinstatement effects (corresponding to automation and the creation of new tasks)
at the industry level for our two subperiods. Displacement [resp., reinstatement] effects
correspond to declines [resp., increases] in the labor share of value added in an industry not
explained by changes in factor prices over a five-year period. In the Appendix, we provide
details on data sources and the construction of these variables, and present descriptive
statistics. Both measures are expressed in percent changes, so that a 0.1 displacement
corresponds to a 10% decline in the labor share.




Figure 1: Change in relative demand for skills 1947­1987 and 1987­2016 versus displace-
ment and reinstatement. Relative demand for skills measured as the log of the college
wage bill relative to the high school wage bill. See the Appendix for details and derivation
of the estimates for displacement and reinstatement.

      Using these measures, we estimate the following model separately for the two periods:

(2)              Skill Demandi =d  displacementi + r  reinstatementi + i ,

where Skill Demandi --our measure of industry-level increase in the relative demand for
skills--is the change in the log of the college wage bill relative to the high school wage bill
in each industry during the relevant period. All regressions are weighted by the average
share of the wage bill accounted by the industry during the period. These regression
results are presented in the Appendix. Here we depict them visually.
and half of those with some college.


                                              7
        Figure 1 shows a strong association between industry-level demand for skills and our
measures of displacement (due to automation) and reinstatement (due to new tasks). Dur-
ing both subperiods, displacement is associated with increases in the relative demand for
skills of the industry, though displacement changes are larger and the relationship becomes
steeper in 1987­2016, shown in Panel b. A 10% increase in displacement during 1987­2016
is associated with a 8% increase in the relative demand for college workers (s.e.=0.015).
This estimate implies that displacement alone explains about 30% of the variation in
the demand for skills across industries during this period.6 Panels c and d depict the
relationship between reinstatement and the demand for skills. Greater reinstatement is
associated with lower relative demand for skills during 1947­1987, presumably because
unskilled labor had a comparative advantage in many of the new tasks introduced during
this period. In contrast, reinstatement goes hand-in-hand with greater demand for skills
in 1987­2016, which we interpret as new tasks being allocated to skilled workers during the
last three decades. Our estimates suggest that during this latter period, a 10% increase in
reinstatement is associated with a 7% increase in the relative demand for college workers
(s.e.=0.035).7


3        Conclusion
Automation and new tasks can have sizable effects on the demand for skills and factor
prices (including declines in the wages for some or all types of labor), while leading only
to small changes in TFP. These effects are not mediated by the elasticity of substitution
between factors and instead operate via the changes in the allocation of factors to tasks
(the task content of production). This contrasts with factor-augmenting technological
changes, which are assumed to raise the productivity of factors in all tasks and therefore
always cause large TFP increases.
        We have argued that the canonical SBTC model can be significantly enriched by
incorporating this task-level perspective and technologies that change the allocation of
tasks to factors. We also document that proxies for automation and the introduction of
new tasks are robustly associated with changes in the relative demand for skills at the
industry level. This perspective further suggests that a primary reason for the increase
in the skill premium (and the decline in the real wages of less skilled workers) has been
rapid automation that has replaced tasks previously performed by less skilled workers.
    6
     The 0.55% increase in displacement per annum at the aggregate level during this period could account
for as much as a 0.44% increase in the demand for college skills (out of an estimated shift in the relative
demand of 2.4% per annum--see Acemoglu and Autor, 2011). Assuming that  = 30%, this substantial
increase in the relative demand for college skills is consistent with automation technologies increasing TFP
by as little as 0.11% per annum between 1987 and 2016.
   7
     The Appendix provides several robustness checks, using different measures of the demand for skills
and different constructions of the displacement and reinstatement effects, and also present estimates from
several regression models. These results confirm the patterns summarized in the text.

Appendix A. Model, Additional Results, and Proofs

This section of the Appendix provides the derivation of equation (1) and the proofs of
generalized versions of Propositions 1 and 2. We also present additional results on the
effects of standardization and skill upgrading on wages, inequality and productivity.


Characterization of Equilibrium

We first provide a full characterization of the equilibrium for the model presented in the
main text.
   To simplify the notation and without loss of any generality, we assume that when indif-
ferent between producing with labor or capital, firms produce with capital. Furthermore,
when indifferent between producing with skilled and unskilled labor, firms produce with
skilled labor. Cost minimization then implies that

                                   wL     wH    wL    q (x)
                       TL = x           <     ,     <
                                   L (x) H (x) L (x) K (x)
                                   wH    wL     wH    q (x)
                       TH = x                 ,     <       ,
                                   H (x) L (x) H (x) K (x)
                                   q (x)  wL    q (x)  wH
                       TK = x                 ,            .
                                   K (x) L (x) K (x) H (x)

It also follows that the price of task x is given by

                                             wL
                                            L (x)       if x  TL
                                            wH
                                p(x) =      H (x)       if x  TH
                                            q (x)

   Because the price of the final good is normalized to 1, we have that task prices satisfy
the price-index condition

which can be written in terms of factor prices and the cost of producing capital as follows:

   The demand for task x is given by y (x) =       M    Y  p(x)- . Thus, the demand for unskilled

   Let K = x q (x)k (x) denote the total amount of capital used in the economy. The

   Market clearing implies that Ld = L, H d = H and K d = K . Using the expressions for
factor demands above, we can express equilibrium wages as
                                                1                                 1

Substituting these expressions into (A.1) and solving for Y we obtain

Combining this expression with the market cleaning condition for capital, we can write

Derivation of Equation (1)

A proportional increase in AH H and AL L does not alter the allocation of tasks to factors,
and hence has no impact on H L . We can therefore write this ratio as a function of
AH H AL L and other technologies, such as automation and new tasks:

                                            H   AH H
                                       ln     =      , ,
                                            L   AL L

where  is a vector denoting the state of technology. We can then decompose changes in
     H
ln   L   as

                       H      ln(H L )          AH H        H

Additional Results and Proofs

This section of the Appendix provides general statements and proofs for the propositions
in the main text. We first present a lemma that provides sufficient conditions for all tasks
that can be produced by capital to be produced by capital in equilibrium. We then state
and prove an additional lemma that will be used for computing the productivity gains
from different types of technology. Finally, we present five propositions characterizing the
effects of different types of technologies on wages, skill premium and productivity. The first
three of those are generalizations of Propositions 1 and 2 in the text. The next two study
the implications of skill upgrading (technologies that allow skilled workers to perform more
efficiently/cheaply some of the tasks that were previously allocated to unskilled labor) and
standardization (technologies that simplify tasks and increase the relative productivity of
unskilled labor in tasks reviously performed by skilled workers).

Lemma A.1 Suppose that K (x) is bounded away from zero in the set of tasks for which
K (x) > 0 and that L (x) and H (x) are bounded above. Then there exists a threshold q
such that, if q (x) < q for all tasks, all tasks for which K (x) > 0 are produced by capital.

Proof. Consider an allocation in which

                                     wL     wH
                           TL = x         <      , k (x) = 0
                                     L (x) H (x)
                                     wH    wL
                          TH = x                 , K (x) = 0 ,
                                     H (x) L (x)
                          TK = {x  K (x) > 0} .

We prove that there exists a q such that, if q (x) < q for all tasks, this is the equilibrium

allocation. This is equivalent to showing that

           wj = L AL                      >       q (x)        for j  {L, H } and x  Tk .
                               L              AK         K (x)

A sufficient condition for this inequality to hold is that
                                                    1
                                1    -1       NY            Aj   j
                                     
(A.3)                   wj =  L AL                      >      q   for j  {L, H },
                                               L            AK   K

where  j is an upper bound for j (x) and  K is a lower bound for K (x) in TK .
   As q declines, the left-hand side of this equation (weakly) increases. To see this, note
that we can rewrite the left-hand side as
                                               1

                                                                                                       -1 AL

which increases as q (x) falls.
   Instead, as q declines towards zero, the right-hand side of equation (A.3) converges to
zero. Thus, there exists q > 0 such that the sufficient condition in equation (A.3) holds,
as claimed. 
   We now provide an additional lemma that we use repeatedly in the proof of the main
propositions.

Lemma A.2 Consider any improvement in technology increasing TFP by d ln T F P > 0.
Then

                                d ln T F P = sL  d ln wL + sH  d ln wH .

Proof. Because of constant returns to scale and the fact that we have competitive
markets,
                                          Y = wL  L + wH  H + K.

Following an improvement in technology, both sides of this equation change by

                 ln Y
                      d ln K + d ln T F P = sL  d ln wL + sH  d ln wH + sK d ln K,
                 ln K

where d ln T F P = d ln Y     L,H,K   denotes the expansion in output holding inputs constant.
                                                                                              ln Y
The lemma follows from the fact that in a competitive equilibrium                             ln K    = sK . 
   We now turn to general statements of Propositions 1 and 2 and their proofs.

Proposition A.1 Suppose that q (x) < q , with q as defined in Lemma A.1. Consider an
improvement in automation technologies such that the productivity of capital in a small
set of tasks in A  TL increases to K (x) > 0. Then:

   · wH increases while the effect on wL is ambiguous.

Proof. Define the function

                                                                     H (x)-1 dx
                 ~ (wH wL ; ) =    wH H (x)wL L (x),K (x)=0
                                                                                       .
                                                                     L (x)-1 dx
                                   wH H (x)>wL L (x),K (x)=0


Because q (x) < q , we have that in equilibrium ~ (wH wL ; ) = (AH H AL L; ). Thus, the
skill premium satisfies the implicit equation
                                                           -1             1
                                                                         -

                         wL                AL                    L

   The definition of the derived elasticity of substitution implies that a change in ln H L
reduces the skill premium by
                                      ln wH wL   1
                                               =- .
                                      ln H L     
Using equation (A.6), we can expand this expression as

                        ln wH wL 1    ln ~   ln wH wL 1
                                =                    - ,
                        ln H L      ln wH wL  ln H L  

and consequently,
                                                         1
                                ln wH wL                
                                         =-                   ~
                                                                     .
                                ln H L      1-        1    ln 
                                                        ln wH wL


                                                A-6
   Therefore, the function ~ satisfies the equation

                                                 1
                                      1

                                                ln wH wL


   To obtain the effect of automation on the skill premium, we can take a log differential
of (A.6):
                           wH   1   ln ~           wH       -1

where the last step follows by substituting  from (A.7).
   To derive the expression for the change in TFP, we start by differentiating equation

                                                                                   wL        
                                                                                              dx.
 0 = sL  (1 - )  d ln wL + sH  (1 - )  d ln wH +                               -             
                                                      M    A  K (x)                L (x)     
                                                                                             

Note that, because the cost of producing a task with different factors is equated at marginal
tasks, additional changes in the allocation of tasks to factors are second order and do not
contribute to this expression. Hence, we can rewrite this equation as

                                                      wL    1-          q (x) 1-

                sL  d ln wL + sH  d ln wH =                                        dx.

Lemma A.2 then implies that the left-hand side of the above equation equals d ln T F PA ,
as claimed. Furthermore, because q (x) < q , we have that wL L (x) > q (x) K (x) for
tasks in A, and therefore the right-hand side of the above equation is positive, as stated
in the proposition.
   The expression for the decline in the labor share follows from differentiating equation
(A.2).
   Finally, wH increases because the skill premium increases and Lemma A.2 implies that
sL  d ln wL + sH  d ln wH = d ln T F PA > 0. That the effect on wL is ambiguous follows from
the fact that                                               1

                                   wL = L  AL                   .
                                                       L
On the one hand, an improvement in automation reduces L (in particular, equation (A.1)



                                              A-7
implies A -1    -1                 ~
         L L + AH H = 1, and H L =  increases with automation, which implies
that L must decrease and H must increase). On the other hand, N Y increases by
d ln T F PA (1 - sK ). Consequently, automation reduces unskilled wages when it gener-
ates small productivity gains, but increases unskilled wages when productivity gains from
automation are large. 

Proposition A.2 Suppose that q (x) < q , with q as defined in Lemma A.1. Consider the
introduction of a small set of tasks N that expand M such that: i. wH H (x) < wL L (x),
ii. wH H (x) < 1, and iii. K (x) = 0 for all tasks in N . These new tasks will be produced
by skilled labor, and:

Proof. By assumption, the most cost effective way of producing the new tasks is with
skilled labor. Thus, new tasks expand the set TH and the mass of tasks M increases to
M+ N.
   To obtain the effect of new tasks on the skill premium, we can take a log differential
of (A.6):
                           wH   1   ln ~        wH       -1
                                                     1 N H   dx

where the last step follows from (A.7).
   To derive the expression for the change in TFP, we start by taking a differential of

equation (A.1):

We can rewrite this equation as

                                                                     wH    1-

Lemma A.2 then implies that the left-hand side of the above equation equals d ln T F PN .
Moreover, the assumptions made in the proposition ensure that wH H (x) < 1 for tasks
in N , and therefore the right-hand side of the above equation is positive, as stated in the
proposition.
   The expression for the increase in the labor share follows from differentiating equation
(A.2).

introduction of a small set of tasks N that expand M such that: i. wL L (x) < wH H (x),

We can rewrite this equation as

               sL  d ln wL + sH  d ln wH =                                           dx.

                                                   A-10
Lemma A.2 then implies that the left-hand side of this equation equals d ln T F PU . Also,
note that because wH H (x) < wL L (x) for all tasks in U , we have that the right-hand
side of the same equation is positive, as stated in the proposition.
   The fact that the labor share remains unchanged follows from equation (A.2).
   Finally, wH increases because the skill premium increases and Lemma A.2 implies that
sL  d ln wL + sH  d ln wH = d ln T F PU > 0. The effect on wL is ambiguous because
                                                         1

                                                     L

and skill upgrading reduces L , while N Y increases by d ln T F PU (1 - sK ). Consequently,
skill upgrading reduces unskilled wages when the productivity gains from this technology
are small, but increases unskilled wages when the productivity gains are large. 
   One interesting implication of this proposition is that skill upgrading, though it in-
creases inequality between skilled and unskilled labor, leaves the labor share unchanged.
This highlights that recent developments in the US labor market, involving both greater
inequality between skilled and unskilled labor and lower labor share (at least in manu-
facturing, see Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2019), cannot just be explained by skill upgrading
and likely entail some reallocation of tasks previously performed by workers to capital.
   Finally, we turn to the implications of standardization.

Proof. To obtain the effect of automation on the skill premium, we can take a log

where the last step follows from (A.7).
       To derive the expression for the change in TFP, let us differentiate equation (A.1):

                                                                           1-               1-

                                                                                    wH        
                                                                                               dx.
 0 = sL  (1 - )  d ln wL + sH  (1 - )  d ln wH +                                -

We can rewrite this equation as

                                                      wH    1-           wL    1-

                 sL  d ln wL + sH  d ln wH =                                        dx.

Lemma A.2 then implies that the left-hand side of the above equation equals d ln T F PS .
Also, note that because wL L (x) < wH H (x) for all tasks in S , the right-hand side of
the above equation is positive, as stated in the proposition.
       That the labor share remains unchanged follows from equation (A.2).
       Finally, wL increases because the skill premium decreases and Lemma A.2 implies that
sL  d ln wL + sH  d ln wH = d ln T F PS . The fact that the effect on wH is ambiguous follows
from the same argument as before: we have
                                                            1

                                                       L

and following a standardization of tasks, H decreases and N Y increases by d ln T F PS (1 -
sK ).

This section provides the details for productivity calculations provided in the introduc-
tion and in footnote 2. Throughout, we approximate changes over time using first-order
expansions.

Productivity Implications of Skill-Biased Technological Change in the Canon-
ical Model

We provide two complementary exercises to illustrate the implications for productivity of
the canonical SBTC model. First, we use the estimates for the growth rate in AH AL from
Katz and Murphy (1992) and Acemoglu and Autor (2011) and compute the productivity
gains that would result from such changes. We then estimate the growth in AH that one
would need to explain the observed shift in the relative demand for college workers, and
also compute how real wages would respond to such changes.
   Regarding the fist exercise, the resulting productivity gains from improvements in
factor-augmenting technologies are approximately

                         ln T F PSBT C = sH  ln AH + sL  ln AL .

If there is no technological regress, then  ln AL  0, and thus

(A.8)                        ln T F PSBT C  sH  ln AH AL .

   Katz and Murphy (1992) estimate  = 1.41 and a yearly growth rate for ln AH AL
of 11.34% during the 1963­1987 period. In addition, sH = 17% at the beginning of their
sample (skilled workers accounted for 25% of wages, and the labor share was roughly of
2/3, which gives sH = 25%  2 3 = 17%). Using equation (A.8), their estimates imply a
yearly increase in TFP of at least 1.9% per annum. If we use the average value of sH
between 1963 and 1987, we obtain an increase in TFP of at least 2.76% per annum.
   Acemoglu and Autor (2011) estimate  = 1.63 and a yearly growth rate for ln AH AL
of 7.22% during the 1963­1992 period and of 4.64% during the 1992­2008 period. In
addition, sH = 17% at the beginning of their sample, sH = 32% around 1992 and sH = 38%
around 2008. Using equation (A.8), their estimates imply an annual increase in TFP of
at least 1.2% per annum for 1963­1992 (1.76% if we use the midpoint of sH during this
period). Finally, their estimates imply a yearly increase in TFP of at least 1.48% per
annum for 1992­2008 (1.62% if we use the midpoint of sH during this period).
   The canonical SBTC model also has strong implications for real wages. In particular,
if there is no technological regress, an increase in AH AL changes wages by at least

                                            1
(A.9)                         ln wL  sH         ln AH AL .
                                            

Using the midpoint estimates for sH , this formula implies a growth rate for unskilled
wages of 1.95% for 1963­1987 using Katz and Murphy estimates for  and the growth
rate of AH AL . Likewise, this formula implies a growth rate for unskilled wages of 1.08%


                                          A-13
for 1963­1992 and 0.98% for 1992­2008 using Acemoglu and Autor estimates for  and
the growth rate of AH AL . In contrast, as noted in the text, real wages for man with no
college reached a maximum in 1970 and declined since then at a rate of 0.2% per annum;
whereas real wages for woman with no college rose by 0.2% per annum (see Acemoglu and
Autor, 2011).
   Table A.1 summarizes the estimates from the literature and our calculations for differ-
ent time periods. For comparison, Fernald's (2012) estimates of TFP are provided in the
last column of the table. In particular, these estimates imply a 1.2% per annum increase
in TFP for 1963­1987; 1.1% per annum for 1963­1992; and 1% per annum for 1992­2008,
which are much smaller than the lower bounds implied by the canonical SBTC model.

   Turning to the second exercise, note that the total shift in the relative demand for
college workers is given by
                                                     wH  1    H
                                            ln          +  ln   .
                                                     wL       L
Using the numbers from Acemoglu and Autor (2011), it follows that the relative demand
for college workers increased by 3.3% per annum from 1963 to 1992 (1.3% from wages and
2% from the 90% increase in the relative supply of skills during this period), and then by
2.4% per annum from 1992 to 2008.
   Equation (A.8) implies that, if shifts in the relative demand for college workers were
driven by factor augmenting technologies, then:

                                           ln T F PSBT C       
                                                         = sH     .
                                           ln wH wL            -1

The estimates from Katz and Murphy in Table A.1 then imply that, if the only source
of technological change were improvements in AH , a 1% increase in the relative demand
for college workers would be associated with an increase in TFP of 0.83% for 1963­1987
(using the midpoint estimate for sH ). Likewise, The estimates from Acemoglu and Autor
in Table A.1 imply that a 1% increase in the relative demand for college workers would be
associated with an increase in TFP of 0.63% for 1963­1992 and 0.9% for 1992­2008 (using
the midpoint estimate for sH ). Thus, the changes in AH required to explain the total

                                                           A-14
shift in the relative demand for college workers would generate productivity increases of
at least 2.08% per annum for 1963­1992 (= 0.63 × 3.3) and 2.16% per annum for 1992­2008
(= 0.9 × 2.4).
    Moreover, equation (A.9) implies that if all changes in inequality were driven by factor-
augmenting technologies, we would expect an increase in unskilled wages of at least 1.27%
per annum for 1963­1992 and of 1.32% per annum for 1992­2008.

Productivity Implications of Automation

To illustrate the differences between the task framework and the canonical SBTC model,
we now estimate the amount of automation that one would need to explain the observed
shift in the relative demand for college workers, and also compute how real wages respond
to such technological changes.
    Suppose instead that technological changes are driven by automation. Then, the in-
creases in TFP would be given by equation (A.5). Using a first-order Taylor expansion,
these productivity gains can be approximated as

                                             1-
                                     wL                  wL         q (x)
                 d ln T F PA                       ln          - ln         dx.
                                A    L (x)               L (x)      K (x)

This expression shows that the productivity gains from automating a task are given by its
initial share in value added (the term (wL L (x))1- ), and the percent reduction in the
unit cost of producing the task (the term ln (wL L (x)) - ln (q (x) K (x))). We can also
express the productivity gains from automation as

                                                                 1-
                                                         wL
(A.10)                          d ln T F PA                           dx,
                                                   A     L (x)

where  > 0 is the (weighted) average reduction in the cost of producing tasks due to
                    wL          1-
automation and A L   (x)    dx gives the share of automated tasks in value added.
   Using equations (A.4) and (A.10), it follows that if shifts in the relative demand for
college workers were driven by automation, then:

                                       ln T F PA
                                                 =   sL  .
                                       ln wH wL

This equation shows that automation technologies that bring modest reductions in costs
(in the extreme,   0) can generate sizable changes in inequality accompanied by modest
increases in TFP.
    In particular, suppose  = 30%, which is in line with estimates for industrial automation
surveyed in Acemoglu and Restrepo (2020a). Using a value for  of 1.63 and a midpoint
estimate for sL , we obtain that, if the only source of technological change were automation,

                                                  A-15
a 1% increase in the relative demand for college workers would be associated with an
increase in TFP of 0.21% for 1963­1992 and 0.14% for 1992­2008. Using a value for  of
1.41 (as in Katz and Murphy, 1992) and a midpoint estimate for sL , we obtain that a 1%
increase in the relative demand for college workers would be associated with an increase
in TFP of 0.18% for 1963­1987.
   Thus, the changes in automation technology required to explain the total shift in the
relative demand for skilled labor would generate productivity increases of as little as 0.54%
per annum for 1963­1987 (using Katz and Murphy's estimates of 0.18 × 3.3); 0.66% per
annum for 1963­1992 (= 0.21 × 3.3); and 0.34% per annum for 1992­2008 (= 0.14 × 2.4).
   Moreover, automation technologies would change unskilled wages by

                                             wH                       wH
             ln wL =  ln T F PA - sH  ln        = (  sL   - sH )   ln
                                             wL                       wL

Thus, if all changes in inequality were driven by automation, we would expect a reduction
of unskilled wages by 0.12% per annum for 1963­1992 and of 0.5% per annum for 1992­
2008 (which contrasts with the predicted increase in unskilled wages under just factor-
augmenting technologies as in the standard SBTC model).


Appendix C. Data Description and Additional Empirical Exercises

This part of the Appendix describes the data and provides additional empirical exercises.


Set of Industries Used in the Analysis

We use a set of 44 industries which we could track across different sources, including the
Census, the BEA industry accounts, and NIPA. The crosswalks used are part of the repli-
cation package for this paper (see http://economics.mit.edu/faculty/acemoglu/data). Our
sample excludes industries that are heavily dependent on commodity prices, in particular,
oil and gas, mining, agriculture, and petroleum derivatives.


Measures of Relative Demand for Skills

Using the US Census and the American Community Survey (ACS), we compiled data on
the college and high school wage bill and hours of work by industry for 1950, 1990, and
2016. We follow Acemoglu and Autor (2011) and define college workers as those with a
college degree and half of those with some college. We then define high school workers as
those with a high school degree or less and half of the workers with some college.
   For the 44 industries in our sample, we study two separate periods. First, for the
period from 1987­2016 we use the 1990 Census and 2016 ACS to construct measures of
changes in the relative demand for skills across industries during this period. Second, for


                                            A-16
the period from 1947­1987, we use the 1950 and 1990 Censuses to construct measures of
changes in the relative demand for skills across industries during this period.


Measures of Displacement and Reinstatement

The construction of these measures follows Acemoglu and Restrepo (2019). First, suppose
that the model in the main text describes the production process of an industry. The labor
share in that industry is given by

                                      wL    1-          wH   1-
                                   TL L (x)    dx + TH H (x)    dx
               s=                  1-                1-                              1-
                                                                                               .
                           wL                   w     H          q (x)
                     TL    L (x)        dx + TH    H (x)        dx + TK      K (x)        dx

We can hen decompose changes in the labor share in two components. On the one hand,
we have changes driven by factor prices and by technologies that do not change the allo-
cation of tasks between capital and labor (including improvements in factor-augmenting
technologies). On the other hand, we have the effect of technologies, like automation and
new tasks, which directly change the allocation of tasks between capital and labor. As
in Acemoglu and Restrepo (2019) we refer to these as changes in the task content of pro-
duction. Specifically, we decompose changes in the labor share of an industry as follows
(suppressing industry indices to simplify notation):

(A.11)              d ln s = dtask content + (1 - )  (1 - s)  (d ln w - d ln r + g ),

where d ln w = (sL (sL + sH ))  d ln wL + (sH (sL + sH ))  d ln wH denotes the change in
                                                                     q (x)   1-
                                                            1
the average wage paid in the industry, d ln r =     TK K (x)
                                                           sK       d ln q (x)dx denotes the
change in the average rental rate of capital used in the industry, and

                                         1-                                    1-
               1               wL                                    wH                             
         g=                                   d ln L (x)dx +                         d ln H (x)dx
            sL + sH       TL   L (x)                            TH   H (x)                          
                                    1-
                1         q (x)
           -                             d ln K (x)dx
               sK    TK   K (x)

denotes the increase in the productivity of labor relative to capital in the tasks that are
currently allocated to labor. Note that g also incorporates the effect of changes in AL , AH
and AK through the  terms. Because q (x) < q , these improvements in factor-augmenting
technologies do not alter the allocation of tasks between capital and labor, and for the
same reason , coincides with the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor.
   Building on equation (A.11), for each of the 44 industries in our sample, we compute




                                                   A-17
its yearly changes in the task content of production as

         task contentit =  ln sit - (1 - K )  (1 - sit )  ( ln wit -  ln rit - git ) .

We measure sit using the industry payroll share, which we obtained from the BEA industry
accounts (in some of our robustness checks, we also used a measure from the BEA and
BLS KLEMS that adjusts the payroll share for self-employment). In addition, K denotes
the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor, which we set to 0.8 following
Oberfield and Raval (2014). We obtained the industry-specific wage and capital rental
rate indices, wit and rit , from the BLS KLEMS accounts for 1987­2016. For the earlier
period, we constructed these indices using data on the quantity of labor and capital used in
each industry from NIPA. Finally, we follow Acemoglu and Restrepo (2019) and set git --
improvements in labor productivity relative to capital productivity--to 2% per annum for
1947­1987 and 1.46% per annum for 1987­2016.
   Increases in the (labor) task content of an industry are indicative of the reinstatement
effect generated by new tasks, whereas reductions in the (labor) task content are indicative
of the displacement effect brought by automation. To separate these two effects, we assume
that over a five-year period, each industry either introduces new automation technologies
or new tasks but not both. This assumption implies that we can compute the extent of
displacement and reinstatement in a given year and industry as

                                                  1 t+2
                      displacementit = max 0, -           task contenti
                                                  5  =t-2
                                               1 t+2
                   reinstatementit = max 0,            task contenti .
                                               5  =t-2

(If there are simultaneously new automation technologies and new tasks within five-year
periods in our data, then our estimates will be lower bounds on the extent of displacement
and reinstatement).
   Finally, in our regressions we use the cumulative extent of displacement and reinstate-
ment during our period of analysis. These measures are given in percent changes over the
entire period, so that a 0.1 displacement corresponds to a 10% decline in the labor share
that is unexplained by changes in factor prices.
   Figure A.1 shows the total displacement and reinstatement in each industry for 1947­
1987 and 1987­2016. For 1947­1987, the average reinstatement across industries was
19.6% (0.49% per annum) and the average displacement was 17% (0.425% per annum).
For 1987­2016, the average reinstatement was 10% (0.345% per annum) and the average
displacement was 16% (0.55% per annum).

Regression Results

Tables A.2, A.3 and A.4 present various estimates of equation (2).
   Table A.2 presents our main estimates. Panels A­C provide estimates for 1947­1987
and Panels D­F provide estimates for 1987­2016. In Panels A and D we use the wage bill
of college workers relative to high school workers as our measure for the demand for skills
in an industry. In Panels B and E we use the hours worked by college workers relative to
high school workers as our measure for the demand for skills in an industry. In Panels C
and F we use the number of college workers relative to high school workers as our measure
for the demand for skills in an industry. Columns 1­3 present estimates of (2) for all
workers, and columns 4­7 present estimates separately for men, women, and workers in
different age groups.
   Tables A.3 and A.4 provide estimates using alternative measures of changes in the
task content of industries and the resulting measures of displacement and reinstatement.
For this exercise, we use relative wage bill (columns 1­3) and relative hours (columns
4­6) as our measures of skill demand. Table A.3 focuses on the 1947­1987 period. Panel
A provides results obtained by setting K = 1 in our computation of the displacement
and reinstatement effects. Panel B reverts to K = 0.8 but we now use a 10-year moving
average, rather than a 5-year moving average in our calculation of the displacement and
reinstatement effects. Finally, in Panel C we implement both changes simultaneously.
   Table A.4 focuses on the 1987­2016 period. Panel A provides results obtained by
setting K = 1 in our computation of the displacement and reinstatement effects. Panel
B reverts to KL = 0.8 but we now use a 10-year moving average, rather than a five-year



                                           A-19
moving average, in our calculation of the displacement and reinstatement effects. In Panel
C we implement both changes simultaneously. In Panel D­F we repeat these exercises but
now we use data from the BEA KLEMS accounts for 1987­2016. These data provide the
labor share for each industry inclusive of self employment.
   Overall, the results in Tables A.2, A.3 and A.4 confirm our summary in the text.
Automation is associated with significant increases in the relative demand for skills in both
periods, regardless of the specification or measure we use (and for different subgroups such
as men, women and younger workers). Reinstatement between 1947 and 1987 is associated
with lower relative demand for skills, whereas between 1987 and 2016, it is associated with
higher relative demand for skills. This pattern is robust as well. One additional finding
is worth noting: even between 1947 and 1987, reinstatement does not appear to increase
the demand for unskilled men by much, likely reflecting the fact that less skilled women
may have been the ones with comparative advantage in new tasks introduced during this
period.

Notes: the table provides regression estimates of changes in the relative demand for skills across industries
on measures of displacement and reinstatement. The Appendix provides a description of the construction of
these explanatory variables. Panels A­C provide estimates for 1947­1987. Panels D­F provide estimates
for 1987­2016. Each panel uses a different measure of changes in the relative demand for skills across
industries. Panels A and D use the change in the log of the college wage bill relative to the high school
wage bill in each industry as outcome. Panels B and E use the change in the log of college hours relative
to high school hours in each industry as outcome. Panels C and F use the change in the log of the number
of college employees relative to high school employees in each industry as outcome. In columns 1­3, the
measures of changes in relative demand for skills are computed for all employed in an industry; in column
4 only for men; in column 5 only for women; in column 6 for employees aged 25­34 years; and in column
7 for employees aged 35­64 years. Standard errors robust against heteroskedasticity are in parentheses.

Notes: the table provides regression estimates of changes from 1987 to 2016 in the relative demand for skills
across industries on measures of displacement and reinstatement. The Appendix provides a description
of the construction of these explanatory variables. Columns 1­3 use the change in the log of the college
wage bill relative to the high school wage bill in each industry as outcome. Columns 4­6 use the change
in the log of college hours relative to high school hours in each industry as outcome. Each panel presents
results for a different construction of the displacement and reinstatement measures, as explained in the
Appendix. Standard errors robust against heteroskedasticity are in parentheses.
