Retirement Plan Type and Employee Mobility: The Role of Selection and Incentive Effects

                                                      ABSTRACT

Employer-provided pension plans may affect employee mobility both through an “incentive effect,”
where the bundle of benefit characteristics such as vesting rules, pension wealth accrual, risk, and
liquidity affect turnover directly, and a “selection effect,” where employees with different underlying
mobility tendencies select across plans or across firms with different types of plans. In this paper, we
quantify the role of selection by exploiting a natural experiment at a single employer in which an employee’s
probability of transitioning from a defined benefit (DB) to a defined contribution (DC) pension plan
was exogenously affected by default rules. Using regression discontinuity as well as differences-in-regression-discontinuities
(DRD) methods, we find evidence that employees with higher mobility tendencies self-select into
the DC plan. Our results suggest that selection likely contributes to the observed positive relationship
between the transition from DB to DC plans and employee mobility in settings where employees sort
into plans or employers. Counter to conventional wisdom, we find a negative direct effect of the DC
plan on turnover relative to the DB plan, which underscores the multi-dimensional difference between
these plans.

1    Introduction
Among private sector employees in the U.S. with an employer-provided pension plan, the
fraction covered solely by a defined contribution (DC) plan more than tripled between 1980
and 2003, while those covered solely by a defined benefit (DB) plan declined by over eighty
percent (Buessing and Soto, 2006). At the same time, there has been evidence of increased
employee mobility (Munnell, Haverstick and Sanzenbacher, 2006; Farber, 2007). Because DB
and DC plans typically diﬀer in how employee tenure relates to pension wealth, it is com-
monly thought that the increase in DC plans led to this increase in mobility. Understanding
the causal link between mobility and pension plan type is an important labor market issue
given the large number of firms and employees aﬀected by the transition.
   On the one hand, DC plans may indeed cause greater mobility relative to DB plans given
that the benefit structure of DB plans often rewards employees who spend their entire career
with a single employer through longer vesting requirements and back-loaded pension wealth
accrual. These plan features act to reduce portability (Mitchell, 1982; Lazear, 1990), while
the wealth accrual in DC plans is generally age-neutral. On the other hand, DB plans and
DC plans diﬀer in multiple dimensions, such as control of financial decision-making, access to
liquidity, and the transparency of wealth accrual. If employees find these features desirable,
DC plans may actually increase retention. In fact, studies have found that, similar to DB
plans, workers in DC plans have lower mobility relative to uncovered workers (Gustman and
Steinmeier, 1993; Andrietti and Hilderband, 2004). While uncovered workers are not the
relevant comparison when evaluating the eﬀect of plan type on mobility, this finding does
question conventional wisdom that only DB-plan features reduce mobility.
    In addition to diﬀerences in plan features, the selection of workers across plans may drive
part of any observed relationship between mobility patterns and pension plan type. Under-
standing the causal eﬀect of pension plan type on turnover requires estimating the direct
eﬀect of plan features on employee turnover, which we refer to as an incentive eﬀect, separate
from the selection eﬀect, defined as diﬀerences in turnover that stem from the underlying
relationship between mobility tendencies and preferences for plan characteristics. However,
disentangling the incentive eﬀect from the selection eﬀect has typically been challenging be-
cause it requires comparing mobility across workers who are enrolled in diﬀerent plans but
are otherwise similar.
    This paper identifies the role of selection in the relationship between employee mobility
and pension plan type by exploiting a natural experiment at a single employer in which
existing employees faced a one-time, irrevocable option to transition from a DB plan to
a DC plan. We exploit exogenous variation in the probability of switching to the DC plan


                                              1
caused by the default rule that governed the plan transition. In particular, existing employees
who were under age 45 at the time of the transition were assigned the DC plan as the default
plan, while employees age 45 or older were assigned the DB plan as a default. Defaults have
been shown to have dramatic eﬀects on DC enrollment (Madrian and Shea, 2001), and this
result holds across a variety of private employment contexts (Choi et al., 2004) as well as in
public sector pension plans (Cronqvist and Thaler, 2004).
    The features of the default rule in our context allow us to use a fuzzy regression discon-
tinuity (RD) approach to estimate the exogenous eﬀect of changing to the DC plan from
the DB plan on employee mobility. To improve the precision of our estimates, we combine
our data in the year of the policy change with data from previous years in a fashion similar
to a diﬀerences-in-diﬀerences (DD) framework. We hereafter refer to this approach as a
diﬀerences-in-regression-discontinuities (DRD) estimator. We quantify the role of selection
by comparing the DRD eﬀect to OLS estimates, which are confounded by employee selection.
We find evidence that employees with higher mobility tendencies select into the DC plan in
that the DRD estimates of the eﬀect of the DC plan on turnover are significantly less than
the OLS estimates.
   This paper contributes to the literature by providing a new source of identification with
which to quantify the role of selection into pension plans based on mobility. Prior studies have
generally addressed this selection by using selection-correction models or cross-sectional data
that includes heterogeneous firms and plans (Allen, Clark and McDermed, 1993; Gustman
and Steinmeier, 1993; Rabe, 2007). Other studies have used plausibly exogenous variation
from tax reforms (Andrietti and Hilderband, 2004) or plan oﬀerings (Disney and Emmerson,
2004; Manchester, 2010) to identify the consequences of pension plan type for mobility.
The regression discontinuity approach we use relies on credible and testable assumptions,
namely that unobservable determinants of mobility rates for aﬀected employees relative to
non-aﬀected (but otherwise similar) employees did not change discontinuously at the age
governing the default plan. Our identification assumption passes falsification tests which
show no evidence of a discontinuous change in mobility at alternative age thresholds or in
years prior to the policy change. In addition, we do not detect a discontinuous change in
other, predetermined observables at the age threshold.
    We contribute to the literature in two additional ways. First, we develop a conceptual
framework for evaluating the eﬀect of introducing a new benefit on mobility that allows for
heterogeneity in preferences over the benefit, costs of switching, and mobility costs. We
show that the resulting relationship between benefit enrollment and mobility depends on the
joint distribution of this multi-dimensional heterogeneity as well as the choice environment
in which the new benefit is oﬀered. In particular, whether employees have the opportunity


                                               2
to self-select into the new benefit as compared to being forced to enroll has diﬀerent im-
plications for mobility over and above the inter-relationship between the diﬀerent sources
of heterogeneity. We use both of these insights to generate testable predictions for our
estimated parameters and to provide a richer interpretation of our empirical evidence.
  This framework sheds new light on previous findings of pension plans and employee
mobility. In particular, previous evidence has shown that both DB and DC plans may
reduce employee mobility (e.g. Gustman and Steinmeier, 1993; Ippolito, 2002). It has been
hypothesized that this result is due to compensation premiums for employees with a pension
plan relative to those without (Gustman and Steinmeier, 1993), and the possibility that the
retention eﬀect is driven by preferential treatment of savers by employers (Ippolito, 2002).
Our framework implies that the overall eﬀect of plan type on mobility depends on the sign
and magnitude of the incentive and selection eﬀects.
   Applying this framework to our setting, we find that the selection eﬀect tends to induce a
positive relationship between mobility and DC plan enrollment, although this is oﬀset in our
context by a negative incentive eﬀect of DC plans. Therefore, our results are consistent with
the possibility that the bundle of DC plan features, including increased control, transparent
wealth accrual, and loan and withdrawal provisions, are desirable relative to those of the DB
plan (as measured by higher retention), in line with previous work that finds a low perceived
benefit of additional DB benefits (Fitzpatrick, 2011; Brown et al., 2011). Of course, our
results are in part specific to our context and the specific features of the DB and DC plan
under consideration.1
    Our second, additional contribution is that we are able to evaluate both the short-term
and longer-term eﬀects of DC plans on mobility as our data extends to three years beyond
the DC plan introduction. With the exception of Allen, Clark and McDermed (1993), most
studies evaluating the relationship between pension plan and mobility use a one-year time
frame (Gustman and Steinmeier, 1993; Andrietti and Hilderband, 2004; Disney and Emmer-
son, 2004; Rabe, 2007). We find that the DC plan had an immediate and relatively large
negative eﬀect on mobility rates for those exogenously moved to the plan over a one-year
time horizon. However, the eﬀect eventually deteriorates as additional years are included in
the analysis. These findings suggest that our estimates may represent a temporary change,
rather than a longer-run retention of employees. In other words, aﬀected employees appear
to delay their exit, but only for a limited period of time.
    The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the conceptual
   1
    In particular, the DB plan in our setting is not backloaded, as we discuss in Section 3. This means that
our estimate of the positive selection eﬀect may be understated, and our estimate of the negative incentive
eﬀect may be overstated, relative to standard, backloaded DB plans.

framework that motivates our empirical approach and examines what our results may reveal
about the relationship between mobility tendencies and pension plan preferences. Section
3 provides details regarding the natural experiment we exploit in our empirical application.
We outline our RD and DRD empirical strategies in Section 4 and present our results along
with robustness checks in Section 5. Section 6 explores the implications of our results and
concludes.


2    Model of New Benefit Enrollment and Mobility
We construct a conceptual framework for interpreting observational and quasi-experimental
estimates of the relationship between mobility patterns and employee benefit enrollment in
the presence of unobservable heterogeneity. To do this, we first propose a basic framework
that governs individual decisions regarding enrollment in the newly-oﬀered benefit and sub-
sequent turnover. Second, we evaluate this framework in two distinct choice scenarios for
benefit enrollment. Finally, we show how comparing the eﬀect of new benefit enrollment
on turnover in these two scenarios provides insight into the selection eﬀect, the relationship
between underlying mobility tendencies and preferences for the new benefit.
   We model the discrete decision between a new employer-provided benefit and an existing
one, and the subsequent decision to leave or stay with one’s current employer. An employee
in our model, indexed by i, has three sources of individual-level heterogeneity: φi , which
determines her relative valuation of the new employee benefit over the old option; ci > 0,
which represents the employee’s cost of switching to the new employee benefit; and mi , which
dictates the mobility tendencies associated with switching to a new employer. These three
sources of heterogeneity are governed by a joint distribution with CDF F (·) : R3 → [0, 1].
    We define Bi to be a binary variable indicating enrollment in the new benefit at one’s
current employer and Leavei to be a binary variable indicating departure from the current
employer. For example, in our setting Bi = 1 indicates that an employee is observed enrolled
in the DC retirement plan rather than the DB plan, while Leavei = 1 indicates that an
individual has subsequently left the firm within one year of being initially observed. An
employee maximizes her expected utility, E [Vi (wi , Bi )] which, among other things, depends
on the employee’s wage wi , the status of her benefit participation Bi , and her choice of
employer.
    We begin with the benefit enrollment decision. The parameter φi , which captures the
net utility change of enrolling in the new benefit, is defined as follows:

                              φi ≡ E [Vi (wi , 1)] − E [Vi (wi , 0)] .                    (1)


                                                 4
Employees with a higher φi place a higher value on the new benefit. In our context, such
employees may prefer a DC plan to a DB plan for a number of reasons, including the net
present value, the risk profile of the retirement plan, transparency, portability, control over
investment, etc.
   In order to realize this utility change, the employee must pay a cost of switching to the
new benefit, ci > 0. This may include such costs as time, informational requirements or
administrative hurdles associated with switching benefits. If aﬀorded the choice, it follows
that the employee will use the following decision rule for adoption of the new benefit:
                                            
                                            1        if φi ≥ ci
                                     Bi =                                                  (2)
                                            0        if φi < ci .

   We now turn to the decision of whether or not to leave the firm. Denote Vio (wio , Bio ) as
the value of working at an outside firm and ηi as a cost of switching employers. We define
mi as the net benefit of leaving the current employer for an outside employer, conditional on
having the old benefit:

                          mi ≡ E [Vio (wio , Bio )] − E [Vi (wi , 0)] − ηi ,

where ηi is a parameter that captures the cost of switching employers. Thus, individuals
with a higher mi are more “mobile,” in that their outside options tend to be better relative
to the current employer and/or they tend to have lower switching costs across employers.
The decision to leave the firm can be characterized as follows:
                                        
                                        1 if φ · B < m
                                                  i   i     i
                               Leavei =                                                  (3)
                                        0 if φ · B ≥ m .
                                                         i     i     i


    We now consider two choice scenarios. In the first case, Bi is endogenously determined by
the employees. In the second case, Bi is exogenously determined. In each case, we discuss the
association between benefit enrollment and observed mobility and how these relationships
may be informative about the joint distribution of (φ, m, c). In particular, we are interested
in the co-movement of preferences for the new benefit, φ, and mobility, m.
    In the endogenous case, the employer introduces a new benefit and allows employees
to select into this benefit according to the rule in Equation 2. Subsequently, employees
make a decision on whether or not to leave the firm according to the rule in Equation 3.
Consider a comparison of the subsequent leave probabilities among those enrolled and those



                                                  5
not enrolled. We define this diﬀerence as:

                βEndo ≡ E [ Leavei | Bi = 1, Endo] − E [ Leavei | Bi = 0, Endo] ,              (4)

where the “Endo” explicitly indicates that Bi is endogenously determined by the employee.
   First, note that those who have chosen to enroll must have a positive value of φi , given
Equation 2 and the assumption that ci > 0. Focusing just on the left-hand sides of the
inequalities in Equation 3, those now enrolled have less of a reason to leave the firm relative
to those not enrolled, all other things equal. That is, φi · Bi > 0 for enrollees. We define this
direct eﬀect of the new benefit on the likelihood of leaving as the “incentive eﬀect.”
    In our context, a negative incentive eﬀect means that the DC plan reduces turnover
relative to the DB plan among those choosing to enroll in the new DC benefit. This may
seem counterintuitive given that DC plans are typically more portable. However, recall that
the parameter φ captures preferences for the multi-dimensional diﬀerences between a DC
plan and DB plan. All things equal, those who value the DC plan more receive higher utility
in the job now that it has a DC plan and are therefore less likely to leave it. Note that,
particularly in the context of DB and DC plans, there is a possibility that Bi also directly
aﬀects mi . We return to this case later in the section as an extension of the model.
    We now turn to the right-hand sides of the inequalities in Equation 3. The diﬀerence
in leave probabilities between enrollees and non-enrollees will depend on diﬀerences in the
distribution of mi across the two groups. We define the diﬀerence in leave probabilities due
to diﬀerences in the distribution of mi between enrollees and non-enrollees as the “selec-
tion eﬀect.” In particular, the sign of the selection eﬀect depends on the following baseline
diﬀerence in leave probabilities absent the new benefit:

           βSelection ≡ E [ Leavei | Bi = 0, φi > ci ] − E [ Leavei | Bi = 0, φi ≤ ci ] � 0.   (5)

    To explore the role of selection, fix ci = c. Conditional on c, if φi and mi are indepen-
dent, then Equation 5 is zero and there would be no selection eﬀect on leave probabilities. In
this no-selection case, the incentive eﬀect ensures that leave probabilities are lower for those
employees who endogenously enroll in the benefit. Alternatively, assume that, conditional
on c, Equation 5 is negative, i.e. there is a negative selection eﬀect. Then the selection eﬀect
reinforces the incentive eﬀect, and we would again expect to see lower leave probabilities for
enrolled employees. Finally, if Equation 5 is positive, conditional on c, then the selection
eﬀect works in the opposite direction of the incentive eﬀect. In this case, the leave probabil-
ities for enrollees may be lower, equal or higher than those of non-enrollees, depending on



                                                  6
whether the selection eﬀect only mitigates, neutralizes, or dominates the incentive eﬀect.2
  Now consider the second choice scenario. In the exogenous case an employer forces all
employees to enroll in the new benefit.3 Imagine comparing the probability of leaving the
firm under the new benefit regime as compared to under the original regime. The decision
to leave the firm is still dictated by the decision rule in Equation 3. However, now that
employees are not self-selecting into the new benefit, we no longer have a selection eﬀect
since plan enrollment is independent of m. Furthermore, because there is no endogenous
enrollment into Bi , it is no longer the case that φi · Bi > 0 for all enrollees. Instead, the
incentive eﬀect will vary across employees, decreasing the likelihood of leaving among those
who have a positive φ and increasing the likelihood of leaving for those with a negative φ. A
comparison of leave probabilities under the new relative to the old benefit regime identifies
the average incentive eﬀect of Bi among all employees, or a treatment eﬀect defined as:

                  βExog ≡ E [ Leavei | Bi = 1, Exog] − E [ Leavei | Bi = 0, Exog] ,                       (6)

where the “Exog” explicitly indicates that benefit enrollment is exogenously determined.
The net change in leave probabilities depends on the number of employees now induced to
stay with the firm, i.e. those with mi and φi such that 0 < mi ≤ φi , relative those who are
now induced to leave the firm, i.e. those with mi and φi such that 0 ≥ mi > φi , because of
the new benefit.
   Now that we have defined the estimates for the endogenous and exogenous cases, we can
show how the characteristics of the (φ, m, c)-distribution manifest in the relative magnitude
of the estimates. Fixing ci = c, suppose that m and φ are independent, meaning there is
no selection eﬀect. This means that the distribution of m does not diﬀer among those who
choose to enroll in the new benefit under the endogenous case and under the exogenous
case. If there is no selection eﬀect, then we would expect to find a larger reduction in leave
probabilities under the endogenous case than the exogenous case (i.e. βEndo < βExog ). This
is because those who self-select into the new benefit have relatively higher values for the
benefit, and therefore experience larger reductions in the probability of leaving due to the
incentive eﬀect, all things equal.4 Now, suppose that the selection eﬀect is negative. This
scenario would further reduce βEndo relative to βExog because the negative selection eﬀect
would reinforce the negative incentive eﬀect present in the endogenous case, again implying
βEndo < βExog . Finally, a positive selection eﬀect would oﬀset the diﬀerence between the
   2
      We formalize this idea with a Lemma 1 in Appendix A.
   3
      In the exogenous case the cost of enrollment c is removed; therefore, the influence of φ and c can be
separated.
    4
      This is because the distribution of φ among enrollees in the endogenous case is a left-truncated version
of the distribution of φ among all employees under exogenous enrollment.


                                                      7
endogenous and exogenous estimates, potentially even reversing the relative magnitude of
βEndo and βExog .
   We formalize these relationships in the following Proposition 1, but first we must define
two additional parameters:

Definition 1. Define β0 and β1 as the eﬀect on leave propensity of exogenously enrolling
those who would not have enrolled voluntarily (i.e. φ < c) and those who would have enrolled
voluntarily (i.e. φ ≥ c) respectively. That is:

                β0 = E [ Leavei | Bi = 1, φi < ci ] − E [ Leavei | Bi = 0, φi < ci ]
                β1 = E [ Leavei | Bi = 1, φi ≥ ci ] − E [ Leavei | Bi = 0, φi ≥ ci ] .

Proposition 1. If the quasi-experimental estimate defined in Equation 6 is positive (i.e.
βExog ≥ 0), or if exogenous benefit enrollment increases leave propensity by more among
those who would not have endogenously enrolled relative to those who would have enrolled
(i.e. β0 ≥ β1 ), then the diﬀerence between the endogenous (Equation 4) and exogenous
(Equation 6) estimates is bounded from above by the selection eﬀect defined in Equation 5.
That is:
                                βEndo − βExog ≤ βSelection .                           (7)

We provide a proof in Appendix A. The requirement that βExog be positive is in principle
empirically testable, while the alternative suﬃcient condition (i.e. β0 ≥ β1 ) is sensible and
more general, but cannot be tested. Namely it requires that employees who would have
self-selected into the new benefit on their own are less likely to leave the firm if exogenously
enrolled relative to employees who would not have enrolled on their own.
    The implications of Proposition 1 are summarized in Table 1, which maps the possible
sign of the selection eﬀect to the implied diﬀerence between the endogenous and exogenous
estimates. Importantly, Table 1 shows that the mapping is asymmetric in that a negative
diﬀerence (i.e. βEndo ≤ βExog ) is not informative about the sign of the selection eﬀect.5
As shown in Table 1, in the case where the exogenous estimates show a larger reduction
in leave probabilities than the endogenous estimates (i.e. βEndo > βExog ), we can rule out
a zero or negative selection eﬀect in favor of a positive selection eﬀect. A regression of
turnover (i.e. Leavei ) on new benefit enrollment among employees who can choose their
benefit approximates the endogenous case. As shown above, the correlation between Leavei
and Bi in this choice scenario is driven by both the incentive eﬀect and the selection eﬀect.
   5
     This may seem counterintuitive given the standard approach of signing omitted variable bias. However,
we show in Appendix A.3 why this is the case. In short, the standard omitted variable bias intuition does
not hold in the presence of heterogeneous treatment eﬀects and selection on treatment.


                                                    8
Estimating the eﬀect of new benefit enrollment on leave probabilities when benefit enrollment
is randomly assigned approximates the exogenous case. The eﬀect of Bi on Leavei identifies
the average incentive eﬀect.
   A couple of points are worth making about our stylized model. First, it may appear that
the dynamics are completely suppressed in our model. In particular, we introduce a friction
in decision-making by requiring the enrollment decision to be made before the leave decision,
and furthermore do not model forward-looking behavior at the enrollment stage. However,
the friction is meant to capture uncertainty about the future leave decision, or at least about
the time span between enrollment and leaving. In addition, we can allow for the enrollment
decision to be correlated with the leave decision directly through a correlation between φ
and m, which we have thus far left unrestricted.6
    Second, we have to this point modeled a new benefit that only aﬀects mobility, m, through
its eﬀect on E [Vi (wi , Bi )]. However, the new benefit we examine in our context (the DC
plan) has the potential to directly aﬀect mobility, for example, by reducing or eliminating
the vesting requirement for retirement benefits. This can be modeled by allowing ηi , the
employment switching cost, to be a function of Bi . We have abstracted here from that
interaction for brevity and ease of exposition. However, we show in Appendix A.2 that
Proposition 1 still holds in this case, so long as we still assume that β0 ≥ β1 .


3       Institutional Setting and Data
3.1     Setting
We use data on unionized, non-faculty employees from a large research university. While our
data are from a single institution, the jobs represented in the sample are diverse, ranging
from those with low skill requirements (e.g., athletic equipment keeper, food service worker)
to relatively high-skilled jobs (e.g., life science technician, computer service, audio equipment
specialist). These unionized employees underwent a plan transition on September 1, 2002.
All existing union employees could elect to continue participating in the DB plan, or choose
to move to the DC plan and cease accruing benefits under the DB plan.7 If no election was
made, the employee was enrolled in the default plan. The default plan was heterogeneous
and depended on the employee’s date of birth. In particular, employees under age 45 as of
September 1 were assigned the DC plan as the default, while employees age 45 or older as
    6
     In fact, if we had not allowed any friction, then our model would generate the unrealistic prediction that
no one who enrolls then leaves the firm, as it would not be optimal to pay the cost of enrolling knowing that
one would be leaving the firm.
   7
     The choice governed future benefit accruals only, as past benefit accruals were frozen in the DB plan.


                                                      9
of September 1 were assigned the DB plan as the default.8 We exploit this rich variation in
our estimation strategy.
   The DB plan at the firm oﬀered benefits equal to 2% of an employees average salary,
multiplied by the total years of service at the firm. Because the benefit base was the average
salary rather than a final average salary based on the 3 or 5 years prior to retirement, DB
benefit accruals were not as “back-loaded” as is often the case with DB plans. These benefits
were vested for employees with at least 5 years of service. The DC plan oﬀered a 5 percent
employer contribution and matching schedule up to an additional 5 percent.9 Employer
contributions were considered vested after 1 year of service.10


3.2     Data
We construct an original data set using administrative data from two sources: annual payroll
records that include employees present at the university on December 15 of each year from
1999 to 2005 and pension accrual records. The payroll data includes annual information on
job, salary, and weekly hours worked as well as demographic characteristics, including exact
date of birth, gender, race, and hire date.11
    Our primary outcome measure is a binary variable that indicates whether an individual
we observe in year t is present in the dataset in year t + 1. As such, it measures the 1-year
probability of leaving the firm, either voluntarily or involuntarily. After the transition, the
one-year leave probability among employees that remained in the DB plan was 4.3 percent,
while it was 5.3 percent among employees who switched to the DC plan. We also examine
the relationship between pension plans and two- and three-year mobility.
   The main analysis segments the data into two subsamples: (1) the subset of employees
who were present in 2002 and eligible for the September transition from the DB plan to the
DC plan, where the default provision varied by the age of the employee on September 1,
2002; and (2) the subset of employees who were employed at the firm in the years 1999-2001.
   8
     In addition, all unionized employees hired after January 1, 2001 started accruing benefits in the DC
plan and did not have a choice of plans. Non-union employees were subject to an earlier plan transition
on January 1, 1997. However, our data do not span this earlier policy change. All non-union employees
hired after this date were enrolled in the DC plan. Faculty and non-union employees in supervisory roles
were never oﬀered benefits in a DB plan unless they experienced job changes that resulted in changes in
employment group.
   9
     If the employee contributed 1, 2, 3, or 4 percent, the employer contributed 1.5, 3, 4, and 5 percent
respectively.
  10
     In a study which examines the 2002 transition for union employees, Goda and Manchester (2013) show
that the certainty equivalents for the two plans under a base set of assumptions are roughly equal on average
across the two plans, though the DC plan is of more value to younger employees and the DB plan is of more
value to older employees.
  11
     Individuals with missing pension or demographic records were dropped from the analysis (12 individuals).
Individuals who had DB accruals, but were rehired following the transition were also dropped (7 individuals).


                                                     10
These employees were all enrolled in the DB plan during these years, and because it was prior
to the policy change, there is no discontinuity in plan enrollment as a function of whether
one would be older than 45 or not on September 1, 2002, or whether one is currently over
or under age 45 in these years. Our empirical strategy allows us to use this subsample as an
additional comparison group.
   Table 2 shows summary statistics for diﬀerent subsamples of the data. Column 1 shows
summary statistics for both union and non-union non-faculty employees at the university.
Column 2 restricts the sample to just union employees. The table shows that the mobility
propensities are lower among union employees relative to non-union, and lower still among
employees between the ages of 40 and 50 years old. In addition, the percent female is
substantially lower among the unionized employees, while the fraction Hispanic is higher.
Column 3 applies the age restriction of 40 to 50 years of age as of September 1, 2002, which
is relevant for our fuzzy RD and DRD analysis. Finally, the last two columns further split
this sample into the two subsets of data used in the main analysis. Column 4 includes
union employees in 2002, while Column 5 includes union employees in 1999-2001. The
predetermined characteristics across these two subsamples are very similar.On the other
hand, the propensity to leave within one year for the 2002 subsample (Column 4) is low
relative to the 1999-2001 subsample (Column 5).


4    Empirical Strategy
For our empirical strategy, we estimate the endogenous and exogenous relationship between
enrollment in the DC plan and mobility based on the model outlined in Section 2 albeit
with one diﬀerence. Rather than true random assignment as described in the model above,
we exploit the discontinuity in DC enrollment produced by the diﬀerent default plan for
employees on either side of age 45 in 2002 using a fuzzy RD and diﬀerences-in-regression-
discontinuities (DRD) design described below. We conclude this section with a discussion of
how these estimates map to our model and Proposition 1.
    To execute our strategy, we first use OLS to estimate the eﬀect of DC plans on employee
mobility by running the following regression:

         Leave1i = βOLS · DCi + f (Ai − 45) + f (Ai − 45) · U nder45i + ΓXi + εi ,        (8)

where Leave1i is a binary variable that equals one if the employee is not with the firm one
year later. The variable DCi is a dummy equal to one if employee i is in a DC plan. The
variable Ai denotes the employee’s age on September 1, 2002. The variable U nder45i is a


                                             11
binary variable that takes the value 1 if the employee is younger than age 45 on September
1, 2002. The flexible function f (·) controls for age. We use three alternative functions as
follows:

                                      f (x) = 0
                                      f (x) = ax
                                      f (x) = ax + bx2 + cx3 .

Finally, the vector Xi consists of demographic control variables for gender, race, hours, base
salary, tenure at the firm and dummies for department.
    We then turn to a fuzzy RD estimate using the discontinuity in default rules. In the first
stage, we estimate the eﬀect of the default provision on DC participation for those under
45 relative to those over 45 in 2002. In the second stage, we estimate the eﬀect of DC
participation on the one-year turnover probability, instrumenting for DC participation using
the age-based policy change.
   Formally, the first-stage equation is as follows:

          DCi = δ · DCDef aulti + f (Ai − 45) + f (Ai − 45) · U nder45i + ΓXi + εi ,                   (9)

where DCi , Ai , U nder45i and Xi are defined as described above, and DCDef aulti is a
binary variable that equals 1 if the employee is an employee under the age of 45 in 2002.
The coeﬃcient δ is interpreted as the increase in DC enrollment from the assignment of the
DC default.
  The second-stage equation is estimated as:

           Leave1i = βRD · DCi + f (Ai − 45) + f (Ai − 45) · U nder45i + ΓXi + εi ,                   (10)

where DC is instrumented for with the age-based policy as shown above. The estimate
βRD identifies the incentive eﬀect of the DC plan relative to the DB plan for compliers, as
the two-stage approach helps isolate the eﬀect of enrollment patterns driven by the random
variation in the assignment of the default plan on employee mobility.12 The fuzzy RD
estimate approximates the exogenous case under the assumption that, in a small window
surrounding the age 45 threshold in 2002, counterfactual mobility rates evolve smoothly as
a function of age (Lee and Lemieux, 2010).
    Because of the availability of administrative data prior to the policy change, we can
  12
     Specifically, the two stage estimation identifies the local average treatment eﬀect (LATE) among “com-
pliers”, whose choice in retirement plan is driven by the default policy (Imbens and Angrist, 1994).


                                                    12
augment our analysis by combining our fuzzy RD design with elements of a diﬀerence-in-
diﬀerence. We refer to this methodology as a diﬀerences-in-regression-discontinuities (DRD)
design. This strategy provides an additional estimate of the incentive eﬀect of pension plans
on leave propensities. Formally, we estimate:

          Leave1i = βDRD · DCi + f (Ai − 45) + f (Ai − 45) · U nder45i + Γ̃X̃i + εi ,                  (11)

where DCi is instrumented for with the age-based policy as shown above. When pooling the
data from 2002 with data from years prior to the policy change, both the first and second
stage include indicators for the year 2002 and U nder45i in X̃i . The estimate βDRD compares
the diﬀerence in mobility between workers under and over 45 in 2002 to that same diﬀerence
in 1999-2001.13
    The DRD approach aﬀords three advantages over employing a fuzzy RD using a single
cross section. First, it mitigates the typical trade-oﬀ between bias and precision in RD de-
signs. The use of age as the forcing variable in the first stage requires controlling for age
parametrically to identify the eﬀect of the default provision on plan enrollment. However, as
will be seen, we run into problems with statistical power when estimating a smooth function
of age with our sample size. With a cross section of data, one may increase sample size by
widening the window about the discontinuity. However, doing so may weaken the assump-
tion that individuals above and below the cutoﬀ are otherwise similar. Our additional years
of data aﬀord us the ability to increase our sample size while holding the size of our win-
dow constant, thus increasing the eﬃciency of our estimate. These additional observations
contribute to our estimate of the smooth function of the forcing variable, increasing our
precision. This refinement is not completely free: we must impose an additional assumption
that the relationship between leave probability and age is similar in earlier years.14
    Second, the additional data allow us to control for flexible functions of age. While the
assumptions underlying a fuzzy RD estimator would allow us to estimate everything using
just a single cross section, certain methods of controlling or age, such as age dummies, are
not possible. However, the inclusion of pre-transition data allow us to add this fourth,
nonparametric functional form for our control function in age:15

                                                  k/2
                                                  �
                                    f (x) =              γi · 1 (x = i) ,
                                                i=−k/2

  13
     As we explain later, we will use both a cohort-based analysis, where Ai is age in the year 2002, and an
age-based analysis, where Ai is age at time of observation.
  14
     We visually inspect the validity of this assumption below.
  15
     When we control non-parametrically for age using age dummies, the estimation technique becomes
essentially a diﬀerence-in-diﬀerence estimator in a narrow window around the policy change.


                                                    13
where k is the size of the bandwidth around age 45 to which the analysis is restricted.
   Finally, DRD estimation can be used in situations where the relationship between un-
observable determinants of leaving and age is not continuous at the threshold, perhaps due
to other polices that discontinuously change. In our context, this is not a concern as there
are no other policies that involve the age 45 threshold. Instead, we can use the pre-policy
data to evaluate the validity of our assumption that there is no discontinuous change in
unobservable determinants of leaving at age 45 in the absence of the policy.
   Our estimates provide proxies for the relationship between mobility and DC enrollment
in the endogenous case (OLS) and the exogenous case (fuzzy RD and DRD) laid out in
Section 2.16 The OLS estimates that compare mobility rates among DC participants and
DB participants are driven by both the incentive eﬀect and the selection eﬀect. These two
forces can, in general, lead to an ambiguous relationship between mobility rates across the
two types of plans because the selection eﬀect could reinforce or counteract the incentive
eﬀect. Importantly, by Proposition 1, we can rule out both a negative selection eﬀect and
no selection eﬀect if we can reject that the OLS estimate is less than the RD estimate.
    Recall that Table 1 summarizes the relationship between the relative magnitude of βOLS
(≈ βEndo ) and βRD (≈ βExog ) and the implied sign of the selection eﬀect generated from our
model. Here βRD refers either to the fuzzy RD estimate generated from the 2002 data or to
the DRD estimate generated from the pooled 1999-2002 data. In order to test for positive
selection, we report the results of a test of the null hypothesis that βOLS ≤ βRD . We also
report first stage results and the results of reduced-form regressions, which replace DCi in
Equations 10 or 11 with DCDef aulti .


5      Results
In this section, we first graphically examine the conditions required for a regression disconti-
nuity analysis in our context. Second, we show our main regression results for one-year leave
probabilities, followed by analysis using a two- and three-year window. Finally, we present
supplemental analyses, including placebo discontinuities and an analysis of the control groups
used in our DRD estimator.
  16
     The discontinuity in the default plan by age allows us to identify a local average treatment eﬀect among
compliers, i.e. individuals who enroll in the plan that is their default plan, whether it be the new benefit or
the old benefit. In the context of our model in Section 2, these are employees for whom |φi | ≤ ci . While
these employees may not represent the average employee, we can use the same conditions developed earlier
to sign the selection eﬀect.




                                                      14
5.1       Graphical Analysis
Figure 1 shows the DC plan enrollment rate by one-year age bins in 2002. The figure shows a
large discontinuity in enrollment at age 45, which is the causal eﬀect of the default policy on
plan enrollment. We next investigate the assumptions needed for a regression discontinuity
approach. Figure 2 confirms that the age distribution is smooth across the age 45 cut-oﬀ
for the 2002 subsample, while Figure 3 shows that observable characteristics do not vary
discontinuously at age 45.
       The upper panel of Figure 4 depicts the probability of leaving within one year for one-
year age bins for employees at the firm in 2002. This graph shows some evidence of a
discontinuity in mobility rates on either side of the age 45 cutoﬀ. However, the figure also
highlights some diﬃculties in estimating the eﬀect of pension plans on mobility with these
data. Due to limitations in sample size, there is considerable noise in the mobility rates by
age, particularly within a small window surrounding the age 45 threshold.
   As discussed previously, the issue of precision can be surmounted by augmenting our
analysis with data from the 1999-2001 period, when these workers were not aﬀected by the
policy. Namely, we can compare the discontinuity in mobility rates at age 45 in 2002 to the
discontinuity in mobility rates for these same workers in prior years (i.e. based on date of
birth or “cohort”). The bottom panel of Figure 4 displays the leave probabilities by age in
2002 for both the 2002 and the 1999-2001 subsamples. By showing both plots in the same
figure, a clearer mobility pattern emerges in that the 2002 plot is shifted down relative to
the 1999-2001 plot for those younger than 45 in 2002, yet the two plots are nearly identical
for ages 45 and older.17
    To better facilitate this comparison, in Figure 5, we show the diﬀerence in employee
mobility between employees in 2002 and the same cohort of employees in 1999-2001 by one-
year bins based on age in 2002. This figure shows evidence of a discontinuity in one-year
leave probabilities across the age threshold. The probability of leaving within one year is
lower for the younger employees relative to the older employees, suggesting that the DC plan
is associated with lower one-year turnover probabilities relative to the DB plan.18
    Alternatively, we can use the 1999-2001 data to compare the discontinuity in mobility
rates at age 45 in 2002 to the discontinuity in mobility rates at age 45 in prior years (i.e.
fixed age). While we omit the graphical results for ease of exposition, our empirical results
report DRD results for both cohort and age.
  17
     The fact that these curves line up so well to the right of age 45 supports our notion that the pre-transition
data provides an accurate counterfactual for the 2002 employees.
  18
     Again, the diﬀerence is nearly zero for ages above 45 in 2002, suggesting that the pre-transition employees
are an appropriate group to use for estimating the baseline relationship between leaving and age.



                                                       15
      These figures give suggestive evidence that employee mobility is related to pension plan
enrollment. The following section formalizes the graphical evidence using the regression
framework outlined previously in Section 4.


5.2       One-Year Leave Probabilities
We begin by estimating the eﬀect of DC plan enrollment on the probability of leaving the
firm within the next calendar year using a fuzzy RD approach. Table 3 reports the results for
the sample of employees aﬀected by the policy change in 2002. We report results for a sample
consisting of observations within a 5-year window around the age of 45.19 Coeﬃcients from
the OLS regression in Equation 8 are reported in the first row. The second row contains the
results from the fuzzy RD regression described in Equation 10, and the third row provides
the p-values of the test of the null hypothesis that βOLS ≤ βRD . Recall that this is the key
inequality from Proposition 1. The table also includes first stage and reduced form regression
results, the mean one-year leave probability within this sample, and the F-statistic from the
first stage regression.
    The OLS estimate of the correlation between DC plan enrollment and leaving the firm
is not significantly diﬀerent from zero. The fuzzy RD estimates indicate a negative, though
typically insignificant eﬀect of DC enrollment on employee mobility. As we add controls
for the running variable (age) we lose a significant amount of power, given our low sample
size. This result is demonstrated most readily by moving across the first three columns
and comparing the first stage regressions. The F-statistics from our first stage imply that
simultaneously estimating a smooth function in age and a jump at age 45 is asking a lot of
the data. While the fuzzy RD estimates are always more negative than the OLS estimates,
suggesting a positive selection of high-mobility employees into the DC plan, the p-values
from our hypothesis test do not consistently allow us to reject the null hypothesis that the
OLS estimates are less than the fuzzy RD estimates. Overall, the lack of power in these
fuzzy RD estimates mirrors our earlier discussion of Figure 4. We therefore turn to our
DRD analysis for increased precision.
   We report results from our DRD estimation in Table 4, which mirrors Table 3 in format
except that it contains one additional column where age is controlled for non-parametrically.
Here, βDRD reflects the diﬀerence in mobility rates for those near age 45 in 2002 relative
to the same employees in prior years. We again see very little evidence of a correlation
between employee mobility and DC plan enrollment in the first row of OLS regression results.
However, the DRD estimates are now robust to alternative methods of controlling for the
 19
      Results assuming a 10-year window are provided in Appendix B.2.



                                                   16
running variable. The p-values from our hypothesis test now consistently allow us to reject
the null hypothesis that βOLS ≤ βRD at the 5 percent level. Thus, based on Proposition
1, we conclude that the selection eﬀect is positive, i.e. mobility tendencies are positively
related to preferences for the DC plan. We also demonstrate a strong and robust first-
stage relationship, which suggests that those just below the age 45 threshold are about 50
percentage points more likely to enroll in the DC plan.
   Table 5 presents results where βDRD reflects the diﬀerence in mobility rates for those
near age 45 in 2002 relative to those near age 45 in prior years. We find the same pattern of
results in that βOLS is greater than βDRD or a positive selection eﬀect, although the finding
is now only marginally significant with a p-value of approximately 0.07.
    One may be concerned that these results are driven by employees who are vested in the
DC plan but not vested in the DB plan due to diﬀerences in vesting requirements. When
we restrict the analysis to employees vested in both plans (i.e. at least 5 years of service),
the positive selection eﬀect remains. This suggests that the multi-dimensional diﬀerence
between the two plans contributes to the positive relationship between mobility tendencies
and preferences for the DC plan rather than diﬀerences in vesting alone.
   While our focus has been on identifying the role of selection, our results also provide
estimates of the incentive eﬀect, which measures the direct eﬀect of the DC plan on mobility
relative to the DB plan. The results suggest switching an employee from the DB plan to the
DC plan reduces the probability of leaving the firm within the next year by approximately
six to ten percentage points depending on which comparison group is used (Table 5 vs Table
4). While conventional wisdom suggests that DC plans ought to increase mobility, due to
greater portability, our results suggest that other attributes of the benefit generally make
this DC plan more attractive than the DB and increase the likelihood that one remains with
the firm in a way that dominates portability.
    The magnitude of the incentive eﬀect is large relative to the average leave probability
among the sample, which is between four and five percent. One possible explanation is
that those induced to enroll in the DC plan due to the default policy (i.e. “compliers”) are
systematically diﬀerent from the average employee in our sample. We use a method similar
to Autor and Houseman (2005) to estimate the characteristics of the marginal DC enrollee
via a DRD and compare average characteristics to the sample mean. The only diﬀerence
we observe is that compliers are more likely to be White and less likely to be of Hispanic
origin relative to the sample mean. These results are provided in Appendix B.1. Another
possibility is that these eﬀects only represent intertemporal retiming of behaivior. In Section
5.4, we discuss in the context of longer run eﬀects whether this estimate is more akin to a
permanent reduction in mobility or a short-run delay in leaving the firm.


                                              17
       The fact that we find a positive selection eﬀect and a negative incentive eﬀect may
appear counterintuitive, but is readily interpretable in the context of our conceptual model.
Consider a simple case with two types of workers, indexed by j ∈ {1, 2} and a constant
enrollment cost of c. Assume φ1 > c > φ2 > 0, so that both types prefer the DC plan, but
only type 1 enrolls voluntarily. Furthermore, assume the mobility parameter for individual i
of type j is mij = mj − η − �ij , where m1 > m2 and �ij ∼ F (·). In this case we have positive
                                                        i.i.d.
selection, i.e. those who voluntarily choose the DC plan are also generally more likely to
leave the firm, even in the absence of the DC plan. Formally, 1 − F (η − m1 ) > 1 − F (η − m2 ).
Nonetheless, the DC plan has a negative incentive eﬀect on the probability of leaving, i.e.
1 − F (η + φj − mj ) < 1 − F (η − mj ). In particular, when the DC plan default removes the
enrollment cost for type 2 workers, they enjoy a positive benefit relative to the DB plan,
implying higher retention. Finally, the result is robust to a direct eﬀect of DC enrollment
on mobility, e.g. η = η − Bi �η, so long as φ2 > �η.20
   We can similarly illustrate this example as follows. Suppose that the DC plan is equivalent
to the DB plan in terms of retirement wealth and risk, but also allows for low penalty
withdrawal pre-retirement. However, assume that this additional feature of the DC plan
requires eﬀort to discover. If higher ability workers are more likely to discover this feature,
they may be more likely to enroll in the DC plan. Furthermore, assume that higher ability
workers tend to receive more frequent outside oﬀers, and, therefore, are more likely to leave
the firm. In this case, we have positive selection, in that those who choose the DC plan
are also more likely to leave the firm. Finally, assume that once you are enrolled in the
DC plan, you costlessly learn about all of its features. Now, randomly enrolling a worker in
the DC plan will, on average, reveal the higher value of the benefit, and therefore, reduce
turnover, all things equal. Again, this example is consistent with simultaneously finding
positive selection and a negative incentive eﬀect.
    Therefore, while behavioral economic explanations may be possible, e.g. overestimation
of the enrollment cost ĉ > c, they are not required to explain the pattern of our findings. It is
important to note that our findings cannot merely be explained by a tendency for compliers
to be complacent or inert because our estimation uses employees who were aﬀected by the
default on both sides of the age 45 threshold. Any such explanation would need to highlight
why compliers under age 45 are systematically diﬀerent from compliers who are age 45 or
above in a narrow window around this threshold.
  20
    Because m involves two components, the value of the outside employment option relative to the current
firm and employer switching costs (η), this result places no restriction on the magnitude of the enrollment
cost c relative to the switching cost η. However, in the case where the DC plan directly aﬀects the switching
cost, our assumptions do imply that c is greater than the diﬀerence in switching costs between the DC and
DB plan, �η.

5.3     Robustness Checks
In this section, we evaluate the robustness of our results by conducting falsification tests using
alternative age thresholds in 2002. We furthermore evaluate the validity of our comparison
groups in the DRD analyses by testing for discontinuities in mobility in the pre-period.

5.3.1   Placebo Discontinuities for Plan Enrollment

Our estimates rely on the assumption that those employees just below age 45 are otherwise
comparable to those employees above age 45. One advantage of regression discontinuity
designs is that specification checks that help to test the validity of our identification are
readily available (Lee and Lemieux, 2010). In particular, we can redo our analysis at placebo
discontinuities, where we know there is no sharp change in the DC enrollment rate. Our
identifying assumptions imply that we should find no discontinuous change in our outcome
variables at these alternative thresholds. To employ this method, we conduct our analysis
with ages 42.5 and 47.5 as our placebo thresholds. In both cases, we examine the sample
in 5-year windows surrounding these ages: ages 40 to 45 and ages 45 to 50, respectively.
Within these samples, all employees receive the same retirement plan default.
    Table 6 contains the reduced form results for one-year leave probabilities at these al-
ternative thresholds as well as the first-stage F-statistic using the 2002 sample and pooled
1999-2002 sample used for the two DRD analyses. As expected, the F-statistics from the
first stage are very small given there is no discontinuity in plan enrollment at these placebo
thresholds. We therefore focus on the reduced form estimates at these alternative thresholds.
They are similarly noisy and almost always indistinguishable from zero. Thus, in order for
our results to be confounded by age patterns, there has to be an unobservable diﬀerence
in underlying employee mobility between those just above and below age 45 that quickly
vanishes when comparing those just above and under either age 42.5 or 47.5.

5.3.2   Placebo Discontinuities in 1999-2001

Our DRD approach compares diﬀerences in leave propensities for workers on either side of
age 45 in 2002 relative to diﬀerences in leave propensities for the same cohorts in 1999 to
2001 and relative to diﬀerences in leave probabilities around the age 45 cutoﬀ in 1999 to
2001. Therefore, the diﬀerence in leave probabilities in 1999-2001 is the counterfactual we
use in our analysis. This group, which was not aﬀected by our policy, should not exhibit
any jumps in leave probabilities around the relevant threshold if our assumption that there
is no discontinuous change in unobservable determinants of leaving at age 45 in the absence
of the policy is correct.

                                               19
      In Table 7 we assess this condition by estimating the reduced form discontinuity in
one-year leave probabilities in each of the years 1999-2001. The top panel estimates the
discontinuity for the same cohorts that were subject to the diﬀerential default policy in
2002, while the bottom panel estimates the discontinuity at the fixed age 45 threshold in
prior years. In each case, we do not find evidence of a discontinuity nor do we find any
trend. In the final column, we estimate the average diﬀerence pooling the years 1999 to
2001, which represents the counterfactuals we use when pooling the data among employees
in 1999-2002 in Tables 4 and 5. Here, we find no statistically significant evidence that
turnover probabilities diﬀer at the threshold age in the absence of the policy, which suggests
that the 1999-2001 employees serve as an appropriate control group.


5.4       Two- and Three-Year Leave Probabilities
We extend the analysis from the previous section to longer-run turnover outcomes, in partic-
ular, the likelihood of leaving the firm within two or three years. Table 8 reports fuzzy RD
estimates for the 2002 sample and results from the two DRD analyses for various samples
and specifications. Our sample is slightly smaller than that used in our main set of estimates
in order to eliminate employees in the pre-period whose two- or three-year horizons cross
the 2002 introduction of the new pension plan. We have omitted results from the first stage
because, other than the diﬀerence in sample size, they remain identical to those contained
in the previous tables.
    The first three columns of Table 8 show the results from the fuzzy RD, which are sensitive
to functional form as we saw in the one-year outcome. Columns (4) to (6) report the DRD
estimates when using age in 2002 as the forcing variable. The point estimates show a slightly
more pronounced eﬀect of DC enrollment on turnover. Enrollment in the DC plan generates
nearly a 17 percentage point reduction in the probability of leaving the firm within two
calendar years, relative to a baseline of 9 percent. When using the comparison across age
45 in prior years, the results are similar, but lower in magnitude and thus not significant at
conventional levels. This pattern suggests that there is an additional reduction in employees
leaving in the second year, albeit a smaller eﬀect as a proportion of the baseline leave
probability.21
    Looking at results of pension plan type on mobility over a three-year horizon, we see that
there is still a negative eﬀect of DC plans on turnover probabilities, though the eﬀect is not
consistently significant. In fact, the magnitude of the three-year turnover eﬀect is less than
the eﬀect on two-year turnover. There are at least two ways to interpret this result. First,
 21
      Theoretically, the eﬀect would eventually have to slow down, since it is bounded below by negative one.



                                                      20
the fact that the three-year eﬀect is less significant and sometimes smaller than the two-year
eﬀect may suggest that the leave probabilities are beginning to converge between those just
over and just under 45 years of age. This relationship may be indicative of a short-run eﬀect
of the policy that eventually fades. In other words, employees who were defaulted into the
DC plan initially stay with the firm some time longer, but ultimately leave the firm anyway.
This finding would suggest that the large magnitude of our one-year results may be due to
the fact that intertemporal adjustments tend to be much larger than permanent behavioral
responses. Second, this finding may be due to the smaller sample and reduced precision
resulting from measuring a three-year leave probability and therefore having to drop more
observations who span the the pre- and post-periods.


6    Conclusion
The eﬀect of a widespread transition in the employer-provided pension plan landscape from
DB to DC plans on employee mobility has been a subject of interest among policymakers and
academics because of the large number of firms and employees aﬀected. Since DB pension
wealth is typically tied more closely to tenure as compared to DC plans, conventional wis-
dom supports the idea that DC plans will induce higher mobility. However, this conclusion
is complicated by the potential role of selection into employers and plan oﬀerings by em-
ployees with diﬀering underlying mobility tendencies. The eﬀect of plan type on mobility is
further confounded by the multi-dimensional diﬀerence between DB and DC plans, including
features, such as individual control, liquidity, and transparency, that may make DC plans
desirable enough to increase retention at firms with these plans.
    In this paper, we exploit a natural experiment that created random variation in pension
plan enrollment, in order to study the eﬀects of pension plan type on employee mobility.
Our identification strategy combines elements of a diﬀerence-in-diﬀerence and a fuzzy RD
estimator, a DRD estimation approach, relying on weaker assumptions relative to the pre-
vious literature. We develop an empirical model that helps us interpret the results from our
analysis in the context of separate, and possibly countervailing, incentive and selection ef-
fects. This framework provides predictions regarding the diﬀerent eﬀects of endogenous and
exogenous pension plan enrollment as they relate to the role of selection on mobility tenden-
cies. Our empirical results combined with insights from our model indicate that preferences
for DC plans are positively related to unobservable mobility tendencies.
    While the natural experiment we examine provides plausibly exogenous variation, extrap-
olating from a single employer warrants caution. However, our findings have some implica-
tions for mobility and the transition from DC to DB plans more generally. First, our results

                                             21
provide evidence of positive selection into DC plans based on mobility tendencies, implying
that at least part of the relationship between the transition and increased job mobility is
due to selection, and not fully caused by diﬀerences in portability or accrual patterns across
plan type. Second, because the transition we examine takes place within an employer among
a set of covered workers, we can rule out the possibility that the diﬀerences in mobility we
find are driven by compensation premiums, which have been used to explain a potentially
large part of the mobility diﬀerences between covered and uncovered workers (Gustman and
Steinmeier, 1993).
   Third, we find evidence that, counter to conventional wisdom, DC plans may reduce
mobility relative to DB plans. Thus we should not simply characterize the diﬀerence in plan
features between DB and DC plans in terms of portability and accrual; rather, the diﬀerences
are multi-dimensional, including diﬀerences in risk exposure, liquidity, and transparency, for
example. Finally, we find that the incentive and selection eﬀects work in opposite directions
in our context. This has implications for choice architecture in that the presence of nontrivial
transaction costs of switching from the DB to the DC benefit ensures that only those who
value the DC plan the most will switch into it. For these individuals, the relatively high
value they place on the DC plan will tend to oﬀset certain features of the DC plan, such as
a shorter vesting period, that may generate higher turnover. For an employer contemplating
a transition from a DB to a DC plan, the trade-oﬀ between higher DC enrollment and lower
turnover may be mitigated by transaction costs, implying that the optimal level of switching
costs may be nonzero.

Note: Selection refers to the relationship between mobility tendencies and preferences for the new benefit,
defined by Equation 5, while βEndo and βExog are defined by Equations 4 and 6. In practice, we estimate
an OLS coeﬃcient βOLS ≈ βEndo and an RD (DRD) eﬀect βRD ≈ βExog

Appendix A: Model Discussion

A.1      Proof of Propositions 1

Before proving Proposition 1, we establish a useful lemma:

Lemma 1 (Selection and Observational Correlations). The observed diﬀerence in leave prob-

abilities by benefit type (Bi ) defined in (4) is bounded from above by the selection eﬀect defined
in (5). That is:
                                        βEndo ≤ βSelection                                   (A.1)

   The implication of Lemma 1 is that if we observe a positive correlation between the

probability of the leaving the firm and endogenous enrollment in the new benefit (i.e. βEndo >

0), then we can sign the selection eﬀect as positive (i.e. βSelection > 0). This result is
asymmetric, in that a negative correlation (i.e. βEndo ≤ 0) is not informative about the sign
of the selection eﬀect.

Proof.


              βEndo ≡ E [ Leavei | Bi = 1, Endog] − E [ Leavei | Bi = 0, Endog]

                      = Pr ( mi > φi | φi ≥ ci ) − Pr (mi > 0| φi < ci )

                      ≤ Pr (mi > 0| φi ≥ ci ) − Pr (mi > 0| φi < ci )

                      ≡ βSelection




where in the third line, we have used the fact that by assumption ci ≥ 0 and therefore
mi > φi ≥ ci ≥ 0. Thus, this eﬀect is bounded above by the selection eﬀect. It follows that
a necessary condition for observing a positive βEndo is a positive selection eﬀect.
   We now prove Proposition 1:



                                                37
Proof. First note that:


  βExog = E [ Leavei | Bi = 1, Exog] − E [ Leavei | Bi = 0, Exog]

         = Pr (mi > φi ) − Pr (mi > 0)

         = Pr (φi ≥ ci ) · Pr (mi > φi | φi ≥ ci ) + Pr (φi < ci ) · Pr (mi > φi | φi < ci )

             − Pr (φi ≥ ci ) · Pr (mi > 0| φi ≥ ci ) − Pr (φi < ci ) · Pr (mi > 0| φi < ci )

         = [1 − Pr (φi < ci )] · Pr (mi > φi | φi ≥ ci ) + Pr (φi < ci ) · Pr (mi > φi | φi < ci )

             − Pr (φi ≥ ci ) · Pr (mi > 0| φi ≥ ci ) − [1 − Pr (φi ≥ ci )] · Pr (mi > 0| φi < ci )

         = Pr ( mi > φi | φi ≥ ci ) − Pr (mi > 0| φi < ci )

             − Pr (φi ≥ ci ) · [Pr (mi > 0| φi ≥ ci ) − Pr (mi > 0| φi < ci )]

             − Pr (φi < ci ) · [Pr (mi > φi | φi ≥ ci ) − Pr (mi > φi | φi < ci )]

         = Pr ( mi > φi | φi ≥ ci ) − Pr (mi > 0| φi < ci )

             − [1 − Pr (φi < ci )] · [Pr (mi > 0| φi ≥ ci ) − Pr (mi > 0| φi < ci )]

             − Pr (φi < ci ) · [Pr (mi > φi | φi ≥ ci ) − Pr (mi > φi | φi < ci )]

         = Pr ( mi > φi | φi ≥ ci ) − Pr (mi > 0| φi < ci )

             − [Pr (mi > 0| φi ≥ ci ) − Pr (mi > 0| φi < ci )]

             − Pr (φi < ci ) · [Pr (mi > φi | φi ≥ ci ) − Pr (mi > 0| φi ≥ ci )]

             + Pr (φi < ci ) · [Pr (mi > φi | φi < ci ) − Pr (mi > 0| φi < ci )]

         = βEndo − βSelection − Pr (φi < ci ) · [β1 − β0 ] ,                                   (A.2)


where we have used the definitions of the treatment eﬀects for two subpopulations:


              β0 = Pr ( mi > φi | φi < ci ) − Pr (mi > 0| φi < ci )

                   = E [ Leavei | Bi = 1, φi < ci ] − E [ Leavei | Bi = 0, φi < ci ]

              β1 = Pr ( mi > φi | φi ≥ ci ) − Pr (mi > 0| φi ≥ ci )



                                                38
                       = E [ Leavei | Bi = 1, φi ≥ ci ] − E [ Leavei | Bi = 0, φi ≥ ci ]


These two parameters capture the eﬀect of exogenously switching from the old to the new
benefit on the probability of leaving, for those who would not choose the new benefit when
given the choice (β0 ) and those who would choose the new benefit when given the choice
(β1 ), respectively. Thus, the diﬀerence between βEndo and βExog gives:


                         βEndo − βExog = βSelection + Pr (φi < ci ) · [β1 − β0 ]


If the second term in brackets, [β1 − β0 ], is negative, then the results follows. We have focused
on two suﬃcient conditions for this term to be negative. First, note that if βExog > 0, then
we have:


                                 0 ≤ βExog

                                     = βEndo − βSelection − Pr (φi < ci ) · [β1 − β0 ]

                                     ≤ − Pr (φi < ci ) · [β1 − β0 ]

                 =⇒ [β1 − β0 ] ≤ 0


where in the third line we have used Lemma 1. Alternatively, we can just assume that

[β1 − β0 ] is negative. In either case, the result follows.

   The assumption that [β1 − β0 ] is negative will in general be true if the new benefit is less
likely to make those who would choose the benefit leave the firm than those would not choose
the benefit if given the choice. It makes sense that those for whom values of φi are high are
less likely to have mi > φi , which is how this condition is represented in our model. However,
this is not guaranteed to be negative and one could construct counter examples. When this
assumption is true, we have the result and a necessary condition for βEndo − βExog ≥ 0 is
that βSelection ≥ 0.


                                                    39
A.2     Allowing for a Direct Eﬀect of Benefit Enrollment on Mobility

In the previous section, we restricted the eﬀect of the new benefit on m to an eﬀect on
E [Vi (wi , Bi )]. We now show that an amended version of Proposition 1 still holds once this
restriction is relaxed. We now define a new “mobility” parameter, m̃, as the value of mobility,
net the switching cost
                             m̃i ≡ E [Vio (wio , Bio )] − E [Vi (wi , 0)] .

Furthermore, we now allow the employment switching cost to be a function of benefit enroll-
ment, Bi . Without loss of generality, we normalize the switching cost to zero in the absence

of the new benefit and define this new function η̃ (Bi ) as follows:


                                             η̃i ≡ Bi · ηi


   It follows that the net benefit of mobility is now:


                                           mi ≡ m̃i − η̃i ,


and the decision to leave is now made according to the following rule:
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                        1      if (φi + ηi ) · Bi < m̃i
                            Leavei =
                                        
                                        
                                        0      if (φi + ηi ) · Bi ≥ m̃i .


Heterogeneity is now captured by the quadruplet (φ, c, m̃, η). The incentive eﬀect is now
φ + η, and without any further restrictions on η, Lemma 1 no longer holds. In particular,
notice that the when ηi < 0, the benefit enrollment may increase the likelihood of leaving
the firm. This is the case, for example, when the new benefit does not have as demanding a
vesting a requirement. However, if we define the new treatment eﬀect on each subpopulation




                                                  40
as:


               β˜0 = E [ Leavei | Bi = 1, φi < ci ] − E [ Leavei | Bi = 0, φi < ci ]

                   = Pr ( mi > φi + ηi | φi < ci ) − Pr (mi > 0| φi < ci )

               β˜1 = E [ Leavei | Bi = 1, φi ≥ ci ] − E [ Leavei | Bi = 0, φi ≥ ci ]

                   = Pr ( mi > φi + ηi | φi ≥ ci ) − Pr (mi > 0| φi ≥ ci ) ,


the following, amended version of Proposition 1 is obtained:

Proposition 1a (Selection, Observational Correlations and Quasi-Experimental Estimates
with Direct Mobility Eﬀects). If exogenous benefit enrollment increases leave propensity by
more among those who would not have endogenously enroll relative to those who would have

enrolled (i.e. β˜0 ≥ β˜1 ), then the diﬀerence between the endogenous (Equation (4)) and
exogenous (Equation (6)) estimates is bounded from above by the selection eﬀect defined in

Equation (5). That is:
                                   βEndo − βExog ≤ βSelection

Proof. To prove this, we use the same steps as in (A.2) above. However, we substitute
mi > φi + ηi everywhere for the expression mi > φi . It then follows that:


               βExog = E [ Leavei | Bi = 1, Exog] − E [ Leavei | Bi = 0, Exog]

                       = Pr (mi > φi + ηi ) − Pr (mi > 0)
                                                             �          �
                       = βEndo − βSelection − Pr (φi < ci ) · β˜1 − β˜0


Rearranging terms, we again have:

                                                                  �        �
                     βEndo − βExog                                  ˜    ˜
                                     = βSelection + Pr (φi < ci ) · β1 − β0 ,


and the result follows.

                                                41
A.3     Deviation from Traditional Omitted Variable Bias Intuition

In our model, we arrive at the result that when comparing OLS to an exogenous estimate of
the treatment eﬀect, we only learn about unobservable diﬀerences in leave probabilities when
the exogenous eﬀect is more negative than the OLS estimate. A traditional omitted variable
bias calculation would suggest that the opposite observation would be equally informative

about the selection. However, this notion only holds when there is a constant treatment
eﬀect. We relax that assumption in our case. To illustrate this, consider a case where all
individuals have the same eﬀect of new benefit enrollment on the probability of leaving: β ∗ .
That is, the probability of leaving is characterized by the following equation:



                                      Leavei = β ∗ · Bi + εi

   The OLS regression of Leavei on Bi among employees who endogenously choose benefit
enrollment recovers the following:




               βEndo = E [ Leavei | Bi = 1, Endo] − E [ Leavei | Bi = 0, Endo]

                       = β ∗ + E [ εi | Bi = 1] − E [ εi | Bi = 0]


   On the other hand, the eﬀect of benefit enrollment when exogenously assigned recovers:




               βExog = E [ Leavei | Bi = 1, Exog] − E [ Leavei | Bi = 0, Exog]

                       = β∗


   Thus, comparing the OLS estimate to an estimate based on exogenous variation is infor-
mation about the selection eﬀect: E [ εi | Bi = 1]−E [ εi | Bi = 0]. In our case, however, we relax
the assumption of a constant treatment eﬀect. Assume that the eﬀect of benefit enrollment


                                                 42
on leaving for those that endogenously choose to enroll is β1 and the eﬀect among those that
do not enroll is β0 > β1 . This approximates our model above, where those who have a high
value of the benefit will experience a greater reduction in the probability of leaving when
enrolled. Now, the OLS estimate among employees who choose their enrollment recovers:


               βEndo = E [ Leavei | Bi = 1, Endo] − E [ Leavei | Bi = 0, Endo]

                      = β1 + E [ εi | Bi = 1, Endo] − E [ εi | Bi = 0, Endo]


On the other hand, an estimate of the eﬀect of benefit enrollment on leaving using exogenous

variation recovers:


               βExog = E [ Leavei | Bi = 1, Exog] − E [ Leavei | Bi = 0, Exog]

                      = πβ1 + (1 − π)β0


where π is the share of employees that would choose the benefit voluntarily, and (1 − π) is
the share of employees who would not enroll. Since we have assumed that β0 > β1 , it follows
that:

                                    β1 < πβ1 + (1 − π)β0

Thus, observing βEndo < βExog is consistent with a positive or negative selection eﬀect.
However, βEndo > βExog is only consistent with a positive selection eﬀect, i.e.


                       E [ εi | Bi = 1, Endo] − E [ εi | Bi = 0, Endo] > 0


The heterogeneity in treatment eﬀects, then, prevents us from relying on the traditional
intuition regarding omitted variable bias, and we can only sign the selection eﬀect when it
is positive enough to overcome the direct eﬀect of benefit enrollment on leaving.

Appendix B: Supplemental Results

B.1     Characterizing the Marginal DC Enrollee

Table B.1 attempts to look deeper into the DRD results from Table (4). Column (1) reports
the means of various observable characteristics among the sample of union employees in a 5-
year window around age 45 in 2002. The final characteristic, predicted leave, is an estimated

leave probability. Column (2) reports the mean characteristics among DC participants, and
Column (3) reports the estimated average characteristic of the “compliers” in the DRD
context. Here, we define compliers as those individuals who would not have enrolled in the
DC plan were it not for the fact that they were defaulted into the DC plan. We use a method
similar to Autor and Houseman (2005) to estimate the characteristics of the marginal DC

enrollee via a DRD. In all cases, the estimates are regression-adjusted for age.

   In general, we do not detect significant diﬀerences between the marginal DC enrollee and
the average employee in our sample, though our power is limited. The exception is that we
find that compliers are more likely to be White and less likely to be Hispanic.

     Note: Sample includes employees in 2002 and 1999-2002 samples. DC is instrumented for using the discontinuity in default pension plan type at the
     age of 45 in 2002 (i.e. “Treatment” is DC plan default). Exogenous, or incentive, eﬀect of DC plan on two- and three-year turnover outcomes is
     reported for fuzzy RD (columns 1 to 3) and two DRD analyses: by cohort (columns 4 to 6) and by age (columns 7 to 9). Demographic controls include
     gender, race, tenure dummies, department, hours worked per year and base pay rate. Standard errors are robust and clustered at the employee level.
     * Significantly diﬀerent at the 10% level; ** at the 5% level; *** at the 1% level.
