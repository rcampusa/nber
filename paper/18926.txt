                                              ABSTRACT

Regulatory entry barriers to hospital service markets, namely Certificate of Need (CON) regulations,
are enforced in many states; although no longer federally mandated, policy makers in other states are
considering reinstating CON policies in tandem with service expansions mandated under the Affordable
Care Act. While numerous studies have examined the impacts of CON on hospital volumes, demand
responses to actual hospital entry into local hospital markets are not well understood. In this paper,
we empirically examine the demand-augmenting, demand-redistribution, and risk-allocation effects
of hospital entry by studying the cardiac revascularization markets in Pennsylvania, a state in which
dynamic market entry occurred after repeal of CON in 1996. Our findings with respect to demand-augmentation
are mixed: we find robust evidence that high entrant market share mitigated the declining incidence
of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), but it had no significant effect on the rising trend in percutaneous
coronary intervention (PCI) procedures, among patients with coronary artery disease. Consequently,
incumbent hospitals experienced a decrease in the likelihood of PCI due to entry, thereby indicating
a shift in demand away from incumbents to entrants, namely business-stealing. Results of our analyses
further indicate that entry by new cardiac surgery centers tended to sort high-severity patients into
the more invasive CABG procedure and low-severity patients into the less invasive PCI procedures.
Thus, from a welfare perspective our results are mixed: on the one hand, free-entry may lead to improved
access rather than business stealing for CABG procedures; on the other hand, the empirical evidence
is in favor of business-stealing for PCI procedures. Moreover, free-entry improves the match between
underlying medical risk and treatment intensity. These findings underscore the importance of considering
market-level strategic responses by hospitals when regulatory barriers to entry are rescinded.

I.    Introduction

Regulatory entry barriers, while considered detrimental to market efficiency in most industries,

are widely used in health care. In particular, many states enforce Certificate of Need (CON)

regulation, whereby hospitals are required to obtain approval from a designated state agency

before installing additional capacity or prior to offering certain high cost services. Although a

Federal law which required all states to maintain CON regulation for cardiac care expired in 1986,

states were slow to deregulate the market. As recently as 2011, cardiac CON continued to be in

place in 26 states (AHPA, 2011). Moreover, new forms of quality monitoring recently introduced

under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) have rekindled interest in state-based regulation, with

several states currently reinstituting CON programs (Sharamitaro and Drew, 2011)1.

        Proponents of CON argue that regulation is needed to curtail overuse of technology-

intensive services, a phenomenon previously referred to as the medical “arms race” (Luft, 1986).

Furthermore, proponents theorized that entry barriers promote higher quality and help to rein in

costs by maintaining higher-volume clinical programs with established expertise. Opponents

make the more traditional argument that entry barriers protect inefficient producers by shielding

them from competition. In a joint report the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of

Justice (2008) noted that “existing competitors have exploited the CON process to thwart or delay

new competition to protect their own supra-competitive revenues.”2

        Previous research attempted to shed light on the policy debate by evaluating impacts in

states that kept or dropped CON regulation. Focusing on health outcomes associated with major

cardiac procedures, notably mortality, Ho et al. (2009) and Popescu, Vaughan-Sarrazin, and

Rosenthal (2006), find small or no difference between the groups of states. Another study by Ho

for a number of medical conditions, notably heart attacks, and a requirement that hospitals meet community
needs assessment criteria to maintain their tax-exempt status.

(2006) uses simulation methods to identify difference in treatment costs between CON and non-

CON states, finding that CON was associated with relatively small reductions in costs. Turning to

volume effects, Popescu et al. find significantly lower use rates in states with CON, while Ho

(2006) found no significant difference in the statewide procedure volume between states with and

without CON. Using a difference in difference approach, Ho et al. (2009) found that the number

of hospitals performing cardiac revascularization rose in states that repealed CON, coupled by

offsetting decreases in average hospital volume in these states.

         While studies focusing on the impact of discrete policy events are important, they do not

necessarily capture heterogeneity within states that are targeted by the intervention. In this study

we focus on understanding volume effects more deeply, taking within-state heterogeneity into

account. In particular, we seek to empirically explain responses to actual hospital entry into local

cardiac markets as they occurred in the aftermath of CON repeal, differentiating between

incumbent hospitals and all other market participants combined. To implement this approach, we

focus on Pennsylvania, a state in which dynamic market entry occurred after repeal of CON in

1996, allowing us to observe the distribution of low and high entry rates both longitudinally and

across small market areas. For similar reasons Pennsylvania was also used as the case study by

Cutler et al. (2010) in their empirical study of CON regulation affecting cardiac surgeons.3

Additionally, we adopt an interrupted time series design to account for discontinuity in trends

before and after repeal of CON (Finkelstein, 2007). Following much of the literature cited in this

paper we focus on two major cardiac procedures, jointly referred to as cardiac “revascularization”,

namely coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) 4 and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)5,



3
  Cutler et al. point out that facing with a highly inelastic supply of cardiac surgeons, entrant hospitals are
more likely to contract with higher-quality cardiac surgeons, which in turn leads to a welfare-enhancing
redistribution of patients from lower-quality to higher-quality surgeons. Empirically, they show that top-
performing cardiac surgeons received increased CABG volume following the entry of new CABG hospitals.
4
  CABG is a surgical procedure which involves surgically isolating a section of a vein or artery and grafting
it to create a bypass of blockage in the coronary artery. It was developed in the late 1960s and entered
mainstream use in the United States during the 1970s, largely performed on patients whose indications
represent a significant risk of heart attack.

                                                      3
which are relatively common and well identifiable in administered databases. Specifically, we

explore how entrants’ market shares affect the likelihood of undergoing the more intensive

CABG and the relatively less intensive PCI for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), as

well as the likelihood of encountering these treatments at incumbent hospitals before and after

deregulation.

          By focusing on shifts in patient volume, we are able to further hone in on strategic

responses related to the distribution of patients by levels of risk and illness severity. While

previous research has explored this issue of risk allocation in the context of hospital competition

in general (Capps, Dranove, Satterthwaite, 2003; Kessler and Geppert, 2005)6, the allocation of

low risk versus high risk patients has not been previously studied in relation to either CON

regulation or market entry specifically. This latter analysis, which we implement, carries certain

welfare implications as well: from the patient’s perspective, does resorting after market entry lead

to appropriate intensity of care? From the hospital perspective, do entrants exhibit “business

stealing” behavior (e.g., Mankiw and Whinston, 1986; Bresnahan and Reiss, 1990, 1991), such

that incumbents are left with a greater proportion of high-risk patients in the post-deregulation

period?

          Thus, our analysis complements and extends previous studies by exploring the interaction

of CON deregulation and the degree of market entry. Moreover, unlike previous studies of CON,

we focus on changes in patient volume at the level of local markets, rather than hospital averages.

Furthermore, we analyze the reallocation of patients based on severity, among incumbents and

  The PCI procedure involves only a small incision through which a balloon-tipped catheter is threaded and
inflated within the coronary artery to improve the blood supply. PCI is less invasive compared to CABG,
and more often performed on patients with relatively mild CAD. PCI was formerly labeled PTCA, and
more commonly referred to as angioplasty.
6
  Capps et al. note that low risk and high risk patients differ in their valuations of health care, leading them
to differ in their willingness to switch to competitors; Kessler and Geppert show that clinically appropriate
sorting of low risk and high risk patients into low intensity and high intensity hospital treatments is
enhanced when markets are locally competitive.

other hospitals, and between high-intensity (CABG) and low intensity procedures (PCI), thereby

shedding light on an issue not previously considered.

        The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section II lays out the main hypotheses to be

tested, and provides a related review of the literature. Section III discusses the market for cardiac

care in Pennsylvania, and provides background behind CON laws in that state. Section IV

describes the data and presents summary statistics. Section V describes the empirical models for

identifying the effects of entry on patient allocation, while controlling for prior trends. Section VI

presents the empirical results, showing that they are robust to alternative specifications. Section

VII concludes.

II.   Main Issues and Related Literature

        In the previous section we noted prior literature on the effects of CON which relied on

between-state comparisons to identify changes in volume and aggregate demand. A separate

strain of the literature has focused on strategic responses to market entry by new health care

providers, independently of CON. Yet few studies have explored market reactions to free entry

specifically in the aftermath of CON deregulation. In this study, we aim to fill the gap, thereby

combining and extending both research themes. Below we survey the literature on entry in

relation to the main hypotheses to be tested in our empirical analysis. We label these hypotheses

as the demand augmenting effect, the demand redistribution effect, and define two variants of

patients risk allocation effects, first by type of hospital, and second by treatment intensity:

      1.     Demand-augmenting Effect – Previous studies have shown that market entry by

hospitals and other health care centers can lead to higher volume. For instance, using the

structure-conduct-performance (SCP) framework developed by Bresnahan and Reiss7, Abraham


7
  Bresnahan and Reiss (1990, 1991) model firms’ entry decision as the equilibrium outcome of a discrete
game played between potential entrants. The general entry condition suggests that as intensified
competition shrinks profit margin, entrants need a larger population to generate enough revenue to cover
fixed entry costs. Thus examining the relationship between the number of firms and the market size allows
the authors to determine whether additional firms generate additional revenue or just steal business from
incumbent rival firms.

                                                    5
et al. (2007) presented evidence that hospital entry substantially expands market demand and

tightens competition. Similarly, Mitchell (2007) found substantial increases in utilization rates

following the entry of specialty hospitals, even after controlling for area specific effects. While it

is difficult to empirically distinguish between volume increases that occur due to entrants’

response to unmet needs (pent up demand) and volume increases representing creation of new

demand by entrants (inducement), anecdotal evidence suggests that inducement may have been

the culprit. For instance, Burns et al. (2009) found that the rapid growth in Arizona’s cardiac

surgery volume, which was accompanied by entry, exceeded population growth and aging trends.

In this paper we do not attempt to enter the debate over inducement. Rather, we are initially

interested in describing trends in the aggregate demand for CABG and PCI, and their association

with market entry, in order to establish the potential for strategic behavior as described below8.

Note that while the above studies provide evidence on the aggregate demand response to entry,

they do not explain how entry affects treatment choices and patients’ redistribution.

              2. Demand-redistribution Effect (business stealing) — Entry that shifts demand from

incumbent firms to entrants is generally referred to as “business-stealing” (Mankiw and Whinston,

1986; Bresnahan and Reiss, 1990, 1991). In our context, entrants (namely new cardiac surgery

centers) may attract patients from incumbent hospitals rather than augment existing demand.

Prior studies examining volume shifts in response to hospital entry are sparse. However,

Huckman (2006) examines shifts in the volume of cardiac care from acquired hospitals to

acquiring hospitals, using small area market shares and concludes that acquirers benefited from

business stealing. Dafny (2005) has shown that incumbent hospitals strategically increase their

own volume in order to deter potential entry into high-end cardiac treatments, suggesting that the



8
  Mankiw and Whinston (1986) note that when entry causes a sufficient rise in the aggregate demand so
that incumbent firms’ demand is not affected (no business-stealing effect), free entry will create net social
benefits through newly created demand. In health care markets, however, asymmetric information between
providers and patients, may induce demand beyond optimal treatment levels, so that the additional demand
may not be welfare enhancing.

                                                      6
perceived threat of business stealing is pervasive in these markets9. Given that incumbent market

share is necessarily reduced when new firms enter the market10, in this study we are able to infer

business stealing effects from changes in the likelihood of receiving cardiac treatment at

incumbent hospitals associated with entry into an incumbent’s local market area. We base our

analysis on patient level regressions, which allows for detailed risk adjustment using the patient’s

clinical characteristics while incorporating market-level variables, notably the share of entrants in

treatment volume within the local market area. Predicted entrant market share is constructed

using a method used by Kessler and McClellan (2000) (see Appendix).

       3. Risk-allocation Effect (Patient sorting) – refers to the allocation of high risk patients and

low risk patients into incumbent hospitals versus entrant hospitals. To the extent business stealing

is found, its effects may be more harmful from the perspective of incumbents if for a given

medical condition, relatively healthy patients (“low-risk”) are drawn away by entrant hospitals

while sicker patients (“high-risk”) remain with incumbents. Rephrasing, we ask whether entrants

exhibit business stealing behavior such that incumbents are left with a greater proportion of high-

risk patients following deregulation11.

        Previous studies found evidence that specialty cardiac hospitals tend to serve relatively

healthier patients than general hospitals (Barro et al., 2006; Cram et al., 2005) and tend to enter

markets in which cardiac patients are healthier to begin with (Barro et al., 2006). However, given

their interest in specialty hospital reimbursement issues, these studies took a narrow view of


9
   Ellison and Ellison (2011) find similar results in the case of the pharmaceutical industry, where
investment in research and development in established product lines acts as a deterrent for potential entry
by new drug developers.
10
   As an illustrative example, let ∆     ∆       ∆ , where ∆ , ∆ , and ∆ denote the change in total
demand, change in incumbent demand, and change in entrant demand, respectively. Assume that the
baseline market volume was 100, and that following entry, ∆           10, ∆    0, and ∆        10. In this case,
even though the incumbent share declines from 1 to 0.91(=100/110), there is no business stealing, because
the entrant obtains its market share through creating new demand.
11
   Note that under the Medicare Prospective Payment System (PPS) hospitals receive a fixed payment for a
given diagnosis with minimal compensation for outlier costs; for the most part, private insurers also use
PPS or similar fixed-price reimbursement methods that do not provide for full risk adjustment (Capps and
Dranove, 2004). Thus, high risk patients are also less profitable for the hospital.


                                                       7
market entry and did not consider broader entry due to openings of new cardiac centers within

established general hospitals. In addition, these studies did not model the interaction between

entrant share and patient “riskiness”, which would allow one to explore the degree to which

business stealing by entrants correlates with risk. In this paper, we seek to address both of these

issues by focusing on Pennsylvania, where all cardiac surgery centers were affiliated with general

hospitals during our sample period, and by incorporating the interaction patient risk and entrant

share in patient-level analyses of the likelihood of receiving cardiac surgeries at incumbent

hospitals. The manner in which we interact the low-risk and high-risk patient designations with

entry share categories is analogous to Kessler and Geppert (2005) who examined the effects of

hospital competition and patient risk on hospital expenditures for Medicare patients with heart

attacks. Their results showed that competition led to increased variation in risk-based inpatient

expenditures, suggesting that contrary to standard oligopoly theory, competition leads to greater

product differentiation in the special case of hospital care12.

       More generally, we are interested in knowing the extent to which observed changes in

demand are actually related to the repeal of CON, rather than a reflection in long-term trends that

may be unrelated to policy changes. Nationally, the rate for CABG (the high intensity procedure)

steadily declined during the past decade while the rate for PCI (the low intensity procedure) has

remained stable (Epstein et al., 2011). Previous studies noted the introduction and diffusion of

stent coronary angioplasty (one type of PCI) in the mid-1990s contributed to the declining rate of

CABG by shifting many patients from CABG to PCI (Cutler and Huckman 2003; Epstein et al.

2011). However, recent clinical trials indicate that CABG remains the treatment of choice for


12
   Although Kessler and Geppert do not discuss this, Hotelling’s (1929) duopoly model of spatial location
serves as the basis for this hypothesis. The standard Hotelling model predicts that competition leads the two
firms to move towards the center in a linear market, a result that is referred to as the “principle of minimum
differentiation”. Accordingly, market entry would not change the level of specialty or risk differentiation
by hospitals. However, applying the Hotelling model to the unique circumstances of the hospital industry,
Calem and Rizzo (1995) and Brekke et al. (2006) show that when prices are regulated, there is an incentive
for hospitals to move further apart on the service mix space in order to dampen the quality competition.


                                                      8
patients with severe coronary arterial disease as it achieves better health outcomes than PCI

(Serruys et al., 2009). Given the longitudinal nature of our data from Pennsylvania, one concern

is that our estimates of demand augmentation may reflect a general time trend in cardiac

treatment rates that began prior to the repeal of CON, which may confound our estimates of the

trend due to CON and related effects of post-deregulation entry. To address this concern, we

adopt a differences-in-trend design akin to that found in Finkelstein’s (2007) study on the effects

of Medicare’s introduction.

III. Pennsylvania’s Cardiac Care Market and CON Regulation

        With the repeal of CON laws in several states following a change in Federal law dating

back to 1986, hospitals have faced opposing incentives for entering newly opened markets for

cardiac services. On the one hand, cardiovascular disease is a highly prevalent condition in the

population and a potentially large source of revenues, currently accounting for about a third of

inpatient revenues nationally. On the other hand, entry costs into this market may be prohibitively

high, with an initial investment in a new revascularization centers reportedly ranging from $12 to

$14 million (Robinson et al. 2001; Huckman 2006). Therefore, high entry costs may dampen the

effects of deregulation in this market. Although a number of studies examined aggregate changes

in volume due to the repeal of CON regulations13, the issue of strategic responses by hospitals to

entry that ensued deregulation has not been fully explored. Pennsylvania, a state in which

dynamic entry occurred following its repeal of CON, provides a useful test case (Longwell, 2011).

Pennsylvania repealed its comprehensive state CON program in December 1996, thereby

allowing hospitals to provide new services, including cardiac surgeries, without having to obtain

permission from the state’s regulators. Recently however, public interest in the state’s CON




13
  For instance, Ho et al. (2009) found that while the number of hospitals performing cardiac
revascularization rose in states that repealed CON between 1989 and 2002, overall volume in these states
remained essentially unchanged due to offsetting decreases in average hospital volume.

                                                    9
program has been rekindled, and legislative attempts to reinstate the program are currently

underway.14

        Figure 1 illustrates the striking increase in the number of cardiac surgery centers after the

1996 repeal of CON relative to the pre-policy trend. Five centers, all of whom were located in

general hospitals, entered the market immediately after the repeal, consequently increasing the

total number of providers from 43 to 48. By 2004, there were a total of 28 post-CON new entrants,

accounting for 41% of all hospitals providing cardiac revascularization in Pennsylvania.15 The

majority of entry occurred in urban or suburban areas. All cardiac surgery centers in Pennsylvania

were affiliated with general acute hospitals rather than cardiac specialty hospitals.

        Figure 2 shows the type of procedures provided by new entrants since the 1996 repeal of

CON. A hospital is considered to be a participant in the market for CABG in a particular year if it

performed at least 5 CABGs in that year (Magid et al, 2007, Nallamothu et al, 2007).16 The same

threshold is used to identify PCI hospitals. Although PCIs are less invasive than CABGs, and are

performed in catheterization laboratories instead of operating rooms, hospitals performing PCIs

are required to have on-site surgical backup in case an emergency CABG is needed following a

failed PCI. For this reason, all participating hospitals in Pennsylvania had provided both types of

procedures before the 2000s. However, as PCI became nationally more diffused in the mid-1990s,

some of the new entrants began specializing in PCI only. As shown in Figure 2, only one of the

six new entrants during 2003 and 2004 was providing both procedures; the other five were

providing only PCI procedures. This trend suggests that the cardiac revascularization markets in

Pennsylvania may be evolving toward a greater degree of treatment specialization following the

IV. Data and Sample

          This study uses longitudinal inpatient records of all CAD patients who reside in

Pennsylvania from 1995 through 2004 to investigate the effects of free entry in cardiac

revascularization markets. The data is collected by the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost

Containment Council (PHC4), and provides a wide range of patient clinical and utilization

information including diagnosis/procedure codes, admission type and source, discharge status,

and charges. It also includes patient demographic information such as age, gender, race, insurance

type, and zip code of residence. A unique patient identifier allows us to track each individual’s in-

hospital records over time.

          The PHC4 also records patient’s illness severity using the MediQual score, which is

calculated based on patient characteristics and key clinical variables abstracted from admission

medical records including vital signs, other physical findings, historical factors, and radiographic

and laboratory findings (Lezzoni and Moskowtiz, 1988). This severity measure ranges from 0 to 4,

with 4 being the most severe. The MediQual score captures not only acute symptoms, but also

long-term conditions that may affect the patient’s baseline health status.

          The second source of data for this study is the American Hospital Association (AHA)

Annual Survey of Hospitals. Each admission record in the PHC4 data is associated with a unique

facility identifier, which enables us to link it to comprehensive facility characteristics in the AHA

data, including location (longitude and latitude), bed capacity, teaching status, ownership, and

system member status.

          Our study sample includes Pennsylvania residents who were admitted to any hospital in

the state with a new diagnosis of CAD17 between 1995 and 2004. During the sample period, a

total of 1,112,777 patients were hospitalized due to CAD. Excluding those who were hospitalized

     Diagnosis codes for CAD: ICD-9-CM 410x-414x.

for the same diagnosis in the previous year, and repeated admission records within the same

quarter, the final sample contains 714,088 CAD patients.

         The analysis centers on two outcomes: an individual’s incidence of CABG or PCI18

procedure within a three month period (a quarter) after admission for CAD; and the incidence of

CABG or PCI procedure at any incumbent hospital within one quarter after admission for CAD.

The first outcome is used to assess the response of per-patient demand for procedure to the entry

of new cardiac surgery centers. The second outcome is used to identify how patient flow is

redistributed from existing centers to new centers following entry. Table 1 presents the summary

statistics of procedure incidences and surgical outcomes by patient severity. Patients with

MediQual scores greater than or equal to 2 are identified as high-severity. More than half of

hospitalized CAD patients in the study period received either a CABG or PCI procedure within 3

months after admission. Without adjusting for age, gender, and other individual factors, the low-

severity patients were more likely to undergo CABG and PCI procedures than the high-severity

patients.

         Figure 3 contrasts the trends of 3-month CABG and PCI rates between1995 and 2004,

which are further divided into trends in markets where entry occurred versus markets where entry

never occurred. These rates are expressed as the number of procedures per 1,000 new CAD

patients in the study sample, and markets are defined as Hospital Service Area (HSA)19. As

shown in Figure 3, markets that experienced entry had higher rates of CABG and PCI than

markets that did not experience entry both before and after the 1996 CON repeal. Nevertheless,

the average CABG rate gradually declined since 1997, despite the continuing entry of new

surgery centers in these markets. In contrast, PCI diffused rapidly in both entry and no-entry

   HSAs are groups of zip codes whose residents receive most of their hospitalizations from the hospitals in
that area. There are 127 HSAs in Pennsylvania. Our market definition differs from Cutler et al. (2010),
which used Hospital Referral Regions (HRRs). The use of HRRs can create measurement error of entrant
market share because 7 out of 21 HRRs include areas of neighboring states, where we do not observe
patient flows. Therefore, we use smaller geographic markets, the HSAs, to mitigate the boundary problem.

markets, mirroring national trends that occurred with the introduction of stent technology during

the mid-1990s (Epstein et al., 2011).

         However, taken by itself Figure 3 does not necessarily provide evidence that free entry in

the post-CON period explains the shifts in revascularization rates, since it does not distinguish

between market effects and temporal effects due to technological change. Moreover, Figure 3

does not distinguish between market areas with different concentrations of entrants at different

time points in time. To identify these effects we implement the empirical analysis described

below.

V.     Empirical Framework

V.A. General Specification

         It is hypothesized that the entry of new cardiac surgery centers may lead to both demand-

augmenting and business-stealing effects in the aftermath of the repeal of CON. To test for the

demand-augmenting effect, we estimate changes in CABG and PCI incidences in local area

where new entrants had a larger market share, relative to areas where they had low market share

following the repeal of CON. Using the sample of first-time CAD patients, we estimate two

alternative specifications of the regression model, (1a) and (1b). The more parsimonious equation

(1a) captures the average effect of entry, similar to the baseline model in Barro et al.’s (2006)

study of cardiac specialty hospitals20. Equation (1b) incorporates area-specific pre-existing trends

to allow for identification of area trends attributable to CON deregulation. Finkelstein (2007) uses

an analogous model in her study of Medicare implementation, referring to it as “differences-in-

trend”.21 We specify both models as follows:


20
   While highly related to our study, Barro et al’s analysis of entry into the CABG and PTCA markets
focused more narrowly on specialty hospitals; they do not consider entry by general hospitals who open
new revascularization centers. According to these authors only five specialty hospitals entered these
markets nationally during their study period of 1996-1999. Their results showed that specialty hospitals
tended to enter market area with a healthier mix of patients, thereby incurring lower costs.
21
   In our special case entrant market share forms the local impact variable to be interacted with trend. In
Finkelstein’s case, the time interacted impact variable is the percent of elderly individuals in a region

                                                              ∙             ∙
                                                                                                           (1b)
                                  ,




where the dependent variable          equals one if patient from market         admitted to hospital           at

time received CABG or PCI procedure within a period one quarter after admission to a hospital

for CAD;             are market fixed effects;              are year fixed effects,       is a vector of

patient characteristics,     is a vector that controls for characteristics of the admitting hospital,

and        is an error term. Standard errors are clustered by market area to account for any within-

area correlation.

        In both models,     is the policy parameter of interest. In equation (1a), the corresponding

variable of interest is defined as     ∙       , the interaction between the market share of new

cardiac surgery centers in market k at time t and an indicator variable that equals 1 for years after

the repeal of CON (t=1997 … 2004). This interaction measures the extent to which area k is

exposed to entrants’ market power at time t during the post-policy period. Thus the coefficient

identifies the difference in per-patient demand for revascularization procedures in areas where

entrant market share is relatively high. A positive       implies that entry of new surgery centers

expands market demand for CABG or PCI procedure by CAD patients. If                   is zero, the total

demand for CABG or PCI does not increase following the entry.

        While informative about average entry effects, the parsimonious model                  may reflect a

general time trend in procedure rates that began prior to the repeal of CON in 1996, independent

of the policy itself (by definition, entrant share equals zero for all markets until 1997). To address

without private insurance in 1963, the year in which Medicare was introduced. Thus in our case, the impact
variable varies longitudinally as well as across areas.

                                                   14
this concern, equation (1b) imposes a area-specific linear trend [                 ∙ ]22 and allows for a

shift in trend after the repeal of CON that varies with the entrants market share              ∙     .

Here, the coefficient     indicates the differential shift from pre-existing trends experienced by

markets with higher entrant share relative to markets with zero entrant share.

           Next, we attempt to identify business stealing behavior. Accordingly, new cardiac

surgery centers have an incentive to draw patients away from existing hospitals even if total

demand has expanded. To test for this effect, we simply re-estimate equations (1a) and (1b), by

replacing the previous dependent variable with a binary variable that equals one if the patient

received CABG or PCI procedure at any incumbent hospitals within one quarter of admission for

CAD (          ). Thus we estimate:




                                                        ∙                                  ,             (2a)


                                                                 ∙             ∙
                                                                                                         (2b)
                                  .




            If higher entrant market share leads, on average, to a decrease in patient demand at

incumbent hospitals, then a negative value for coefficient           would be expected. On the other hand,

if entrant hospitals create new demand from the potential pool of patients such that the incumbent

hospitals’ demand is not reduced, we would expect            to approximately equal zero. A positive

may reflect either a spillover of demand-augmentation from entrant hospitals to all hospitals, or

strategic behavior on the part of incumbent hospitals whereby they increase procedure volume in

order to deter further entry (Dafny, 2005).

           All of the models we estimate include patient characteristics and hospital traits.

omitted group), race (White, Black, Asian; omitted group is other races), gender, urban residence,

MediQual severity score (1, 2, 3, and 4; omitted group is 0), admission status (emergency

admission and transferred admission), insurance type (Medicare and Medicaid) and major clinical

indications at admission (cardiogenic shock, hypertension, dialysis, heart failure, renal failure,

and acute myocardial infarction). We also include in         a continuous variable for the annual

percentage of HMO enrollees in the patient’s county of residence, in order to control for the

potential impact of HMO penetration on procedure use (Town and Vistnes 2001; Miller and Luft

1997).23

           The vector     includes the indicator variables for the hospital’s bed capacity (200 beds

to 400 beds and >400 beds; omitted group is <200 beds), teaching status , whether it is not-for-

profit, and whether it belongs to a health care system. In addition, the literature on volume-

outcome relationship suggests that hospitals with a higher volume of a particular surgical

procedure tend to achieve better patient outcomes (Birkmeyer et al. 2002; Halm et al. 2002;

Shanhian and Normand 2003)24. To control for volume effects, the vector             also includes two

indicators of high-volume CABG hospital and PCI hospital, based on the number of cases

performed at the hospital in the previous year. The cut-off values are 200 cases for CABG and

400 cases for PCI, following the recommendation by the ACC/AHA guidelines (Smith et al.,

2001). Descriptive statistics for patient and hospital characteristics are reported in Table A-1 of

the Appendix.

           Finally, we estimate the extent to which the effect of entry on utilization and business

varies with patient risk. In particular, we hypothesized that business stealing would be more

concentrated among low risk patients, both because they are potentially more profitable from the

   To further test the potential confounding influence of HMOs on procedure use, we repeat the analyses on
the Medicare sample only. See Section VI.B. for details.
24
   Economists have questioned whether such volume effects should be taken as evidence of “learning-by-
doing” or quality. For instance, Gaynor et al. (2005) suggest that economies of scale and selection of low
risk patients explain better outcomes at high-volume hospitals.

                                                   16
perspective of the hospital, and because low risk-patients are more likely to value entrants as

acceptable substitutes for established providers (Capps et al., 2003). To test this hypothesis, we

estimate another variant of the above equations, allowing for heterogeneous demand responses of

high-severity versus low-severity patients. Specifically, focusing on the full interrupted time

series design from equations (1b) and (2b), we add interactions between a patient’s on-admission

illness severity and the post-trend as follows:




                                                        ∙                    0 ∙      ∙
                                                                                                        (3)
                        1 ∙     ∙                             ∙                                 ,




where      ∙ is an indicator function,    equals 0 if the patient’s MediQual severity score is below

2, and       equals 1 if the patient’s MediQual severity score is equal to or greater than 2. To

control for any systematic shift in procedure incidences for the two patient groups in the post-

policy period, we include an interaction between the illness-severity indicators and                .

Coefficients      and    separately capture the effects of entry on low- and high-severity patients.

In the demand-augmenting analysis, a difference in the magnitudes of estimated            and

provides evidence that hospitals selectively expand treatment among patients with different levels

of illness severity. In the business-stealing analysis, the       estimate is expected to be smaller than

   because relatively healthier patients are likely to be disproportionately attracted from

incumbent centers to new cardiac surgery centers.

V.B. Robustness to Alternative Specifications

         To check the robustness of our main results, we reestimated equation (3) in several ways,

each time using an alternative definition of a key variable. Among these are an alternative

classification of incumbent and entrant hospitals, two alternative measures of patient severity


                                                   17
groupings other than the severity measure previously described, the addition of a supply-side

variable (surgeons), and finally a reestimation using Medicare patient sample. Further detail is

provided in section VI along with a brief discussion of the results.

V.C. Measuring Entrants’ Market Share

      One issue we have not yet addressed in relation to the patient-level equations (1) - (3) is

our definition of market share. Entrant’s market share is the aggregate of patient-level

probabilities of treatment at entry hospitals in the market area. There are two ways to assign

market share to each patient. One is based on where the patient was admitted, and the other is

based on where the patient lives. The former is susceptible to endogeneity bias because the

patient’s choice of hospital may depend on unobservable factors that correlate with the patient

treatment decision. For instance, patients with unobservablely high valuations of cutting-edge

care may prefer to be admitted to teaching hospitals located in urban areas where entrant share is

higher. To address this, we define market share by the patient’s area of residence.

      Even so, measuring entrant share with actual treatment volume can lead to bias because

hospitals’ investment in new capacity, e.g. entry, is guided by potential demand and revenue in

the relevant market (Wedig et al. 1989; Chernew et al. 2002; Dafny 2005). Although the use of

area fixed effects may alleviate this concern, the potential for unobserved heterogeneity remains.

To address this, we construct predicted hospital choice equations using the method by Kessler

and McClellan (2000) and Gowrisankaran and Town (2003), whereby exogenous distances to

hospitals in the patient’s geographic area enter as instrumental variables. Further, following

Kessler and McClellan (2000), we estimate hospital choice separately for CABG and PCI, and as

noted above, sum up the probabilities of treatment at entrants by patient location rather than

hospital location to obtain shares. The full estimation method is described in the Appendix.

      Table 2 shows how entrant shares in CABG and PCI markets have changed during the free-

entry period. As measured by predicted patient demands, the average CABG entrant share across



                                                 18
all HSAs increased from 3.2% to 29.6%, and the PCI entrant share increased from 3.5% to 33.1%,

from 1997 to 2004. The actual entrant market shares are slightly smaller than the predicted

entrant market shares, meaning that patients are more likely to choose entrant hospitals if their

decisions are based only on exogenous factors. By either measure, the entrant share distributions

are highly skewed to the right, with more than half of the markets having extremely small entrant

share.

         To deal with the possibly non-linear relationship between entrant share and outcome

variables, we categorize markets into zero-, low-, and high-entrant share groups. The reference

group is zero-entrant share group, which contains all markets in 1995-96 and most markets in

1997-98. The markets with non-zero entrant shares are divided into two groups with the median

entrant share value as the cutoff; this is roughly 12 percent and 14 percent for CABG and PCI

markets, respectively. In the CAD patients sample, approximately 28%, 37%, and 35% of all

patients fall into each category.

VI. Results

VI.A. Main Results

          Table 3 reports the results of eight sets of logistic regressions where the dependent

variables is the individual’s likelihood of having CABG (PCI) at any hospital (demand-

augmenting), and at any incumbent hospital (business-stealing), within three months of being

diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD). Coefficient estimates are converted to represent

percentage changes in the value of the dependent variables.

          Panel A shows the estimates of coefficients ′ on the interaction term         ∙         in

our parsimonious specifications in equations (1a) and (2a). Results in columns (1) and (2) of

Panel A suggest that while entry with low entrant share did not have a significant impact on the

incidence of revascularization, entry with high entrant share was associated with significantly

higher CABG and PCI incidences after the CON repeal. Columns (3) and (4) suggest that for both


                                                  19
procedures, there was a concomitant business-stealing effect with the incidence of

revascularization declining significantly at incumbent hospitals in high entrant share areas.

        Panel B estimates equations (1b) and (2b), which control for the differential growth of

procedure rates in across HSAs before the policy took effect. We again find a significant demand-

augmenting effect on CABG, while such effect on PCI appears to be absorbed by the area-

specific time-trends. In column (1), the   coefficients imply a 0.3 and 0.4 percentage point

change in the likelihood of receiving CABG, for low and high entrant share markets, respectively.

Transformed into odds ratios, these estimates suggest that on average, in the post policy period

CAD patients in markets with low and high entrant shares were respectively 7.6 to 10.9 percent

more likely to undergo CABG, compared with patients in zero-entrant share markets. Consistent

with Panel A, results in column (3) show that patients located in areas with higher entrant shares

were less likely to receive CABG at incumbent hospitals compared to patients in zero entrant

share markets, although the size of the effect was small and statistically insignificant. Lastly, the

significantly negative estimates of   coefficients in column (4) indicate that market entry led to a

sizable business-stealing effect in the PCI markets. The corresponding odds ratios suggest that on

average, incumbent hospitals lost 9.9 to 14.1 percent of their PCI patients as a consequence of

business-stealing.

        Using estimates from equations (1b) and (2b), we calculate the regression-adjusted

probability of receiving cardiac revascularization procedures, and plot the time-series of the

average regression-adjusted procedure rates in Figures 4 and 5. For each procedure, we separately

plot the trends for areas with zero entrant share and for areas with non-zero (low and high) entrant

share. By definition, entrant share equals zero in all market areas prior to 1997. Figure 4 shows

that the average CABG rate in areas with zero entrant share declined steadily between 1997 and

2004. In contrast, the average CABG rate in areas with low and high entrant share followed the

pre-CON trend rising until 2000, but then declined at a slower rate than areas with zero entrant

share. In figure 5, while the average PCI rate showed an upward trend in both types of markets, it

                                                  20
increased slightly more rapidly in areas with low and high entrant share, especially toward the

end of the sample period. These time-series plots provide further evidence of demand-augmenting

effects associated with market entry.

        Table 4 reports the estimation results from equation (3), which investigates the extent to

which entry had different impacts on low- and high-severity patients. Overall, high-severity

patients are more likely to receive CABG, and less likely to receive PCI, than low-severity

patients. Comparing the estimated coefficients        and     in the first two columns, we find that the

expansion of CABG procedures mainly targeted sicker patients, while healthier patients may have

experienced a modestly higher incidence of PCI following entry. Specifically, entry led to a

sizable increase of 1.8 - 3.4 percentage points (Column 1) in the likelihood of CABG procedures

(∆odds ratio = 11.6 – 23.8 percent) among high-severity patients, and an increase of 1.1

percentage points (Column 2) in the likelihood of PCI procedures (∆odds ratio = 6.7 percent)

among low-severity patients, during the post-policy period.

        Results in Column (3) show that entrant share had a positive impact on high-severity

patients, and a negative impact on low-severity patients, in their likelihood of receiving CABG at

incumbent hospitals. These estimates suggest that low-severity patients tended to be shifted away

from incumbents to new surgery centers. As shown in column (4), while entry had a negative

effect on incumbents’ volume of low-severity as well as high-severity PCI patients, such effect

was relatively larger among low-severity patients.25 Therefore, we conclude that the estimates in

columns (3) and (4) support the risk-allocation hypothesis, which predicts that new surgery

centers are likely to attract disproportionately more low-severity patients from incumbent

hospitals.

VI.B. Alternative Specifications



25
   Interpreted as changes in odds ratio, the estimated coefficients in Column (4) represent a decreased
likelihood of undergoing PCI at incumbent hospitals by 11 – 17.3 percent for low-severity patients, and
13.4 – 13.7 percent for high-severity patients in non-zero entrant share markets.

                                                    21
        To examine the stability of the main effects (the γ coefficients), we changed the definition

of entrants from cardiac surgery centers to those that were “in the market” for only three years or

less as of the repeal of CON in 1996; concomitantly, entrants with more than three consecutive

years of market presence as of 1997 were reassigned as incumbents. Switching to the 3-year

definition caused the number of entrants in the data to fall from 28 to 13 in 2004; the new

threshold for high entrant share is roughly 4 percent compared with 12 percent under the original

definition. This repeated analysis also provides answers to additional questions of interest.

Previously, identification came from variation in the “cumulative” entrant market share within

markets. To this extent, the estimated coefficients revealed the long-term effects of entry since the

repeal of CON. Instead we now examine short-run effects: Did the demand for revascularization

grow immediately after new cardiac surgery centers entered the market? Was the negative

demand shock on incumbent hospitals stronger in the short term?

        Results are reported in Table 5. The signs of coefficients are generally consistent with

those in Table 4. Estimates in the first two columns indicate that in markets with higher 3-year

entrant shares, high-severity patients are more likely to undergo CABG, while low-severity

patients’ revascularization rates were not much affected. The significantly negative coefficient

estimates in columns (3) and (4) indicate the presence of business-stealing in the short run. The

relative magnitudes of estimated     and    further suggest that incumbent hospitals lost a larger

proportion of low-severity patients immediately following the entry of new surgery centers.

        Tables 6 presents estimates for the effects of entry on the likelihood of CABG and PCI

procedures based on various alternative specifications. Column (1) of Table 6 reproduces the

baseline results. Columns (2) and (3) of Table 6 explore alternative measures of patient illness

severity. In column (2), we follow Dranove et al. (2003) and Kessler and Geppert (2005) to

define high-severity patients as those who experienced hospitalization in the year prior to their

CAD. This definition identifies 23.1% of the sample as high-severity patients. In column (3), a

patient is identified as high-severity if her Elixhauser comorbidity score was greater than or equal

                                                 22
to 2.26 In the study sample, the Elixhauser comorbidity score ranges from 0 to 7, and the

correlation between the MediQual score and Elixhauser score is 0.13. The estimates in columns

(2) and (3) are remarkably similar to the baseline results and show no evidence that our results are

sensitive to alternative definitions of patient severity.

        Column (4) investigates whether the differential revascularization rates between zero and

non-zero entrant share markets were driven by the supply of cardiac surgeons. In particular, entry

by new cardiac surgery centers may have attracted more cardiac surgeons, imposing greater

financial stress on incumbent surgeons and thus providing incentives for them to perform more

surgeries. The number of CABG surgeons increased from 248 in 1995 to 284 in 2001, and then

dropped to 231 in 2004, while the number of PCI surgeons increased steadily from 570 in 1995 to

684 in 2004. If such a change causes increased procedure referrals, it may be picked up by the

estimated effects of entrant market share. To examine this issue, we control for the number of

CABG surgeons and the number of cardiologists performing PCI in each patient’s county of

residence. As shown in column (4), results are robust to this additional control.

        Finally, we examine the possibility that our results are driven by unobserved influence of

insurance plans. As mentioned earlier, one particular concern is the potential confounding

influence of HMOs on private insurance patients. On the one hand, HMOs are less likely to

encourage hospitalization and expensive revascularization procedures. On the other hand, HMOs’

selective contracting has enhanced price competition successfully among hospitals and lowered

hospital prices, making high-cost procedures more affordable (Town and Vistnes 2001; Miller

and Luft 1997). While we controlled for patient payer type and county-level HMO penetration

rate, there may still be systematic differences between private and public insurance plans that

affected patients’ choice of treatment and hospital. To test this, we repeat the analyses on the

Medicare-only sample as shown in column (5). Estimates in column (5) are generally unchanged

9-CM diagnosis codes (Elixhauser et al. 1998).

from the baseline results. Perhaps the only exception is in the last panel, where the estimated

business-stealing effects among high-severity PCI Medicare patients appeared to be larger than

the baseline estimates. Overall, our general findings are unaffected by these specification tests.

VII. Conclusion

        The majority of hospital markets in the United States currently operate under state-

mandated certificate-of-need regulation which impedes market entry. Concerns over

anticompetitive effects and adverse impacts on the availability of services to consumers led a

number of states to repeal CON regulation in recent years. Previous research has focused

primarily on the efficiency consequences of CON, generally finding no significant cost-

differences between CON and non-CON states, with little evidence provided on volume effects

(e.g. Ho and Ku-Goto, 2013). Moreover, little has been previously known about the degree to

which deregulation correlates with market entry, or the effect of unimpeded entry has on the

incidence and flow of services in these markets. In this study, we aim to fill the gap by exploring

the impacts of post-deregulation hospital entry on the use of major cardiac procedures in

Pennsylvania, a state which experienced rapid market entry after the repeal of its CON in 1996.

        Consistent with previous studies, we find that the removal of entry restrictions in

Pennsylvania was associated with a substantial increase in the number of hospitals performing

cardiac revascularization procedures, coupled with an overall downward trend in CABG, and an

overall upward trend in the alternative procedure, PCI. Examining the role of entry by new

cardiac surgery centers, we find that entry led to a significant increase in the likelihood of CABG,

relative to trend, but it did not contribute to the increase in PCI after adjusting for patient traits,

market characteristics, and area-specific trends. Our analyses show that the probability of

receiving PCI specifically at incumbent hospitals decreased with market entry, suggesting a

volume shift from incumbents to entrants, a phenomenon referred to as business stealing. Results

of our analyses further indicate that entry by new cardiac surgery centers tended to sort high-


                                                   24
severity patients into the more invasive CABG procedure and low-severity patients into the less

invasive PCI procedures. Regarding risk-allocation among hospitals, we find evidence that entry

shifted disproportionate volume of low-severity patients from incumbent hospitals to entrants.

        While our analysis on impacts of market level entry and entrant concentration on

procedure likelihood and trends are novel, our results echo findings from studies in related

literature which suggest that hospital entry contributed to increased quantity of services, as

observed in market aggregates (Abraham et al. 2007; Mitchell 2007). Our results on business

stealing by entrants parallel those of Huckman (2006), which show that acquiring hospital chains

tend to draw volume from target hospitals. The finding that entrant hospitals tended to

disproportionately attract low-severity patients away from incumbent hospitals is consistent with

Barro et al. (2006), thereby suggesting that the risk-allocation effect of entry is not unique to

specialty hospitals. Finally, focusing on per unit costs of hospitalizations, Kessler and Geppert

(2005) show that low- and high- risk patients are sorted more efficiently into low intensity and

high intensity care when markets are competitive.

        As for welfare implications for policies, such as CON, that are designed to remove barrier

entries in hospitals markets, our results are mixed: on the one hand, free-entry may lead to

improved access to care rather than business stealing for CABG procedures; on the other hand,

there is significant empirical evidence in favor of welfare-reducing business-stealing for PCI

procedures. Moreover, free-entry improves the match between underlying medical risk and

treatment intensity, potentially improving quality of care and hence welfare enhancing. These

findings underscore the importance of considering strategic responses by hospitals when

evaluating the impact of free entry into hospital markets when regulatory barriers to entry are

rescinded.

        In conclusion, our analysis complements and extends previous studies by exploring the

interaction of CON deregulation and market entry. Moreover, building on an empirical analysis

                                                  25
of patient heterogeneity and hospital preference, we allow the impact of the policy to vary by

local market area, and thus provide a more nuanced understanding of the responses to entry as

measured by patient flows. Future research might apply our analytical framework to efficiency

measures such as costs or patient outcomes.

Appendix: Predicting Entrant Market Share

In equations 1-3,      is the entrant market share at time t in Hospital Service Area (HSA) k, based

on patients’ area of residence (assigning entrant share based on where patients were treated can

introduce endogeneity, since patients’ hospital choice may be affected by unobserved

determinants of the hospitals; Similarly, the hospital’s entry choice may depend on anticipated

patient flows, which in turn depends on unobserved determinants of patient population). To

further address the identification issues, we adopt Kessler and McClellan’s (2000) method of

constructing hospital market share to our special context of entry. The analysis is conducted in

three steps: First, calculate an array of relative distances between the choice hospital and

alternative hospitals in the patient’s choice set; these provide instrumental variables. Second,

estimate a patient level hospital choice model, incorporating patient characteristics, hospital traits,

and relative distances. Third, obtain predicted probabilities of choosing an entrant hospital and

sum up the probabilities within each area to obtain market shares. Estimates are implemented

separately for CABG and PCI.

        Step 1:

We specify an array of distance variables specified as follows:

                  ∑         ∙     ∙          ∙       ∙ 1             ∙     ∙          ∙        ∙
                                                                                                   (A-1)
                                                 1         ,

where       is a binary indicator of trait h in hospital j. The exogenous impact of travel cost is

specified as an array of differential distances between the choice hospital and the patient’s closest

alternative hospital (D), where the alternative is specified separately for each hospital trait. Thus,

for H hospital traits, there are 2×H distance-trait interactions terms included in V. For example, if

hospital j is not-for-profit, then the patient’s utility from choosing hospital j depends on       , the

additional distance she has to travel beyond her closest not-for-profit hospital (a good substitute)

and       , the additional distance she has to travel beyond her closest for-profit hospital (a poor


                                                     43
substitute).27

         The choice set for each individual i at year t is comprised of all non-federal hospitals

offering at least five CABG (PCI) within 50-mile radius of her residence. We compute the

straight line distance between the geographic centroid of the zip code of a patient’s residence and

the exact location (longitude and latitude) of the hospital using the Geographic Information

System.

         Step 2.

In this step, we estimate a patient-level conditional logit (CL) model of hospital choice separately

for CABG and PCI patients by each year in the post CON period, 1997-2004. An individual

patient i’s utility from going to hospital j is a function of the individual’s characteristics, the

hospital’s attributes, and they array of relative distances previously described. Using vector

notation we define

         Using the previous notation the individual ’s indirect expected utility from choosing

hospital can be summarized as

                        ;   ,...,              ,...,        ,       ,...,        ;       ,...,             .        (A-3)


Each hospital is characterized by         binary characteristics            ,...,        , and the utility of

individual from choosing depends on the relative distances to its good substitutes (same-type)

     This specification allows for 2   relative distances that influence             :      equals the distance from to
hospital minus the distance from to the closest hospital ′ with              ′
                                                                                          , and        equals the distance
from to hospital minus the distance from to the closest hospital ′ with                     ′
                                                                                                   .

and the relative distances to its poor substitutes (different-type). To allow for any nonparametric

relationship between distances and patient’s choice, we categorize             and       into four quartile

dummies based on the distribution of the respective relative distance. That is,

     1     ,…,     4     and              1       ,…,    4   .

         Finally, let      1 if individual is treated at hospital , and =0 otherwise. Using

McFadden’s (1973) conditional logit, the probability of individual choosing hospital equal to

         Equation (A-4) is estimated using maximum likelihood. Given that private insurance plans

ranging from HMOs to PPOs constrain their memberships choices to hospitals within their

networks, we estimate equation (A-4) using the sample of Medicare fee-for-service enrollees

whose hospital choices are essentially unrestricted. Following Town and Vistnes (2001) and Ho

(2006) we use the parameter values from the Medicare equation to obtain predicted choices for

the all-payer sample. Both studies showed that this method provides reasonable proxies for other

payers.29 Descriptive statistics for the patient and hospital characteristics of the Medicare-FFS

sample are reported in column (2) of Table A-1.

Estimated coefficients then are used to predict          , the expected demand for CABG (PCI) at

hospital from patients living in market , for patients of all insurance types:

         where      denotes the predicted probability of individual receiving procedure CABG(PCI)

at hospital .

have similar preference for hospitals as their managed care counterparts conditional on diagnosis, distances,
and other demographics.

market of residence (instead of at the admitting hospital).
