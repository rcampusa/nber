The Short and Long-Run Effects of Attending The Schools that Parents Prefer

                                          ABSTRACT

Using meta-analysis we find that, on average, sought-after schools do not improve student test
scores. A potential explanation for this result is that parents value schools that improve outcomes
not well-measured by test scores. We explore this notion using both administrative and survey
data from Barbados. Using a regression discontinuity design, preferred schools have better peers
but do not improve short-run test scores. Consistent with the proposed explanation, the same
students at the same schools have more post-secondary school completion and improved adult
well-being (based on an index of educational attainment, occupational rank, earnings, and health).
These long-run benefits are larger for females who also experience reduced teen motherhood.
Mechanisms are explored.

I    Introduction
     In many nations, there are preferred or elite public secondary schools for which there is high
demand and fierce competition. To determine whether these schools tend to improve outcomes, we
perform meta-analysis on publicly-available studies using quasi-random assignment to a preferred
(non-charter) public school (either through lottery or selective enrollment exam). This includes
studies from the United States, the United Kingdom, China, Kenya, Mexico, Romania, and others.
Estimates from each of these studies for the full population (i.e., not just the subsamples with
significant effects) are shown in Figure 1.1 The precision-weighted average test score impact across
all studies is small and cannot be distinguished from zero.
    The lack of robust achievement effects of attending preferred schools is something of a puzzle.
One potential explanation is that preferred schools improve outcomes valued by parents (such as
non-cognitive skills, social skills, job referral networks, adult earnings, and well-being) that are not
well-measured by test-score impacts. No single paper has estimated the causal impacts of the same
preferred schools on test scores and also on a broad array of medium- and longer-run outcomes. As
a result, whether strong parental preferences for schools that have no impact on short-run test scores
can be rationalized by these same schools improving longer-run outcomes is unclear.2 We examine
this question directly using data from Barbados. We exploit quasi-random variation to estimate the
causal effect of attending a preferred school on short-run exam performance. We then look at both
administrative educational attainment data and survey data to estimate the causal effect of attending
a preferred school on a broad set of social and economic outcomes measured in adulthood.
    The Barbados data and context are well-suited for this study. At the end of primary school,
students take the Barbados Secondary School Entrance Examination (BSSEE). At BSSEE regis-
tration, students submit a ranked list of preferred secondary schools to the Ministry of Education,
Science, Technology and Innovation (METI), and the METI uses a deferred acceptance algorithm
(Gale and Shapley 1962; Abdulkadiroğlu et al. 2005) to assign students to schools based on their
choices and their test scores. The assignment rule used by the METI creates a test score cut-off
for each school above which student applicants are admitted and below which they are not. This
feature allows us to employ a regression discontinuity (RD) design to identify the causal effect of
attending a preferred school. We use administrative data on the BSSEE, and all secondary school
applications and assignments for twenty five years (1987 through 2011). To track educational out-
comes, we merge these student-level BSSEE data to administrative school exam records taken at
the end of secondary and post-secondary studies between 1993 and 2016. To track a rich set of
    1 See Borenstein et al. (2009), Appendix B, and the Inter-American Development Bank’s SkillsBank

    2 Clark and Del Bono (2016) examine the longer-run effect of attending one of three elite schools in Scotland but

do not examine whether the long-run impacts relate to school impacts on short-run test scores.

long-run outcomes, we link the administrative BSSEE records to the 2016 Barbados Survey of
Living Conditions and focus on cohorts aged 25 or older at the time of the survey.3
    We show that attending a preferred school is causally associated with higher-achieving peers,
more academically homogeneous peers, and smaller cohorts. However, consistent with prior work
(Figure 1), we find no improvement on secondary-school exam performance (at age 16). Look-
ing at medium- and longer-run outcomes tells a different story. In administrative data, students
at preferred schools are more likely to earn a post-secondary credential (at age 18). To exam-
ine longer-run outcomes, we construct a summary index of adult well-being from the survey. This
index includes educational attainment, occupational status, labor market wages, and health. Attend-
ing a preferred school is associated with considerable improvement on this long-term index (ages
25-40). These benefits are driven largely by women who experience similar health improvements
as men, but enjoy larger educational and labor market improvements.
    We explore mechanisms. The earnings increases for women may be mediated by having higher-
status jobs, and better social networks at preferred schools that facilitate securing these jobs. We
also find reduced teen-motherhood at preferred schools– suggesting that the improved education
and labor-market outcomes for females may be mediated by delayed childbearing. This is new evi-
dence of a causal link between school quality and teen motherhood. Patterns suggest that improved
health may be due to more productive habits and attitudes (rather than health care access).
    Our results suggest that schools’ test score impacts may not reflect impacts on adult well-being
such that parents may be rational to prefer schools that have no short-run test-score impacts. This
paper therefore contributes to the literature on parental preferences for schools (e.g. Black 1999;
Hastings et al. 2006; Burgess et al. 2015). While economists have long proposed a causal link
between educational attainment and health (Cutler and Lleras-Muney 2006; Clark and Royer 2013;
Buckles et al. 2016; Malamud et al. 2018), we provide fresh evidence of a causal impact of more
selective schools on health.4 This work represents the first exploration into the the causal impact of
attending a preferred school on both short-run test scores and a broad array of longer-run outcomes
(including health, educational attainment, occupational rank, earnings, and teen motherhood). We
bring together the literatures on schools’ long-run effects, the effect of elite schools on test scores,
the effect of education on health, and on the multidimensionality of school output.
    The remainder of this paper is as follows: Section II presents background information on the
Barbados education system. Section III describes the data. Section IV outlines the identification
strategy, Section V presents the results, and Section VI concludes.
   3 By age 25, 99 percent of all individuals had completed their formal schooling.
                                                                                 Therefore, this population is suitable
to measure educational attainment and labor market outcomes.
    4 Jones et al. (2011) use matching methods and find that students who attend better schools have better health. In

related work, Aaronson et al. (2017) and Frisvold and Golberstein (2011) find that African Americans that had access
to better schools in the early to mid 1900s had improved health outcomes.

II       The Barbados Education System
    The Barbados education system evolved from the English system. At the end of primary school
(after grade 6), students register to take the BSSEE and provide a list of ranked secondary school
choices to the METI.5 There are 24 public secondary schools. Between 1987 and 1995, students
could rank all schools, while after 1996 students could list up to nine school choices. The BSSEE
is comprised of three subjects that all students take: mathematics, English language, and an essay.
The METI ranks students by their BSSEE score and gender. No other criteria are used (e.g., sibling
preferences or geographic proximity). Individual school capacity by gender is pre-determined. The
algorithm assigns the highest ranked student to her first choice. It then moves on to the second and
treats her similarly. The procedure continues until it reaches a student whose first choice is full. At
that point, it tries to assign the student to her second choice. If full, to the third choice and so on.
Once this student has been assigned to a school, the algorithm moves on to the next person.
     Under the deferred acceptance assignment, when the number of choices is constrained (1996
and after), students may have an incentive to exclude some desirable schools from their list if the
probability of admission is too low (Haeringer and Klijn 2009). However, among the set of schools
listed, it is a dominant strategy to list them in order of true preference (Chade and Smith 2006,
Agarwal and Somaini 2018). Accordingly, so long as parents make rational choices, one can infer
that a higher-ranked school is preferred to a lower-ranked school. We examine choices in Appendix
C. Parents almost always rank more-selective schools higher. We show that is because (a) students
rank schools very similarly, and (b) the highest-achieving students are admitted to their top choices
first. As such, a preferred school is virtually synonymous with being more selective or more elite.
    Secondary school begins in first form (the equivalent of 7th grade) and ends at fifth form (the
equivalent of 11th grade) when students take the Caribbean Secondary Education Certification
(CSEC) examinations. These are equivalent to the British Ordinary levels examinations and are
externally graded by the Caribbean Examinations Council (CXC). The CSEC examinations are
given in 33 subjects. Passing five subjects (including English and mathematics) is a sufficient entry
requirement for community colleges, technical schools, or training schools. It can also be used for
entry at some colleges in the United States. Students who complete these requirements continue
their studies at a tertiary institution (if accepted) or pursue the Caribbean Advanced Proficiency
Examination (CAPE), also externally graded by CXC.
   The CAPE is a tertiary-level program. Students seeking to attend University (as opposed to a
community college) will take the CAPE. The CAPE is equivalent to the British Advanced levels
examinations. The CAPE is a two-year program and includes two core units (Caribbean Studies and
Communication Studies) and six other units. Passing at least two CAPE units is typically required

requirement to British higher education institutions. The post-secondary qualification of a CAPE
Associate’s Degree is awarded for passing seven CAPE units, including Caribbean Studies and
Communication Studies.

III       Data
    Our analytic sample is the full population of students who applied to a public secondary school
in Barbados between 1987 and 2011.6 We obtained the official administrative BSSEE data for
each of these years. These data include each student’s name, date of birth, gender, primary school
attended, parish of residence, total score on the BSSEE exam, the ranked list of secondary schools
the student wished to attend, and the administrative assignment by the METI.
    Administrative Examination Data: To track secondary performance, we collected data on the
CSEC examinations (taken five years after secondary school entry, around age 16). The CSEC data
are available for all years between 1993 and 2016. The CSEC data were linked to the 1987 through
2011 BSSEE cohorts by full name (first, middle, and last), gender, and date of birth.7 To track
post-secondary outcomes, we collected population data from the CAPE examinations (completed
after two years of post-secondary studies, around age 18). The CAPE data are available for years
2005 through 2016, and are linked to the 1998 through 2009 BSSEE cohorts by name, gender, and
date of birth.8 Both the CSEC and CAPE data contain scores for each subject examination taken.
    Survey Data: Our longer-run outcomes come from the 2016 Barbados Survey of Living Con-
ditions. This survey is a large, parish level representative two-percent survey of the population. It
included data on 7,098 individuals collected between February 2016 and January 2017. It includes
data on demographics, education, health, fertility, migration, consumption, employment, and in-
come.9 The survey collected full names at age 10 (to account for name changes), date of birth, and
gender so that it could be matched with the administrative BSSEE data. We matched 90 percent of
surveyed individuals within the target BSSEE cohorts (aged 25-40 when surveyed). We show that
our survey results likely generalize to the full population. First, the distributions of covariates and
outcomes are similar in the administrative and survey samples (Appendix Table A1). Second, ad-
mission to a preferred school is unrelated to responding the survey and subsequently being matched
with the BSSEE (Section V.1). Finally, the impacts on CSEC performance are similar in both the
full administrative dataset and among those who are linked to the survey (Appendix Table A2).
   6 Around  91 percent of secondary students in Barbados are enrolled in the public education system.
   7 We matched 90 percent of individuals observed in the CSEC administrative records to the BSSEE records. The 10
percent rate of unmatched individuals closely mimics the 9 percent enrollment rate in private secondary schools who
would not have taken the BSSEE.
   8 We matched 96 percent of individuals observed in the CAPE administrative records to the BSSEE records.
   9 The response rate of the survey was 80 percent, which is higher than the average for similar surveys in Latin

America and the Caribbean.

III.1      Summary Statistics
    Table 1 presents summary statistics. The population is roughly half female and the average
admitted school-cohort size is 157 students. About 68 percent of students took at least one CSEC
subject, and 26.8 percent passed five subjects including English language and mathematics (i.e.
qualified for tertiary education).10 We also break up the sample by the rank of the student’s assigned
school (based on the average incoming BSSEE scores). Among those assigned to the top ranked
schools, incoming BSSEE scores are roughly one standard deviation higher than the average of the
population (column 2).11 Unsurprisingly, students at these schools have much better outcomes than
average. Indeed 62 percent of students at the most selective schools qualify for a tertiary education
(column 2), while only 4.1 percent of students at the least selective schools do (column 4). In terms
of post-secondary education, 40.6 percent of students at the most selective schools took at least one
CAPE unit and 23.4 percent earned an Associate’s degree. Almost no students at the least selective
schools take the CAPE.
    The lower panel of Table 1 presents summary statistics for individuals ages 25 to 40 who are
matched to the surveys. Students at more selective schools have more years of education, are
more likely to be employed in a managerial or professional position, and earn higher wages. Also,
individuals at the most selective schools rely more on their school network when seeking employ-
ment. Only 1.9 percent of women assigned to the most selective schools had a live birth before age
18, while 16.4 percent of women in the bottom third of schools did. Preventive health behaviors
(having medical insurance, dental checkups, gym attendance) are also more prevalent among indi-
viduals assigned to more selective schools. In our analyses, to reduce multiple inference problems
we compute the following standardized summary indexes: educational attainment (combines years
of education and university completion); labor market (combines being employed, working in a
managerial or professional role, and the monthly wage); health (combines having medical insur-
ance, attending yearly dental checkups, attending a gym at least once per week, and being within a
normal Body Mass Index range).12 We also compute a long-term index which combines all these
individual outcomes.13
  10 Because   CSEC taking is not mandatory, this measure is not equivalent to secondary school completion. Students
receive a School Leaving Certificate regardless of CSEC taking after completing five years of secondary school. About
87.5 percent of surveyed individuals in our reference BSSEE cohorts report having completed secondary school.
   11 The gender imbalance across the school ranks reflects the fact that there is one all-girls school in the middle-ranked

schools, and one all-boys school in the bottom-ranked schools.
   12 Persons are classified within normal weight if they have a BMI below 25 but on or above of 18.5.
   13 Following Kling et al. (2007), we first standardize each index component. The summary indexes are the geometric

means of the standardized non-missing components for each individual.

IV        Empirical Strategy
    The assignment mechanism described in Section II creates a test score cutoff above which
applicants to each school are admitted and below which they are not. If nothing else differs for
those scoring just above and below the cutoff, any sudden change in outcomes as students’ BSSEE
score goes from below to above the cutoff for a preferred school can be attributed to attending
that preferred school (Hahn et al. 2001). We exploit the discontinuity in the admission probability
through the cutoff by estimating the following two-stage least-squares (2SLS) model:

                   Attendi jt = π · Abovei jt + f1 (BSEEit ) + Xi jt γ1 +C1, jt + P1,i jt + ε1,i jt                  (1)

                                      ˆ i jt + f2 (BSEEit ) + Xi jt γ2 +C2, jt + P2,i jt + ε2,i jt
                      Yi jt = β · Attend                                                                             (2)

    In the first stage equation (1) we predict whether individual i attends school j at time t, Attendi jt ,
as a function of scoring above the cutoff for preferred school j at time t, Abovei jt , and controls.
To account for latent outcomes that vary smoothly through the cutoffs, we control for a cubic in
BSSEE and a cubic of BSSEE interacted with the Abovei jt indicator ( f1 (BSEEit )). We also include
parish of residency fixed effects and gender (included in Xi jt ). Following Jackson (2010) and Pop-
Eleches and Urquiola (2013), we stack the data across all application pools into a single cutoff,
recenter BSSEE scores at each respective cutoff, and include cutoff fixed effects (C1, jt ). The cutoff
fixed effects ensure that all comparisons are among students who applied to the same school in the
same year. In the second stage (equation 2), the outcome of interest (Yi jt ) is a function of predicted
preferred school attendance (from the first stage) and all controls from equation (1). The second
stage excluded instrument is Abovei jt . Because the same individual can enter the data for multiple
cutoffs, the estimated standard errors are clustered at the student level.14
     Student’s ranked choices reflect student preferences and are much stronger predictors of student
outcomes than variables typically observed in most datasets. We add choice-group fixed effects
(P1, jt ) as controls to increase precision. These choice group fixed effects define the unique set of
schools in a student’s list along with the unique ranking of those schools. As such, students in the
same choice group list the same set of schools in the exact same order. All of our results are robust
to excluding these controls.
   The identifying assumption behind this Regression-Discontinuity-based model is that nothing
other than the change in admission probability changes in a discontinuous manner through the cut-
  14 In our context, this approach is equivalent to heteroskedasticity-robust estimated standard errors allowing for off-
diagonal non-zero terms in the variance-covariance matrix when the same individual enters the data for more than one
cutoff. Kolesár and Rothe (2018) show this to be a more conservative approach than also clustering estimated standard
errors at the level of the running variable. Indeed, our results are more conservative with the adopted approach than if
we also cluster standard errors at the BSSEE relative score level.



                                                           6
off. We test this assumption in several ways. Following McCrary (2008), we test for a discontinuity
in density through the cutoff and find no change in density either in the full population or in the sur-
vey sample (Table 2, panel A). As an additional test for smoothness through the cutoff, we estimate
reduced form models on each of our predetermined covariates. None of the 32 covariates is related
(at the 5 percent level) to scoring above the cutoff in either the full population or the survey sample
(Appendix Table A3). To summarize impacts on all these covariates into a more efficient test, we
create predicted CSEC certification, CAPE Associate’s degree, and long run-index variables (based
on all covariates).15 None of these predicted outcomes is related to scoring above the cutoff (Table
2, panel B). All these tests suggest that our estimation strategy is likely valid.

V      Results
V.1       The First Stage and Survey Representativeness
    Table 2, panel C presents the first stage estimates on the Abovei jt indicator from equation (1).
For observations within 0.75 SD of the cutoff, in the population, scoring above a cutoff increases the
likelihood of attending a preferred school by 74.5 percentage points.16 The top left panel of Figure
2 shows clear visual evidence of a discontinuous jump in the probability of attending a preferred
school through the cutoff. Table 2, panel D shows that attending a preferred school increases peer
quality (average BSSEE scores) by 0.25 standard deviations, and also decreases heterogeneity in
peer quality with lower cohort sizes. While there are peer quality differences across schools, all
secondary schools teach a homogeneous national curriculum approved by the METI. Also, because
public secondary schools are allocated funding annually by the METI, per-pupil school resources
are essentially the same across all schools. As such, any differences in outcomes are not due to
differences in school resources or curriculum across schools.
    To provide further evidence that our survey results are likely representative of the population,
we show that the first stage is identical in the survey sample (Panel C, columns 3 and 4).17 We also
show no change in the likelihood of being matched to and then responding to the survey through the
cutoffs (panel E). Consistent with this, the estimated effects on school environments are statistically
indistinguishable between the population and the survey sample (Panel D, column 5). This all lends
even greater credibility to the survey results generalizing to the full population.

V.2       Effects on Secondary School Academic Achievement
    Table 3, panel A presents estimated impacts on CSEC performance (age 16) measured at the
  15 We   report impacts on all predicted outcomes across different samples by gender in Appendix Table A4.
  16 Individuals can appear for multiple cutoffs in the stacked data.As such, regression models have more observations
than individuals.
   17 To improve precision, results from the survey sample exploit all observations. However, we show that these are

robust to alternative bandwidth restrictions (Appendix Figure A1).

end of secondary school. To use the same cohorts for which CAPE data (age 18+) are available, we
focus on the BSSEE cohorts from 1998 to 2009.18 We present estimated preferred school impacts
in models that do not include the choice group effects (column 1). The results with and without
these controls are very similar, so we focus on the full model with all controls.
    Students who attend preferred schools do not perform better on the secondary school leaving
exams, and may do slightly worse. Overall (column 2), we find no effect on taking the CSEC
exams, and small marginally significant negative effect on the likelihood of qualifying for tertiary
education.19 This pattern is the same for both men and women (columns 3 and 4). The lack of
improved CSEC outcomes through the cutoff are presented visually in the top right panel of Figure
2. These findings echo the several studies documenting zero effects on test scores from attending
more selective schools (see Figure 1) and possible negative effects on school completion in Dustan
et al. (2017).20
    Most studies in this literature use regression discontinuity designs that estimate school impacts
for the marginal applicant (who just made or missed the cutoff). As such, one potential explanation
for the null effects is that marginal applicants don’t benefit from preferred schools even if average
students do. We implement a formal test of this (see Appendix D) and find that the effects are the
same, on average, for the marginal applicant and the average attendee – so that this does not explain
for the null impacts for highly-demanded schools.

V.3     Effects on Post-Secondary Certification
    To explore whether improved longer-run impacts can explain strong demand for schools with
no short-run test-score impacts, we now examine post-secondary outcomes. We examine CAPE
taking (a measure of continued education beyond secondary school) and earning a CAPE Asso-
ciate’s degree in panel B of Table 3. Overall, columns 1 and 2 show that attending a preferred
school increases the likelihood of taking the CAPE by about 2 percentage points and increases the
likelihood of earning an Associate’s degree by 2.1 percentage points (p-value<0.01). That is, de-
spite a slight reduction in the likelihood of passing the secondary school exam, students at preferred
schools are more likely to enter and complete the CAPE post-secondary education. There is little
evidence of any differential effect by gender. The corresponding visual evidence of a discontinuous
jump in earning an Associate’s degree through the cutoff is in the lower left panel of Figure 2.
   The contrast between the slight negative impacts on short run test scores (age 16) and post-
secondary educational attainment (age 18) for the same population is compelling evidence that a
  18 Appendix   Table A2, panel A shows estimated CSEC effects using the BSSEE cohorts 1987-2002 (25-40 years old
when surveyed) in whom we focus to estimate longer-term effects later. Results are similar.
   19 Estimated impacts on other CSEC outcomes are in Appendix Table A5.
   20 Appendix Table A2, panel B shows estimated effects on the same outcomes but restricting the sample to individuals

that were matched with the survey data. Results are similar suggesting null effects.

lack of short-run test score impacts does not imply a lack of impact on overall longer-run well-
being. The estimated positive effect on CAPE taking of 2 percentage points is equivalent to 13.16
percent of the sample average, and almost double the average at the least preferred (selective)
schools. This pattern of improved longer run outcomes for preferred schools is echoed in the
survey data examined in the next section.21

V.4     Effects on Long-Run Outcomes
    To summarize the longer-run survey outcomes (between ages 25 and 40), we examine impacts
on the long-run index (which combines education, labor market, and health outcomes). The lower
right panel of Figure 2 shows a clear jump in the long-run index through the cutoff – indicating
that attending a preferred school improved students long run well-being. To provide statistical
evidence that this jump is real, we randomly assigned “placebo” cutoffs to each school-cohort
and estimated the cutoff effect across 2000 replications. None of the placebo effects is as large
as the real one (see Appendix Figure A2). The 2SLS estimates in panel C of Table 3 show that
overall, attending a preferred school increases the long-term index by 0.187 standard deviations (p-
value<0.01). Despite no significant impacts on short-run test scores, attending a preferred school
has large positive, statistically significant, impacts on overall long-term well-being. While the point
estimates are positive for both females and males (columns 3 and 4), one cannot reject that the effect
for males is zero. However, one can reject equality of impacts by gender at the 10 percent level.
We now explore impacts on particular components of long-run well-being.
V.4.1   Educational Attainment
    Given that many individuals pursue university studies after the CAPE (for which we find pos-
itive impacts), one might expect to see increases in overall educational attainment. Panel C of
Table 3 shows that attending a preferred school increases the educational attainment index only
for women. Women who attend a preferred school have 0.376 standard deviations (p-value<0.01)
higher educational attainment index (column 3), while the estimate is negative and not significant
for men (column 4). This positive effect for women is driven by positive effects on each of the in-
dividual components of the index (Appendix Table A6). For women, attending a preferred school
increases the likelihood of having a university degree by 17 percentage points, and increases the
years of education attained by 1.64 years. Given that both male and female students who attend
preferred schools experienced increased CAPE completion, the lack of an overall educational effect
for men is surprising. We explore mechanisms behind this asymmetric result in Section V.6.
  21 Appendix  Table A2, panel C shows estimated CAPE effects for the cohorts that overlap with the longer-term
sample (i.e. BSSEE cohorts 1998-2002). While less precise, the results are similar.




                                                      9
V.4.2   Labor Market Outcomes
    Similar to the estimated effects on educational attainment, panel C of Table 3 shows that attend-
ing a more selective school increases labor market success only for women. For women, preferred
school attendance has a positive effect on the labor market index of 0.389 standard deviations (p-
value<0.01) (column 3). However, there is no economically or statistically significant effect for
men (column 4). This positive effect for women is driven by significantly positive effects on each
of the components of the index (Appendix Table A6). For women, attending a preferred school
increases the likelihood of being employed by 13 percentage points, increases the likelihood of
holding a managerial job by 24 percentage points, and increases log monthly wages by 41 points.
For both women and men, attending a preferred school is associated with increased labor market
employment, but this effect is larger for women and not significant for men. These results are
consistent with a standard human capital model (e.g. Becker 1975) where the increased educa-
tional attainment associated with attending a preferred school among women (but not men) being
rewarded in the labor market for women (but not men). The fact that we observe no appreciable
labor market effects for men (for whom there was no increase in overall educational attainment)
suggests that the labor market benefits for women are not driven by more elite schools signaling
ability (e.g. Spence 1973; MacLeod and Urquiola 2015)
V.4.3   Adult Health
    One key innovation of this paper is to estimate causal impacts of schools on health. Panel
C of Table 3 shows that attending a preferred school increases the health index by 0.22 standard
deviations (p-value<0.01). This health effect is similar for both women and men. Estimated effects
on the individual components of the health index are shown in Appendix Table A7. Selective school
attendance increased the likelihood of being within a normal BMI range by 16.7 percentage points
and reduced the likelihood of being overweight or obese. Consistent with preferred schools leading
to better practices that improve health status, attending a preferred school increases the likelihood
of attending a gym at least once per week by 12.5 percentage points, and increases the likelihood
of having an annual dental checkup by 11 percentage points. Interestingly, there is no statistically
significant impact on having medical insurance– suggesting that health status improvements are
largely due to improved behavioral norms at more preferred schools. Even though there were
only detectable educational and employment benefits for women, long-term health improved for
both women and men because of selective school attendance. This finding constitutes a previously
undocumented benefit to preferred school attendance.

V.5     Robustness
    To assuage concerns that our results are driven by modelling choices, we show that our 2SLS
estimates for each outcome are similar for any choice of bandwidth (Appendix Figure A1). Also,

                                                 10
Appendix Table A8 shows the robustness of our estimates to alternative BSSEE polynomial specifi-
cations. We also show robustness to two-way clustered standard errors at the individual and BSSEE
scores levels (Appendix Table A9).

V.6     Exploration of Potential Mechanisms
    A possible explanation for the lack of increased male earnings at preferred schools is that pre-
ferred schools led males to pursue more academic oriented programs at the expense of pursuing
technical and vocational training.22 If technical/vocational training had a higher rate of return than
academic programs for these marginal males, the labor market impacts could be negative. Our data
do not support this hypothesis. We find no reduction in having a technical/vocation credential for
males (panel D of Table 3).
    One possible labor market benefit to attending a preferred school is access to better-connected
social networks that can be leveraged to improve employment opportunities (Schmutte, 2015). In-
deed, the likelihood of having been referred to one’s current job by somebody in one’s secondary
school network increases by 3.7 percentage points due to attending a preferred school (panel E of
Table 3). The referral effect is similar for women and men. Although only women experienced
positive effects on the labor market index, the fact that both men and women experienced simi-
lar increases in the likelihood of employment (see panel B of Appendix Table A6) suggests that
improved referral networks may be a mechanism. In contrast, men have no wage increases while
women do, suggesting that referrals do not explain the higher wages for women. The results are
consistent with the referral effect leading to increased employment, and the increased educational
attainment (for women) increasing wages (for women) conditional on being employed. We exam-
ine the education mechanism further below.
    Attending a preferred school increased Associate’s degree receipt for both women and men,
but educational attainment only increased for women. One explanation for these findings is that
the gains in educational attainment for men who pass the CAPE were offset by losses among
those who do not take the secondary school exam. Indeed, the reduction in qualifying for tertiary
education (based on CSEC performance) and earning a CAPE Associate’s degree are opposite in
sign and almost identical in magnitude. However, the differences in overall educational attainment
between men and women imply that women who completed the CAPE were more likely than men
to continue their studies and pursue a university degree.
    The notion that school quality may increase educational attainment for girls more than for boys
is not new (e.g. Jackson 2010; Deming et al. 2014; Clark 2010). However, the reasons for the
gender differences are not well understood. One potential explanation is that attending a better
school reduces the likelihood of teen pregnancy (which disproportionately impacts girls). Given
  22 This   was proposed in Clark and Del Bono (2016). However, they are unable to test this hypothesis in their data.


                                                           11
that teen motherhood has been shown, by some, to adversely impact educational attainment and
earnings (e.g. Fletcher and Wolfe 2009), this could explain the pattern of results. Panel F of
Table 3 shows that the likelihood of giving birth by age 18 is reduced by 6.2 percentage points
(p-value<0.05). Relative to the average in the population, this represents a considerable 59 percent
decrease. We find no impact, however, on total fertility (Appendix Table A10) – indicating that
preferred schools lead to delayed child bearing rather than reduced fertility. This is suggestive
evidence that decreased teen motherhood may have played an important role in explaining the
long-term improvements in educational attainment and labor market outcomes for women.

VI     Conclusions
    Our meta-analysis reveals that, across several national contexts, the average impact of attending
a preferred public school on test scores is not distinguishable from zero. Using data from Barba-
dos, we replicate this result. We argue that these findings can be rationalized by parents valuing
school impacts on a broader set of outcomes than those measured by achievement tests. Our anal-
ysis of long-run outcomes support this explanation. Attending a preferred school led to sizable
improvements in educational attainment, labor market success, and health. The long-run impacts
are larger for girls, who also experience lower teen pregnancy. Given these patterns, if parents care
about these outcomes, it may be reasonable for them to prefer these schools despite no test-score
improvements in the short-run.
    The fact that we find no impact of attending preferred schools on short-run test scores, but
do find sizable impacts on longer-run outcomes is important. Our results suggest that test score
impacts may not be the best measure of a school’s impacts on longer-run outcomes (Jackson 2018;
Heckman et al. 2006). Accordingly, policymakers should be cautious regarding using test score
impacts in accountability systems and incentive-pay schemes. Moreover, these results underscore
the need for evaluations of school choice programs and private voucher programs to move beyond
test score impacts alone, and to examine broader sets of outcomes that parents may value.

     Notes: The individual standardized estimated effects along with their 95 percent confidence intervals are shown. RD denotes a regression discontinuity design
     exploiting admission scores cutoffs. Admission Lottery refers to identification strategies exploiting randomized admission lotteries for oversubscribed schools. The
     overall weighted average effect (µ) considers a weight W j = (SE 2j + T 2 )−1 for each study j. Where SE j 2 is the variance of the estimated effect from each study j
     and T 2 is the between-study variance (resulting from a random-effects meta-regression). The prediction interval of the overall weighted average effect is computed
              √
     as µ ± z T 2 + SE 2 . The prediction interval presents the expected range of true effects in similar studies. The resulting overall weighted average effect shown is

Notes: All individuals who took the BSSEE between 1987 and 2011 are included in panels A and B. The gender
imbalance across the school ranks reflects the fact that there is one all-girls school in the middle-ranked schools,
and one all-boys school in the bottom-ranked schools. Panel C includes individuals who took the BSSEE between
1998 and 2009. This because the earliest CAPE outcome data corresponds to year 2005 which is associated with
the 1998 BSSEE cohort; while the latest CAPE data corresponds to year 2016 which is associated with the 2009
BSSEE cohort. Panel D uses the full matched survey data covering BSSEE cohorts 1987-2002 (25 - 40 years old
when surveyed). The Long-term index is expressed in standard deviations and combines the following outcomes:
years of education, university degree, employed, manager or professional, monthly wage, medical insurance, yearly
dental checkup, weekly gym, and normal BMI. Standard deviations are reported in parentheses below the means. *
Qualification for tertiary education requires passing five CSEC examinations including English and mathematics.

           ficients on the ’Above’ indicator resulting from reduced form models as in equation (1). Panels D and E report estimated
           2SLS coefficients on ’Attend’ a preferred school using ’Above’ as the excluded instrument (resulting from equation
           system (1) - (2)). Models in Panel B do not control for preferences as the selectivity of preferences were used when
           predicting the outcomes. Estimated standard errors in parenthesis are clustered at the individual level. Sociodemographic
           controls include student gender and parish fixed-effects. Regressions in columns (3) and (4) are weighted by the inverse
           of sampling probability to reflect survey design. Column (5) reports the p-value of a test for the equality of estimates
           reported in columns (2) and (4). Sample corresponds to BSSEE cohorts 1987 - 2002 (25 - 40 years old when surveyed).

Notes: This table reports estimated 2SLS coefficients on ’Attend’ a preferred school using ’Above’ as the excluded instrument (resulting
from equation system (1) - (2) in the text). Estimated standard errors in parenthesis are clustered at the individual level. Sociodemographic
controls include student gender and parish fixed-effects. Panels A and B correspond to BSSEE cohorts that have both CSEC and CAPE
data available (BSSEE cohorts 1998 - 2009). Panels C, D, E and F use the matched survey data covering BSSEE cohorts 1987-2002 (25
- 40 years old when surveyed). All regressions estimated with survey data are weighted by the inverse of sampling probability to reflect
survey design. Summary Indexes are expressed in standard deviations and combine the following outcomes: Educational attainment
(years of education, university degree); Labor market (employed, manager or professional, monthly wage); Health (medical insurance,
yearly dental checkup, weekly gym, normal BMI); Long-term (all outcomes included in the previous indexes). Column (5) reports the
p-value of a test for the equality of estimates reported in columns (3) and (4).

                                  Figure A1. 2SLS Effects by Bandwidth




Notes: This figure depicts estimated 2SLS coefficients on ’Attend’ a preferred school using ’Above’ as the excluded
instrument (resulting from equation system (1) - (2) in the text). The estimated 2SLS effects are reported for each
bandwidth between +/-15 (+/-0.6sd) and +/-60 (+/-2.5sd). The 90 (95) percent confidence interval of the estimated
effects is presented in dark (light) gray.

                         Figure A2. Cutoff Falsification Test (Long-Term Index)




Notes: This figure depicts the distribution of 2,000 placebo estimated coefficients on the ’Above’ indicator resulting
from reduced-form models as in equation (1) along with the real estimated reduced-form effect on the Long-Term
Index (equivalent to 0.147 standard deviations with p-value<0.01). Each placebo estimate was generated with the
following steps: (1) A randomly chosen cutoff admission score was generated for each applicant pool (i.e. applicants
to each school-year); (2) A placebo relative score and ’Above’ indicator were generated with respect to the randomly
chosen admission cutoff; (3) A reduced form model was estimated using the placebo relative scores and the ’Above’
indicator.

Notes: All individuals who took the BSSEE between 1987 and 2011 are included
in panels A, B, C, and D. However, panel E only includes individuals who took
the BSSEE between 1998 and 2009. This because the earliest CAPE outcome data
corresponds to year 2005 which is associated with the 1998 BSSEE cohort; while the
latest CAPE data corresponds to year 2016 which is associated with the 2009 BSSEE
cohort. Standard deviations are reported in parentheses below the means. Column
(1) reports means and standard deviations of individuals who were not surveyed.
Column (2) reports means and standard deviations of individuals who were surveyed
and matched with the BSSEE administrative dataset. Estimates in column (2) are
weighted by the inverse of sampling probability to reflect survey design. Column (3)
reports the p-value of a test for the equality of means reported in columns (1) and (2)
adjusting for BSSEE cohorts fixed effects.

  Notes: This table reports estimated 2SLS coefficients on ’Attend’ a preferred school using ’Above’ as the excluded instrument (resulting
  from equation system (1) - (2) in the text). Estimated standard errors in parenthesis are clustered at the individual level. Sociodemographic
  controls include student gender and parish fixed-effects. Panel B shows estimated effects using only observations that belong to the
  matched survey data and regressions are weighted by the inverse of sampling probability to reflect survey design. Column (7) reports the
  p-value of a test for the equality of estimates reported in columns (4) and (6).

Notes: This table reports estimated coefficients on the ’Above’ indicator resulting from reduced form models as in equation (1) of the text.
Estimated standard errors in parenthesis are clustered at the individual level. Samples in Panels A and B correspond to BSSEE cohorts
that have both CSEC and CAPE data available (BSSEE cohorts 1998 - 2009). This because the earliest CAPE outcome data corresponds
to year 2005 which is associated with the 1998 BSSEE cohort; while the latest CAPE data corresponds to year 2016 which is associated
with the 2009 BSSEE cohort. Panel C shows estimated effects on predicted longer term indexes obtained from the matched survey data
covering BSSEE cohorts 1987-2002 (25-40 years old when surveyed). Regressions do not control for preferences as the selectivity of
preferences were used when predicting the outcomes. Regressions in Panel C are weighted by the inverse of sampling probability to reflect
survey design. Column (4) reports the p-value of a test for the equality of estimates reported in columns (2) and (3). Column (5) reports
the adjusted coefficient of determination of the prediction regression for each outcome.

             Notes: This table reports estimated 2SLS coefficients on ’Attend’ a preferred school using ’Above’ as the excluded instrument (resulting from
             equation system (1) - (2) in the text) using alternative polynomial specifications of the BSSEE relative score. Estimated standard errors in parenthesis
             are clustered at the individual level. Sociodemographic controls include student gender and parish fixed-effects. All regressions include interactions
             between the BSSEE polynomial and the the ’Above’ indicator, cutoff fixed effects and preference fixed effects. Samples in Panels A and B
             correspond to BSSEE cohorts that have both CSEC and CAPE data available (BSSEE cohorts 1998 - 2009). Panel C uses the full matched
             survey data covering BSSEE cohorts 1987-2002 (25 - 40 years old when surveyed) and these regressions are weighted by the inverse of sampling
             probability to reflect survey design. Summary Indexes are expressed in standard deviations and combine the following outcomes: Educational
             attainment (years of education, university degree); Labor market (employed, manager or professional, monthly wage); Health (medical insurance,
             yearly dental checkup, weekly gym, normal BMI); Long-term (all outcomes included in the previous indexes).

Appendix B. Meta-Analysis Methodology
    We perform meta-analysis on all publicly-available studies using quasi-random assignment to
a preferred (non-charter) public school (either through lottery or selective enrollment exam). We
focus on studies that examine test score impacts. Studies for the meta-analysis were obtained
through a targeted literature search. This involved searching through the bibliographies of known
papers that fit the inclusion criteria and a search of papers citing these papers. To locate additional
papers that may have been missed using this first approach, we also conducted a keyword search
on ”causal” and “elite” or “selective” for additional papers. We found 17 papers that fit our criteria.
    Following Borenstein et al. (2009), the meta-analytic methodology employed can be summa-
rized in two main stages. First, the computation of the estimated effect from each study and, second,
the computation of the overall average effect across all studies. For the first stage, because studies
tend to report multiple estimated effects, we consider the following criteria: (i) The estimate re-
sulting from the preferred identification strategy and model specification by the author if specified.
If no preference is specified, we take into account estimates from all identification strategies used
(considering the model specification with most controls within each strategy).23 (ii) Treatment on
the treated effects whenever possible. If not reported, intention to treat effects are used. (iii) Test
scores closer to secondary school completion (e.g. 11th grade preferred to 9th grade). (iv) Full
population effects. If effects are reported only for sub-populations separately, we record all of them
and compute a weighted aggregate effect. (v) Overall examination scores (of exams that evaluate
mathematics and language together) if available. If not, separate scores on mathematics and lan-
guage examinations are recorded and then averaged. If only one overall score of an examination
that evaluates mathematics, language, and other additional subjects is available, we consider that
one.
    After following these criteria, some studies will have multiple effects using different identifi-
cation strategies, sub-populations or examinations. Therefore, following Borenstein et al. (2009),
we compute one single overall average effect for each study. For this, it is important to recognize
whether different effects presented within the same study are expected to be correlated. This is the
case when math and language effects are estimated for the same sample or when different identifi-
cation strategies are used for the same outcomes. In such cases, we compute as the combined effect
the mean of the estimated effects and we assume a correlation of 0.5 between their standard errors
to compute the variance of the combined effect. If different sub-populations are used, such as gen-
der, cohorts or regions and no overall effects are presented, then (also following Borenstein et al.
(2009)) we assume them to be independent and we generate a combined effect for each study j
  23 Such is the case of Bui et al. (2014) where we use the estimated effects derived from both the RD and Admission
Lottery identification strategies.



                                                        37
by performing a fixed-effects meta-regression. This procedure estimates a weighted average effect
(ES j ) and average variance (SE j 2 ) for each study j as follows:

                                                      esi
                                                    ∑
                                                     sei 2
                                            ES j =                                                  (3)
                                                   ∑ sei 2

                                                         1 −1
                                         SE j 2 = (∑          )                                     (4)
                                                        sei 2
where esi denotes the ith estimated effect of study j and sei 2 denotes the variance of such estimated
effect.
    In the second stage, we compute an overall average effect across all studies through a random-
effects meta-regression of all the studies’ estimated effects obtained within the first stage (see
Borenstein et al. (2009), chapter 12 for a detailed explanation). The random-effects meta regression
estimates a weighted average effect (µ) of the included studies where the weight for each study j
is computed as follows:
                                                        1
                                            Wj =                                                 (5)
                                                  SE 2j + T 2

where SE j 2 is the variance of the estimated effect from study j (or the within study variance) and T 2
is the between-study variance. We estimate the between-study variance using a method of moments
approach.
    Finally, we compute the prediction interval for the weighted average effect across all studies
, µ, as follows:                             p
                                        µ ± z T 2 + SE 2                                       (6)

where SE 2 denotes the variance of the weighted average effect (µ) and T 2 denotes the between-
study variance resulting from the random-effects meta-regression of all the studies’ estimated ef-
fects (estimated with a method of moments approach). The prediction interval presents the expected
range of true effects in similar studies.
    Our analysis includes the following studies assessing the test score effects of attending any
preferred public (non-charter) secondary school: Abdulkadiroğlu et al. (2014), Abdulkadiroglu
et al. (2017), Anderson et al. (2016), Ajayi (2015), Cullen et al. (2006), Deming (2011), Hastings
et al. (2009), Hoekstra et al. (2018), Jackson (2010), Pop-Eleches and Urquiola (2013). In addition,
we also consider the following studies assessing the test score effects of attending a preferred elite
public secondary school: Barrow et al. (2017), Bui et al. (2014), Clark (2010), Dee and Lan (2015),
Dustan et al. (2017), Lucas and Mbiti (2014), Park et al. (2015).



                                                  38
Appendix C. The Revealed Preference Ranking of Schools
    While existing studies have examined the impacts of attending a more selective school or an
elite school, it is not clear that most parents actually prefer such schools. If all parents prefer more
elite (or selective) schools, the lack of an elite schooling effect would speak to the choices made
by all parents. Conversely, if parents hold very different views regarding what schools they prefer,
then elite schools would not necessarily be preferred by many (or even most) parents. In this second
scenario, the lack of an elite schooling effect would speak to the choices made by some parents, but
would not speak to the choices made my most parents. Related to this, if parents agree on which
schools are preferred, the benefits to attending a preferred school reflect the relative impacts of a
certain set of schools. Conversely, if parents have very heterogeneous preferences for schools, the
benefits to attending a preferred school might reflect student-school matching effects rather than
the effectiveness of a certain set of schools relative to others. From a policy perspective, and to aid
interpretation, these are important distinctions that we examine below.
    To better understand parental preferences for schools, we follow Avery et al. (2013) and exploit
the choice data to construct a revealed-preference ranking of secondary schools in Barbados. Intu-
itively, because each student lists a set of schools they wish to attend, in order of desirability, and
the allocation algorithm is truth revealing among the set of choices submitted, one can determine
which are more preferred schools by seeing which individual schools tend to be systematically
higher in individuals’ choices. The ranking approach is similar to that used for ranking players in
tournaments where players are observed in several head-to-head match-ups. Schools that tend to
be preferred in many head-to-head comparisons (i.e. ranked above other schools on the list) are
more highly ranked, and schools that are preferred over more highly ranked schools are themselves
more highly ranked. Because each list of X ranked schools includes ∑X−1    n=1 (X − n) such head-to-
head comparisons and thousands of students submit such lists each year, constructing such rankings
from the choice data is feasible. We expand on the model below.
    Each student i, has a utility value, Ui j , for each secondary school j, given by (1) below.

                                              Ui j = θ j + εi j                                          (7)

The parameter θ j is an index of the overall desirability of school j, and the random error term
is εi j . The parameter θ j does not vary at the student level and therefore represents a school’s
average desirability. Let θ jris be the desirably of the school j that individual i ranked s (ri = s) in
their list of options Ri . Let Uirjis be the utility individual i gets from school j that she ranked in
position s, so that Uirji1 is her utility from the school she ranked first, Uirji2 her utility for the school
ranked second, and so on. Because the assignment mechanism is truthfully revealing within the
set of submitted choices, we make the simple behavioral assumption that higher ranked schools

                                                     39
are preferred to lower ranked schools. It therefore follows that the probability that an individual i
submits a particular ranking over the set of listed schools is

                                                                                     riR −1   riR 
                    Pr (Uirji1 > Uikrim , 1 < m, ∀m ∈ {2, . . . , Ri }) ∩ . . . ∩ (Ui j i > Uik i )
                      
                                                                                                                   (8)

As is common practice in the discrete-choice literature, we assume that εi j follows an extreme value
distribution so that the probability that an individual i submits a particular ranking over all ranked
schools is a product of standard logit formulas. The likelihood (or probability) that individual i
chooses ranking {ri1 , ri2 , . . . , Ri } is now:
                                                                                                  r
                                                 exp(θ jri1 )          exp(θ jri2 )        exp(θ j iR−1 )
   li (θ ) = Prob[ri1 , ri2 , . . . , Ri ] =                    · i                ...    r               riR      (9)
                                                Ri
                                               ∑k=1 exp(θikrik ) ∑Rk=2 exp(θikrik ) exp(θ j iR−1 ) + exp(θk i )

The full log likelihood of observing all the choices is simply the sum of the log of the individual
likelihoods across all individuals.
                                                                 N
                                                   log L(θ ) = ∑ log li (θ )                                      (10)
                                                                 i=1


One can obtain estimated preferences for each school θˆj by finding the θ j s that maximize the full
log likelihood. This is achieved by estimating a rank-ordered logit model with a full set of indicator
variables for each school in Barbados. Because proximity is a strong predictor of parents’ choices,
we obtained rankings based on models that both include and exclude proximity to each school
choice as a covariate. Reassuringly, the rankings are identical across both models. Schools with
larger θˆj s are those that tend to be listed higher up in individuals’ ordered lists. The school with
the highest θˆj will be the school that is most likely to be preferred (on average) in head-to-head
comparisons with other schools. After running this model, we rank schools by their estimated
desirability to obtain a revealed-preference ranking over all schools. If students who list both
schools A and B tend to list school A above school B, and students who list both schools B and C
tend to list school B above school C, our approach will rank school A above B and B above C.

The Estimated School Rankings
    To determine whether the preference rankings are meaningful, we first establish that they are
stable over time. The top five schools in 1987 remain the top five schools in 2011 with the only
difference being that the top two schools swapped places.24 While there is some movement among
the lower-ranked schools, the rankings are quite stable across this 25 year period. Overall, the
  24 Usingthe reveled preference rankings, the five top ranked schools in 1987 were (1) Harrison College (HC), (2)
Queens College (QC), (3) Combermere School (CS), (4) St. Michaels School (SM), (5) Christ Church Foundation
(CF). A quarter century later in 2011, the top ranked schools were (1) QC, (2) HC, (3) CS, (4) SM, (5) CF.


                                                                40
correlation between the revealed preference rank in 1987 and the revealed preference rank in 2011 is
0.96. The similarity in rankings when parents can rank all schools (and therefore truthful revelation
is a dominant strategy) and when they can rank up to nine schools, indicates that one can reliably
infer parental preferences from choice data when parents can only rank nine choices. A scatter-plot
of the rankings across these two years is presented in the left panel of Figure C1. The regression
predicting the rank in 2011 based on the rank in 1987 has a slope of 0.97 and an R-squared of
0.91. The p-value for the test that the slope is equal to 1 is 0.7. This suggests that the average view
regarding what schools are most desirable has been very stable over time.
     Having established that aggregate school rankings are stable over time, we now explore how
much the average view is shared among individuals. To do this, we rank schools in each year, and
then estimate the likelihood of a given school being listed as a preferred school in a given year as
a function of its aggregate ranking in that year.25 If there is widespread agreement among parents
about what the most desirable schools are, aggregate rankings would predict being ranked more
highly by parents, and rank reversals (i.e. putting a lower-ranked school higher in one’s choice
list) would be uncommon. Conversely, if there is considerable heterogeneity in parents’ views
regarding which schools are more desirable, aggregate rankings may predict being ranked more
highly by parents on average, but rank reversals would be common. The average ranking in a given
year is a very strong predictor of individual choices in that year. A school is 44 percent more likely
to be more highly ranked by an individual if it is one rank higher in the aggregate, 3 times as likely
to be more highly ranked if it is three ranks higher in the aggregate, and 38 times as likely to be
more highly ranked if it is 10 ranks higher in the aggregate.
     To assuage concerns that the analysis above uses an in-sample prediction (for which there may
be some mechanical correlation), we also we rank schools based on the choice lists in 1987, and
then estimate the likelihood of a given school being listed as a preferred school in 2011 as a function
of its ranking in 1987. We estimate this using a rank ordered logit model on the 2011 choices in
which the 1987 ranking enters the model as the sole predictor. Because we use the rankings from a
different year, this model will understate the extent to which the individual choices are similar to the
average view. However, the patterns are very similar. The 1987 ranking is a powerful predictor of
rankings in subsequent years. A school is 33 percent more likely to be more highly ranked in 2011
if it is one rank higher in 1987, 2.4 times as likely to be more highly ranked in 2011 if it is three
ranks higher in 1987, and more than 19 times as likely to be more highly ranked in 2011 if it is 10
ranks higher in 1987.26 These patterns suggests that while parents may disagree regarding which

  26 Put differently, a rank reversal would occur only about 42 percent of the time for schools that were one rank apart
in 1987, under 30 percent of the time for schools that were four ranks apart in 1987, and less than six percent of the
time for schools that were ten ranks apart. Figure C2 shows the estimated likelihood that a parent would rank a school
above another school in 2011 as a function of the difference in the school rankings in 1987.

schools are most desirable among very similarly ranked schools, there is considerable agreement
regarding which group of schools are most desirable. To allow for the possibility that boys and
girls may have different preferences for schools, we examined differences by student gender and
the results are virtually identical.27
    Because the highest-achieving students are admitted to their top choices first, if most students
rank schools similarly, then the more preferred schools will also be more selective than the less
preferred schools. To show that this is borne out in the data, the right panel of Figure C1 presents
the cumulative distribution of the mean peer incoming BSSEE scores of students’ school choices.
The distribution of mean BSSEE scores of first-choice schools is to the right of the second-choice
schools, which is to the right of the third-choice schools, and so on. That is, parents and students
tend to place schools with higher-achieving peers higher up on their preference ranking. This is
further evidence that most parents agree on which schools are most desirable. As above, we allow
for the possibility that boys and girls may have different preferences for schools, we examined
differences by student gender, and the results are virtually identical. Given that the impact of
schools may differ by student gender, this is an important finding.




  27 We calculated revealed preference rankings pooling all BSSEE cohorts separately by gender. The correlation
between girls’ rankings and boys’ rankings is 0.996.

Appendix D. Do the Null Effects Generalize to the Average Stu-
dent?
    Because our estimated preferred school effects are based on applicants who score just above
or just below the cutoff for a preferred school, this local treatment effect may not reflect the ex-
periences of the average student at a preferred school. This limitation applies to 13 out of the 17
studies in Table 1 that rely on test score cutoffs to identify school impacts. In these studies (as
here) the estimated treatment effect is the impact of being the lowest scoring student at a preferred
school relative to being a more typical student at a less preferred school which may be different
from the average effect of attending a preferred school relative to a less preferred school. If so,
the small benefits to attending a preferred school for the marginal admit could be reconciled with
strong parental preferences for such schools if the average impacts were more positive than those
for the marginal student who scores just above the cutoff. Contributing to this literature method-
ologically, we implement a test for whether the estimated school impacts for the marginal students
are similar to those for the average student. While used for a different purpose, our proposed test is
similar to those used in Deming (2014) and Hastings et al. (2015) to validate observational school
impacts with quasi-random variation. This test will help potentially explain the null impacts we
find in Barbados and possibly other settings.
The Empirical Test
     We now introduce some notation. The impact of attending school j for the average student is
µ j1 while that for the marginal student is µ j2 . The outcome for marginal student i at school j is

                          Yi jt = µ j2 + f (BSEEit ) + Xi jt γ +C jt + Pi jt + εi jt                (11)

The estimated effect on outcome Yi jt of scoring above the admissions cutoff for any school j is
Γ j,actual = E(Yi jt |Above = 1) − E(Yi jt |Above = 0). Substituting (11) into this expression and taking
expectations, in the neighborhood of the cutoff yields

                        E[Γ j,actual ] = E(µ j2 |Above = 1) − E(µ j2 |Above = 0)                    (12)

In expectation, the RD estimate of scoring above the cutoff for school j simply reflects the differ-
ence through that cutoff in the attended school impacts for the marginal students. This is intuitive;
scoring above the cutoff for school j increases the likelihood of attending school j and reduces the
likelihood of attending the next preferred schools. If school j is no more effective for the marginal
admit (on average) than the next preferred schools, then the cutoff effect for school j will be zero.
Conversely, the cutoff for school j will only have a positive impact if school j is more effective at


                                                     45
improving outcomes for the marginal admit (on average) than the next preferred schools.
    Now consider impacts for the average admit, µ j1 . One can estimate the impact of school j for
the average student, µ j1 , in a value-added framework. Where Ii,J= j is an indicator variable equal
to 1 if student i attends school j, the outcome for average student i at school j is

                          Yi jt = Ii,J= j · µ j1 + f (BSSEEit ) + Xi jt γ +C jt + Pi jt + εi jt                     (13)

    One can obtain an estimate of the value-added of school j for the average attendee by estimat-
ing equation (13) by OLS. The resulting estimate µ̂ j1 is simply a school fixed effect that reflects
the school-level average outcomes after accounting for observable student characteristics such as
incoming test scores, choices, and demographics.28
     As discussed above, the RD estimate of scoring above the cutoff for school j on outcomes
reflects the difference through that cutoff in the attended school impacts (i.e. δ (µ j2 )/δ (Above))
for the marginal admits. We define Γ j,predicted as the difference through that cutoff in the estimated
value-added of the attended school (i.e. δ (µ̂ j1 )/δ (Above)) among those same marginal admits. If
(i) the value-added estimate is unbiased such that E[µ̂ j1 ] = µ j1 , and (ii) the effect of school j for the
marginal admit is the same as the average admit such that µ j1 = µ j2 , then (iii) in expectation, the
change in the average estimated value-added of the school attended through the cutoff for school
j should be equal to the actual change in outcomes through that cutoff.29 We test this empirically
by estimating Γ j,actual and Γ j,predicted for each school j across all the CSEC outcomes, and then
we regress one on the other. To avoid endogeneity, we use out-of-sample (or leave-year-out)
estimates of school value-added. If our school value-added estimates are biased, then the slope of
this regression will differ from 1. In addition, if the school impacts are different for the marginal
student from those for the average student, then this slope will also differ from 1. However, if (a)
our school value-added estimates are unbiased, and (b) the school impacts are the same for the
marginal student as for the average student, then the slope will be equal to 1.30
  28 Under  the assumption that E[εi jt |Ii,J= j , BSSEEit , Xi jt ,C jt , Pi jt ] = 0, this will be an unbiased estimate.
  29 One can estimate the impact of scoring above the cutoff for school j on the average value-added of the schools
students attend, µ̂ j1 , by replacing the actual outcomes with the estimated value-added of the attended school and
estimating the model below.

                               µ̂ j1 = ζ j · Abovei jt + f (BSEEit ) + Xi jt γ +C jt + Pi jt + εi jt                 (14)

The parameter ζ j is the difference in school value-added between those who score just above the cutoff for school j
and those who score just below. In the neighborhood of the cutoff, this is

                               E[ζ j |Xi , BSEEi ] = E(µ j1 |Above = 1) − E(µ j1 |Above = 0)                         (15)


  30 It
      is possible that biases in the school effect estimates are exactly offset by differences between the marginal and
average treatment effects so that the estimated coefficient appears to be 1 even when the marginal and average impacts


                                                               46
    Pooling the estimated impacts for each cutoff (preferred school) across all CSEC outcomes, we
plot the estimated impacts against the difference in school value-added in Figure D1. The estimated
slope is 0.97, revealing that on average the predicted impacts are very similar to the actual impacts.
The p-value associated with the null hypothesis that the slope is zero has a p-value of less than
0.001, and the p-value associated with the null hypothesis that the slope is 1 has a p-value of 0.836.
This is compelling evidence that the null impacts on short-run test scores are not because the impact
for the marginal student is more negative than that for the average student.31




differ. This would be a razor’s edge result and is extraordinarily unlikely. Accordingly, we assume that the probability
of such a situation is essentially zero.
   31 This test also serves as a validation of the school fixed effects (i.e. value-added estimates).
