             Productivity, R&D, and Basic Research
                at the Firm Level in the 1970s


                             ABSTRACT




     A new data et (the NSF—Census match) containing information on the

R&D expenditures, sales, employment, and other detail for approximately

1,000 largest manufacturing firms in the U.S. during 1957—1977 is

analyzed using a standard production function framework augmented by the

addition of an R&D "capital" and "mix" variables (basic as a fraction of

total and privately financed as a fraction of total). The results indicate

that R&D continued to contribute to productivity growth in U.S. manufacturing

also in the 1970's, with no significant decline in its effectiveness as com-

pared to the 1960's; that the contribution of the basic research component of

such expenditures was significantly higher than its nominal ratio would imply;

and that while federally financed R&D expenditures did have a positive effect

on measured productivity growth of these firms, this effect was significantly

smaller than the comparable contribution of privately financed R&D expenditures.

     This paper reports new results on the relationship of R&D expenditures,

especially expenditures on basic research, to productivity growth in U.S.

manufacturing firms during the 1970's. It is based on a new and unique data

set, the NSF R&D—Census match, containing information on R&D expenditures,

sales, employment, and other detail for approximately 1000 largest manufac-

turing firms from 1957 through 1977. It updates the earlier work of Griliches

(1980) on the precursor of this data set, replicates some of Mansfield's (1980)

work on the contribution of basic research to productivity growth using a

larger, more recent, and more representative sample of firms, and complements

similar work by Griliches and Mairesse (1983, 1984) based on a publicly acces-

sible but more limited data set.

     Two topics are explored in some detail:   (1) Is there any evidence of a

decline in the returns to industrial R&D expenditures, a decline in their

"fecundity" in the 1970's as compared to earlier time periods? And, (2) is

there evidence that basic research is a relatively more important component of

R&D and that there may have been an underinvestment in this component?

    A few background facts are worth stressing at this point. In the U.S.

total R&D expenditures in industry peaked (in real terms) around 1968, dropped
                                   —2—




slightly in the early 1970's and recovered somewhat in the late 1970's. Relative

to total sales, R&D expenditures in industry declined from 4.2 percent in 1968

to a trough of 2.6 percent in 1979 and then recovered to 3.7 percent by 1982.

This pattern masks a strong divergence between the trends in federally and pri-

vately supported industrial R&D. Federally supported R&D fell from 2.1 percent of

manufacturing sales in 1967 to 0.7 percent in 1979 and has only recently begun

to recover, while company financed R&D stayed essentially constant (relative

to industry sales) with almost all of the fluctuation coming from the decline

in federal support (NSF 1984). During the same period, the economy experienced

one of the sharpest and prolonged recessions of the post—war period. The

recession of 1974—75 was triggered by the first OPEC increase in energy prices

and resulted both in a large and pervasive productivity slowdown and large

amounts of unanticipated inflation. Most hard hit were the primary metals,

motor vehicles, and other heavy, energy related industries. On the whole,

these were the less R&D intensive industries, resulting in a probably spurious

relationship between R&D intensiveness and the productivity slowdown. (See

Criliches 1980 and Griliches—Lichtenberg 1984 for more discussion of these

issues.)

     The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. First I describe the

data set with its advantages and limitations and present some overall compara-

tive statistics. Second, I outline briefly the framework that underlies the

computations to be performed. The results are presented and discussed next

and the paper closes with some caveats and suggestions for further research.

 II. The Data

     The current project is an extension of work originally begun in the mid

1960s. That work was based on the matching of R&D data collected on behalf

of the NSF by the Bureau of the Census during 1957—1965 with additional com-

pany data from the 1958 and 1963 Census of Manufactures and Enterprise Statis-

tics. The universe consisted of large (1000 or more employees) R&D performing

U.S. manufacturing companies. The final sample of 883 of such companies

accounted for over 90 percent of total sales and R&D expenditures of all firms

in this universe. Because of the confidentiality of the individual data, the

final output was in the form of matrices of correlation coefficients and

standard deviations, broken down into six rather broad industrial groupings,

with no access by us to the actual individual observations.

     The main finding of that work (Griliches, 1980) was a rather consistent

and positive relationship between various measures of company productivity

and its investments in research and development. Cobb—Douglas type production

functions, estimated on both levels (1963) and rates of growth (1957—65)

yielded an elasticity of output with respect to R&D investments of about 27

percent (as of 1963), a significantly lower rate of return to federally financed

R&D expenditures, and no clear evidence of significant scale effects either in

R&D investment policies or the returns from it.

     In trying to extend the earlier study to the more recent time period

It became clear that the earlier work could not be simply updated, since the

earlier project tapes has been blanked inadvertently in the interim. Also, it

turned out that the 1958 and 1963 Census of Manufactures summaries could not

be retrieved in machine—readable form. Luckily, most of the original R&D

schedules could still be found, though they had to be repunched from scratch.
                                   —4—




Thus, what started out as a simple update, became an almost entirely new

data gathering and matching effort, of significantly larger dimension than

originally anticipated. Its basic objective was to create a matched body:

of data on most of the large R&D performing corporation in the U.S., making

it possible to analyze both the determinants and the consequences of R&D

spending over time. For this purpose a time series record has been created

for each company consisting of the major variables in the annual R&D survey

for each of the years 1957—1977, supplementary R&D information for selected

years (1962, 1967, 1972, and 1975), data from the Enterprise Statistics

(NCK—l) for 1967, 1972, and 1977, and a few additional items from the Census

of Manufactures establishment record summaries for 1967 and 1972.

     The universe of this data match consists of all "certainty" cases in the

1972 R&D survey. I.e., the basic definition is the population of companies as

they existed in 1972 (as against 1962 in the earlier study) and the requirement

of "certainty" assures that the Census Bureau tried to collect consistent data

for these firms for more than one year. The "certainty" cases correspond

closely to the earlier restriction to companies with 1000 or more employees,

though it is a bit more inclusive. There were approximately 1100 such companies

in 1972. A "complete" record, however, exists only for a much smaller number of

companies. A number of different matching efforts were involved: First, a

company's R&D schedules had to be matched over time. A company, however, may

not have existed over the whole period as an independent entity, or was not

in the R&D Survey in some of the years. Second, separate matches had to be

made to the Enterprise Statistics (NCK—l) and Census of Manufactures summaries

in 1967, 1972, and 1977. Each of these matches could fail individually, both
                                    —5—




because the relevant records may not have been found, and because the defini-

tions of a company on the different surveys may have been inconsistent (due

to different rules of consolidation, treatment of foreign operations, etc.).

     Given our interest in the analysis of productivity growth, our data can

be reclassified into: 1. Output measures (sales annually from HRD, value

added from Census of Manufactures for 1967, 1972, and 1977); 2. Employment

mreasures (total employment annually from HRD, manufacturing employment from

the Census in Census years); 3. Capital data (from Enterprise Statistics for

Census years); and 4. R&D data (annually from HRD, with additional mix detail

for 1962, 1967, 1972, and 1975). We have also added to the record price in—

dexes for the delfation of sales and value added, at the 2 1/2 digit NSF

recode detail (given in Table 1), derived from the BEA and BLS price indexes

tapes by 4—digit and input—output detail, an R&D deflator based on the method-

ology suggested by S. Jaffe (NSF 1972 and Griliches 1984), and investment

and capital stock deflators derived from various N]IPA publications.1

     Table 1 gives detail on the industrial composition of the panel and also

some indication of the relative success of the various matching criteria.

Roughly speaking, if one requires a good match for at least two Census years,

the effective sample size is down to about 500 companies, though for a variety

of cross sectional questions significantly larger sample sizes are feasible.

Table 2 lists the number of firms with good R&D data by individual year,

showing both the growth of the R&D collection effort over time and sample

attrition in recent years due to merger activity and sample redefinition.

Table 3 lists the means and variances for the major variables as of 1972. But

before we look at these number in some detail I need to describe the model and
                                   —6—




the analytical framework that will be used for their analysis. This is the

topic of the next section.




III. The Analytical and Econometric Framework2

      The work reported here focuses primarily on the analysis of productivity

growth for these companies, using a rather simple growth accounting approaëh

w1-rich an be summarized along the following lines:

(1)            Q =    TF(C,L),
(2)            T = G(K,O)

(3)            K =



where Q is output (sales, or value added), C and L are measures of

capital and labor input, respectively, T is the current level of (average)

technological accomplishment (total factor productivity), K is a measure

of the accumulated and still productive (social or private) research capital

("knowledge"), 0 represents other forces affecting productivity, Rt measures

the real gross investment in research in period t, and the wi's connect the

levels of past research to the current state of knowledge.

      For estimation purposes, the F and G functions are usually special-

ized to the Cobb—Douglas form and 0 is approximated by an exponential trend.

The whole model then is simplifies to



                  =

                                              —7—




where A is constant, A              is   the rate of disembodied ttexternal?t technical

change, and constant returns to scale have been assumed with respect to the

conventional inputs (C and L). Alternatively, if one differentiates the

above expression with respect to time and assumes that conventional inputs

are paid their marginal products, one can reqrite it as



(5)                f = q —     c—    (l—)l    =X+ ck


where f is the rate of growth of total factor productivity, lower—case
letters represent relative rates of growth of their respective upper—case

counterparts [x = C/X =         (dXldt)/X].      Equation (5) is a constrained version

of (4), with        ,   (the   observed factor share of capital) used to estimate the

true

       A number of serious difficulties. arise when one turns to the operational

construction of the various variables (see Griliches 1979 for more detailed

discussion). Perhaps the two most important problems are the measurement of

output (Q)   in   a research—intensive industry (where quality changes may be

rampant), and the construction to the unobservable research capital measure (K).

Postponing the first for later consideration, we note that K =

cn    be thought of as a measure of the distributed lag effect of past research

investments on productivity.             There are at least three forces at work here:

the lag between investment in research and the actual invention of a new tech-

nique or product, the lag between invention and the development and complete

market acceptance of the new technique or product, and the disappearance of the

technique or product from the currently utilized stock of knowledge due to
                                                           —8—




changes in external circumstances and the development of superior techniques

or products by competitors (depreciation and obsolescence). There is some

scattered evidence, based largely on questionnaire studies that such lags are

rather short in industry, where most of research expenditures are spent on

development and applied topics, and where the private returns from R&D become

obsolete much fasher due to the erosion of a firmts specific monopoly posi-

tion (Pakes and Schankerman 1984).

allowing one to rewrite (5) as

where p is the rate of return to research expenditures (the marginal product

of K) while                       is the net investment in research as a ratio to total out-

put. In practice, to make some connection between gross and net investment in

research one needs information about its "depreciation" which, if available,

would have allowed one to construct a measure of K in the first place. Note

that in estimating (5) or (5') one assumes that either a or p are constant
                                  —9—



espectively across firms or industries. It is not clear, a priori, which

is the better assumption.

     While our models are written as if the main point of research expenditures

is to increase the physical productivity of the firm's production process, most

of the actual research in industry is devoted to the development of new products

or processes to be sold and used outside the firm in question. Assuming that,

on average, the outside world pays for these products what they are worth to

it, using sales or value added as the dependent variable does in fact capture

the private returns to such research endeavours. However, the observed private

returns may underestimate the social returns because, given the competitive

structure of the particular industry, the market price of the new product or

process will be significantly below what consumers might have been willing to

pay for it. On the other hand, part of the increase in sales of an individual

firms may come at the expense of other firms and not as the result of the

expansion of the market as a whole. Also, some of the increase in prices

paid for a particular new product may come from changes in the market power

of a particular firm induced by the success of its research program. More-

over, some of the gains inproductivity or in the sales of new products may

be based on the research results of other firms in the same or some other in-

dustry. Such factors could result in the observed private returns overesti-

mating the social returns significantly. I will not be able to say much about

the net impact of such forces on the basis of the data at hand. This would

require a detailed comparison of the individual firm results with estimates

based on industry and economy wide returns to research, a topic beyond the

scope of this project. But since expected private returns are a determinant

of private investment flows into this acticity, this work is of some interest
                                          —10—




even if it cannot answer the social returns question unequivocally.

       One can also use this framework to ask whether different types of R&D

(private versus federal, or basic versus applied) are equally "potent" in

generating productivity growth. One way of answering this question is to look

at the "mix" of R&D expenditures and ask if it matters for the question at

hand. Let there be two types of R&D expenditures, R1 and R2 , and let

us assume that the overall analysis is in terms of the logarithm of total

R&D expenditurs but that we believe that R2 should have been weighted more,

given a          premium (or discount). That is, the right variable is



(6)                 R* =
                           R1
                                + (l+)R2 =   R(1+s),


where s =                is the "share" of R2 in total R = R1+R2.           Then the c logR*
                 R2/R
term can be approximated by c Log R* log R + cs.                     The sign and signif i—

cance of the "mix" term s, will give us some clue about the size and

magnitude of the 5 term.

       A similar argument can be made also in the context of a growth—rate

formulation. Let lower case letters denote growth rates. Then

r =
       (l—s)r1   + Sr2     while r* =
                                        (l—s)r1
                                                  +
                                                      (l+)sr2   .   If,   as is mostly the

case in our data, the growth rates of r1 and r2 are roughly equal, then

r* =   r(l+s),      and again, the coefficient of the "mix" term s provides us

with some information about the "premium" or "discount" on R2 since                   cr

can be approximated by



(7)                 cr*     (a+Ss)r + (aFS)s
                                 —1].—




     Given the pecularities of ou. data set ——   its   unbalanced nature (many

missing observations towards the beginning and end of the period) the avail-

ability of capital and value added only for Census years, the desire to

preserve comparability with the earlier study, and the difficulty of doing

elaborate programming inside the Census Bureau, I focus primarily on two major

dimensions of the data: levels (in 1967, 1972, and 1977) and growth rates,

and eschew any attempt at a complete annual data analysis. The annual data

are summarized by computing average growth rates for two subperiods 1957—65

(corresponding to the earlier study period) and 1966-77, based on regressions

of the logarithms of the relevant variables on time trends (solving thereby

the missing years problem within each of these subperiods).

    In implementing such a framework of analysis one has to deal with several

serious data problems: missing data, erroneous data and possible erroneous

matches, and mergers. Except for R&D data, no special effort was made to

replace missing values by various imputation procedures. It was our notion

that the basic data set represents what the Census did collect, what we

actually know, and that any imputation procedure should be done only in the

context of a particular research project where its implications for the final

analysis could be interpreted. As far as the R&D data are concerned, the

Census used the shuttle nature of the original questionnaires to fill in many

of the original blanks. To the extent that there remain missing values which

are not due to the fact that the whole company is missing before or after some

date, they were interpolated on the basis of the estimated growth rates (which

require at least f;ie good data points within each sub—period). For other

variables, missing values were not imputed It was not possible, within the

constraints of this project, to develop optimal imputation procedures.     This

would have required several repeated passes at the original numbers.      Instead,
                                        —12—




 the analysis is based either on reduced "clean" samples or on "pairwise

 present" correlation coefficient matrices.

     From an econometric point of view, we have eo deal with the problem of

 firm effects (or firm specific left—out variables) and the possibility that

 the relationships we are trying to estimate may not stay constant either

 across firms or across time. The first is handled by analyzing first differ-

 ences or growth rates, transformations that eliminate any unchanging effects

 from the model. The second problem, the problem of differences across firms,

 is handled in part by calculating a measure of "partial" productivity growth

 [BPT =   y — (1   —)   ], using   individual firm data on the share of labor in

 total costs. One can also estimate separate and different parameters for

 the various industry groupings and include some of the other variables avail—

 alie in the record which might distinguish one firm's environment and response

 pattern from another's (such as its specialization ratio, size, or vertical

 integration). The main hypothesis under investigation, that the returns to

 R&D investments may have declined over time, is tested both by comparing

 estimates based on the more recent data with the earlier results, and by

 allowing      and testing for systematic changes in the estimated relationships

 between the three available cross—sections.




 IV. Major Results

     Before I present some of the preliminary results derived from this data

base it may be useful to review both its structure and the main outlines of

what happened in the 1970's. Table 3 is intended to describe three aspects

of these data: 1. The general characteristics (means and standard deviations)
                                   —13—




of the sample as of 1972; 2. average rates of growth of the major variables

of interest during the 1967—77 period; and 3. how these measures change when

the sample is chngd to select observations according to the availability of

the requisite information.

     Turning to the last topic first, note that we tend to lose smaller and

more R&D intensive firms as the sample gets more restrictive. Matrix 1 corres-

ponds to the most liberal ctiterion: a firm had to exist in 1972 and report

positive R&D to be included in this sample. Matrix 2 requires both the ability

to compute a growth rate for the 1967—77 period (i.e.   ,
                                                            at   least five good time

series observations) and a successful match to the 1972 Census of Enterprise

data (NCK—l). Matrix 3 adds to this also the requirement of a successful match

to the 1977 Census data while Matrix 4 asks for a match with the 1967 Census

instead of the 1977 one. Most of the difference occurs in the transition

from Matrix 1 to Matrix 2 where trying to match to the Census we lose a re-

latively large number of smaller firms for which there are still data on the

R&D Survey files.   The. firms that can be also found in 1977 are slightly larger

and have had a somewhat higher rate of growth in employment, R&D, and produc-

tivity. The firms that also existed in 1967 are even larger but have on

average grown somewhat more slowly than those that exited only in the 1972—77

period. If we look at two of our major variables or interest, partial pro-

ductivity growth and the ratio of basic to total R&D, there is almost no

difference in their means across the relevant matrixes (2, 3, and 4) and hence

it is unlikely that subsequent conclusions will be subject to a serious sample

selection bias. I will, therefore, ignore this topic for the purposes of

further discussion here.

    Looking at the levels of the variables in 1972 we see that the average
                                  —14—




firm in the sample is quite large with 5000+ employees: it employs close

to a hundred R&D scientists and engineers, and is making only a relatively

modest investment of its own money (about 2.5 percent of sales) in R&D, with

very little of that, less than 3 percent, being devoted to Basic R&D.3 This

picture is somewhat misleading, however. The actual distribution of firms

is quite skewed, with a small number of larger firms spending much larger

amounts on both total and basic R&D.       Looking at growth rates one can

observe that on average these firms grew only moderately during this period:

about 1 percent per year in total employment, about 2.5 percent per year in

partial productivity, and almost zero growth in deflated R&D expenditures

(though a slightly positive rate of growth in the number of R&D scientists

and engineers). Here again, while on average there is little movement, there

is a great deal of variability at the individual firm level. The standard

deviations of the rates of growth of partial productivity and total R&D are

3.5 and 8 percent per annum respectively, with many firms growing much faster

(and also much slower) than the average.

     Looking at some of the R&D ratios over time, not reported in Table 3,

one cannot see any significant decline in the rate of private investment in

R&D. While the total R&D to Sales ratio falls from .042 in 1962 to .035 in

1972 (in matrix 4) and again from .032 in 1972 to .029 in 1977 (matrix 3),

the CRS (company financed R&D to sales) ratios are essentially unchanged

(.025 in 1962 and 1972 in matrix 4 and .023 in 1972 and 1977 in matrix 3.)

On the other hand, while the BR ratio fell only modestly, from .033 to .031

between 1962 and 1972 (in matrix 4) and from .027 to .023 between 1972 and

1977 (in matrix 3), coupled with the decline in the overall total R&D to Sales

ratio this implies about a 40 percent reduction in the relative intensity of
                                 —15—




industrial investment in basic research, relative to industry sales. Almost

all of this decline came from the overall decline in federally financed R&D

which declined from about 55 percent of total R&D in industry in 1965 to

about 35 percent in 1982. The federal government financed about 32 percent of

all basic research in industry in 1967 but only 19 percent in 1982 (see NSF,

84—311). The reduction was so steep that basic research in industry declined

not only relative (to sales) but also absolutely, from a peak of $813 million

in 1966 (in 1977 dollars) to a trough of $581 million in 1975 and did not

surpass the 1960's levels until the early 80's. How one interprets the con-

sequences of such declines depends on one's view of the relative productivity

of governmentally financed R&D expenditures in industry, a topic I will be

exploring below.

     Let us look now at the first set of substantive results. Table 4 reports

the results of estimating cross—sectional production functions (eq. 4) sepa-

rately for each Census year, adding to the standard capital and labor variables

a measure of total R&D capital accumulated by the firm and two R&D "mix"

variables: the fraction of total R&D that was spent on basic research and the

fraction of accumulated R&D which had been financed privately. All the reported

estimates allow for 18 to 20 (depending on the matrix) separate industry inter-

cepts. The first and last two columns report estimates which are based on the

same number of firms and use the same dependent variables, differing only by

the year of observation. The two middle columns present additional estimates

for 1972 based on different sample and dependent variable definitions with the

main intent being to show that the major conclusions are insensitive to such

differences. There are three major points to be made about these estimates:

1. The stock of R&D capital contributes significantly to the explanation of
                                  —16—




cross—sectional differences in productivity and there is little evidence of

a decline in its coefficient over time.3 There is a minor rise in the esti-

mated coefficient from 1967 to 1972 and a somewhat larger but not really

significant deddine from 1972 to 1977. Given this particular measure of R&D

capital, based on a 15 percent per year declining balance depreciation formula

(the results are insensitive to the particular formula used), the implied

average (at the geometric mean of the sample) gross rate of return to R&D

investment rises in a similar fashion from .51 in 1967 to .62 in 1972 (in

matrix 4) and falls from .39 in 1972 to .33 in 1977 (in matrix 3). In either

case the estimated rate of return is uite high and there does not appear to

be any dramatic fall in it over time.

     The second major finding is the significance and rather large size of the

basic research coefficient. It seems to be the case that firms that spend a

larger fraction of their R&D on basic research are more productive, have a

higher level of output relative to their other measured inputs, including R&D

capital, and that this effect has been relatively constant over time. If any-

thing, it has risen rather than fallen over time. Using the formulation of

equation (6) in Section III implies a very high premium on basic versus the

rest, a 5 of between 2.5 to 4.5, a several hundred percent premium on

basic research. Before I explore the implications of this result, I want

to examine some other dimensions of these data and see whether similar effects

can be observed there too.

     The last major result of interest is the significant positive coefficient

on the privately versus federally financed R&D mix variable. This variable is

of most import for the older more established firms in matrix 4, but its sign
                                   —17-




 is consistent throughout, indicating a positive premium on privately financed

 R&D, or equivalently a discount as far as federally financed expenditures are

 concerned. Here the implied premium is smaller, between 50 and 180 percent,

but still quite large.

     All the above results were based on cross—sectional level regressions

which are subject to a variety of biases, the main one being the possibility

that "rich" successful firms are both more productive and can afford to spend

more of their own money on such luxuries as P&D and especially the basic

variety. One can reduce somewhat the possibility of this type of bias by

focusing on firm growth rates, the changes that occurred, rather than on

their levels. To the extent that firms have idiosyncratic productivity co-

efficients which may be also correlated with their accumulated R&D levels,

considering growth rates is equivalent to doing a "within" firms analysis,

one that eliminates such "fixed effects" from the analysis. The next two

tables present, therefore, the results of analyzing the growth in the partial

productivity of these same firms during the whole 1966—77 period.

     Table 5 presents the results of estimating partial productivity equations

in the largest possible sample (matrix 6) and in the sample with a successful

1972 Census match (matrix 2). Here again we find our three main results con-

firmed: the R&D growth term and the two mix variables: the basic research

ratio and the fraction of research financed privately all contribute signi-

ficantly to the explanation of productivity growth.

     On the assumption that the growth rate in the stock of R&D is roughly

proportional to the growth in deflated R&D itself, the coefficient of BTRD

should be estimating the same number as the coefficient of the R&D stock

variable in Table 4.   The results are in fact surprisingly close: about .12
                                     —18—




in Table 5 as against .09 to .17 in Table 4. Moreor, there seems to have

been no decline in this coefficient relative to the earlier 1957—65 period.

In the previous study (Griliches 1980) I estimated the same coefficient to

be .073. In the current replication and extension of this sample a similar

equation for 1957—65 yields a BTRD coefficient of .086.

Thus, if anything, the coefficient of R&D went up between the early 60's and

the early 70's.

     The second major finding of interest is the positive and significant

basic research coefficient. It is hard to interpret its magnitude since the

approximation outlined in Section III breaks down when the average growth rate

of deflated R&D and of basic R&D is close to zero or negative. Consider,

however, the following illustrative calculation. Raising the BR ratio by one

standard deviation, from .026 to .097 at the mean, would increase the rate

of growth of partial productivity by close to half a percent per year

(.071 x .059 =    .0042).   This same increase would raise the growth of total R&D by

.107 for one year and would contribute a once and for all increase in the level

of productivity of .0125. Discounting the more "permanent" effect of basic re-

search by a real interest rate of .05 yields an "equivalent" one year effect

of .084, or a 7 to 1 ratio in favor of basic research! If one allows for

industry dummies which in this formulation represent separate industry trends

of disembodied technical change, the effect of basic research is cut by about

50 percent, implying perhaps that a significant fraction of the estimated

effect comes from spillovers which diffuse throughout the industry. Note that

it is the only coefficient that is affected substantively when separate industry

dummies are allowed for. Nevertheless, even a 3.2 to 1 ratio is quite high!
                                   —19—




      The third finding is the significant positive premium on company financed

 R&D. Here too the impled premia are quite high, but given that the mix variable

 is defined in terms of stocks rather than flows the calculations are more cum-

bersome. Consider starting from a zero growth position and a .7 ratio of

private to total R&D stock. To move this fraction from .7 to .75 we would

need to raise the private stock by 29 percent and the overall stock by 20 per-

cent (without reducing absolutely the stock of federally financed R&D capital).

There are different possible investment paths that would achieve this goal and

would have somewhat different present value consequences. If one roughly

doubled the rate of privately financed R&D expenditures, from the previous

replacement level of .105 (.7 x .15) to .205, one could achieve this target

in slightly over two years. Ignoring discounting, this would lead to a once

and for all growth in productivity of .024, due to the growth in the total

stock of R&D and a .0011 permanent increase in the rate of growth due to the

shift of the fraction private ratio from .7 to .75. The present value of this

second term is about.022, or of the same order of magnitude as the first term.

That is, raising the stock of R&D by 20 percent but shifting it all into the

private component doubles the effect of such dollars.

     There are problems, however, with such an interpretation. If private R&D

expenditures contribute more to productivity growth, one might have thought

that when they are substituted for the total R&D growth measure they might fit

better and also have a higher coefficient. But that is not the case as can be

seen from the results presented in columns 2 and 5 of Table 4. The total R&D

measure does a little bit better both in terms of fit and in the overall size

of its coefficient, implying that the contribution of federal dollars is not
                                  —20—




zero. That is perhaps what one should expect. Most of the direct output of

federal research dollars is "sold" back to the government at "cost plus"

and is unlikely to show up as an increase in the firm's own productivity. Thus

all that one could expect to measure here are the within firm spillover effects

of such expenditures. What we may be detecting is that such effects are indeed

present and positive but we should not have expected them to be of the same

order of magnitude as would be the case for the firm's own investments in im-

proving its productivity or profitability.

     There are a number of eocnometric questions that can be raised about the

robustness and sensitivity of such results. I will discuss only a few of

these here. The most obvious question arises from the fact that even though

I allowed, in the growth rates version, for separate firm intercepts and dif-

ferent industry trends, I am still assuming common R&D and conventional capital

coefficients across rather different industries. This is done from necessity

rather than as a virtue. Estimating the same models industry by industry

reduces the sample sizes drastically and raises greatly the relative noise

level, making it rather hard to interpret the resulting estimates.    Neverthe-

less, these estimates, which are summarized in Table 6, are quite consistent

with the earlier story: 17 out of the separately estimated 19 coefficients

for the R&D growth variable are positive and more than half of them are

statistically significant at conventional significance levels. Similarly,

the coefficients of the basic research ratio variable are positive in 14

of our 19 industries and significant in over a third of them.   The

fraction private variable is less robust to the division of the sample

into industries, with more than half of the coefficients still positive,

but only four of them are statistically significant within particular
                                        —21-




industries. Two     of   these industries are indeed the ones where one would

expect to find such an effect, aircraft and electronics, industries where the

bulk of federal monies is spent. Nevertheless, it seems that the effect that

is being caught by the fraction private variable has an important industry

component, something that had been already noted in the earlier study

(Griliches 1980), as does also the effect associated with the basic research

variable, though to a lesser extent.

     A number of other versions were computed using the growth in capital

services rather than the depreciation and age composition variables which had

been used to keep the results comparable to the earlier study, and the growth

in R&D "capital" rather than the flow (and also different definitions of such

"capital"). I also estimated versions using the "intensity" form for the R&D

variable, to make it more comparable to other studies in the literature

(Griliches—Lichetenberg 1984, Mansfield 1980, and others). By and large the

results of these alternatives were somewhat weaker but not substantively dif-

ferent. Perhaps the most interesting alternative estimate is the intensity

version using the growth of capital between 1967 and 72 as its capital measure:

BPT6677 =   ...   .243ACRS +    .045 ABR +     .18ODLCS   See = .0316
                  (.069)       (.024)          (.130)     (Matrix 4)


where ACRS is the average company R&D to sales ratio, averaged over 1967 and

1972. ABR is a similar average basic to total R&D ratio, and DLCS is the rate

of growth in deflated capital services between 1967 and 1972. This version is

closest in form to the kind of equations estimated by Mansfield (1980) on much

smaller samples. The basic results are similar, however. Basic R&D is a

significant contributor to productivity growth with an implied basic to company
                                  —22—




premium of about 5 to 1 (given an average R&D to sales ratio of .035).

     The final set of results to be presented here, in Table 7, relate to the

relative profitability of our firms in 1972 and 1977. The dependent variable,

GRR, is the ratio of gross profits (value added minus labor costs and plus

R&D) to total gross fixed assets. The independent variables include the ratio

of R&D capital (undepreciated) to total fixed assets and our ubiquitous R&D

mix variables: the basic research and fraction private ratios. Even though

the dependent variable is quite different the overall results are rather

similar to the earlier ones. The R&D capital variable is positive and almost

always statistically significant though its coefficient is a bit low if it is

to be interpreted as a rate of return to it. The basic research variable is

both large and significant though possibly too large to be credible. Given that

the ratio of total R&D capital to total fixed assets is only about .05 on average

in 1972 the estimated coefficients imply a      of about 30 to 60. The frac-

tion private ratio also contributes positively to profitability but its effect

largely disappears once industry differences are allowed for. The results for

1977 are weaker than those for 1972, the residual variance is significantly

higher, but they too suggest the importance of basic research even in this

context. A similar analysis was performed using an estimate of the net rate

of return as the dependent variable, subtracting depreciation from the numera-

tor of GRR and using a net stock concept for the denominator and also in the

definition of the R&D capital variable. While the fit was significantly worse

when using this definition of the dependent variable, the overall results were

rather similar. The net return version was also available for 1967 and the

results using it indicate a relatively constant and significant coefficient

for the basic research ratio while the coefficient of the total R&D stock rises
                                  —23—




from 1967 to 1972 and than falls again in 1977 (from .11 to .16 and down

to .06). It is doubtful whether these fluctuations represent real trends or,

more likely, reflect the larger noise level in the 1977 data and the changing

composition of these samples. In any case, the profitability regressions

are consistent with the productivity level and productivity growth rate

based results described earlier (Tables 4, 5, and 6).




V. Discussion and Summary

     The three major findings of this paper: that R&D contributed positively

to productivity growth and seems to have earned a relatively high rate of

return, that basic research appears to be more important as a productivity

determinant than other types of R&D, and that privately financed R&D expendi-

tures are more effective, at the firm level, than federally financed ones,

are not entirely new or very surprising. The first finding has been documented

in a number of earlier studies (see Griliches 1980, Griliches and Mairesse

1984, Link l98la, and others). What is new in this paper in this regard is

a confirmation of this finding on a much larger and more recent data set. It

also presents evidence for the view that this effect has not declined signi-

ficantly in recent years, in spite of the overall slowdown in productivity

growth and the general worry about a possible exhaustion of technological

opportunities.

     The evidence for a t7premium't on basic research is much more scarce. The

major previous paper suggesting this type of a result is Mansfield (1980)

which uses aggregate data for 20 industries for 1948—66 and data for 16 firms

during 1960—76 and finds a significant premium on basic research, on the order
                                  —24—




of 2 to 1 at the industry level and 16 to 1 at the firm   level.   (See also

Link 1981b for similar results for 1973—78 based on data for 55 firms.) In

this paper I get similar though somewhat smaller effects at the firm level,

using a much larger and more representative sample. I also find that differ-

ences in levels of productivity and profitability are related to differences

in the basic research intensity of firms.

     Such findings are always subject to a variety of econometric and sub—

stantive reservations. In this context the two major related issues are

simultaneity and the question how can major divergences in private rates of

return persist for such long periods. It is possible to argue that it is

not R&D, or its basic research component, the casues firm "success" as measured

by productivity and profitability but rather that success allows firms to

indulge in these types of luxury pursuits. It is difficult to argue about

causality on the basis of what are essentially correlational data. It is

possible to use simultaneous equation techniques to estimate such models but

then the argument shifts to the validty of the exogeneity assumption for the

particular instruments. In the context of our specific data set it is hard to

think of any valid instruments except for possibly lagged values of the same

variables, which raises some problems of its own. The best evidence for the

notion that these results are not entirely spurious is provided by the growth

rates where the individual firm levels are partialed out of the analysis. But,

here too, one could argue about the impact of common unanticipated "luck"

elements. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that one could use lagged growth rates

as instruments since there is very little correlation in growth rates over time

at the firm level. While an attempt will be made in further work with these

data to estimate more extended simultaneous equations versions of such models,
                                   —25—




 I am not too optimistic as to what can be accomplished in this regard. The

 evidence presented here should not be interpreted as "proving" that R&D, and

expecially its basic component, are important for productivity growth but

rather as presenting some prima facia evidence in support of such an inter-

pretation. In this sense it is an exercise in economic rhetoric (McCloskey

1983).

     It is even more difficult to respond to the theoretical a priori argument

that such results cannot be true since they imply widely differing rates of

return to different activities under the control of the same firms. One's

response to this depends on one's views as to the prevalence of equilibria in

the economy. While it is likely that major divergences in rates of return are

eliminated or reduced in the long run, the relevant runs can be quite long.

R&D as a major component of firm activity was undergoing a diffusion process

in the 1950's and 1960's and may not have reached full equilibrium even by the

end of our period. This may be especially true of the basic research component

where the risks are much greater and the uncertainty introduced by changing

government policies and the changing economic environment make it quite diff i—

cult to decide what is the right level for it.

     A somewhat different version of this argument would claim that the world

is indeed in approximate equilibrium but that different firms face different

opportunities for doing research, basic or otherwise, are in different ecologi-

cal niches, and hence have different coefficients in their "production

functions." This would explain why different firms are observed to spend

different amounts on R&D while actually earning about the same rate of return

on it. When a constant coefficients production function is fit to such data

it will fit because it is approximating a market equilibrium relation. If the
                                  —26—




level of R&D invested were independent of the coefficient then such a

function would just reproduce its average share and not produce any evidence

of excess returns. But if, as is reasonable, R&D is invested optimally with

firms which have better opportunities, higher coefficients, investing more,

this will induce a positive correlation between R&D and its individual co-

efficient and lead to an upward bias in the estimated "average" coefficient.4

The resulting "larger" coefficient, larger than the observed factor share,

will be interpreted, wrongly, as implying a higher rate of return than is

actually prevailing at the individual level.

     This argument may be recognized as a version of the earlier attacks on

the Cobb—Douglas production function combined with a random coefficients

interpretation of the same phenomenon. In its extreme form it is testable.

Since there are time series data available for individual firms one could try

to estimate individual firm parameters and check whether they are in fact

distributed as is predicted by this particular argument. While individual

parameters are unlikely to be well estimated, given the relative shortness of

the available times series, the parameters of the distribution of such coef-

ficients might be estimable with more precision. I intend to pursue this

possibility in further work.

     To restate again the major points of the paper: A newly available body

of data on all the major R&D doing firms in the U.S. has been examined and

evidence has been presented for the proposition that R&D contributes signifi-

cantly to productivity growth, that the basic research component of it does

so even more strongly, and that privately financed R&D expenditures have a

significantly larger effect on private productivity and profitability than
                                    —27--




federally financed R&D. These findings are open to a number of reservations.

Nevertheless, they do raise the issue that the overall slowdown in the growth

of R&D and the absolute decline in basic research in industry which occurred

in the 1970's may turn Out to have been very costly to the economy in terms

of foregone growth opportunities.

Dep. variable: BPT 6677 = trend growth rate of deflated sales minus the
               trend growth of total employment multiplied by the share
               of payroll in total sales.

BTRD — trend growth of deflated total R&D expenditures
BCRD — same for company financed R&D expenditures
B/R — basic research expenditures as of fraction of total research expenditures.
FP   — ratio of company financed R&D stock to total.
SEE — residual standard error.

All equations contain also a term reflecting the variance of R&D and terms
representing the growth of physical capital: age composition and depreciation
as   of 1972.

 1. See Griliches—Hall, 1982, and Hall 1984 for more details.

 2. This section borrows heavily from Griliches 1974.

3. Here and subsequently, all statements about statistical "significance"

should not be taken literally. Besides the usual issue of data mining clouding

their interpretation, the "samples" analyzed come close to covering completely

the relevant population. Tests of significance are used here as a metric for

discussing the relative fit of different versions of the model. In each case,

the actual magnitude of the estimated coefficients is of more interest than

their precise "statistical significance."

4. A positive correlation is not enough, but itself, for a positive bias.

The weight of an individual firm slope coefficient in the cross—sectional

estimate is proportional to the square of the deviation of R&D stock from

its mean. A positive correlation between levels does not translate itself

directly into a positive correlation between the level of one variable and

the square of the other, except for certain skewed distributions. Since we

do not observe the individual coefficients directly, it is rather difficult

to check out this conjecture.
