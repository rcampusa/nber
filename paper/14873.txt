The entry of married women into the labor force is one of the most notable economic phenomena of
the twentieth century. We argue that medical progress played a critical role in this process. Improved
maternal health alleviated the adverse effects of pregnancy and childbirth on women's ability to work,
while the introduction of infant formula reduced mothers' comparative advantage in infant feeding.
We construct economic measures of these two dimensions of medical progress and develop a quantitative
model that aims to capture their impact. Our results suggests that these advances, by enabling women
to reconcile work and motherhood, were essential for the rise in married women's participation and
the evolution of their economic role.

1       Introduction
The entry of married women into the labor force is one of the most notable economic phenomena
of the twentieth century and has led to a revolutionary change in women’s economic role. We
examine the contribution of advances in reproductive medicine and infant feeding to this process
and find that they played a critical role.
     Our point of departure is that, up until the early decades of the twentieth century, poor
maternal health and lack of reliable alternatives to breast feeding made it particularly hard to
reconcile motherhood and work outside the home. Consider a typical woman born around 19001 .
She married at 21 and gave birth to more than three live children between age 23 and 33. The
high fetal mortality rate implied an even greater number of pregnancies, so that she would be
pregnant for 36% of this time. Health risks in connection to pregnancy and childbirth were
severe. Septicemia, toxaemia, hemorrhages and obstructed labor could lead to prolonged physical
disability and, in the extreme, death. In 1920 one mother died for each 125 living births. At
a rate of 3.6 pregnancies per woman, the compounded risk of death from maternal causes was
2.9%2 . For every death, twenty times as many mothers were estimated to suﬀer diﬀerent degrees
of disablement annually. Many maternal conditions had very long lasting or chronic eﬀects on
health, hindering women’s ability to work beyond their childbearing years. In addition, due to
the lack of reliable alternatives, most infants were exclusively breast fed. Women would then be
nursing for approximately a third of the time between age 23 and 33. Since the average time
required to feed one child ranges between 14 and 17 hours per week, with a 40 hour workweek,
mothers would be nursing for 35%-43% of their potential working time in childbearing years.
     Not surprisingly given this burden, few married women worked. Only 5.4% of married women
aged 25 to 34 were in the labor force in 1900. Starting with this cohort, married women experienced
a significant rise in labor force participation, as shown in Figure 1. Married women’s participation
rose from 2.8% in 1890 to 70% in 1990 during childbearing years and beyond, leading to a sizeable
increase in lifetime participation. By contrast, participation for never married women was a
relatively high 59% in 1900 and rose at a much slower pace, reaching 85% in 1990. We argue
that the improvement in maternal health and the diﬀusion of infant formula were critical to this
process. Both these dimensions of medical progress begin to exert their impact in the 1930s and
are mostly exhausted by 1960.
     The improvement in maternal health was mostly the result of general scientific and medical
advances in the early 1900s. The development of bacteriology, the introduction of sulfominydes
and antibiotics, and the diﬀusion of blood banks dramatically decreased the death rate from sepsis
and hemorrhage. More specific interventions, such as the standardization of obstetric practices
and the increased availability of pre-natal care, reduced the incidence of hypertensive disorders of
pregnancy and obstructed labor, a causal factor for many forms of post-partum disability. These
developments lead to a stark decline in maternal mortality and a rise in the female-male diﬀerential
in life expectancy at age 20 from 1.5 years in 1920 to 6 years in 1960. The improvement in maternal
health also led to a decline in stillbirths, which in turn reduced the number of pregnancies required
to achieve the desired fertility. To quantify the eﬀect of improved maternal health, we estimate
the burden of maternal conditions based on historical data on the incidence and duration of the
    1
     Data from Historical Statistics of the United States, Hauser (1976) and Glick(1977). See the Data Appendix
for detailed information and sources for all data used in the Introduction.

     The probability of survival to age 42 in 1920 was 75%. (Bureau of the Census, United States Abridged Life
Tables 1919-1920). Thus, maternal causes account for 12% of the death hazard at age 42.

corresponding symptoms, combined with the World Health Organization measure of the intensity
of the corresponding disablement. We construct an index of the decline over time in this burden
based on the evolution of maternal and fetal mortality. According to our estimates, the years lost
to disabilities associated with maternal conditions declined from 2.31 per pregnancy in 1920 to
just 0.17 in 1960.
    The development and commercialization of infant formula were the result of progress in nutri-
tion and pediatrics, specialties that developed at the turn of the twentieth century to reduce infant
mortality. The first type of "humanized" formula, so called because it replicated the nutritional
content of human milk, was first commercialized in the late 1920s. We construct a measure of
the time price for infant formula using newly collected data from historical newspapers. The time
price declines by 82% between 1935 and 1960, and remains approximately constant thereafter.
This decline can be interpreted as a measure of the progress in infant feeding over this time period.
Infant formula reduces mothers’ comparative advantage in infant care.
    We incorporate these measures of medical progress in a quantitative model to assess their
role in accounting for the rise in labor force participation of married women. The model hinges
on two critical components. First, agents can make a pre-marital investment in market skills,
which increases their future productivity. Prior to this investment, men and women are equally
productive in market work. Additionally, married households engage in the production of infant
goods, that is activities strictly connected to the presence of infants in the household, including
pregnancy, childbirth and infant feeding. Only wives can contribute to the production of infant
goods during child bearing years. The time required for infant good production is given by the
time associated with pregnancy, childbirth and post-partum conditions, plus the time for infant
feeding. While the first component is taken as given, households choose whether to breast or
bottle feed. Bottle feeding requires infant formula, instead breast feeding does not generate any


                                                                                 3
pecuniary costs. The time and expenditure required for infant good production are scaled by
the number of children, which is exogenous in the model. Households also produce general home
goods, that is activities such as meal preparation, cleaning, and other chores. Wives and husbands
have equal ability in general home good production and their individual contribution is determined
eﬃciently, based on their relative opportunity cost in terms of foregone labor earnings.
    Medical progress aﬀects women’s participation in the model in two ways. The corresponding
reduction in the burden of maternal conditions and, via the decline in the time price of infant
formula, the adoption of bottle feeding have a direct positive eﬀect on married women’s partic-
ipation during childbearing years. This is turn increases women’s incentives to invest in market
skills before marriage, raising their potential wage relative to their husbands. As a consequence,
married women’s participation rises in all stages of the lifecycle, their earnings relative to men
rise, and their contribution to general home production also declines.
    To assess the quantitative relevance of this mechanism, we simulate the model, confronting
overlapping generations of agents with the estimated historical series for the burden of maternal
conditions and the time price of infant formula. The initial point is calibrated to match US data
on participation, home hours and earnings by gender, as well as breast feeding rates and adoption
of home appliances in 1920. We run several experiments to evaluate the impact of each dimension
of medical progress in isolation. Following Greenwood, Seshadri and Yorugoklu (2005), we also
allow for advances in general home production, as proxied by the decline in the time price of
appliances.
    We find that medical progress is indeed a powerful force. The decline in the burden of maternal
conditions alone can generate the fourfold increase in the labor force participation of married
women in childbearing years between 1920 and 1965. This result hinges on the critical role
of medical progress in enabling married women’s participation to rise contemporaneously with
fertility during the Baby Boom, between 1940 and 1960. The eﬀect of infant formula on female
participation is positively related to the fertility and the burden of maternal conditions. If fertility
is high and maternal mortality is low, women have an incentive to participate and this is when
infant formula appears to be most valuable. The decline in the time price of infant formula adds
up to 10% to participation in child bearing years in 1960 at the peak of the Baby Boom. Despite
the more than ten-fold decline in the time price of home appliances in the course of the twentieth
century, their diﬀusion cannot account for the contemporaneous rise in fertility and participation
of married women between 1940 and 1960, though it plays a more significant role between 1960
and 1975.
    Our simulations imply that progress in reproductive medicine and infant feeding alone could
drive married women’s participation close to 50% as early as 1965. In the data, this threshold is
attained after 1970. It is not surprising that the model overpredicts married women’s labor force
participation between 1935 and 1965, since we abstract from a number of factors that had an
adverse eﬀect on participation in those years. These include “marriage bars,” which were in place
for female employees until World War II (Goldin, 1990), wage discrimination (Goldin, 2002), as
well as cultural forces, such as aversion of women in the workforce (Fogli and Fernández, 2009)
and a bias against working women in the marriage market (Fernández, Fogli and Olivetti, 2004).
Similarly, the model under-predicts participation relative to the data after 1980. Again, this is
not surprising since the dimensions of medical progress we consider are mostly exhausted by 1960,
while starting in the late sixties several additional factors emerged. These include the diﬀusion of
oral contraception (Goldin and Katz, 2002), shifts in the labor market that favored women (Blau
and Kahn, 1999), and an attenuation of the cultural biases against working women. We quantify


                                                   4
these forces by computing their impact on the return to pre-marital investment in market skills in
the model. We find that marriage bars and negative cultural forces active between 1935 and 1960
are equivalent to a 50% reduction in the returns to pre-marital labor market investments relative
to the calibrated value. On the other hand, the favorable shifts in the labor and marriage market,
and the other positive forces operating starting in the 1970s, are equivalent to a 46% increase in
the returns to pre-marital investment in market skills in the model.
    Our analysis makes several contributions. It is the first to consider the impact of improved
maternal health and infant feeding on the evolution of married women’s labor force participation.
While these forces began to exert a tangible eﬀect on women’s lives in the early 1930s, when
married women’s participation also started to rise systematically, the public health initiatives and
the scientific discoveries that led to these advances date as far back as the mid 19th century and
largely preceded the rise in married women’s participation. By contrast, the diﬀusion of home
appliances largely occurred after World War II and may well have been driven by rising demand
from working women.3
    From a theoretical standpoint, we isolate dimensions of medical progress that disproportion-
ately aﬀect women’s health and incorporate them into a macroeconomic model of household
behavior to quantify their impact. In our model, both the division of labor within the household
and gender diﬀerences in wages are endogenous. Thus, we are able to generate predictions for the
joint evolution of women’s home hours, labor force participation and earnings relative to men.
This constitutes a step forward relative to the existing literature. Jones, Manuelli and McGrattan
(2003) examine the eﬀect of a declining gender wage gap on married women’s participation in
the post-war period, but they treat this gap as exogenous. Greenwood, Seshadri and Yorugoklu
(2005) examine the impact of advances in home appliances on female participation and treat both
the household division of labor and gender wage diﬀerentials as given. By contrast, biological
factors are the only source of gender diﬀerences in our model. Our work relates in this dimension
to Galor and Weil (1996) who examine the impact of the rise in jobs that require intellectual
rather than physical skills, in which women have a biological comparative advantage.
    Finally, we also make an empirical contribution by constructing an economic measure of the
burden of maternal conditions and its evolution over time based on historical data on maternal
morbidity that had not been previously used in economics. Our methodology is related to the
literature on the eﬀects of health on growth (Weil, 2007, and Ashraf, Lester, Weil, 2008). In
addition, we collect new historical data on the price of infant formula to measure progress in
infant feeding.
    While we treat fertility as exogenous, it is reasonable to presume that the demand for children
was aﬀected by such a dramatic decline in their cost. The fact that the sharp reduction in
maternal mortality between 1935 and 1955 precedes the mid twentieth century Baby Boom by
a handful of years is likely not coincidental. Indeed, Albanesi and Olivetti (2009) find that the
rise in fertility during the years between the late 1930s and the early 1960s was highest for US
states and cohorts of women that experienced the greatest improvements in maternal health. In
this paper, we concentrate on the role of improvements in maternal health and infant feeding in
enabling married women to participate in the labor force despite their high fertility. Albanesi and
Olivetti (2009) analyze instead the impact of medical progress, in the form of reduced maternal,
infant and child mortality, on fertility decisions.
    The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly describes the medical advances responsible
for the improvement in maternal health and documents the diﬀusion of infant formula. This

price of infant formula. Section 3 presents our analytical framework. Section 4 discusses our
calibration strategy and presents the results of our quantitative analysis. Section 5 concludes.


2       Evidence on Medical Progress
We now document the two components of medical progress that contributed to alleviate the time
commitment associated with women’s maternal role: the advances in reproductive medicine that
reduced the burden of maternal conditions and the introduction and diﬀusion of infant formula.
The detailed list of sources and references for this section can be found in the Data Appendix.

2.1     Advances in Maternal Health
The risk of temporary or permanent disability, and potentially death, associated with childbirth
implied that mothers were subjected to a very significant health toll (Loudon, 1992, and Leavitt,
1986) until the early decades of the 20th century. In 1921, septicemia (40%), toxemia (27%),
obstructed labor (10%) and hemorrhages (10%) were the main causes of maternal death. Sepsis,
toxaemia and obstructed labor were also the leading causes of maternal morbidity and gave rise to
the most debilitating conditions associated with the child bearing process, such as puerperal fever,
neurological disorders, rectovaginal fistula and other severe forms of perineal lacerations.4 Ob-
structed labor was very common, due to pelvic deformation from poor nutrition, and contributed
to imperil the health of the child, as well as that of the mother.
    We now examine the impact of medical progress on maternal mortality and female life ex-
pectancy and then construct a measure of the burden of maternal conditions and describe its
evolution over time.

2.1.1    Maternal Mortality and Female Life Expectancy
The number of maternal deaths dropped from 690 to 7.1 per 100,000 live births between 1915
and 1995. The decline in maternal mortality started in 1933 and continued precipitously in the
ensuing decades. In 1940, maternal mortality had declined by 39% relative to 1933, and by 90%
in 1953. Figure 2 shows the evolution of maternal mortality by cause. The most striking decline
occurs for deaths due to sepsis, which drop from 275 in 1923 to 5.5 per 100,000 live births in 1955.
All other factors of mortality also drop in this period.
    Several factors contributed to the decline in maternal mortality5 . The first is medicalization
and hospitalization of childbirth. Physicians gradually entered the birth room starting in 1850,
and after 1935 births increasingly took place in hospitals. The intervention of physicians did not
initially contribute to a reduction in maternal mortality.6 Excessive operative interventions and
their exposure to other patients with communicable diseases actually increased the risk of infection
before germ theory was widely accepted and antibiotics were available. However, the involvement
of physicians eventually led to the development of standardized obstetric practices that reduced
    4
     Mothers rarely survived hemorrhages before blood banking was introduced.

birth on maternal mortality.

the incidence of trauma during labor7 . Scientific discoveries and advances in general medicine
starting in the 1930s had a particularly positive eﬀect on maternal health. The introduction of
sulfonamide drugs (1935), blood banking (1936) and the discovery of the antibiotic eﬀects of
penicillin (1939-1942) were critical for the remarkable decline in maternal mortality. Infection
could now be easily treated and transfusions could replace blood lost in hemorrhages. Improved
pre-natal care determined a decline in the incidence of death by toxaemia. The generalized shift
from home to hospital of childbirth also occurred in the mid-1930s, with the advent of electronic
imaging and advanced neonatal therapies that could only be administered in a hospital setting.
The percentage of births that took place in hospitals rose from 36.9% in 1935 to 82% in 1946 and
to 94.4% by 1955 (see Table 1 in Taﬀel, 1984.)
    The decline in maternal mortality was associated with a sizeable rise in the female-male
diﬀerential in adult life expectancy at age 20 starting in 1930, as shown in Figure 3. Between
1900 and 1930, the female-male diﬀerential in life expectancy at age 20 is approximately constant,
despite the substantial decline in the overall mortality rate, which dropped by 42% for men and
by 36% women.8 Maternal mortality declined by 5% between 1900 and 1930, while it declined by
84% between 1930 and 1960, when the decline in overall mortality was twice as large for women
   7
      The New York Academy of Medicine published in 1933 a shocking study of 2,041 maternal deaths in childbirth.
At least two-thirds, were found to be preventable. There had been no improvement in death rates for mothers in
the preceding two decades and newborn deaths from birth injuries had actually increased. The investigators found
that many physicians simply didn’t know what they were doing. The White House followed with a similar national
report and this precicipated the eﬀorts to standardize obstetric practices and train physicians.
    8
      Noymer and Garenne (2000) show that the drop in the female-male diﬀerential in life expectancy between 1915
and 1920 is a consequence of the influenza epidemic of 1918 on female-male mortality diﬀerentials for tuberculosis.
Influenza increased mortality associated with tuberculosis. Though in general tuberculosis mortality rates were
higher for men, they increased for women during the influenza outbreak of 1918, temporarily closing the gender
gap.

than for men. Consequently, the female-male diﬀerential in life expectancy at age 20 more than
doubled over this period. The decline in maternal mortality can explain two-thirds of the rise
in the female-male diﬀerential in life expectancy, and the correlation coeﬃcient between the two
series is -0.94, significant at the 1 percent level.
    Life expectancy and adult survival rates are a widely used index of health and linked to
labor productivity. Based on this evidence, improvements in health resulting in increased life
expectancy are also associated with a decline in the burden of disease while alive.9 On this basis,
we construct an index of the burden of maternal conditions and its evolution over time.

2.1.2    Burden of Maternal Conditions
The variety of possible debilitating conditions associated with pregnancy and childbirth implies
that it is extremely diﬃcult to provide a comprehensive assessment of the toll of childbearing on
women’s health and labor market performance.10 A small number of hospital based studies from
the late 1920s oﬀer detailed information on incidence and duration of the most common ailments.
We use this evidence to construct a measure of the burden associated with maternal conditions.
    Our measure is based on the concept of years lost to disability (YLD) developed by the World
Health Organization (WHO):
                                      Y LD = I × D × DW,
   9
    Weil (2007) oﬀers an excellent discussion and review of the literature on the impact of health on productivity.
  10
    The World Health Organization estimates that even today 42 percent of the women who give birth annually
experience at least mild complications during pregnancy. Despite the large numbers of women who are aﬀected
by such morbidity, especially in developing countries, systematic measures of the economic impact of maternal

where I is incidence and D represents duration. The variable DW, which stands for disability
weight, is an index of the degree of disablement associated with a disease. A value of 0 stands
for perfect health and 1 for death.11 We interpret the YLD associated with each pregnancy as a
time in which mothers would be unable to participate in the labor force.
    Based on the hospital based studies from the 1920s, 12% of all live births generated some form
of maternal morbidity (Kerr, 1933). Perineal lacerations from obstructed labor were the most
debilitating and prevalent maternal condition, accounting for 67% of all cases of morbidity (or 8%
of all live births). The duration of complaints ranged from seven months for rectovaginal fistula,
to 3.5 years for other perineal lacerations and up to 7-13 years for prolapse of the uterus with an
average duration of 55.67 months.12 The WHO disability weight for rectovaginal fistula is 0.43.
This is a relative large number, considering that the disability weight for blindness is 0.60 and the
one for AIDS is 0.505. These conditions were prolonged but mostly temporary. Other conditions
that were common give rise to severe and chronic disablement. For example, the disability weight
for neurological sequelae of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (corresponding to toxaemia and
related conditions) is 0.38 in childbearing years and increases with age, reaching 0.468 at 60+
years of age. The disability weight for severe anaemia resulting from a maternal haemorrhage is
0.09 until the end of life. The disability weight for a healthy pregnancy is 0.22.
    To calculate the total years lost to disability for maternal conditions, we combine the historical
data on incidence and duration with the WHO age specific disability weights. We obtain two
values, one for childbearing years (age 14 to 44, based on the WHO definition) and one for
post-childbearing (age 44 to 60+).

                                             Y LD14−44 = 1.17,
                                               Y LD44+ = 1.09.

    This measure of YLD provides an estimate of the per pregnancy burden. To obtain the total
burden for the temporary conditions, we have to adjust for the overall number of pregnancies.
This is greater than the number of live births, and this diﬀerence is particularly important in
early years due to the high incidence of stillbirths and neonatal deaths.
    We measure the lifetime number of live births with the Total Fertility Rate (TFR), a widely
used measure of completed fertility based on live birth registration data.13 To estimate the corre-
sponding number of pregnancies, we make two adjustments. The first corrects for measurement
error, which was a serious issue in birth registration (Loudon, 1992). Specifically, we use the
neonatal mortality rate at less than 1 week to measure under-registration.14 The second adjust-
ment estimates the number of pregnancies from the number of live births, corrected for measure-
ment error. Specifically, we use the stillbirth rate to measure the probability of an unsuccessful
pregnancy.15 Letting nt denote the neonatal death rate at less than 1 week in year t and st

      See Jones and Tertilt (2007) for an extensive discussion of lifetime fertility measures.
   14
      Since no guidelines were available, children that had died by the time of registration were often registered as
stillbirths even if born alive and many births simply went unregistered. According to Woodbury (1926), births fell
short of their true value by 8.7%. Our adjustment is quite conservative as it implies a 3% rate of under-registration
in 1920.
   15
      The stillbirth rate only includes fetal deaths in which the period of gestation was 20 weeks or more. See Data
Appendix for details.

the stillbirth rate, the number of pregnancies for each live birth is (1 + pt ), with pt = nt + st ,
and Pt∗ = T F Rt ∗ (1 + pt ) for completed fertility. Many of the stillbirths and neonatal deaths
were caused by maternal conditions, especially toxaemia and obstructed labor, so the resulting
adjustment is quite significant for the early years. In 1920, each live birth was associated with
1.07 pregnancies. This implies that while the T F R was 3.26, the number of pregnancies equaled
3.55 in 1920.
    The advances in reproductive medicine led to a decline in the burden of maternal conditions.
We construct a time series of this burden based on the evolution of maternal mortality. The
implicit assumption is that maternal disability declined at the same rate as maternal mortality.16
Our estimated time series for the lifetime burden of maternal conditions per pregnancy during
and beyond childbearing years is:

                                                   b̄t = Y LD14−44 × M̃t ,                                                                 (1)
                                                                   44+
                                                   bt = Y LD             × M̃t ,

where M̃t = M Mt /M M1920 and M Mt is the maternal mortality rate in year t.
    Figure 5 plots M̃t , while Figure 4 displays T F Rt and (1+pt ). The time series for bt are plotted
in Figure 8. Both the decline in maternal mortality and the reduction in stillbirths alleviate the
burden associated with maternal conditions. Stillbirths declined from 4% of live births in 1930 to
2% in 1953, a trend driven by improved pre-natal care (O’Dowd and Phillipp, 1994) and a fall in
the incidence of obstructed labor. The number of pregnancies per live birth drops from 1.07 in
1920 to 1.01 in 1950. Thus, (1 + pt ) ∗ M̃t can be taken as an index of progress in maternal health.
  16
     Obviously this is not ideal but, given the absence of time series data on maternal morbidity, we think that this
is a reasonable assumption.

2.2    Advances in Infant Feeding
Until the early decades of the 20th century, most infants were breast fed. The only two alternatives
were wet nurses or cows’ milk. By the end of the 19th century, both these options were deemed
inadequate.17 The new discoveries in physiology, bacteriology and nutritional science in the second
half of the 19th century revealed a connection between infant mortality, poor nutrition, and
tainted water and milk supplies. A variety of public health initiatives in the major urban areas
were undertaken with the purpose of reducing infant and child mortality from gastrointestinal
diseases18 . Eﬀorts to develop a substitute for breast milk for infants whose mother had died
spurred commercial and scientific interest in the development of infant formulas, even as breast
feeding was prescribed as the best practice.
    The discovery that cow’s milk is a very poor alternative to human milk constituted a significant
breakthrough in infant nutrition.19 The first chemical analysis of cow’s milk in 1838 revealed that
it was too high on proteins and too low on fat and carbohydrates relative to human milk. This
discovery led to the first generation of cow’s milk modifiers, such as Leibig’s, Nestle’s and Mellin’s
infant food, introduced commercially between the 1870s and the 1890s. These products contained

     After a failed attempt to regulate wet nursing by instituting certified directories in the late 19th century,
concerns about transmission of siphylis and other deseases led to its virtual disappearance by the mid-twentieth
century. See Golden (1996) for more details.
  18
     The first federal law on the purity of food supplies was passed in 1906. The establishment of Children Bureau
in 1912 strongly contributed to the furthering of this agenda. By 1920, milk pasteurization had become the norm
in most states, and by 1940 most metropolitan areas had developed sources of untainted drinking water and sewage
disposal systems. See Wolfe (2001). These developments were a necessary condition for the diﬀusion of water based
infant formulas.
  19
     See Packard and Vernal (1982), Apple (1987) and Schuman (2003) for a detailed account of the history of infant
formula in the United States.

a combination of malt, wheat flour and sugar to be mixed with hot cow’s milk, and were strongly
opposed by pediatricians who worked to develop more scientific methods for modifying cow’s
milk. The most successful was Rotch’s “percentage method,” the medical gold standard for
infant feeding between 1890 and 1915. This formula was so complex that it was mostly prepared
in milk laboratories and distributed through pediatricians.
    The most important innovation in infant feeding occurred in the early 1920s when two pedia-
tricians succeeded in creating a water based infant formula that exactly reproduced the content of
fat, proteins and carbohydrates in maternal milk. The first two brands of so called "humanized"
infant formula, SMA (simulated milk adapter) and Similac (similar to lactation) are still sold
today. The humanized formulas were approved by the medical profession and were promoted as
nutritionally equal to human milk and more convenient for mothers.20

2.2.1    Changes in Breast Feeding Practices
The introduction of eﬀective and easy-to-prepare infant formulas induced a remarkable shift from
breast to bottle feeding starting in the 1930s. We rely on several sources to document this phe-
nomenon, including in-depth studies of US localities in the 1910s and hospital discharge records.
The details on the data sources and the construction of the series are described in the Data
Appendix, Section 6.7.
    Figure 6 displays the trend in incidence and duration of breast-feeding. We report information
on in-hospital partial and exclusive breast-feeding rates,21 and on breast-feeding rates at 6 months.
Until 1930 over 90% of newborns were breast fed. This fraction declined precipitously over the
next few decades. By 1956, the in-hospital breast-feeding rate had dropped to 37%, further
declining to 25% by 1971. The decline was greater for exclusive breast-feeding rates and at longer
breast feeding durations. The in-hospital exclusive breast-feeding dropped from 88% in 1920 to
21% in 1956 where it hovered until 1970. The percentage of infants breast fed at six months also
dropped substantially - from 74% in 1920 to 3.4% by 1971. The dramatic change in breast-feeding
practices occurred across all socioeconomic and demographic groups and independently from the
labor force status of the mother (see Hirschman and Butler, 1981.)22
    The evidence on trends in the use of commercially prepared formulas is only available since the
1950s. The fraction of infants who were fed commercial formulas at 1 week of age increased from
23% in 1955 to 77% in 1971 (Martinez and Nalezienski, 1979.) The fraction of 2 to 3 month-old
infants fed on commercial formulas increased from 30% in 1958 to 70% in 1970 (Fomon, 2001.)
    The incidence of breast feeding increased substantially between 1975 and 1983 owing to new
medical findings on the immunization properties of human milk, as well as a series of highly
publicized cases of metabolic dysfunction linked to infant formulas.23 After a decline during the
second half of the 1980s, breast-feeding rates continued to rise steadily.24 However, the increase
  20
     The name Similac was proposed by Morris Fishbein, the editor of the Journal of the American Medical Asso-
ciation in the 1920s (Schuman, 2003).
  21
     For 1918 the “in-hospital” figures refer to babies breast fed before 1 month of age. The "exclusive" breast-
feeding rate includes children who are fed only human milk. The breastfeeding rate includes infants who receive a
combination of breast milk and formula.
  22
     For example, they document that between 1950 and 1970 breast-feeding rates declined both for working and
for non-working mothers, although non-working women were more likely to breast feed for more than 3 months.
  23
     These cases prompted the passage of the Infant Formula Act of 1980 which established standards for many
nutrients in formulas and mandated extensive testing (Schuman, 2003.)
  24
     The diﬀusion of breast pumps likely contributed to this trend. Although rudimental breast pumps
existed since the 16th century, the first successful mechanical pump for humans was introduced in

occurred mostly for in-hospital breast feeding rates. Exclusive breast feeding and its duration
remains substantially lower today than they were in the early decades of the 20th century.25

2.2.2    Price of Similac
We measure progress in infant feeding with the decline in the opportunity cost of infant formula,
or time price. To construct this measure, we collect data on the monetary cost of infant formula
from historical advertisements from the Chicago Tribune, the Los Angeles Times and the Wash-
ington Post.26 The advertisements provide information on price, quantity and type of formula
in drugstore chains such as Walgreens and Stineway. The price observations refer to items on
sale, hence, we interpret them as a lower bound. We combine monthly observations by city into
a yearly aggregate series. The time price of infant formula is obtained by deflating the monetary
price series by hourly wages in manufacturing.
    Figure 7 plots the estimated time price of Similac starting in 1935, the first sample year. We
focus on Similac because it was the first commercially available humanized formula to become
popular. In 1975, 52% of infants receiving commercial formulas were fed Similac (see Table III in
Fomon, 1975.)27 The value of 2 for the time price in 1935 means that the cost of 1 liquid ounce

  25
     Evidence from the 2002 National Immunization Survey confirms these trends (see Li, Darling, Maurice, Barker
and Grummer-Strawn, 2005).
  26
     This information is available from ProQuest Historical Newspapers Chicago Tribune (1849-1985), Los Angeles
Times (1881-1985) and The Washington Post (1877 - 1990). We are grateful to Claudia Goldin for suggesting this
data source. The details about the construction of the price series are discussed in the appendix.
  27
     SMA did not achieve great popularity in the U.S, and in 1975 it accounted for less than 12% of the market for
commercially prepared formulas (Fomon, 1975). Enfamil, was launched in 1959.

of Similac corresponds to 2% of the hourly wage in manufacturing in that year. This time price
declined by an average of 6.6% per year between 1935 and 1960, and remained approximately
constant thereafter.
    The decline in the time price of formula determined a reduction in the total cost of bottle
feeding. Table 1 summarizes the average monthly cost of bottle feeding in 1936, expressed in 2000
USD. The calculations account for the variation by weight and age of the quantity of formula
required. See the Data Appendix for the details. The total cost of bottle feeding a boy of median
weight during the first year of life in 1936 ranged between $340-455, corresponding to 6-10% of
average yearly income of white, male, full time year round salaried workers.28 By 1960, this cost
had fallen to less than 1.5% of average yearly labor income.

    The decline in the time price of infant formula between 1935 and the mid 1950s may explain
the large drop in breast feeding rates over the same period. The potential impact of the availability
and diﬀusion of infant formula on mother’s time-use is very significant. First, breast feeding is
a time intensive activity. Based on accounts from pediatric journals, the average time spent for
each feeding ranges from 20 to 30 minutes. Given the number of required daily feedings by age,
the total feeding time for a child in the first year of life totals 700 to 900 hours, corresponding
to an average 13.6 to 17.3 hours per week of mother’s time, a very considerable fraction of a 40
hour workweek. This estimate is consistent with historical time use evidence in Brossard (1926)
and Wilson (193-), who report that infant feeding added 15 and 17 hours of home production,
respectively.29 Additionally, infant feeding needs to be administered at specific times.
    The diﬀusion of infant formula does not reduce the time that must be devoted to infant feeding,
though it potentially removes this burden from the mother, since other household members or
child care providers can attend to this task. Combined with the reduced burden from maternal
conditions, the advances in infant feeding arguably contributed to relax the constraints on married
women’s labor force participation. The rest of the analysis explores this hypothesis in the context
of a quantitative model.


3        Theory
The economy is populated by overlapping generations of agents who diﬀer by intrinsic labor
productivity, ξ, and gender, j = f, m. Each cohort lives for L > 2 periods and is split equally by
gender. The distribution of labor productivity is the same across genders. All agents belong to
a household which comprises one male and one female. Household preferences are defined over
household consumption, c, and individual leisure, lj for j = f, m, and are represented by the
following lifetime utility function:
                                            L
                                            X            ³              ´
                                                  β r−1 u cr , lrf , lrm ,
                                            r=1

where                                   ³          ´      X ¡ ¢
                                       u c, lf , lm = c +  v lj .
                                                               j=f,m

The function v (·) is continuous, twice diﬀerentiable, strictly increasing and strictly concave. The
parameter β ∈ (0, 1) represents the per period discount factor.
   Leisure is defined as:
                                          l = T − pn̄ − h,
where T is the individual time endowment, p ∈ [0, 1] denotes the fraction of time spent in the
labor force, n̄ is the fixed number of work hours if employed, and h denotes home hours.
    Home hours are applied to the production of two goods, an infant good, I, and a general home
good, G. Infant good production corresponds to activities connected to the presence of infants
in the household. The time required for infant good production includes the time commitment
    29
    The study of professional women in the Washington D.C. area in Brossard (1926) suggests that an infant would
add a minimum of 15 hours of home production per week for feeding and cleaning to a maximum of 31 hours
also including bathing, dressing, changing and pacifying. We are grateful to Valerie Ramey for pointing us to this
source.



                                                          15
associated with pregnancy, childbirth and the burden of maternal conditions, as well as infant
feeding. General home goods correspond to the usual notion of home production, that is chores
such as meal preparation, cleaning, yard work and so on. We do not model preferences for home
goods and simply assume that their level of production is exogenously given30 and generates a
demand for inputs, specifically home hours, that in turn depends on the choice of production
technology. We now describe this framework in detail.

3.1      Infant Goods
The time required for infant good production comprises two components. The first, denoted
with b, includes the time for pregnancy, childbirth and post-partum disabilities, which we take
to correspond to the burden of maternal conditions. The second component, denoted with f,
represents the time required for infant feeding.
    The component b is taken as given by the household and varies with age:
                                         ½
                                            b for 1 ≤ r ≤ LI ,
                                    br =                                                    (2)
                                            b for LI < r ≤ L.

The years in the range {1, 2, ...LI } correspond to the fecund period of life in which childbearing
occurs. The component f also varies by age:
                                           ½
                                             φ for 1 ≤ r ≤ LI ,
                                     fr =                                                       (3)
                                             0 for LI < r ≤ L,

since infants are only present during childbearing years. The values of {b , b̄} and f will be
calibrated based on the evidence in Section 2.1.2 and 2.2.
    We assume that households choose the technology for infant feeding. The variable τ Ir ∈ [0, 1]
corresponds to this choice. If τ Ir = 0, infants are exclusively breast fed, whereas if τ I = 1, infants
are exclusively bottle fed. If τ Ir is interior, households choose a combination of breast and bottle
feeding. There is no monetary cost associated with breast feeding, while q I is the cost of exclusive
bottle feeding, which corresponds to the expense for the required infant formula. Therefore,
household expenditure on bottle feeding is q I τ I .
    The total demand on the wife’s time for infant good production at age r ≤ L is given by:
                                             ¡ ¢         ¡        ¢
                                        hfr I τ Ir = br + 1 − τ Ir fr > 0.                          (4)
While bottle feeding reduces the time devoted to infant good production by the wife, we assume
that it increases the time required for general home good production, since it can be equivalently
carried out by the wife or the husband, as we describe below.

3.2      General Home Goods
Let H denote the labor required for general home production. Spouses contribute according to:
                                                ∙³    ´ζ        ¸1/ζ
                                          H=      hf G + (hm )ζ      ,                              (5)

 30
      We will make this level depend on the number of children in the quantitative exercise.



                                                         16
where ζ ∈ [0, 1] and 1/ (1 − ζ) is the elasticity of substitution between the husband’s and wife’s
time. Their contribution is symmetric, as represented by the equal weighting in (5).
    The level of H depends on the technology used for general home production and, in childbear-
ing years, for in infant feeding. The choice of technology for general home production is denoted
with τ G ∈ [0, 1] , where τ G = 0 denotes the "old technology" and corresponds to fully manual
general home production, while τ G = 1 corresponds to a mechanized "new technology" that relies
on home appliances. For households in their childbearing years, the time needed for bottle feeding
is also included in the time required for general home production. Thus, the demand for labor in
general home production is given by:
                                      ¡         ¢    ¡        ¢
                                    Hr τ G , τ I = gO 1 − τ G     G        I
                                                            r + τ r gN + τ r fr ,                      (6)
for r = 1, 2, ..L. Here, gN and gO with gN < gO represent the time that must be devoted to chores
under the new and old, respectively, technology for general home production. The old technology
only requires labor input, while the new technology also requires market goods, specifically home
appliances. We denote with q G the relative price of home appliances associated with the new
technology. The corresponding household expenditure on these goods is τ G    G
                                                                          r q .
    We now describe the household’s problem.

3.3      Household Problem
Spouses have the same level of intrinsic labor productivity ξ. Their wages also depend on a pre-
marital labor market investment, denoted with e ∈ [0, 1]. This investment should be interpreted
broadly, as any action or decision that serves to increase lifetime earnings, including formal
education, pre-marital labor market experience, occupational training and so on. The parameter
εj > 0 represents the initial returns to pre-marital investment and is allowed to be gender specific,
consistent with empirical evidence.31 We allow for these returns to depreciate over time at a rate
that is inversely related to cumulated labor force participation. This implies the following wage
function for an agent with intrinsic productivity ξ:
                                             ³        Sr−1     j
                                                                     ´
                                  wrj (ξ) = ξ 1 + εj δ s=1 (1−ps ) ej ,                          (7)

for j = f, m and r = 1, 2, ..L. The parameter δ ∈ (0, 1) corresponds to the geometric rate of
depreciation.
          ¡ If an¢ agent’s participation is equal to one in all prior periods, her wage at age r is
simply: ξ 1 + εej . If the agent temporarily drops out of the labor force, the wage depreciates
at rate δ. This feature of the model captures the concavity of the wage profile over the life
cycle documented in Goldin (1989) and Eckstein and Wolpin (1989) and is consistent with our
interpretation of pre-marital investment to include work experience.
    Investment in market skills induces a utility cost, represented by c (e) , where c (·) is a twice
continuously diﬀerentiable, strictly increasing and convex function. Since men’s participation
rate
  µ is one in all periods,
                     ¶
                             the wife/husband ratio of wages within a household is wrf /wrm =

marital labor market investment.

Thus, substituting this constraint in the utility function yields the following problem for the
household:

3.4    Market Production and Equilibrium
At each date t, a continuum of identical, perfectly competitive firms produce consumption goods,
C, infant formula, KI , and home appliances, KG , and according to the technology:

                                      θIt KI,t + θG

where θlt for l = I, G are the marginal rates of transformation between consumption and the goods
used in home production. The variable Nt corresponds to per capita aggregate labor supply in
eﬃciency units given by:
                                          T
                                          X X Z

                                          r=1 j=f,m ξ


where pjr,t (ξ) and wr,t
                     j
                         (ξ) denote labor force participation and eﬀective productivity, respectively,
of an individual of age r = 1, ..L, gender j = f, m and productivity ξ at date t.
    Let w̄t correspond to the average economy-wide wage at date t, given by:
                                            T
                                            X X Z             j
                                    w̄t =                    wr,t (ξ) dΓ (ξ) .                          (11)
                                            r=1 j=f,m ξ

Firm optimization implies that (9) holds with equality and that for l = I, G :

                                                 qtl /w̄t = θlt ,                                       (12)

for all t. Thus, θIt and θG
                          t correspond to the relative price, or time price, of infant formula and
home appliances at date t.

households {r, ξ} , firms maximize profits, and the markets for infant formula, home appliances
and consumption clear.

    The sequence of interest rates {Rt }t is exogenous in the model. The demand for KI , KG
is a function of the pattern of technology adoption. Bottle feeding and adoption of the new
general home technology generate a demand for a fixed quantity of formula and home appliances
that varies linearly with the rate of adoption. The linearity of preferences in consumption and
linearity of the production technology ensure that the time price of the market goods used in
home production does not depend on the level of demand.

3.5    Skills, Participation and Home Hours
This framework is parsimonious, yet it is suﬃciently rich to allow for an endogenous allocation of
home hours across spouses and an endogenous gender wage diﬀerential. This is a significant step
forward relative to standard macroeconomic models of household decisions that simply assume a
particular pattern of home hours by gender or treat gender earnings diﬀerentials as a parameter.
    We now analytically derive some key properties of the model from the solution to the house-

decisions.
    The first order necessary conditions for eﬀort and participation for δ = 1 are:

    Equation (13) clearly shows that pre-marital investment in market skills increases with lifetime
participation by the convexity of c(·). Similarly, by equation (14) and the concavity of v(·),
participation is increasing with investment in market skills, generating a positive complementarity
between pre-marital investment and participation. Equation (14) also implies that participation
is decreasing in the burden of maternal conditions and the time devoted to infant feeding, for a
given the wage.
    The time devoted to infant good production by the wife at age r depends on br as well as on
the choice of infant feeding technology. The evidence in Section 2.1.2 suggests that b̄ > b > 0,
since the burden of maternal conditions is greater in childbearing years and certain maternal
conditions are chronic. By (2) and (3), women’s participation will be lower in childbearing years
than post-childbearing, and even in post-childbearing years will be lower than men’s, consistent
with the data.
    The condition that pins down the allocation of home hours devoted to general home production
depends on the labor market behavior of the wife. If she is in the labor force, that is pfr > 0, the

                                    hm r          (1 + εm )

for δ = 1. Then, if the wife’s wage is lower than the husband, ef < em , she will have greater home
hours, hfr G > hm                                      f

                                          hmr          v 0 (lrm )
Thus, a particularly low value of the wife’s leisure, for example during childbearing years, tends
to increase the husband’s home hours.
    These equations clearly identify the mechanism through which medical progress influences
women’s pre-marital investment in market skills, participation and home hours in the model.
The advances in reproductive medicine lead to a reduction in the burden of maternal conditions,
that is a decline in br . Progress in infant feeding corresponds to a decline in the time price of
infant formula, θIt , and induces households to adopt bottle feeding. These factors have a positive
direct eﬀect on married women’s participation during childbearing years. This in turn increases
women’s pre-marital investment in market skills raising their wage relative to their husbands. As
a consequence, married women’s participation rises in all stages of the lifecycle, their contribution
to general home production also declines, and their earnings relative to men rise32 .
    We now evaluate the quantitative relevance of this mechanism.


4        Quantitative Analysis
To quantitatively evaluate the impact of progress in reproductive medicine and infant feeding on
married women’s labor force participation, we calibrate the model to match key statistics on labor
force participation, infant feeding, home production and gender earnings diﬀerentials in 1920, and
then simulate the model between 1920 and 1995, feeding in the historical evolution of the burden
of maternal conditions, the time price of infant formula, the total fertility rate, as well as the time
price for home appliances. We examine the eﬀect of these factors jointly, and then we run several
counterfactual simulations to assess the contribution of each of these forces in isolation.
    We begin by describing our calibration strategy in detail.

4.1      Calibration
We make the following assumptions on functional forms. The utility from leisure and the disutility
of eﬀort are given respectively by:
                                                   l1−ψ
                                       v (l) = ψ 0      ,
                                                   1−ψ
with ψ 0 , ψ ≥ 0,
                                                   e1−γ
                                       c (e) = γ 0      ,
                                                   1−γ
    32
    Given that the production technology is linear in labor input, the entry of women into the labor force does not
aﬀect labor demand. As women invest in labor market skills and enter the labor force average productivity and
economy-wide output rise.

     The model has sixteen parameters: β, ψ 0 , ψ, n̄, γ 0 , γ, εf , εm , δ, b, f, ζ, gO , gN , ξ̄, σ ξ . In
addition, the equilibrium in 1920 also depends on the lifetime path for the time price of infant

formula, θIr r=1  , and home appliances, θG r r=1 , confronted by all agents alive in 1920, as well
as on the interest rate R. We set the yearly discount and interest rates to 5%, which implies
β = 1/R = 0.78.
     The remaining parameters are estimated based on historical evidence or chosen to match the
value of key statistics for the U.S.A. in 1920, including participation of married women, home
hours by gender, breast feeding, diﬀusion of home appliances and gender earnings diﬀerentials.
The resulting values of all parameters are presented in Table 3. The data used for the calibration
are described in detail in the Data Appendix.

4.1.1       Demographics, Preferences and Wages
The demographic parameters are set to match childbearing behavior. Specifically, agents enter
the model at age 23, the median age of first birth in 1920. The childbearing stage of life ends
at age 33, which corresponds to the age of last birth in 1920. The years between age 34 and 63
correspond to the post-childbearing stage of life33 . We assume that the model period corresponds
to five calendar years, so that LI = 2 and L = 8.
    The labor supply parameters are set as follows. The total time endowment T is normalized
to 1, and n̄ is set to 40/112, based on a 40 hour work week and 112 hours of active time per
week. The parameter ψ is set to match a Frisch elasticity of labor supply for men equal to 0.1.
This delivers ψ = 17.25 and implies that married women’s Frisch elasticity in the model is 0.25
in 1970. These values are well within the range reported in Blundell and MaCurdy (1999).
    We set the returns to pre-marital investment in market skills based on the estimated returns
to labor market characteristics in Goldin (1990).34 Specifically, we assume that an agent that
has made a pre-marital investment in market skills in the model corresponds to a worker with
twelve years of schooling, a high school degree and five years of work experience who is married,
in the data. Based on the returns to each of these characteristics, we obtain εm = 0.86, εf = 0.61.
Thus, the return for married women is 70% of the male return. We set the elasticity of pre-
marital investment in market skills to lifetime participation to 1, which implies γ = −0.5 given
our calibrated value of δ.

4.1.2       Infant Good
We set the burden of maternal conditions in the model based on the approach discussed in Section
2.1.2. The WHO disability weights are available for ages 15-44 and 45-59 and 60+. Thus, we
correspondingly allocate the WHO burden for specific ages across the childbearing and post-
childbearing years in the model. We adjust for the number of pregnancies, using the series,
pt , described in Section 2.1.1. For all temporary maternal conditions in childbearing years, we
multiply the corresponding weight by the number of pregnancies. We omit this adjustment for
chronic conditions specific to post childbearing years. Table 3 plots the resulting values for the
  33
       Female life expectancy at age 20 was 46.5 years in 1920.
  34
       We use estimates in Table 4.3 and Figure 4.3.




                                                          21
per pregnancy burden of maternal conditions in each stage of the life cycle as a fraction of the
time endowment.
    For the parameters related to infant feeding, we proceed as follows. The time required for
infant feeding, f , is set to 15 hours per week for one year per child, based on the evidence
discussed in Section 2.2.2. This value is then multiplied by the number of live births, measured
by the cohort total fertility rate. We set the level of the time price of infant formula in 1920 to
match the average cost of feeding one child of median weight with infant formula for one year as
a percentage of yearly male labor earnings (see Section 2.2.2), equal to 6%. This value is then
multiplied by the number of live births to obtain household expenditures on infant formula. The
time series of the time price of Similac described in Section 2.2.2 is used to compute the lifetime
path of the time price of infant formula in the model.

4.1.3   General Home Production
The parameter ζ, which determines the degree of complementarity in the spouses’ contribution
to home production is set to match the optimal allocation of home hours for two earner house-
holds, which in the model is pinned down by equation (15). Specifically, we use home hours for
ever married employed women and employed men ages 18-64 from Ramey (2009), and use the
female/male wage ratio of hourly wages in manufacturing from Goldin (1990) as a measure of the
wife/husband wage ratio. This yields: ζ = 0.7711.
    Finally, we set gN /gO = 0.5. This implies that adoption of home appliances induces a 50%
reduction in the time required for general home good production. This is consistent with evidence
on home hours for housewives and working married women, under the assumption that the latter
adopted home appliances. We proxy the time price of home appliances in the model with the
real value of the quality-adjusted Divisia price index for eight appliances built by Gordon (1990),
rescaled by the real hourly wage in manufacturing. The initial value of this time series is calibrated
as described below.

    The remaining free parameters are ψ 0 , γ 0 , δ, gO , ξ̄, σ ξ , and the level of the time price for home
appliances in 1920, θG1920 . These parameters are calibrated to minimize the distance between the
model prediction and the empirical counterpart for seven statistics. These are the average adoption
rate of home appliances (based on the average percentage of households with washing machines,
refrigerators and vacuum cleaners), the average in hospital bottle feeding rate, measured as one
minus the in hospital exclusive breast feeding rate (see Figure 6); married women’s average home
hours, home hours of men; the female/male ratio of average earnings (Goldin, 1990). Finally, we
target the labor force participation of married women age 23-33 in 1920 (born in 1886-1895) and
of the same women at age 34-63 (Goldin, 1990). Since the male participation is one in the model
but smaller in the data, our target is the ratio of female to male participation in the data. The
calibrated parameters are reported in Table 3. The target statistics and the corresponding model
counterparts are reported in Table 4.

    At the calibrated parameters, there is a very close fit between the model generated statistics
and their empirical counterparts. However, the model has diﬃculty matching the low value of
male home hours in the data for all parameterizations that deliver plausible outcomes for the
other variables of interest. This suggests that the low level of male home hours in the data is
driven by factors not included in the model. In Section 4.4, we discuss a number of additional
forces that may have an impact on gender roles and on the distribution of home hours.

4.2    Transition
Our model features three sources of technological change: the improvement in maternal health,
the decline in the time price of infant formula and the decline in the time price of home appliances.
We are interested in identifying the role of each of these forces, as well as their combined eﬀect,
on women’s labor force participation, home hours and earnings. Thus, we feed historical time
series for the corresponding measures and the exogenous path of fertility35 into the model and
simulate the equilibrium over time. We examine the time period between 1920 and 1995. We
first consider the full model, and then analyze the impact of fertility combined with each source
of progress in isolation (Section 4.3). We also evaluate the quantitative impact of forces that
influence participation but are not included in the model (Section 4.4).
     The improvement in maternal health is comprised of three components in the model. The most
important is the decline in the burden of maternal conditions, corresponding to (1), as discussed in
Section 2.1.2. In addition, the decline in maternal mortality determines a rise in the female-male
diﬀerence in life expectancy at age 20, as documented in Section 2.1.1. To capture this eﬀect, the
  35
   In the model, all households in the same cohort are assumed to have the same fertility, corresponding to the
empirical value of the cohort fertility rate for women age 23-33 in a given year.

length of the post childbearing phase in the model in adjusted to reflect the empirical increase
in life expectancy. Finally, the number of pregnancies per live birth declines over time, thus, we
feed in the variable pt described in Section 2.1.2. We use the cohort fertility rate to adjust for the
variation in number of live births over time.
    The time series for expenditure on infant formula per child for exclusive bottle feeding is
adjusted by the cohort total fertility rate to obtain the average expenditure per household. The
time required for infant feeding f is also adjusted by the number of live births. Finally, we feed
in the time series of the time price for home appliances used in the calibration to track progress
in general home goods.
    Figure 8 plots the burden of maternal conditions by age adjusted by the number of pregnancies
and the time demand for infant feeding adjusted by the number of live births, expressed as a
fraction of the time endowment36 . The burden of maternal conditions at age 23-33 drops from
18% of the time endowment in 1920 to approximately 2% of the time endowment in 1965. The
time demand for infant feeding is much smaller, ranging from 5% to 2.2% of the time endowment,
depending on the number of live births. It is higher than the burden of maternal conditions
starting in 1945.
    Figure 9 displays the transitional dynamics predicted by the model in response to the exoge-
nous evolution of fertility, maternal health, the time price of infant formula and the time price
of home appliances. The improvement in maternal health includes the historical reduction of
maternal mortality and corresponding eﬀects on the burden of maternal conditions, the reduction
of the number of pregnancies for each live birth as well as the rise in female life expectancy. In

each panel, solid lines correspond to the predictions of the model and dotted lines correspond to
the data. We report female participation by cohort, so that in any year the value of participation
corresponds to participation at age 23-33 and at age 34+ of the women who are 23-33 years old in
that year. For all other variables, we simply report cross-sectional yearly averages for the model
as well as for the data37 .
    The main findings from the transition in the full model are:

   1. The model closely matches the empirical value of participation at age 23-33 between 1920
      and 1935, while it overpredicts this outcome relative to the data between 1940 and 1965.
      The predicted value of female participation at age 34+ closely replicates the one in the data
      until 1960. The model underpredicts female participation at age 23-33 after 1980 and at age
      34+ after 1970. In Section 4.4, we discuss and quantify the role of cultural, institutional
      and technological forces absent from our model that can account for these discrepancies.
   2. The model overpredicts the female/male earnings ratio relative to the data after 1940. This
      is due in part to the fact that relative female participation at age 23-33 is higher in the
      model than in the data. This increases female earnings directly and indirectly, since it
      induces a rise in female wages at later ages. Moreover, we assume that the number of
      hours worked, conditional on participation, is not gender specific, whereas conditional on
      participation, married women’s hours are smaller than married men’s, especially in post-war
      years. Allowing for gender specific work hours would reduce the female/male earnings ratio
      in the model and bring it closer to its empirical counterpart.
   3. The behavior of female (square marker) and male (diamond marker) home hours matches
      closely with their empirical counterparts, except that female home hours drop faster than
      in the data between 1945 and 1975. The convergence of female and male home hours over
      time stems from the rise in wives’ relative earning potential due to medical progress, which
      induces greater symmetry in the household allocation of home hours. As a result, leisure
      for married men decreases over time, while leisure of married women rises. This prediction
      is consistent with empirical evidence for the US.38
   4. The model replicates the inverted U-shape pattern of bottle feeding rates, though the peak
      in bottle feeding occurs later in the model, relative to the data. Moreover, the model
      predicts a slower initial rise in bottle feeding rates, relative to the data and predicts bottle
      feeding rates to be higher than in the data between 1975 and 1995. The decline in bottle
      feeding rates in the mid 1970s was in part due to new medical findings on the immunization
      properties of human milk and to a series of highly publicized cases of metabolic dysfunction
      linked to infant formulas, as discussed in Section 2.2. Since in our model, infant formula
      is deemed equivalent to breast milk and its quality is held constant throughout, we cannot
      capture this eﬀect.
   5. The model under predicts the diﬀusion of home appliances relative to the data. This is due
      to several factors. The demand for home appliances in the model depends on the burden of
  37
     The model has rich cross-sectional predictions. For brevity, we limit ourselves to presenting aggregate and
cohort outcomes.
  38
     This phenomenon is discussed by Knowles (2005), who focusses on the time period 1965-2003. For our period
of interest, it is not possible to measure home hours of husbands conditional on the participation of their wife.
However, the downward trend in married men’s leisure relative to their wife is clearly present. Knowles (2005)
argues that this phenomenon can be explained by an increase of wives’ bargaining power.

        maternal conditions, which imposes a very large constraint on women’s time endowment in
        the early years of the simulation. As this burden is relaxed, the demand for home appliances
        endogenously falls for given price. This exerts an oﬀsetting eﬀect on the reduction in the time
        price on the demand for home appliances. In addition, we abstract from the dependence of
        the time required for general home production on the number of children (beyond the time
        for bottle feeding). Clearly, if we were to model this dependence, the Baby Boom would
        lead to a permanent increase in the demand for home appliances, since it would increase
        the time required for general home production at all ages, assuming children live within the
        household until at least age 18. Finally, the demand for general home production output is
        given in the model, while there is evidence it rises with income39 .

Figure 10: Predicted model transition with no sources of progress. Isolates the eﬀect of fertility.


4.3   Experiments
To analyze the contribution of each force of progress in isolation, we run several counterfactuals.
As a benchmark, we first simulate the transition in the model shutting down all sources of medical
and technological progress. This leaves the historical path of the cohort total fertility rate as the
only exogenously changing variable in the transition. The results are displayed in Figure 10.
    This experiment clearly shows the strong impact of fertility on female participation at age
23-33. As the cohort total fertility rate drops from 3.26 in 1920 to 2.18 in 1935, participation
at age 23-33 rises from 9% to 19%. The decline in fertility between 1920 and 1935 alone can
fully account for the empirical rise in participation in childbearing years in this period. The
onset of the Baby Boom, absent improvements in maternal health or infant formula, causes a
reduction of female participation in childbearing years. As the total fertility rate rises from 2.23
to 3.65 between 1940 and 1960, participation at age 23-33 drops from 18.6% to 6.7%. Fertility
aﬀects participation beyond childbearing directly, via the burden of maternal conditions at age
34+, and indirectly, since low participation during childbearing years implies that women’s wages
are low post-childbearing. The eﬀect at age 34+ is smaller that in childbearing years, but still
quantitatively significant. Participation at age 34+ for women in childbearing years between
1920 and 1935 rises from 12% to 18%, and it drops from 18% to 10.4% between 1940 and 1965.
Interestingly, the demand for home appliances is positively related to the number of live births.
Adoption of home appliances rises from 11% in 1935, the trough of fertility in the pre-war years,
to 21% in 1965, which corresponds to the peak of fertility in the data. This shows that the severe
toll on women’s time implied by the burden of maternal conditions combined with high fertility,
generates a significant increase in the demand for home appliances.


                                                   27
   We now analyze the eﬀect of each source of progress in the model in isolation. A summary
description of the experiments is provided in Table 540 .

4.3.1    Medical Progress
We now examine the joint impact of progress in maternal health and infant feeding. To do so,
we shut down the decline in the time price of home appliances. Figure 11 displays the simulated
transition for a version of the model.
    The main finding is that progress in maternal health and infant feeding alone can account
for the rise in participation at age 23-33 between 1920 and 1970, and at age 34+ between 1920
and 1945. The model over-predicts participation at age 23-33 between 1940 and 1965, as well as
the rise in the ratio of female to male earnings after 1940, but to a smaller degree than the full
model. The model now correctly predicts the timing of the initial rise and subsequent decline in
bottle feeding rates, though predicts them to be approximately 20% lower than in the data at the
peak. This outcome is in part due to the lack of progress in home appliances, which indirectly
discourages adoption of infant formula, since infant feeding is a general home good when infant
formula is used. The model closely matches the empirical behavior of female home hours.

4.3.2    Maternal Health
To examine the impact of advances in maternal health in isolation, we shut down the decline in
time price of infant formula, in addition to progress in home appliances. Figure 12, Panels A
and C, compares the path of participation by age in this version of the model, with the paths
predicted by the version with no progress and the full version of the model, that is with progress
in maternal health, infant feeding and home appliances. Improvements in maternal health alone
determine a rise in participation at age 23-33 to 52% by 1970, the same value observed in the
data for that year. Similarly, the predicted behavior of participation at age 34+ closely follows
the corresponding empirical value until 1950, when it reaches a rate of 47%. Also, the comparison
for the predicted behavior for the full model suggests that progress in maternal health accounts
fully for the rise in participation at all ages in the model up to 1950. This force adds 27% to
participation at age 23-33 and 18% at age 34+ for the cohort of women in childbearing years in
1960, that experiences the peak of fertility in the simulations. As for the full model, participation

     For each experiment, we feed in the historical series of the cohort total fertility rate to adjust for the number
of live births.

at age 23-33 in the model is greater than the one in the data between 1940 and 1955. This period
features the sharpest decline in the burden of maternal conditions, while the total fertility rate
rises from 2.23 to 3.03. By 1960, participation in childbearing years predicted by the model with
improvement in maternal health, at 41%, is much closer to the value observed in the data at 34%.
In Section 4.4, we discuss and quantify a number of forces outside the model that may account
for the slower empirical rise of participation in childbearing years over this time period. Since
improvement in maternal health is only marginal after 1960, the variation in participation after
this date is mainly driven by the decline in fertility.
    It is interesting to compare these results to the predicted transition in a version of the model
that only allows for progress in home appliances. The results are displayed in Panels B and D of
Figure 12. Again, we report the simulated transition of female participation by age for the version
of the model with no progress, the version with progress in home appliances only, and the full
model. The decline in the time price of home appliances cannot account for the behavior of female
participation at any age for cohorts in childbearing years between 1940 and 1960, who experience
the high fertility rates associated with the Baby Boom. With progress in home appliances alone,
participation at age 23-33 declines between 1940 and 1960. Progress in home appliances increases
participation by only 7% in childbearing years relative to the version with no progress in 1960,
the year in which fertility peaks in the simulation. Thus, participation for women in childbearing
years in 1960 is only 14% in the model with progress in home appliances only, while it is 27%
in the data. Participation at age 34+ also declines for the cohorts who experience the Baby
Boom in childbearing years. For the cohort in childbearing years in 1960, participation at age
34+ predicted by the model with home appliances only is 28%, 18% higher than in the version of
the model with no progress, whereas it is 60% in the data. Advances in home appliances play a
greater role starting in 1965, when fertility starts to decline and the reduction in the time price
of appliances is more pronounced.
    The improvement in maternal health stemming from the advances in reproductive medicine
also determines a rise in women’s life expectancy relative to men. To isolate the marginal impact
of this eﬀect, we first simulate the model allowing only for the decline in M̃t and pt and then we
add the rising life expectancy. We find that the rise in life expectancy does not aﬀect participation
at age 23-33. It has the greatest impact on participation at age 34+ for the cohorts that are in
their childbearing years in 1935-40. These women benefit of an increase in the female-male life
expectancy diﬀerential, even as they experience a minimal reduction in the burden of maternal
conditions in childbearing years.

4.3.3   Infant Formula
We now evaluate the marginal impact of advances in infant feeding as captured by the decline
in the time price of infant formula on female participation at age 23-33. We first consider the
transition in the model when progress in infant feeding is the only source of progress, that is
maternal mortality and life expectancy are kept constant at 1920 levels and so is the time price
of home appliances. The results are shown in Figure 13.
    Progress in infant feeding has a small marginal eﬀect on participation at age 23-33 when
fertility is low and participation relatively high. Progress in infant feeding adds between 3 and
5 percentage points to participation between 1940 and 1960, when fertility is at its highest and
approximately 4 percentage points from 1970 onward, when fertility is low and participation
is highest. This corresponds to a 25-35% increase in participation at age 23-33 between 1945

and 1970. While progress in infant formula has a relatively small eﬀect on participation when
considered in isolation, it has a substantially greater impact when combined with progress in
maternal health. To illustrate this, we compare the predicted behavior of female participation in
childbearing years in a version of the model that only allows for progress in infant feeding, in a
version with improvements in maternal health only and in the version of the model with medical
progress. The results are displayed in Figure 13.
    The decline in the time price of infant formula adds between 5 and 10 percentage points to
participation between 1940 and 1960, the years of the Baby Boom in the simulation, and adds
4 percentage points to participation after 1960. This result suggests that the impact of infant
formula on participation is greatest when the number of infants present is high and the burden of
maternal conditions has dropped enough to allow for participation during childbearing years. The
marginal eﬀect of infant formula on participation is also significant after 1965, when participation
is high because of low fertility as well as medical progress. Thus, only when advances in maternal
health have enabled women to increase participation does the ability to avoid breast feeding have
a significant additional eﬀect on participation. The size of this eﬀect is positively related to the
number of infants present in the household.
    We run a similar exercise for the version of the model with progress in home appliances and
but no progress in maternal health. Progress in infant feeding has a small marginal eﬀect (not
displayed) on participation at age 23-33 when combined with progress in home appliances, adding
from 3 to at most 7 percentage points to participation between 1940 and 1960. This is due to
the fact that the version of the model that only allows for progress in home appliances predicts
that participation in childbearing years actually declines. As noted above, the ability to avoid
breast feeding has a smaller marginal eﬀect on participation when participation is low. After 1960,


                                                             32
progress in infant feeding adds approximately 5 percentage points to participation in childbearing
years.

   These results suggest that the decline in the burden of maternal conditions is the most im-
portant force driving the rise in the participation of married women during childbearing years
and post-childbearing between 1935 and 1965. The decline in the time price of infant formula
has a significant incremental eﬀect on participation in childbearing years during the Baby Boom.
The diﬀusion of home appliances cannot explain the behavior of participation for the cohorts
of women that experience the Baby Boom. It exerts a more significant eﬀect on participation
post-childbearing after 1975.

4.4    Other Forces
A striking result that emerges from the previous analysis is that progress in maternal health, alone
and combined with infant feeding, overpredicts participation at age 23-33 between 1935 and 1960.
Moreover, even the full version of the model that includes progress in home appliances under-
predicts participation at all ages after 1975. How can we interpret these findings? Clearly, the
model omits additional factors that also influence married women’s participation that respectively
dampen and add to the eﬀect of medical progress.
    For the years between 1935 and 1965, two prime factors that may have contributed to reduce
married women’s incentive or ability to participate are the presence of “marriage bars” and cultural
aversion to married women in the workforce. Marriage bars consisted in the practice of not hiring
married women or dismissing female employees when they married. Marriage bars were in place
until World War II and prevailed in teaching and clerical work, which accounted for approximately
50% of single women’s employment between 1920 and 1950.41 Marriage bars disproportionately
hit cohorts of women in childbearing years between 1930 and the early 1950.
    Cultural aversion to women in the workforce may also have played an important role in slowing
down the increase in women’s labor force participation. Fernández and Fogli (2009) document
the strong role of country of origin, a proxy for cultural diﬀerences in attitudes with respect to
women’s work, in second-generation American women’s labor force participation behavior. Based
on survey evidence reported in Fogli and Veldkamp (2007) and Fernández (2007), only 20% of
respondents believed that a married woman should work in the period between 1935 and 1945. By
1970, this number went up to 55%, a very significant rise to a level that still suggests a significant
cultural barrier to women’s employment.42
    Another possible factor is wage discrimination. Even in current years approximately 10% of the
gender diﬀerences in earnings cannot be accounted for by observable diﬀerences in characteristics
that are related to productivity (O’Neill, 2003). Albanesi and Olivetti (2008) argue that this
unexplained gender earnings diﬀerential could be due to statistical discrimination, especially in
professional occupations. By depressing female wages, discrimination may have hindered women’s
incentives to participate in the workforce.
  41
      Goldin (1991) extensively documents the pervasiveness of these practices for diﬀerent school districts and for
firms hiring oﬃce workers. The probability of not retaining a single female worker upon marriage ranged between
47.5% to 58.4% for school districts between 1928 and 1942, and between 25% and 46% for firms hiring oﬃce workers
between 1931 and 1940. The probability of not hiring a married woman ranged between 62% and 78% for school
districts and between 39% and 61% for firms hiring oﬃce workers over the same periods.
   42
      Fogli and Veldkamp (2007) and Fernández (2007) point to uncertainty about the eﬀect of mother’s work on the
welfare of young children as an important determinant of these attitudes.



                                                        33
    The fact that the model under-predicts participation relative to the data after 1975 is also
not surprising since the sources of medical progress we consider are mostly exhausted by the
1960s, while several factors not present in the model may have contributed to increase married
women’s participation starting in the late sixties. Perhaps the most notable is the diﬀusion of
oral contraception. The pill became available to married women during the 1960s and to most
non-married women in the early 1970s. This development has been linked to the rise in women’s
education, labor force participation and wages. Goldin and Katz (2002) show that the availability
of oral contraceptives contributed to the increase in the number of college graduated women into
professional programs starting in the late 1960s, and to the rise in the age at first marriage.
Bailey (2006) shows that legal access to the pill before age 21 significantly reduced the likelihood
of having a first birth before age 22 and increased the number of women in the paid labor force.
Goldin (2006) argued that this, in turn, led to a shift from "jobs to careers" for working women.
The resulting steeper path of lifetime earnings and the rise in returns to experience (Olivetti,
2006) further facilitated the rise in participation. In addition, skill biased technological change
(Galor and Weil, 1996), and other labor market shifts (Blau and Kahn, 1999) also favored women.
    To gauge the impact of the forces outside the model on married women’s participation we run
the following experiment. We set women’s returns to premarital investment in market skills, εf ,
at each date so that female participation at age 23-33 in the model matches the one in the data.
Given that the model over predicts participation in childbearing years between 1940 and 1960,
the resulting value of εf will be lower than the calibrated value in those years. This is a way to
quantify in the model the impact of forces, such as marriage bars, cultural aversion to women
in the labor force and other forces that undermine married women’s ability to participate in the
labor force in those years. The eﬀect of these forces is translated in terms of a reduction in the
returns to pre-marital investment in market skills. By contrast, since the model under predicts
female participation at all ages after 1975, the value of εf that matches the data in those years
will be higher than the calibrated value. The diﬀerence can be interpreted as the positive eﬀect
of oral contraception and female biased shifts in the labor market on married women’s returns to
pre-marital investments.
    We perform this experiment for three versions of the model: the one with only progress in
maternal health, the version that also allows for advances in infant feeding, and the one that
in addition includes progress in home appliances. This exercise illustrates our findings on the
contribution of each source of medical and technological progress we include in the model, as well
as those that are excluded. It also allows us to identify the specific time period in which the
impact of each particular force is strongest.
    We summarize our findings in Figure 14. It plots the value of εf that matches female partici-
pation at age 23-33 for the full model (dashed line) against the version of the model with medical
progress only (dotted line), and for the model with medical progress and infant feeding (dash-
dotted line). The constant lines correspond to the calibrated returns to pre-marital investment
for females (0.61) and males (0.86). As anticipated, the value of εf that matches participation
at age 23-33 to the data is smaller than the calibrated value for 1940-1975, and greater than
the calibrated value for 1985-1990. The forces that reduced women’s incentives to participate in
market work between 1935 and 1970 are equivalent to a reduction of the returns to pre-marital
investment in market skills of at most 15 percentage points, from 0.61 to 0.44, in 1950 in the
version of the model with advances in maternal health only. The equivalent reduction is equal to
at most 21 percentage points in 1950 for the version of the model which also allows for progress
in infant formula, and at most 35 percentage points in the version that adds advances in home

appliances.
    These results also shed further light on the contribution of advances in infant feeding to
participation in childbearing years. As shown in the figure, advances in infant feeding require
women’s returns to pre-marital investment in market skills to be 4, 10 and 6 percentage points
smaller in 1950, 1960 and 1970, respectively, than in the version of the model with improved
maternal health only to match the data. The year 1960 corresponds to the peak of the Baby
Boom in the model and is the year where the demand for infant formula is greatest. Thus, even if
advances in infant feeding in the form of a decline in the time price of infant formula have a smaller
eﬀect on participation than improved maternal health, the ability to bottle feed is equivalent to
a sizeable rise of the returns to pre-marital investment in market skills when fertility is high.43
Similarly, progress in home appliances is equivalent to women’s returns to market skills being
18-36 percentage points greater than in the model with medical progress only after 1960. Thus,
even if progress in home appliances cannot account for the rise in participation during the Baby
Boom, it has a significant impact when fertility starts to decline.
  43
   Bottle feeding rates predicted by the model when participation at age 23-33 is matched to the data peak at the
same time as in the data, though they continue to be slightly higher than in the data for 1975-1990.

5    Concluding Remarks
Our results suggest that improved maternal health contributed critically to the historic rise in
married women’s labor force participation during the course of the twentieth century. The diﬀu-
sion of infant formula also played a significant role. Medical progress was particularly important
for the cohorts of women in childbearing years between 1940 and 1965, who experienced a steep
rise in fertility. By contrast, the diﬀusion of home appliances cannot account for the rise of
participation for these women. Thus, improved maternal health is essential to explain the posi-
tive correlation between fertility and married women’s participation during the Baby Boom. In
addition to its implications for women’s economic role, improved maternal health has broader
consequences. Per capita income rises by 42% between 1920 and 1990 in the model, solely as a
result of the corresponding rise in women’s investment in market skills and participation. This
suggests that medical progress can have powerful aggregate economic eﬀects via its impact on
maternal health.
    The dynamics of fertility play a key role in women’s participation in the analysis. Albanesi and
Olivetti (2009) develop a model of fertility choice to explore the link between medical progress,
fertility decisions and workforce behavior.

6     Data Appendix
This section lists all the data sources and describes in detail the variables discussed in the empirical
analysis and used in the calibration.

6.1   Demographics
Total Fertility rate and Cohort Total Fertility Rate: U.S. Cohort and Period Fertility Tables 1917-
1980, National Institute of Child Health and Development, National Institutes of Health, compiled
by Robert L. Heuser. Available at http://opr.princeton.edu/archive/cpft/. Key reference is
Heuser (1976). Median age at first marriage: Series A 158-159 in Historical Statistics of the
United States (1975). Median age at first birth: Data on first birth by age of mother from the
National Center of Health Statistics (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/statab/t991x02.pdf). We
use information on number of women in each age group (Series A 119-134, Historical Statistics of
the United States, 1975) to compute median age at first birth in 1920. Median age at last birth:
Glick (1977, Table 1.)

6.2   Earnings Data
Real Wages: Real hourly wages in manufacturing (for full-time year-round workers) from Margo
(2006.) Throughout the paper hourly wages and prices are deflated by using the U.S. Bureau of
Labor Statistics All Urban Consumers Price Index (CPI-U) with base 1982-1984. Female/male
earnings ratio: Goldin (1990, Table 3.1). This is the standard series used in the literature and
it provides comparable information on the gender earnings gap for full-time year-round workers.
Earnings by gender and marital status: Wage and salary income (INCWAGE) from the 1940 to
1990 IPUMS Census 1% samples (for 1970, we use the 1% State sample). Sample includes white
men and women, aged 16 through 64, living in non-farm households. We further restrict the
sample to observations with group quarters status equal 1, “Households under 1970 definition.”
For all years N/A code (999999) is treated as missing data. Statistics are obtained as weighted
averages using sample-line weights (SLWT) for 1940 and 1950 and person weights (PERWT) for
the remaining decades.

6.3   Female Labor Force Participation
Labor force participation (LFP) of married women: Goldin (1990, Table 2.2) which present com-
parable 1890 to 1980 data disaggregated into five age groups: 15-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64.

                                                  41
We use Census IPUMS data (sample inclusion rules same as in section 6.2) to update the series
to 2000. Since data are not available for 1910 LFP by age for this decade is obtained by linear
interpolation of the appropriate statistics between 1890 and 1920. The LFP statistics by cohort
are computed as follows. The 1920 calibration target for LFP of "young" (age 23 to 35) married
women corresponds to the LFP of women born in 1886-1895 (that is, married women age 25-34 in
1920). The 1920 target for LFP of "old" (age 36 to 60) married women is obtained by averaging
LFP statistics for the 35-64 age group across three cohorts: 1856-1865, 1866-1875 and 1876-1885.
Similarly, for all the other decades. The time series data for LFP of old married women is obtained
by averaging (with the appropriate population weight obtained from Haines and Sutch (2006))
LFP of married women aged 35-44, 45-54 and 55-64 by decade. LFP for never married women:
Census IPUMS data (the sample inclusion rules are the same as in section 6.2) from 1900 to
2000. We count individuals whose imputed labor status is "employed" or "unemployed" (variable
EMPSTAT, codes 1 and 2) as participating in the labor force (see IPUMS documentation for in-
formation on consistency of this variable across years.) For 1900 and1920 we use occupation data
because information on employment status is not available. Using the 1950-standardized vari-
able (OCC1950), we count all individuals with an "occupational response" (codes 0 through 970)
as participating in the labor force. Observations with a "non-occupational response," unknown
occupation or no data are, therefore, counted as non-participants.

6.4   Home Hours
We use the estimates of average weekly hours spent in home production constructed by Ramey
(2009) (excel file available at http://weber.ucsd.edu/~vramey/research.html). We use the follow-
ing series. Home hours by married non-working women corresponds to Ramey’s estimates for
housewives. Home hours by married working women and married men corresponds to Ramey’s
estimates for ever-married employed women and married men, respectively.

6.6   YLD Calculations and Data Sources
In our calculation of the YLD we use historical data on duration and incidence of maternal
morbidity and WHO disability weights for four maternal conditions: Maternal haemorrhage,
Maternal sepsis, Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and Obstructed labour.
     Incidence and Duration of Maternal Morbidity
     Maternal Hemorrhage: Loudon (1992) reports that 5.7% of all pregnancies would develop
some form of illness due to maternal hemorrhage. Using the 1920 stillbirth rate (equal to 3.94%)
we obtain an estimate of 5.5% for the incidence of disability due to hemorrhage (as a percentage
of live births). According to WHO maternal hemorrhage can have permanent consequences such
as severe anaemia. Consequently the duration of the disability due to this condition is set equal
to the lenght of each model period (in months).
     Maternal Sepsis: Kerr (1933) reports a 28.1 percent estimates for the incidence of infection in
the production of remote disablement (Table XLI) which corresponds to a 3.4% of all live births.
The outcome of maternal sepsis is either deaths or a short term disability cost for those who
recover. For example, Loudon (1992, Tables 4.3 and 4.4) reports a duration of 18 to 19 days for
the disablement due to maternal sepsis. Hence we set the duration of maternal morbidity for this
condition to zero. This is consistent with the WHO calculation of the disability weights for this
condition (see Table A2.)
     Hypertensive disorders: According to historical studies reported in Loudon (1992), toxaemia
develops in about 10 percent of all pregnancies. Using the 1920 stillbirth rates we obtain an
estimate of 9.6% for the incidence of morbidity caused by hypertensive disorders. According to
WHO hypertensive disorders of pregnancies can cause neurological sequelae which are permanent.
Hence the duration of hypertensive disorder is set equal to the lenght of each model period (in
months).
     Obstructed Labor : Table A1 reports the information on the frequency and lenght of disable-
ments due to obstructed labor used to estimate duration for this condition. The Table reproduces
Table XLIII in Kerr (1933).

              Total Number of Lesions           1346

    Taking a weighted average of the months of disablement (column 3) with frequency weights
(column 2) we obtain the estimate of 55.67 months of disablement for obstructed labor reported in
section 2.1.2. The incidence of morbidity due to this condition is given by 0.673 that is 1346 among
the 2000 in-patients in Dr. Kerr’s ward actually had lesions. Given the 12% overall morbidity
rate, we obtain an estimate of 8.1% for the overall incidence of morbidity due to obstructed labor
(as a percentage of all births). According to the WHO obstructed labor could also cause stress
incontinence - which is a permanent disability. Its duration is set to be equal to the lenght of
each model period (in months).
    Disability Weights
    Table A2 reproduces relevant information from Annex Table 3 "Age-specific disability weights
for untreated and treated forms of sequelae included in the Global Burden of Disease Study,"
available at http://www.who.int/healthinfo/bodgbd2002revised/en/index.html. We report only
one set of entries since DW for treated and non-treated form are identical in this case. Note that
in our calculation of YLD we do not take into account infertilty due to maternal sepsis, since
infertility does not directly reduce labor market productivity.

   Using the above data sources and assuming a 10-year childbearing period (120 months) we
obtain:
                14−44
            Y LDPregnancy  = 0.222 ∗ 9 = 1.98 months;
                14−44
            Y LDObstructed Labor = 0.081 ∗ (0.43 ∗ 55.67 + 0.025 ∗ 120) = 6.56 months;
                14−44
            Y LDSepsis = 0 months;
                14−44

    Consequently Y LD14−44 = (1.98 + 6.56 + 0 + 4.47 + 1.04) = 14.05 months (1.17 years)

6.7   Breast Feeding Practices
Sources for Figure 6: The data point for 1918 is obtained by averaging data on breastfeeding
from a series of studies for diﬀerent geographical areas conducted by the Children Bureau during
the period 1917-1919 (see Apple, 1987, Table 9.1). It records the percentage of infants who were
exclusively breast or bottle fed at 1 month or less, 3 and 6 months. The 1930 data are reported in
Apple (1987, Table 9.1) and are based on a study of 200 patients at the Out Patient Department
Clinic of the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. The study reports exclusive breastfeed-
ing rates at 1 week or hospital discharge, 1 month or less, 3 and 6 months. The data point for
1930 should be considered a lower bound for the national average because breastfeeding was less
common, both in incidence and duration, in the Northeast than in the Midwest. In order to min-
imize this under-estimation bias we exclude private patients since, while their breastfeeding rate
at hospital discharge is as high as for clinical patients, the rate after three months is exceptionally
low (as low as in the mid-1960s.)
    Breastfeeding rates at hospital discharge for 1946 are from Bain’s (1948) hospital survey
which included more than two-third of all hospitals in the United States with at least 25 beds.
The corresponding 1956 figures are from a similarly designed hospital study by Meyer (1958).
This survey included about 60% of hospitals with 300 or more annual births. Both surveys report
exclusive breast- and bottle-feeding rates at one week or hospital discharge (if it occurred before
one week of age).
    Breastfeeding rates at 6 months for children born between the early 1930s and the early 1970s
are from Hirschman and Butler (1981) based on the 1965 National Fertility Study and the 1973
National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) conducted by the National Center of Health Statistics
(see also Hirschman and Hendershot, 1979.) They refer to breast feeding rates for first-born babies.
The entries are extracted from Figure 1 in the paper which reports the proportion of mothers
breastfeeding their first infant by duration of breastfeeding and by birth cohort of mothers (in
five-year intervals). We obtain the statistics by year of birth of infant by using data on mother’s
age at first birth from Glick (1977, Table 1). The data point in figure 6 are for the years 1935,
1941, 1947, 1951, 1955, 1959, 1965 and 1969 - corresponding to the middle point of the five-year
intervals. Data on exclusive breastfeeding rate are not available in these two surveys.

   In hospital breastfeeding rates for 1965 to 2001, as well as 1971 to 2001 breastfeeding rates at
6 months are from the Appendix table in Ryan, Wenjun and Acosta (2002), based on the Ross
Laboratories Mothers Survey (RLMS.)
   We combine these sources to obtain a continuous data series. This raises issues of compatibility
between diﬀerent data. Support for the comparability of RMLS and NSFG data comes from a
study by Ryan et al. (1991) which shows how breastfeeding trends obtained from these two data
sources are very similar.

6.8     Time and Monetary Cost of Breast Feeding
Table A3 reports information on the number of daily formula feedings by infant’s age. As solid
food is introduced, the number of daily feedings decreases (Source: Pediatric Advisor, University
of Michigan Health System, http://www.med.umich.edu/1libr/pa/pa_formula_hhg.htm.).

                               Table A3. Formula feedings per day
                                              min        max
                               <1 month         6          8
                               1-3 months       5          6
                               3-7 months       4          5
                               7-12 months      3          4

    The same data source also reports information on the quantity of formula by feeding. This
varies by infant’s age and weight. Newborns: 1 ounce per feeding initially, up to 3 ounces
per feeding by day 7. After day 7: Amount per feeding (in liquid ounces) should be equal to
a half of the baby’s weight (in pounds). We use these information as well as the 2000 Infant
Growth Charts from the Center for Disease Control of the National Center of Health Statistics
(http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/) to estimate the average daily intake of infant formula for
an infant of median weight. The average daily cost of exclusively breast feeding an infant is then
obtained by multiplying the resulting quantity by the price of a ‘ready-to-feed’ liquid ounce of
Similac.

6.8.1    Price of Similac
The time series for the price of Similac is constructed from historical advertisements from the
Chicago Tribune, the Los Angeles Times and the Washington Post for products on sale in drugstore
chains in these three cities. We have monthly information on price, quantity and type (powder,
concentrated liquid, ready-to-feed) of formula for the period 1935-1986.
    We only use powder and concentrated liquid Similac in the construction of our price index.
These two products can be considered as quality-equivalents since the only diﬀerences between
the two are related to the proportion of water and the diﬀerential amount of time required to
eﬀectively mix powder or concentrated liquid with water. The price per ready-to-feed liquid ounce
of formula is obtained using the following conversion rules. Based on the instructions on current
Similac labels: 25.6 ounces of powder can make approximately 196 fluid ounces of formula; 13
ounces of concentrated liquid can make 26 fluid ounces of formula. The price of one liquid ounce
of formula is obtained by dividing the (real) price of the product by the quantity of formula (in
liquid ounces) that can be obtained with its content.



                                                46
    There is no record on the price of Similac in the Los Angeles Times from July 1936 to March
1948 and in the Washington Post from October 1942 to May 1948. For these years the series is
based on the price of Similac for the Chicago area alone. If the information for one year is missing
we interpolate prices across the two adjacent years. For some years we also have information on
the regular (non sale) price of the product. However, this information is very limited and cannot
be used to obtain a consistent price series. Nonetheless, it is interesting to note that a 16 ounces
can was often referred to as the ‘$1.25 Similac’ and not by its weight. This seems to suggest that
the non-sale price of the product was $1.25 for a long time (from 1935 to the late 1940s/early
1950s). Over time we find more and more ads of the ‘$1.25 Similac’ at discount prices suggesting
that the price of the formula was closer to its sale price in the early 1950s than it was in the mid
1930s. It follows that we are probably underestimating the decline in the price of Similac over
this period.
    The data series is updated to 2000 by using data on the average U.S. price of infant formula
(powder and liquid concentrate) from Oliveira and Davis (2006). We project the series forward
to 2053 using the average change in the price of infant formula between 1994 and 2000.
    The detailed discussion of issues related to the construction of the Similac price series as well
as additional data on 19th century first-generation milk-based formulas is provided in an online
appendix available at http://people.bu.edu/olivetti/papers/online_appendix_babyformula.pdf.

6.8.2   Price of Home Appliances
The time price of home appliances used in the simulations in Section 4.2 is the real value of the
quality-adjusted Divisia price index for eight appliances built by Gordon (1990), rescaled by the
real hourly wage in manufacturing. Since this series starts in 1947, we extrapolate it back to
1920 based on the yearly rate of change of the NIPA price index for kitchen and other household
appliances (NIPA Table 2.5.4, row 30) between 1929 and 1946. The Divisia price index is available
up to 1984, the NIPA price index for kitchen and other household appliances is available up to
2003. We use the post-1985 yearly rate of change of NIPA to extrapolate the Gordon series
forward.
