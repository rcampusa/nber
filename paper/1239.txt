                     Uncertainty, Welfare Cost, and the
                 'Adaptability' of U.S. Corporate Taxes


                                  ABSTRACT

      Alternative corporate tax systems differ in their ability to adapt to

changes in the rate of inflation. Absent complete indexing of depreciation

allowances, a tax system may use the expected inflation rate to set accelerated

depreciation allowances in a way that minimizes the welfare loss from the

misallocation of capital. This welfare loss is a nonlinear function of

the assumed inflation rate, however, so the welfare loss at the expected

inflation rate may be quite different from the expected welfare loss. We

compute these two welfare concepts for each of three alternative corporate

tax schemes in the U.S. and for two different relationships between infla-

tion and interest rates. One important finding is that the Auerbach—

Jorgenson first year recovery plan is not equivalent to indexing as is

often claimed, if uncertainty about inflation implies uncertainty about

the   real after—tax discount rate.

1. Introduction

     The design of a good tax system is often limited by compromises

among several competing objectives. One's view of vertical equity may

require a more progressive tax system for example, but this redistribu-

tion may increase excess burden and thus reduce economic efficiency.

One's view of horizontal equity may require a more comprehensive tax

base, but inclusions of imputed income or consumption items may make the

tax system more complicated and reduce administrative efficien:y.    As a

final example, policymakers might like to be able to change tax rules

in reaction to business cycles or other new circumstances, but this flexi-

bility conflicts with the goal of providing a certain tax environment for

investors.

     Efficiency and equity of various tax systems have been thurougily

studied in the literature of public finance. In this paper, we wouLd like

to compare alternative tax systems with respect to a slightly different

goal, a goal we call "adaptability." Quite often, tax rules must be set

for an indefinite period, before uncertainty about economic variables has

been resolved. Yet we would like these fixed tax rules to adapt automati-

cally to changes in these economic variables, without having to enact new

rules. In particular, we would like the tax system to maintain its

desired equity and efficiency properties in the face of inflation rates

other than the single rate that might be expected.

     Complete indexation would clearly help maintain the equity and effi-

ciency of existing taxes across a variety of inflation outcomes, but this

adaptability comes at the expense of considerable administrative diffi-

culties. In practice, we are left with simpler schemes based on nominal
                               —2—

income, fixed depreciation schedules, and historical cost accounting.

Because assets vary in the extent to which actual allowances differ from

economic depreciation at replacement cost, these schemes distort invest—

inent incentives, misallocate capital, and reduce overall welfare. For

our purposes, however, it is important to note that inflation has different

impacts on the incentive to invest in different assets. A given deprecia-

tion scheme may tax assets similarly at one rate of inflation and very

dissimilarly at another. As a consequence, when policymakers choose among

competing tax schemes on the basis of economic efficiency, they may have

to use more than a single value for the expected rate of inflation. A

more appropriate criterion may be the expected welfare cost rather than the

welfare cost at the expected inflation rate.

     In this paper, we compute these two welfare concepts for each of three

alternative corporate tax schemes in the U.S. The first scheme is based

on the set of allowances that existed in 1980; the second is based on the

Accelerated Cost Recovery System (ACRS) as amended in 1982; and the third

is based on the first year recovery plan of Auerbach and Jorgenson (1980).

One important finding is that this first year recovery plan is not equi-

valent to indexing as is often claimed, if uncertainty about inflation

implies uncertainty about the real after—tax return used for discounting.

     For each scheme, we use a cost—of—capital formula similar to the one

in Hall and Jorgenson (1967) to measure the incentive to invest in each of

33 assets. We then employ Cobb—Douglas demands for these assets in a

partial equilibrium framework like that of Harberger (1966) to measure

the welfare cost of differential incentives. This welfare cost for any

one scheme depends nonlinearly on the rate of inflation used in the cost—

of—capital formula. We plot this welfare cost, and we find that it is a
                                  —3—

 convex function of the assumed inflation rate. As a consequence, the

 welfare cost for the expected inflation rate (a point on the curve) can

 be a substantial underestimate of the expected welfare cost (obtained

 by weighting together the welfare costs of the different possible infla—

 tion rates).

      We look at a very particular kind of uncertainty in this paper.

 Policymakers face an uncertain environment when they must choose among

 alternative tax systems, but we assume that this uncertainty is resolved

 before investment takes place. This scenario is clearly counterfactual,

 but it allows us to study all of the relevant adaptability and efficiency

 issues discussed above while at the same time abstract from complex issues

of how uncertainty affects investment incentives.      In particular, it allows

us to use the simple cost—of—capital formula for a firm facing certain

rates of return and inflation.

     Since this cost—of—capital formula and the Harberger excess burden

formula have been exposited many times, the next section offers only the

briefest possible summary of our methodology. We then outline one case

where uncertainty about inflation causes uncertainty about the real after—

tax rate of return, and another case where it does not. Section 3 makes

these formulas operational with a brief description of the three alternative

tax schemes, but again more complete expositions are available elsewhere.

Section 4 provides discussion of our results, and Section 5 draws conclusions.



2. Methodological Framework

     As in Hall and Jorgenson (1967), we consider a firm facing a certain

nominal interest rate i and inflation rate 7T.    The firm makes a one—

dollar marginal investment in asset j   that   depreciates exponentially at
                                      —4—


rate . and earns a marginal product c.. Income from the asset is taxed
at the statutory corporate rate u. The firm receives an immediate invest-

ment tax credit at rate k. and delayed depreciation allowances on a

fraction of the original purchase price given by the parameter a..                 The

present value of these allowances per dollar of basis is z., where the

firm discounts nominal future allowances by the nominal after—tax interest

rate i(l—u). We thus assume arbitrage between debt and real capital as

in Bradford and Fullerton (1981).

      The profit—maximizing firm continues to make such investments until,

in competitive equilibrium, the net cost of the asset (1—k.) is just

equal to the present discounted value of after—tax returns and tax savings

from the asset. This equilibrium condition is used to solve for the

marginal product or rental cost c as a function of other parameters:


                            Tf + 5.
            c.
                 i(l—u) —
                     1—u
                                      (1 -   k.
                                              j
                                                  -
                                                       jj
                                                      ua.z.)   .                      (1)



This cost is gross of depreciation and taxes, so the pre—tax return net
of depreciation is p. = c• —          5..    This pre—tax return can easily vary

among assets with different depreciation rates                     and/or allowances z.

Depreciation indexing, however, could be set so that the firm receives

economic allowances at replacement cost. The firm discounts by s, defined

here as the certain real after—tax return i(l—u) —      . Thus, in this case,
 z. equals 5/(s +    3.)              reduces to s/(1—u) for all assets. If the
  3          j        3'    and
                                  3


 total   corporate capital stock is fixed, the tax system does not distort
 its allocation in this case.
        In general, taxes do distort the allocation of capital among assets.
 In   this paper, we follow Hendershott and Hu (1980) and Gravelle (1982)
                                        —5—

in measuring the associated welfare cost by the Harberger formula:


                    N
             W =           dc.dK.       ,                                          (2)
                   3=1 L


where K. is the stock of asset j        in   the undistorted equilibrium, K is the

stock in the distorted equilibrium, and N is the number of assets.            To

measure W, therefore, we need to know how the use of K. depends upon its

cost c. Econometric studies reviewed in Jorgenson (1974) suggest that

firms' total use of capital changes by approximately one percent for each

one percent change in its cost. This cost could conceivably be gross or

net of depreciation, but gross costs are used in empirical work finding

that gross output is a Cobb—Douglas function of capital and labor. No

empirical work has measured price elasticities for each of the 33 cipital

assets used in this study, but we assume that the demand for each K. has

unitary elasticity with respect to its price c..

      Expenditure on each type of capital is a constant under our asuumptions,

so dc. in equation (2) can be expressed as a function of K..             Ihat Ls, cK. =
      3                                                             3                33

undistorted      equilibrium, then further algebra provides:


                   N
             w     Y cK[2n(c/c)          - 1     + c/c.]                           (3)
                   j1               1




      For the distorted equilibrium, capital costs c are given by equation

(1) and capital use K is required data. We obtain the distorted capital

allocation for 1980 from Jorgenson and Sullivan (1981), and we estimate

the long—run distorted allocation for the other tax plans by using
                                 —6—

the same Cobb—Douglas reactions. Under ACRS, for example, K is given by

capital expenditures under 1980 law divided by capital costs under ACRS.

      For the undistorted (counterfactual) equilibrium, capital costs

should be the same for all assets, but again these capital costs could

be net or gross of depreciation. We wish to abstract from the consider-

able debate on this issue, but we follow Bradford (1980) in noting that

welfare maximization requires the highest sustainable flow of net output,

achieved where net marginal products are equated. Thus undistorted costs

c. are derived as (p + 3), where p is a constant.    Our particular choice

for p is the capital—weighted average of p' from the distorted equilibrium,

such that both equilibria have the same aggregate pre—tax return, the same

aggregate after—tax return, and the same total tax revenue.

      Once we have data on tax parameters from the next section, equations

(1) and (3) together provide capital costs and welfare costs as functions

of i and ri.   These two parameters could be specified independently for a

number of possible cases, but there is further reason to believe that the

nominal interest rate is itself related to the inflation rate. Two plausible

relationships are:



               =   +   /(1-u)                                            (4a)


and

           j=j+1f        ,
                                                                         (4b)



where i0 is the interest rate in the absence of inflation. In the first

relationship, called Modified Fisherts Law (NFL) by Bradford and Fullerton

 (1981), inflation adds more than point—for—point to the nominal interest

 rate. This relationship insures that s, the real after—tax rate of return,
                                 —7—

is invariant with respect to inflation. Frauineni and Jorgenson (1980) provide

some evidence in support of this proposition, but it need not be viewed as

an empirical relationship. Instead, we may wish to make the ceteris paribus

assumption that s is fixed as we look at different 'IT.   Equation (4b) has

been called Strict Fisher's Law (SFL), as inflation adds exactly point—for—

point to nominal interest. Summers (1981) and others suggest that this is

an empirical upper bound on the impact of inflation.

      In one set of calculations below, we set i at .04, use equation (4a),
                                                0

vary inflation, and calculate W as a function of Ti.   Policymakers face

uncertainty about TI, but equation (4a) insures that s is always 4 percent.

In a second set of calculations, we set i such that the real after—tax rate
                                        0

of   return is .04 when inflation is 7 percent. We then vary Ti in equation

(4b) such that the real after—tax return varies with inflation.     In this

case, because s depends on 'ii, uncertainty about inflation creates further

uncertainty about the after—tax rate of return. In either case, W can be

written as W(Tr). We assume that policymakers face a distribution of possible

inflation rates centered around a mean of 7 percent. For computational

simplicity, we use an approximate uniform distribution, where each' inflation

rate between 1 percent and 13 percent is equally likely, but other distri-

butions would yield similar results. Where E is the expectations operator,

we show how E[W(Ti)] differs from W[E(Ti)].




3. The Specification of Alternative Tax Regimes

      We start with a description of credits and allowances that existed

in 1980, before President Reagan's recent tax reform initiatives. We

then describe the Accelerated Cost Recovery System (ACRS) as introduced

in the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA) and amended in the Tax
                               —8—


Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA). Finally, we describe

an alternative scheme suggested by Auerbach and Jorgenson (1980). More

description of these tax plans and their modelling can be found in Fullerton

and Henderson (1983). For all of these reforms, we assume that the firm

can use all credits and allowances on depreciable assets, and LIFO account-

ing for inventories, in order to minimize taxes .   The real return to

land and inventories, as well as other taxable income, is subject to the

statutory rate u given by the top corporate rate bracket of 46 percent.

     For each plan, we evaluate incentives to invest in each of the 33

asset types listed in Table 1. The first 20 assets are types of equipment,

the next 11 are types of structures, and the last two are inventories and

land. We treat each of these assets as individually homogenous, in the

sense that each has a single tax treatment and economic depreciation rate

(cS). Hulten and Wykoff (1981) provide estimates of f, shown in column 1

of Table 1.

     As of 1980, the investment tax credit stood at a ten percent rate for

all public utility structures (assets 24—28) and for equipment with tax

lifetimes of at least seven years. The credit was 6.7 percent for equip-

ment with a lifetime of at least five years (assets 4 and 14) and 3.3

percent for equipment with a lifetime of at least three years (asset 15).

These rates are shown in column 2 of Table 1.

     The Asset Depreciation Range (ADR) System, in effect in 1980, allowed

firms to depreciate equipment and public utility structures over lifetimes

given by 80 to 120 percent of the many diverse "Guideline" lifetimes that

were set in 1962. Jorgenson and Sullivan (1981) estimated guideline life-

times for each of our more aggregate asset categories, but we assume that

firms minimize taxes. We therefore use 80 percent of these guideline
                                 —9—


lifetimes for eligible assets, unless that choice would raise taxes by

lowering the investment tax credit. Computers, for example, could be

depreciated over 5 years with a 6.7 percent credit, but taxes are lower

if the firm uses 7 years in order to receive the 10 percent credit. Tax

minimizing lifetimes for all assets are shown in column 3 of Table 1.

     Also,   in 1980, equipment and public utility property were eligible

for double declining balance (DDB) or sum—of—the—years'—digits (SYD)

methods of depreciation. If we define L as the asset's lifetime for tax

purposes, then DDB allows depreciation equal to 2/L of the remaining basis

each year. Because of the half—year convention, however, all assets are

assumed to have been purchased on July 1. They receive half of the DDB

amount (that is, i/L) in the year of purchase, leaving a basis of (1—i/L).

They then receive 2/L of this remaining basis in the first full year of

ownership. At this point, as shown in Fullerton and Henderson (1983), the

firm would minimize taxes by switching to SYD. If there are 3.5 years left

(as for a 5 year asset), the firm takes the basis remaining at the time of

the switch and divides it over the remaining years according to the frac-

tions obtained by using a denominator of 8.0 and numerators of 3.5, 2.5, 1.5,

and 0.5.

     For other structures firms could use 150 percent of declining balance

(l.5/L of remaining basis each year), with an optimal switch to straight—

line after one—third of the life of the asset. These depreciation allowances,

specified by law over a finite number of years for each asset, are dis-

counted by the firm's nominal after—tax rate of return because allowances

are based on historical cost. Since the entire purchase price was depreci-

able in 1980, we use 1.0 for the parameter a..
                                 — 10 —



     We   have now specified enough information to calculate the equilibrium

pre—tax return, or net marginal product, under 1980 law for each asset.

These are shown in column 4 of Table 1 for the case of a 7 percent rate

of inflation and fixed 4 percent real after—tax rate of return. Because

of credits and accelerated depreciation allowances in 1980, the required pre-

tax return on investment in equipment is considerably less than that of other

assets. Land and inventories receive "economic" depreciation allowances at

rate zero, since they do not depreciate, but inflation reduces the real

value of allowances on some structures to less than economic depreciation

at replacement cost. Associated welfare losses could be reduced by moving

resources from low to high marginal product investments, until the net

marginal products were equated. The next section discusses estimates of

welfare cost.

     The Accelerated Cost Recovery System (ACRS) was introduced in 1981

and amended in 1982. It establishes an investment tax credit of six per-

cent for autos (asset 15) and ten percent for all other equipment and

public utility property. These credit rates are shown in column 5 of

Table 1. For lifetimes, the law assigns three years to autos, five years

to other equipment, ten years to some public utility structures, and fifteen

years to other structures. These lifetimes are shown in column 6. The

1981 law specified a transition to more accelerated depreciation schedules,

but the 1982 law repealed the transition and left equipment and public

utility structures at 150 percent of declining balance with an optimal

switch to straight line after one—third of the life of the asset. It

also reduced depreciable bases by one—half the investment tax credit, so

a. is .97 for autos and .95 for other equipment and public utility pro-

perty. Other structures receive 175 percent of declining balance with an
                                   —ii—


optimal switch to straight line after three—sevenths of the life of the

asset (see Fullerton and Henderson, 1983).

     Pre—tax returns for this 1982 version of ACRS are shown in column 7

of Table 1, for the case of 7 percent inflation and fixed 4 percent real

after—tax return. Most types of equipment experience reductions from

1980 law, and most pay very small taxes in the sense that the pre—tax

returns barely exceed the 4 percent after—tax return to the corporation.

Taxes on structures are also reduced, but nondepreciable assets are un-

affected. King and Fullerton (1984, Chapter 6) find that the new cor-

porate tax system provides a net subsidy to investment, when they add

consideration of debt finance, interest deductions, and additional personal

taxes. In their model, the total tax wedge rises when the corporate tax

and all allowances are eliminated.

     The Auerbach—Jorgenson (AJ) first year recovery plan would provide

the firm with one depreciation deduction at the time the asset is purchased.

It would eliminate the investment tax credit and calculate the one—time

deduction as the present value of economic depreciation. Policymakers

could use the Hulten—Wykoff estimates of exponential depreciation rates

(a.) and discount at the real after—tax interest rate (s) to obtain the

deduction (z.) as a./(s +   a.).   Substitution into equation (1) implies

that a. equals s/(l—u) for all j, so the tax scheme appears not to distort

the allocation of capital among assets. Pre—tax returns on all assets

are .0741, for comparison with the varying pre—tax returns found in column

4 or column 7 of Table 1. This neutrality, however, depends on the accuracy

of economic depreciation rates and the firm's real after—tax discount rate

that are used by policymakers to set the first year deduction. If the firm

uses different depreciation rates or a different discount rate, then the
                                 — 12 —




required   pre—tax rate of return that it faces may not be the same for all

assets.

    We have no way here to judge the quality of depreciation rate estimates,

but we are concerned with the discount rate used to set the first year

allowance. Under Modified Fisher's Law, as described above, uncertainty

about inflation does not create uncertainty about the after—tax return.

If policymakers can accurately estimate this fixed after—tax return used

for discounting, then they can set the first year allowance for each asset

such that pre—tax returns are all equal. Under Strict Fisher's Law, however,

after—tax returns fall with inflation. Policymakers might use the expected

s to discount economic depreciation and set the first year allowances, but

firms generally evaluate their investment incentives after policy has been

set and after they have more information about s. If they use a discount

rate other than the one used by government, then the present value of

depreciation may not equal the first year allowance, and pre—tax returns

may vary. To avoid interasset distortions in this case, economic deprecia-

tion must be allowed as it occurs, completely indexed for inflation.



4. Welfare Results

     For each tax scheme, a given rate of inflation can be used in equation

(4a) or (4b) to get the nominal interest rate, in equation (1) to get pre-

tax returns, and in equation (3) to estimate welfare costs from differential

taxation of assets. Rather than report absolute dollar amounts, however,

we find it useful to express welfare costs as a fraction of estimated tax

revenue. This ratio is not limited to prices of a particular year, and it

provides a useful measure of the efficiency of each tax. For revenue in

the denominator, we use the aggregate difference between pre—tax returns
                                   — 13 —



and after—tax returns, as measured by ,K.(p.      —
                                                      s).   This denominator

is not the actual revenue in any particular year, but it indicates the

long—run annual amount that could be collected by the relevant tax scheme

if all investments were financed by equity and earned the hypothesized

returns.

     When ACRS lumped many diverse kinds of equipment into a single five—

year category, and many kinds of structures into a single fifteen—year

category, it effectively abandoned any attempt to provide allowances

based on economic depreciation. It introduced new variance among required

pre—tax returns, but it achieved its primary objective of providing

investment incentives by reducing those pre—tax returns. As a result,

welfare cost ratios tend to be higher under ACRS than under the 1980 law,

both because absolute welfare costs are higher and because long run

revenues are lower.

     In designing the 1980 law or ACRS, policymakers may have expected

a particular rate of inflation, and they may have set accelerated deprecia-

tion allowances at least partly to offset the tax—raising effects of histori-

cal cost depreciation. If either tax law is fixed while inflation turns out

to be very low, however, then equipment is highly subsidized and structures

are less highly taxed. Long run revenues from depreciable assets can be

arbitrarily small, and welfare cost ratios can be arbitrarily high. Increased

inflation then raises the tax on equipment more than on structures, makes

pre—tax returns more similar, raises long—run revenue, and reduces the

welfare cost ratio. This falling welfare cost ratio is plotted against

the inflation rate for each tax law in Figure 1, assuming Modified Fisher's

Law of equation (4a). Real after—tax rates of return are fixed in this case,

n   welfare   costs under the Auerbach-JorgeflSOfl plan are measured at zero.

     The cost—of—capital and excess burden framework in this paper is not

new. Many studies have used a similar framework to measure the welfare

costs from differential taxation of assets. Most of these studies use a

single expected rate of inflation, however, and report a single welfare

cost estimate. Figure 1 indicates two major problems with this approach.

First, the rapidly falling curves indicate that welfare cost is very sensitive

to the choice for a single rate of inflation. Second, even with a good

estimate of the expected inflation rate, E(ri), the welfare cost W{E()J may

be a poor substitute for the expected welfare cost E{W(Tr)}. We use as

an example the case where inflation rates between 1 percent and 13 percent

are equally likely, while the real after—tax interest rate is 4 percent.

If only the expected 7 percent inflation rate is used in equations (4a),

(1), and (3), we find that welfare cost under the 1980 law is 2.8 percent

of long run revenues. This point can be taken from the curve in Figure 1,

at 7 percent inflation. All points on the curve are equally likely, however.

and the mean of the different possible welfare cost outcomes under 1980 la;

is almost 4 percent of revenue. Under ACRS, W[E(T)] is 3.5 percent of

revenue, while E[W(IT)] is 4.8 percent of revenue. In general, because

the curve is convex to the horizontal axis,             E[W('rr)]   is greater than

W[E@T)] for any distribution of inflation rates

     The same two problems are apparent in Figure 2 for the case of Strict
                                                              inflation in this case
Fisher's Law in equation (4b). Uncertainty about

implies further uncertainty about the real after—tax rate of return. Again

welfare cost ratios are very sensitive to the inflation rate, and again

the curves are convex. The welfare cost ratio at 7 percent inflation under—

estimates the correct expected welfare cost ratio by 22 percent under 1980

law and by 13 percent under ACRS.

     Inflation   reduces the real value of depreciation allowances, but it

does not affect the relatively high tax on nondepreciable assets such

as land and inventories. Thus, up to a point in Figure 2, inflation

reduces welfare costs by raising taxes on equipment and structures. Once

the cost of depreciable capital exceeds the cost of nondepreciable capital,

however, further inflation makes them less equal and raises welfare costs.

This turning point is reached at 11 percent inflation under 1980 law and at

12 percent inflation under ACRS. (The same phenomenon occurs with >todified

Fishers Law, but the rate of inflation would have to exceed 13 percent

before it erodes the real value of depreciation allowances enouch to make

the cost of equipment and structures as high on average as the cost of

land and inventories.)

     As can be seen in Figure 2, the Auerbach—Jorgenson plan is no Longer

neutral in the case where the inflation outcome may affect the real after—

tax return, that is, where s may be written s(). Policymakers must use

a single rate such as the expected after—tax return E(s) to discount economic

depreciation and set the first year allowance. The AJ deduction must be

set long before investment takes place, however, so firms may be able

to obtain much more information about s.       In the extreme case of this paper,

where all uncertainty is resolved before the firm invests, therequired

pre—tax return may be written as


                      s(r) + .           u3.
                  =              [1 - E(s)      -
                       1 -



     If   s turns out to equal E(s), then p. reduces to s/(l—u) for all

assets, and the tax is nondistorting. Given our approximate uniform distri-

bution, as an example, policymakers would use the expected 7 percent inflation
                                  — 16 —




rate   and the expected 4 percent discount rate to set the first year

allowances. If expectations are realized, Figure 2 hows that welfare

costs are zero. If inflation is anything other than 7 percent, then s

does not equal E(s), and equation (5) shows that p. depends on f. Different

assets have different pre—tax returns, and the tax is no longer neutral.

Welfare costs rise above zero for inflation rates less than 7 percent or

more than 7 percent, so Figure 2 also shows a convex function for welfare

cost ratios under AJ. Welfare costs at the expected rate of inflation are

zero, but the mean of the equally likely welfare cost outcomes is .5 percent

of revenues.

       A final interesting aspect of Figure 2 is that the three curves

cross. While ACRS has the highest welfare cost ratio for most inflation

outcomes, it is not necessarily the most distorting of the three tax pro-

posals.     If the inflation rate is 10, 11, or 12 percent, under our assumed

parameters, then welfare costs from the 1980 law are larger as a propor-

tion of revenues. If inflation turns out to be 13 percent, under deductions

set for the expected 7 percent rate, then the Auerbach—Jorgenson plan is

most distorting. If we do not know the inflation rate before we choose a

 tax plan, then we cannot know that our choice will minimize excess burden.

We could choose the plan with the lowest expected welfare cost, but any

plan might turn out to have the highest welfare cost.



5. Conclusion
       Tax policy is limited by the fact that laws must be set in an uncertain

environment. Fixed depreciation schedules designed for a period of high

inflation may not perform well during periods of low inflation, and vice

versa. Recognizing that legislative changes can be slow, a good tax law
                                  — 17 —




would be "adaptable" enough to operate efficiently over a range of

economic outcomes.

       We compare the efficieficy of three possible tax schemes for the U.S.

under a variety of parameter outcomes. When uncertainty about inflation

creates uncertainty only about the nominal interest rate, we find that

investment distortions cause greater welfare losses under ACRS than under

1980 law for all levels of inflation. As welfare losses decline with

inflation, the difference between the two laws becomes small. In addition,

because welfare costs are a convex function of the inflation rate, the

expected welfare cost can be significantly greater than the welfare cost

measured at the expected inflation rate.

       As long as policymakers can correctly identify the firm's real after—

tax discount rate in order to calculate the present value of economic

depreciation, the Auerbach—Jorgenson first year recovery plan does not

distort the choice among assets. When uncertainty extends to the after—

tax rate of return, however, AJ may no longer be neutral. First year

deductions may be set using the expected after—tax return, but the cost—of—

capital varies among assets if firms use a different after—tax return to

discount economic depreciation. Auerbach and Jorgenson (1980) are correct

that "these allowances would be unaffected by inflation or by variations

in its rate," (p. 117),   but the point is that   neutrality would uire

the allowance to react when inflation variability affects the after—tax

return.

       Our results indicate that policymakers cannot know with certainty which

tax plan will cause the smallest welfare cost. The Auerbach—Jorgenson

plan   performs best for a wide range of inflation outcomes, but its welfare
cost   ratio rises rapidly at high inflation where government has over—
                                 — 18 —




estimated   the real after—tax return. If ex post indexing is not an option,

then policymakers may wish to set first—year deductions by systematically

underestimating the real after—tax discount rate. Such a policy would

minimize the chance that large losses would occur under AJ. At the

extreme, with the use of a zero discount rate, this policy would imply

fully expensing of new investments and an associated loss of tax revenue.

Absent ex post indexing, full expensing is the only policy certain to avoid

distorting the choice among assets.
