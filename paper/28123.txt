                                         ABSTRACT

This paper uses a dataset covering the universe of French firm-level sales, imports, and exports
over the period 1993-2007 and a quantitative multi-country model to study the international
transmission of business cycle shocks at both the micro and the macro levels. The largest firms
are both important enough to generate aggregate fluctuations (Gabaix, 2011), and most likely to
be internationally connected. This implies that foreign shocks are transmitted to the domestic
economy primarily through the largest firms. We first document a novel stylized fact: larger
French firms are significantly more sensitive to foreign GDP growth. We then implement a
quantitative framework calibrated to the full extent of observed heterogeneity in firm size,
exporting, and importing. We simulate the propagation of foreign shocks to the French economy
and report one micro and one macro finding. At the micro level heterogeneity across firms
predominates: 40 to 85% of the impact of foreign fluctuations on French GDP is accounted for by
the "foreign granular residual" -- the term capturing the fact that larger firms are more affected
by the foreign shocks. At the macro level, firm heterogeneity dampens the impact of foreign
shocks, with the GDP responses 10 to 20% larger in a representative firm model compared to the
baseline model.

1        Introduction

This paper studies the international transmission of business cycle shocks at the firm and the aggre-
gate levels. After decades of globalization, the structure of production is increasingly international,
with supply chains overlapping with country borders. An important feature of this international-
ization of production is that the largest firms are responsible for the bulk of international trade
linkages in a typical economy (e.g., Freund and Pierola, 2015). As a result, while only a minority
of firms have direct trade linkages with foreign countries, those firms tend to account for a large
share of aggregate economic activity (di Giovanni et al., 2017, 2018).
        We quantify the consequences of this phenomenon for international shock transmission. Our
point of departure is that even purely aggregate foreign shocks aect firms dierentially depending
on the extent and nature of their international linkages. In that sense, an aggregate shock to a
country's trading partners manifests itself as a set of heterogeneous shocks to individual firms. Our
analysis combines a dataset covering the universe of French firm sales and country-specific imports
and exports over the period 1993-2007 and a quantitative multi-country multi-sector model with
heterogeneous firms. We present one micro finding and one macro finding.
        The micro result is that foreign shocks are predominantly granular fluctuations. To make this
statement precise, let d ln Y F be the log change in France's GDP following a foreign shock. By
definition, d ln Y F is a weighted average of individual firms' value added changes. As in Gabaix
(2011) and Gabaix and Koijen (2019), the GDP change can be decomposed into the simple average
value added change across all firms in France E F , and the foreign granular residual                   F:


                                               d ln Y F = E F +     F
                                                                        .                                         (1)

The superscript F on all three objects calls attention to the fact that these are all changes in
response to a foreign rather than a domestic shock. The foreign granular residual                   F   captures the
deviation of larger firms' value added changes from the unweighted average value added change. It
is proportional to the cross-sectional covariance between firm size and firm response to the shock.
Because the foreign shocks aect predominantly the largest firms in France, they lead to granular
fluctuations. We subject our model French economy to foreign shocks, and find that                       F   accounts
for 40      85% of the resulting fluctuations in French GDP, depending on the shock.1
    1
    Various meanings have been attached to the word "granular" in the literature. To be precise, what we mean by
"granular" in this paper is that the term F in (1) is quantitatively important. More broadly, we use this adjective to
capture the notion that foreign shocks produce domestic aggregate fluctuations driven disproportionately by larger
firms. It has been understood since Gabaix (2011) that the granular residual can in principle arise from idiosyncratic
shocks to large firms, or from a dierential response of larger firms to common shocks. While Gabaix (2011) explores
the former, this paper emphasizes the latter. A distinct question is whether the observed firm size distribution
comes from fat-tailed underlying distributions (what one might term "heterogeneity"), or from idiosyncratic draws
that deviate from those underlying distributions (the meaning that Gaubert and Itskhoki (2020) attach to the word
"granular"). As will become clear, an advantage of our approach of using actual firms in the quantification is that
we never need to take a stand on which of these forces leads to the observed firm data. Our results are not sensitive
to the relative importance of "heterogeneity" vs. "granularity" (in this narrower sense) in the data.


                                                          1
       The macro result is that the observed heterogeneity across firms dampens the impact of foreign
shocks. Following the same foreign shock, the GDP change in an economy with identical amounts
of trade and output, but no within-sector firm heterogeneity is 10                    20% larger than the GDP
change in the baseline economy. Thus, the micro structure aects aggregate outcomes.
       We begin by documenting a novel stylized fact: larger French firms are significantly more
sensitive to foreign GDP growth. This empirical regularity is prima facie evidence that larger
firms are more susceptible to foreign fluctuations, suggesting that the foreign granular residual                    F

could be quantitatively important.2 We also document that in our data (i) there is a great deal
of heterogeneity in both import and export participation among French firms; and (ii) larger firms
are systematically more likely to trade internationally, consistent with a large body of previous
literature.
       The econometric estimates do not lend themselves well to aggregation or to performing counter-
factuals, as they yield the relative impact of foreign GDP growth across firms, but not the overall
impact. That is, the regression evidence relates the variation in sensitivity to foreign GDP to firm
size, but does not pin down either the level of individual firm-level value added changes, nor the
terms in (1). Thus, we employ a quantitative framework to simulate the eects of foreign shocks
on the French economy.
       The model is calibrated to the observed firm-level information for France, and to the sector-
level information for France's trading partners from the World Input-Output Database (WIOD). A
distinctive feature of our framework is that it is implemented directly on firm-level data. In other
words, objects inside the model are actual firms in France. This means we capture the full extent
of the joint heterogeneity across French firms in size and international linkages, without relying on
common shortcuts like integrating over assumed parametric underlying productivity distributions.
Importantly, our model is solved in general equilibrium with discrete firms, implying that shocks
experienced by individual firms can move equilibrium objects such as wages, prices, and GDP. Thus,
it is the appropriate environment to quantify the impact of the micro heterogeneity on aggregate
outcomes.
       The transmission mechanisms in the model are standard. Following a positive foreign produc-
tivity shock, firms importing foreign inputs experience a fall in the prices of those inputs, and
thus expand production. Changes in foreign demand (which could be due to a foreign productivity
shock or a foreign demand shock) aect the firms' export sales. External shocks are transmitted
   2
    This result is reduced-form evidence of the relationship between firm size and sensitivity to foreign shocks. It is
not driven by dierences in overall procyclicality, as larger firms are not dierentially more sensitive to the domestic
GDP growth. In our quantitative model, the sensitivity to foreign shocks arises from import and export links. Our
previous work looks directly at the link between trade at the firm level and comovement with foreign countries,
providing micro evidence for transmission of shocks through trade linkages. Di Giovanni et al. (2014) shows that
firms exporting to foreign countries are subject to demand shocks from those countries. Di Giovanni et al. (2018)
documents that firms importing from, and exporting to, a foreign country are more correlated with GDP growth in
that country.

inside the French economy via domestic input-output linkages and general equilibrium eects on
the domestic goods and factor prices. Thus, even purely domestic firms in France are in principle
aected by foreign shocks.
   We quantify the decomposition (1) in two ways. First, we subject our world economy to
hypothetical foreign shocks: a 10% productivity shock to all the countries other than France, and a
10% foreign demand shock for French goods. Following these shocks, the foreign granular residual
is responsible for 40    85% of the total GDP change, depending on the shock. Second, we simulate
the response of the economy to actual foreign productivity shocks, sourced from the Penn World
Table. Foreign TFP shocks can account for about one tenth of the actual GDP fluctuations in
France. More importantly for us, the standard deviation of the foreign granular residual is 90%
of the standard deviation of overall fluctuations in French GDP generated by foreign shocks. All
in all, both of our quantitative exercises show that foreign shocks manifest themselves as largely
granular fluctuations.
   To establish the macro result, we compare the change in GDP following a foreign shock to
the change in GDP in a counterfactual model that suppresses all within-sector heterogeneity in
both importing and exporting. We refer to this alternative as the homogeneous firm model. It
is common in international macro and trade, and can be implemented with only sector-level data
such as the WIOD. The homogeneous firm model produces GDP changes that are 10             20% larger
than the baseline. Surprisingly, the granularity of the economy dampens the GDP responses to
foreign shocks.
   We build intuition for this finding via a combination of theoretical and numerical results. The
baseline model diers from the homogeneous firm model in two respects: (i) heterogeneous firm
sales, and (ii) heterogeneous production functions across firms within a sector, reflected in firm-
specific imported intermediate input shares. We investigate the consequences of these two sources of
heterogeneity in turn. First, we prove analytically that if production functions are identical among
firms within a sector, the real GDP change due to a foreign shock is invariant to the distribution of
market shares across firms. This theoretical result provides a sharp characterization of the source
of the dampening eect: a necessary condition for dampening is heterogeneity in the use of foreign
inputs.
   We next provide a heuristic illustration for how this dimension of heterogeneity generates damp-
ening. Raising a firm's imported input share lowers its impact on domestic GDP. This is because
mechanically, a higher imported input share means lower demand for domestic value added by the
firm. At the same time, raising a firm's imported input share increases its exposure to foreign
shocks. Thus, relative to a representative firm world, introducing heterogeneity in imported input
shares leads to a negative covariance in the cross section of firms between impact on domestic GDP
and exposure to foreign shocks. This negative covariance is the source of the dampening eect of


                                                 3
production function heterogeneity. Because this dampening eect of firm heterogeneity is to our
knowledge new in the literature, we illustrate it using a simple 2-firm model as well as a variation
of the full-fledged quantitative model.
       We conclude that heterogeneity across firms in the responsiveness to foreign shocks is pervasive
at the micro level, and relevant for macro adjustment. Reallocation of market shares towards firms
more exposed to imported inputs following a positive foreign shock dampens the aggregate response
of the economy.

Related literature.        The paper draws from and contributes to the active literature on the micro
origins of aggregate fluctuations. Carvalho (2010) and Acemoglu et al. (2012) modernized the
research program on shock propagation through the input networks that dates back to Long and
Plosser (1983). A number of papers enriched the theory and quantification of the sectoral input
network models (see, among others, Foerster et al., 2011; Acemoglu et al., 2016; Atalay, 2017;
Grassi, 2017; Baqaee, 2018; Baqaee and Farhi, 2019a,b; Foerster et al., 2019; Bigio and La'O,
2020). At the same time, the seminal contribution of Gabaix (2011) drew attention to the role of
large firms in the macroeconomy, which has been further quantified and formalized by di Giovanni
et al. (2014), Carvalho and Grassi (2019), and Gaubert and Itskhoki (2020) among others. Atkeson
and Burstein (2008), Eaton et al. (2012), and Burstein et al. (2020) explore the consequences
of discreteness in environments with variable markups. The research agendas on input networks
and firm granularity are merging, with the latest modeling and measurement exercises capturing
network interactions at the firm level (e.g., Barrot and Sauvagnat, 2016; Huneeus, 2018; Lim, 2018;
Taschereau-Dumouchel, 2019; Carvalho et al., 2020; Dhyne et al., 2020).
       We apply the insights and tools from this literature to the international transmission of shocks.
Hummels et al. (2001), Yi (2003), and Johnson and Noguera (2012, 2017) document the importance
of international input trade, while Burstein et al. (2008), Bems et al. (2010), Johnson (2014),
Eaton et al. (2016b), and Eaton et al. (2016a), among others, model and quantify international
shock transmission through input trade. Baqaee and Farhi (2019c) and Huo et al. (2020) develop
theoretical and quantitative treatments of the international input network model. The international
business cycle literature has by and large not used firm-level data in empirical and quantitative
assessments of shock transmission.3 The few recent exceptions include di Giovanni and Levchenko
(2012), Kleinert et al. (2015), Cravino and Levchenko (2017), Blaum et al. (2018), di Giovanni et
al. (2018), Blaum (2019), and Boehm et al. (2019). Our paper combines empirics, quantification,

    Ghironi and Melitz (2005) and Alessandria and Choi (2007) provide quantitative assessments of the transmission
of aggregate shocks using international real business cycle models with heterogeneous firms. In these papers, firm
heterogeneity is handled by tracking the moments of the firm size distribution, whereas in our work each actual firm
is an object in the model. These papers explore the role of the extensive margin whereas we focus on the intensive
margin in the context of heterogeneous export and import participation. The intensive margin is quantitatively more
important for aggregate fluctuations and cross-border business cycle comovement in environments with fat-tailed
firm-size distributions, as is the case in the data (di Giovanni et al., 2014, 2018).

2    The Foreign Granular Residual

To set the stage for the empirical and quantitative exercises that follow, we set up a simple ac-
counting framework that introduces the concept of the foreign granular residual and illustrates the
consequences of heterogeneity for the aggregates. Let Ym denote real GDP in country m, and let
Yf,m denote the real value added of firm f . GDP is just the sum of firm-level value added:
                                                                    X
                                                        Ym =                Yf,m .                                             (2)
                                                                        f

We are interested in understanding the change in GDP following some foreign shock. Denote by
      F the log change in m's GDP following that foreign shock, and by !                                           Yf,m,   1
d ln Ym                                                                  f,m,                               1       Ym,    1
                                                                                                                               the
pre-shock share of firm f 's value added in total GDP. The aggregate GDP change is the weighted
                                     F :
sum of firm-level log changes d ln Yf,m
                                                                X
                                                    F                                   F
                                              d ln Ym   =           !f,m,      1 d ln Yf,m .
                                                                f

The GDP change can then be written as:

                                                          F
                                                    d ln Ym     = EF +               F
                                                                                         ,

where the superscript F on all the values highlights the fact that all of these are changes following a

foreign shock. The component E F  N                 F
                                           f d ln Yf,m is the unweighted average value added change
across all N firms in the economy. The foreign granular residual                               F   is the size-weighted firm
deviation from the unweighted average, as in Gabaix (2011) and Gabaix and Koijen (2019):
                                         0                            1

    To build intuition on the meaning of the granular residual, note that with some manipulation
it can be rewritten as a covariance between firm size and the firm value added change:
                                                            !

                                                    = Cov                   , d ln Yf,m  ,                                     (4)
                                                                    !
             1   P                       1                  F
where !      N       f   !f,m,   1   =   N.    Writing          this way helps illustrate the role of granularity in
international shock transmission. Since the largest firms are more likely to be internationally
connected, we would expect them to have a larger increase in value added following a positive
foreign shock, and thus the covariance in (4) is positive.


                                                                    5
    From here, we proceed as follows. After introducing the dataset, Section 3 provides reduced-
form regression evidence that the covariance (4) is positive, by estimating the dierential sensitivity
of larger firms to foreign shocks. Section 4 then sets up a multi-country general equilibrium model
of trade that captures this reduced-form pattern through dierences across firms in foreign market
participation. Section 5 quantifies the size of the foreign granular residual following foreign shocks,
and presents the main macro dampening result. Section 6 concludes.


3     Data and Basic Facts

We combine administrative data on the universe of French firms' value added, imports, and exports
with standard multi-country sector-level databases of production and trade. The use of micro data
for one country allows us to capture the heterogeneous exposure of individual firms to foreign
shocks. While such heterogeneity obviously exists in all countries, firm-level information at this
level of detail and coverage is not available for multiple countries at once. As a consequence, we will
study the impact of firm heterogeneity using the French firm-level data, suppressing heterogeneity
within sectors in the rest of the country sample.

3.1      Firm-Level Variables

We make use of an administrative dataset that contains balance sheet information collected from
individual firms' tax forms, and includes sales, value added, total exports, the cost structure, as well
as its sector of activity for the universe of French firms over 1993-2007.4 This source is complemented
with customs data on bilateral export and import flows at the firm level. The resulting dataset is
described in greater detail in di Giovanni et al. (2018). Table A1 reports the distribution of firms
across sectors in 2005. Interestingly, the largest sector in terms of its contribution to aggregate value
added is the one providing "Business Activities" to the rest of the economy. This underscores how
important input-output relationships are to the functioning of modern economies. More generally,
non-traded sectors are a large share of the French economy, accounting for more than 80% of firms
and 72% of the value added in our sample. The comparison of these two numbers indicates that
non-traded sector firms tend to be relatively small. There are some exceptions, however. For
instance, firms in the "Post and Telecommunications" or the "Air Transport" sectors are relatively
large.
    When describing the variables in this section, we anticipate the notation used in the quantitative
framework (Section 4) throughout. Following di Giovanni et al. (2014), we harmonize customs and
tax form data to obtain sales by destination market (Xf,mn,j for m = F rance). The tax files
contain information on total sales and total exports, which we use to allocate total sales by the
    4
      We work with data for this period because after 2011 import data at firm-product level for France are substantially
left-censored. Our sample ends in 2007 to sidestep the 2008 trade collapse as well.


                                                           6
firm to the domestic or all foreign markets. We then use customs data to apportion total exports to
specific destination markets. We perform a similar exercise for firm inputs. The tax data contain
information on total input purchases. We combine it with customs data on the value of imports by
origin country and type of product to build values for source- and sector-specific input expenditures.
The customs data do not include trade in services. As a consequence, we have no choice but to treat
all services as non-tradables and adjust the calibration accordingly. Appendix A and di Giovanni
et al. (2014) provide further detail on apportioning sectors into tradables and non-tradables, and
the construction of firm-level trade and factor shares.

3.2   Aggregate and Sectoral Variables

The main source of data at the country-sector level is the World Input Output Database (WIOD)
(Timmer et al., 2015). This dataset combines national input-output tables and data on bilateral
trade flows to build the matrix of all intra- and international flows of goods and services between
sectors and final consumers. We use the 2013 release of the dataset which covers 40 countries plus a
rest of the world aggregate and 35 sectors classified according to the ISIC Revision 3 nomenclature.
These data are available over 1995 to 2011 and the benchmark year for the calibration of the
quantitative model is 2005.
   The WIOD dataset is used to recover: i) final consumption spending (Pn Cn ); ii) the value of
bilateral sales by sector (Xmn,j ); and iii) the sectoral production function parameters, which are
used whenever more disaggregated data are not available. We use these data to measure the share
                                               l ) as well as the components of the input-output
of labor in country n sector j 's total costs (n,j
matrix, as measured by the share of inputs sourced from country m sector j by firms operating in
                    M
country n sector i (mn,ji ). The IO coe cients are readily available from the WIOD. Labor shares
are measured by the ratio of value added over output, to be consistent with the interpretation of
L as "equipped labor."
   The French administrative data and the WIOD data must be made consistent with each other,
as the final dataset must feature firm-level trade flows that aggregate up to the sector-level bilateral
trade flows reported in WIOD. In addition, shares of value added in total output implied by the
French data must match those implied by WIOD for France. Appendix A describes in detail the
harmonization procedure.

3.3   Basic Facts

Fact 1: Larger firms are more sensitive to foreign GDP growth.                          We establish this stylized
fact by means of the following heuristic regression:

         d ln Yf,m,j,t =   0 d ln YW,t   +   1 ln Yf,m,j,t 1    d ln YW,t +   2 ln Yf,m,j,t 1   +   j,t   + f,t ,   (5)



                                                          7
where d ln Yf,m,j,t is the log change in firm value added, ln Yf,m,j,t        1   is its initial log level, d ln YW,t
is the GDP growth in the world outside of France, and            j,t   is the sector-time eect. The coe cient
of interest     1   captures whether firms of dierent sizes have dierential elasticity of value added
growth with respect to foreign GDP.
       Table 1 reports the results. The first column presents estimates of (5) without any fixed eects.5
Column 2 adds year eects, which implies that we can no longer estimate the main eect of foreign
GDP growth. Columns 3-4 include interacted sector-year eects, implying that the coe cient of
interest is estimated from the variation across firms within a sector along the size dimension. The
coe cient of interest is strongly positive and significant: larger firms are more sensitive to foreign
growth. The point estimate falls when sector-year eects are added, but remains significant at 1%.
It is sizeable in magnitude, implying that a doubling of firm size increases the elasticity of firm
growth to world GDP growth by about 0.08.
       Next, we check whether larger firms are more sensitive to the foreign business cycle, or simply
more procyclical. Column 4 adds an interaction between firm size and French GDP growth. It is
clear that larger firms are more sensitive to foreign growth specifically: the interaction term of firm
size with respect to the domestic GDP growth is a precisely estimated zero. The elasticity with
respect to foreign growth is the same whether or not we control for the domestic growth interaction
term.


Fact 2: Larger firms are more likely to both export and import.                             Figure 1(a) plots the
cumulative distribution function of firm-level share of exports in total sales. Similarly, Figure 1(b)
plots the distribution of the intensity of imported input use, summarized by the share of foreign
                                           P     P      M
inputs in firms' total input expenditure ( n6=m i2T f,mn,ij   ). In both plots, the solid (red) line
depicts the unweighted distribution and the (blue) circles the distribution weighted by the firms'
share in overall value added.
       We stress two features of these figures, both of which are known in the trade literature and
are confirmed in our data. First, there is a great deal of heterogeneity across firms in both export
intensity and imported input use. Overall, 58% of the firms producing tradable goods do not export
in our data. Among the firms that do export, many have sales that are strongly biased towards the
domestic market. Still, about 6% of firms have export/total sales shares above 50%, and are thus
quite exposed to foreign demand shocks. Similarly, more than 85% of firms source the entirety of
their inputs locally, thus isolating themselves from (direct) foreign input price shocks. At the other
end of the spectrum, about 2% of firms source more than 40% of their inputs from abroad.
   5
     The main eect of foreign GDP growth is negative. However, the main eect coe cient must be interpreted
jointly with the size interaction. Combining the main eect with the size interaction, the impact of foreign growth
on firm value added turns positive above ln Yf,m,j,t of 7, corresponding to annual value added of about 1mln euros
(the value added variable is in thousands). Note that this main eect coe cient should be interpreted with caution,
as this specification does not include any fixed eects and thus omitted factors could be aecting the estimates.

    Second, participation in foreign markets is heavily tilted towards larger firms. This is illustrated
in Figure 1 by the comparison between the weighted and unweighted distributions. In both cases,
the cdfs of the weighted distributions are substantially below the unweighted ones, meaning that on
average larger firms have higher export and import intensities. For instance, the 6% of firms with
more than 50% of their turnover abroad represent as much as 30% of the overall value added in
tradable sectors. On the import side, the 15% of firms that source some inputs from abroad account
for nearly 60% of aggregate value added, and firms sourcing more than 40% of their inputs abroad
account for 10% of aggregate value added. In unreported results, we checked that the heterogeneity
is not driven by cross-sector dierences in overall exposure. While non-traded good sectors tend to
be relatively less dependent on foreign inputs, most of the heterogeneity is actually driven by the
within-sector variation.


Mechanisms and existing evidence.                     The patterns illustrated in Facts 1 and 2 have a nat-
ural connection: the import and export linkages to foreign countries make the larger firms more
responsive to foreign shocks. The quantitative framework in the following section models these
linkages formally and simulates the economy's response to foreign shocks in an environment with

firms heterogeneous in both size and trade participation.
    It is a natural question why Fact 1 documents the reduced-form relationship with respect to size,
rather than the impact of exporting and importing on comovement with foreign GDP at the firm
level. In this paper we focus on the dierential sensitivity with respect to firm size for two reasons.
First, the foreign granular residual is the covariance between firm size and firm-level responses to
foreign shocks. Thus, our Fact 1 regressions is the most direct way to get at the object encapsulated
by (4).
    Second, there is already a large body of evidence, from our work and others', that demonstrates
convincingly using micro data that participation in international trade makes units (firms or sectors)
more correlated with foreign GDP. To give a partial review of this body of work, di Giovanni and
Levchenko (2010) shows that international trade synchronizes sectoral output across countries if
those sectors use each other as intermediate inputs. Di Giovanni et al. (2014) shows that firms
exporting to foreign countries are subject to demand shocks from those countries. Di Giovanni et
al. (2018) provides econometric evidence that firms importing from, and exporting to, a foreign
country are more correlated with GDP growth in that country. The latter two papers use the
same French micro data as in this paper. Boehm et al. (2019) demonstrates that US firms that
imported inputs subject to an exogenous shock (the 2011 Tohoku earthquake) contracted their


                                                                         10
output dramatically. Thus, to avoid redundance, we do not revisit these types of exercises in this
paper.


4     Quantitative Framework

This section builds a heterogeneous-firm, multi-country, multi-sector model of trade. Crucially, we
allow for heterogeneity in both input linkages and destination-specific sales at the firm level. The
model features endogenous factor supply so that we can analyze how domestic and foreign shocks
are transmitted to aggregate fluctuations.

4.1      Setup

The world is comprised of M countries and J sectors. Countries are denoted by m, n, and k , sectors
by i and j , and firms by f and g . The notation follows the convention that the first subscript always
denotes exporting (source) country, and the second subscript the importing (destination) country.


Households.      There are Ln households in country n. Each one consumes goods and supplies
labor. Preferences over consumption and leisure are GHH (Greenwood et al., 1988):
                                                            
                                                        0 ¯
                                  U ( c n , ln ) =  c n ¯ ln ,

where cn is per-capita consumption, ln the per-capita labor supply, and the function  is increasing
and concave. Note that the ln should be thought of as "equipped labor" (Alvarez and Lucas, 2007),
and thus captures the supply of all the primary factors.
    The final consumption aggregate is Cobb-Douglas in the j sectors, with expenditure shares #n,j :
                                                      Y      #n,j
                                             cn =           cn,j  ,
                                                       j

where cn,j is the per capita final consumption of sector j . Therefore, the ideal consumption price
index is:
                                               Y  Pn,j #n,j
                                        Pn =                             ,                         (6)
                                                           #n,j
                                                 j

where Pn,j is the price index of sector j goods in country n. Straightforward steps lead to the
following labor supply:
                                                              ¯1
                                                     1 wn          1
                                       Ln =                            Ln ,

Denote by n the aggregate profits of firms owned by households in n, and by Dn any trade

      Note that we use the French customs data for imports at the firm level, and thus every import
transaction is associated with a French firm (which may be a wholesaler or a retailer). Thus,
French final consumers are never observed to import final consumption goods directly, and as a
result French final consumption is composed only of domestically-supplied final goods.6 For all the
other countries, we do not have firm-level data on imports, but instead have final consumption
data by source country from WIOD. Thus, we assume that foreign consumers import final goods
directly.


Sectors.     Sectors are populated by heterogeneous, monopolistically-competitive firms. Not all
firms sell to all destinations. Denote by mn,j the set of firms from country m, sector j that sell to
country n. The CES aggregate of output in sector j of firms from m selling in country n is:

where Qf,mn,j is the quantity of firm f 's good from country m and sector j selling to country
n.7 The taste shock to a firm's destination-specific sales f,mn,j is at this point left unrestricted.
It could be allowed to have a firm-specific global component, and/or a source-destination-sector
common component across firms. The latter would be isomorphic to µmn,j in the cross section.
The price level of the aggregate of sector j sellers from m in destination n is:
                                        2                         3 1

where pf,mn,j is the price charged by firm f in country n.
       Let X denote expenditure (at each level of aggregation). Then demand faced by firm f in
country n is:
                                                                      p1

Thus, Xmn,j is the total value of exports from m to n in sector j , and Xf,mn,j is the value of exports
by firm f .

                                                                                                                     
Firms.      Firms face downward-sloping demand and set price equal to a constant markup                               1
over the marginal cost. (Below we show that the results are robust to allowing variable markups
following Atkeson and Burstein (2008), such that larger firms have both higher and more flexible
markups.) Firms located in m face an iceberg cost of mn,j to export to n. They have a total factor
productivity af , and the cost of the input bundle

firm does not use inputs from a particular sector and country. Sales by firm f from country m in

Labor market clearing ensures that real wages adjust to equate the aggregate labor demand (right-

Heterogeneity.         In the cross-section, heterogeneity in firm size is thus driven by productivity,
taste/quality, and dierences in input sourcing across firms. To illustrate, the share of firm f 's
sales in total sales by domestic firms to the home market in sector j is:
                                                                           1      1

Sales dispersion across firms in the same market is generated by dierences in productivity af ,
the taste shifter f,mm,j , and the fact that input sourcing shifters                         f,km,ij    dier across firms (even
though we assume that all firms face the same input prices Pkm,i ). As will become clear below, we
will not need to take a stand on the levels of af , f,mm,j , and                        f,km,ij .    Instead the counterfactual
exercises will use the observed shares such as f,mn,j directly to calibrate the model at the baseline
period and then use the equilibrium conditions to compute the changes in those f,mn,j 's between
the baseline and the counterfactual equilibrium.
   Following a shock, what are the reasons that firms will dier in their value added growth rates
       F ? With some manipulation, we can write the approximate log change in value added of
d ln Yf,m
firm f as:

where sf,mn,j,   1   is the pre-shock share of market n in the total gross sales of firm f . Thus, a firm
that only serves the domestic market has sf,mm,j,                     1   = 1 and sf,mn,j,       1   = 0 8 n 6= m.
   The first term in (11) captures the change in the firm's costs, and the second term the change in
the firm's demand following any external shock. Equation (11) highlights the sources of dierential
responses to shocks. On the cost side, following a shock in country k , only firms that import from
    M
k ­ f,km,ij 6= 0 ­ directly experience a change in input costs. At the same time, the change in
                                                                           1 
foreign demand ­ be it from the price-adjusted foreign expenditure Xmn,j /Pmn,j , or from a taste
(f,mn,j ) or trade cost shock ­ will to first order aect only firms that export to country n, and
even among those firms will vary with the sales share to that market.
   At the same time, this expression underscores the general-equilibrium channels that will operate
and thus should be accounted for. To the extent that the foreign shock changes domestic wages
(d ln wm ), all firms in m will be aected. Also, all firms sell domestically. Thus, if the foreign shock
                                              
                                          1 
aects domestic demand d ln Xmm,j /Pmm,j         , it will reach all firms in m. Finally, even the non-
importing firms' input prices d ln Pmm,i change through second-order input linkages and general
equilibrium eects.

                                                               15

      It is ultimately an empirical and quantitative question how much d ln Yf,m
                                                                                          F is indeed

heterogeneous in its comovement with foreign GDP. The reduced-form results are however silent
on the relative importance of the direct eects on the connected firms and the general equilibrium
eects on all firms in the economy. The quantitative analysis addresses this question.


GDP accounting in the model.                GDP is real value added. Following the national accounting
conventions, in the main text we report the results for real GDP obtained using the double-deflation
procedure.8 This definition of real GDP corresponds to the notion of the change in the physical
final output produced by the economy. The procedure for computing real GDP implicitly defines
the GDP deflator, which we take to be the measure of the aggregate price level change. The GDP
deflator is required to compute real value added changes for individual firms following a shock.
Thus, in implementing the decomposition (1), we deflate each firm's nominal value added growth
with the GDP deflator. This procedure ensures that aggregate real GDP is the sum of all firms'
real value added. Appendix B.1 presents the complete set of definitions and formulas underlying
the construction of the real GDP and the GDP deflator, which mimic national accounts procedures.
      As an alternative, we can deflate nominal GDP change by the CPI (Pm in Equation (6)). The
CPI-deflated GDP incorporates changes in prices of imported goods following a foreign shock.
This notion of real GDP corresponds to the change in the real purchasing power of a country's
final output from the perspective of the consumer. Thus, this concept of real GDP will increase
following a reduction in the prices of imports, even if the physical quantities of every good produced
by the economy were unchanged. Table A2 reports the main results for CPI-deflated real GDP.

4.2      Calibration

To perform counterfactuals that simulate the impact of foreign shocks on domestic firms and the
aggregate economy, we follow the approach of Dekle et al. (2008) and express the equilibrium
conditions in terms of gross changes in endogenous variables, to be solved for as a function of
shocks expressed in gross changes, and initial (pre-shock) observables. Appendix B.2 describes the
procedure in detail.
      Importantly, each actual firm in France is an object inside the model, and the solution is
implemented directly on the observed firm-level data for France.                  Doing so requires data on
firm-destination-specific sales shares f,nk,j , firm-source-specific sectoral input expenditure shares
M
f,mn,ji                                                 l
        , as well a firm-specific primary factor shares f,n,i . We only have this information for
France, and thus for the other countries the model collapses to the standard international trade
model with sector-level input-output linkages (see, e.g. the Handbook chapter by Costinot and
  8
      See also Kehoe and Ruhl (2008), Burstein and Cravino (2015), and Baqaee and Farhi (2019a,b,c).

Rodr´
    iguez-Clare, 2014). For the other countries we use WIOD to obtain sector-level counterparts
                                   M
of these shares. For French firms, f,mn,ji 's are available for imported inputs, but not domestic
ones. The domestic input-output linkages are inferred using firm-level data on overall input usage
and sector-level information on domestic IO linkages. See Section 3 and Appendix A for details on
the construction of all firm- and sector-specific shares.
    In addition to initial-period values taken from the data, solving the model requires a small
number of structural parameters. Table 2 summarizes the calibration. We set the elasticity of
substitution between firms in the same sector selling to the same destination to  = 3, a common
value according to standard methodologies (see e.g. Broda and Weinstein, 2006). We set the
Armington elasticity of substitution between goods coming from dierent source countries to         =
1.5. This is the value favored by the international business cycle literature following Backus et al.
(1995), and is supported by the recent estimates by Feenstra et al. (2018). We set the labor supply
parameter to    = 3, implying a Frisch labor supply elasticity of 0.5, as advocated by Chetty et al.
(2013). In the baseline, we set the production function elasticities  =   = 1 (Cobb-Douglas), as is
standard in the literature. In the robustness analysis we implement both higher and lower values
of each of these parameters.
   Our model does not feature endogenous deficits. In all our experiments, we thus assume that
                                b n = 0. We adopt a similar approach to profits: 
the change in deficits is zero: D                                                b n = 0. In the
absence of a model of multinational production and ownership of firms, in an open economy like
France changes in profits are not pinned down in our framework. This is because the aggregate
profits in Equation (8) refer to those used by French residents for domestic consumption spending.
These are not the same as profits of firms operating in France, both because French residents own
French multinationals operating abroad and thus have claims on those foreign-generated profits,
and because not all firms operating in France are domestically-owned, and the profits of foreign
multinational a liates operating in France are not available to French residents for consumption
spending. Since the profit share of GDP is under 10%, and for our counterfactuals what matters is
not the level of profit share but the change, as an approximation we abstract from the impact of
changes in profits on final consumption in our counterfactuals. Section 5.2 checks robustness to an
alternative specification of the profit change.


5     Quantitative Results
5.1   Micro: the Granular Origins of International Shock Transmission

We start by simulating the impact on the French economy of a 10% productivity improvement
in every foreign country in the sample. The left panel of Table 3 presents the results of the
decomposition (1). As discussed above, we report real GDP changes deflated by the GDP deflator.

French GDP increases by 2.7% following a 10% world productivity shock. This is a sizeable GDP
change considering that France itself does not experience the productivity shock, and thus the
entire eect is due to it being transmitted to France via goods trade linkages.
     Our central micro result concerns not so much the overall magnitude, but the role of hetero-
geneity. Decomposing the aggregate elasticity into the unweighted mean and the granular residual,
we find that the latter is positive as expected and quite large. The                     F   term is responsible for 85%
of the overall eect of a world shock. Thus, our results reveal a quantitatively large role of the
heterogeneity in firm-level international linkages in business cycle transmission across countries.
Table A2 presents the results when deflating by CPI. The change in GDP is larger at 6.3% fol-
lowing the world shock. It is not surprising that deflating by the CPI produces a larger real GDP
change, as the CPI includes reductions in the prices of imported goods. Since the movement in the
aggregate price level is larger for the CPI than the GDP deflator, and enters entirely in E F , the E F
term is also larger. Nonetheless, the granular residual is still responsible for 43% of the total GDP
change for the world shock.
     Next, we evaluate whether in the baseline model, the heterogeneity that drives the high covari-
ance term is within or across sectors. To that end, we take the results from the baseline model,
and instead of writing the decomposition (1) at the firm level, write it at the sector level:

                                                      d ln Y F = EJ

Notes: This table reports the change in French GDP, in percentage points, following a 10% productivity shock (left
panel) or a 10% foreign demand shock for French goods (right panel) in every other country in the world, in both the
baseline model and the alternative model that suppresses firm heterogeneity. The table reports the decomposition of
the the GDP change into the unweighted average and granular residual terms as in (1).




results are presented in the panel labeled "Sector-Level Decomposition" of Table 3. By construc-
tion, the overall GDP change d ln Y F is exactly the same as in the top panel of the table. The
sector-level granular residual term is 23% of the total, much smaller than the firm-level granular
residual, suggesting that the impact of heterogeneity is to a large extent not captured by the sec-
toral dimension. Note that standard multi-sector models of international shock transmission would
capture the sectoral granular residual. Thus, the sectoral granular residual is a natural benchmark
for our firm-level results.
    To illustrate the main results, Figure 2(a) plots the histogram of firm-level value added changes
in the baseline model for the world shock. The dispersion in firm-level growth rates is evident.
While most firm value added changes are positive, there is substantial density below zero as well ­

upward-sloping pattern. This is an illustration of the granularity in the data, and the mechanisms
                               F . Exporting in and of itself does not necessarily lead the firms to
behind the variation in d ln Yf,m
expand due to a foreign productivity improvement. Following a foreign productivity shock, there
are two reasons why firms can shrink: (i) non-importing firms lose domestic market share to the
importing firms, who enjoy the direct benefit of lower imported input prices; and (ii) firms lose
market share to foreign firms in both home and foreign markets when substitution eects due to
lower competitors' prices dominate positive income eects of higher productivity. Firms at the
bottom of the distribution of export intensity mostly suer from (i) but firms that export a lot
are more exposed to (ii). The only firms that really benefit from higher foreign productivity are
the input importers that enjoy a large enough direct cost reduction. These happen to be large
exporters on average.
   Next, we evaluate the propagation of a foreign demand shock to France. To that end, we
simulate an increase in the taste shock f,mn,j to all firms in m = France in all foreign markets
n 6= m. Examining Equation (7), it is clear that an increase in the taste for all French firms abroad
              1
amounts to a b 1 productivity increase for French exports abroad, and thus an increase in demand
                 mn,j
for French goods by foreign firms and consumers. (We assume that this is a purely external shock,
such that the French domestic demand shifter f,mm,j is unchanged.) We thus simulate a 10% shift
                                               1
                                         1
in demand for French goods, namely d ln mn,j = 0.1.
   The right panel of Table 3 reports the results. In the baseline, a 10% demand shock for French
goods abroad raises French real GDP by 0.35%. This is a smaller GDP change than following a
foreign productivity shock, but that is because the overall shock is much smaller, as it aects only
the French tradable sector. The granular residual accounts for 43% of the overall impact for the
foreign demand shock. When deflating by CPI, the foreign demand shock raises French GDP by
0.49%, with the contribution of the foreign granular residual of 31% (Table A2).
   The bottom panel reports the average-granular residual decomposition at the sector level for the
foreign demand shock. Not only is the covariance term not positive, it is actually strongly negative,
accounting for     70% of the overall eect for the world demand shock. Evidently, sectors with the
highest positive elasticities with respect to foreign demand shocks tend to actually be relatively
smaller in size. This is sensible, as some of the largest sectors in our data are non-tradable, and
thus by construction not experiencing the positive foreign demand shock.


                                                   21
   Finally, we run the heuristic regression (5) inside the model. The results are reported in Ta-
ble 1, columns 5 (for the world productivity shock) and 6 (world demand shock). Since the model
simulation is of a single year's growth rate, there are fewer firms in this regression, and sector-time
fixed eects become sector fixed eects. The model reproduces the pattern in the data qualita-
tively. Larger firms are more sensitive to both the world productivity and world demand shocks.
Interestingly, the coe cient of interest is much smaller than in the data in the productivity shock
simulation, but much larger than in the data in the demand shock simulation. Given that actual
world GDP is a mix of productivity and demand shocks, we should not expect a single shock inside
the model to replicate the data coe cient. The fact that the data coe cient is between those for
productivity and demand shocks is perhaps telling that foreign shocks experienced by France are a
mixture of the two.

5.1.1   Responses to Country-Specific Shocks

We can also subject our model to shocks in each foreign country separately, and perform the
decomposition (1) of the French GDP change in response to country-specific shocks. Figure 3
displays the results for 10% productivity shocks. On the x-axis of both panels is the change in GDP.
Not surprisingly, French GDP responds by dierent magnitudes to shocks in dierent countries,
with the size of the response conditioned by country size and level of trade integration with France.
The largest by a wide margin is the GDP response to a shock in Germany (DEU), which produces a
0.4% change in French GDP. Smaller and more distant countries produce negligible GDP changes.
   The second notable feature of the figure is that virtually all the variation in the overall GDP
response is accounted for by the variation in the foreign granular residual (left panel). The obser-
vations are near the 45-degree line. In a few instances, including Germany, the foreign granular
residual is actually slightly more than 100% of the total GDP response, implying that the un-
weighted average change across firms is negative. The right panel is the scatterplot of d ln Y F
against the unweighted change E F . This term is on average close to zero, and does not correlate
well with the overall GDP change. Thus, dierences in GDP responses to shocks in dierent foreign
countries are accounted for by the granular residual rather than the unweighted average change.

5.1.2   Simulating Actual Foreign GDP Growth

The above results explore the propagation into France of hypothetical shocks. To provide a closer
comparison to actual GDP data, in this section we subject the French economy to actual foreign
GDP growth rates. Because France trades with many partner countries, to compute the French
economy's responses to worldwide economic conditions requires simulating shocks to multiple coun-
tries at once. We do this in two ways. First, we feed the TFP shocks to foreign countries from the
Penn World Tables into the model. In the second approach, we obtain actual GDP growth for all

the countries in our sample from the World Development Indicators. To compute the propagation
of foreign GDP growth rates into France, we re-express the model directly in terms of elasticities of
French firms to foreign GDP. The advantage of the latter approach is that it in principle accounts
for all of GDP movements abroad, not just the movements in measured TFP. The disadvantage is
that it implicitly attributes all of the foreign GDP changes to TFP, which may not be accurate.
Appendix B.3 details the two procedures.
       Table 4 reports the results for two time periods: 1975­2014, and 1991­2007. There are two
reasons to focus on the shorter time period. The first is that for this time period we can report
the standard deviation of the overall French granular residual ( ), sourced from our earlier work
(di Giovanni et al., 2014).9 Second, our model is implemented on the trade and production data
from this period, and it is not clear that the cross-border trade linkages we assume are realistic
prior to the 1990s. The first two columns report the standard deviations of actual French GDP

growth and the granular residual. The middle panel reports the standard deviations d ln Ym
and      F        generated purely by foreign TFP shocks. Foreign shocks by themselves can generate about
10% of the observed GDP fluctuations of France. More importantly for us, the standard deviation
of the foreign granular residual                                            F   is 91 to 94% of the overall standard deviation of the foreign

component E F is 16 to 21% of the total standard deviation. Thus, foreign shocks are indeed
predominantly granular fluctuations. The right-most panel reports the results of feeding in GDP
growth. The relative contribution of the foreign granular residual to the overall foreign impact is
similarly close to 90%.
    Using dierent approaches, Gabaix (2011), di Giovanni et al. (2014), and Carvalho and Grassi
(2019) document that a significant fraction of GDP fluctuations is driven by idiosyncratic shocks to
individual firms. The contribution of firm idiosyncratic shocks to aggregate fluctuations is captured
by the granular residual. Beyond accounting for aggregate fluctuations, the granular residual is an
object of interest in other contexts; see for instance its use as an instrument (Gabaix and Koijen,
2019). Because of the systematically heterogeneous cross-border linkages across firms, foreign
shocks are a quantitatively important contributor to the granular residual, and are thus one of the
sources of granular fluctuations.

5.2    Macro: the Dampening Eect of Firm Heterogeneity

We compare the baseline model to an alternative implementation that suppresses all within-sector
firm heterogeneity: domestic and foreign sales shares (the f,nk,j 's) and intermediate import usage
 M
(f,mn,ji ) are made identical across firms in each sector. To preserve comparability to the baseline,
this model still has firms, that are homogeneous in their importing and exporting intensities. The
M
f,mn,ji 's are set to match the sector-level imported input coe cients, and the export shares f,nk,j
are set to match aggregate export shares in each sector. Importantly, this exercise preserves the
overall levels of imports and exports, by sector, so this alternative model features the exact same
level of trade openness as the baseline. This implies that the imported input coe cients in this


                                                        24
implementation are lowered for the firms that in the data actually import inputs, but raised for
firms that in the data do not. Similarly, firms that in the data export nothing in this scenario
export to all countries. This model can be implemented using only the WIOD sectoral production
and trade data, and does not require any firm-level information.
   Table 3 reports the results in the row labeled "Homogeneous firms." The main macro finding
is that the aggregate GDP change following the world productivity shock is about 20% larger
in the homogeneous firm model than in the baseline. The dampening eect also appears for the
foreign demand shock, though here the disparity is smaller at 6%. In all cases, the average-granular
decomposition shows that the entirety of the GDP change is now accounted for by the unweighted
average value added change E F , with zero contribution of the granular residual. Not surprisingly,
the representative firm model is very dierent at the micro level.
   This dampening eect is not unique to our preferred calibration. Table A3 presents the com-
parison of GDP changes in the baseline and homogeneous models following the world productivity
and demand shocks, while raising and lowering each key elasticity in the model. The finding that
GDP changes are larger in the homogeneous model obtains for every alternative parameter value
considered in the table. The proportional dierences in GDP changes between the homogeneous
and baseline models are also similar to the main calibration, which does not stand out in terms of
the relative magnitude of the dampening eect.
   Next, Table A3 reports the results under flexible markups as in Atkeson and Burstein (2008).
In this environment, firms take into account the impact of their own pricing decisions on the
sectoral price index, and thus markups are heterogeneous across firms, with larger firms having
higher markups. Flexible markups attenuate somewhat the dierence between the homogeneous
and heterogeneous models, as expected, but substantial dampening eect still remains. Finally, we
examine what happens when changes in aggregate profits n contribute to final demand. As we
do not have firm ground to stand on when evaluating aggregate profit changes, in the baseline we
assume that aggregate profits do not change following the foreign shock. In this robustness check,
we instead assume that the total profits of firms operating in France equal to the variable profits,
which in turn are a constant fraction of aggregate sales. Note that this approach gives profits the
highest chance to make a dierence, by assuming that variable profits are total profits, that is, there
are no fixed costs. The last line of Table A3 reports the results, and shows that the dampening
eect of heterogeneity persists.

5.2.1   Understanding the Mechanisms

The baseline model diers from the homogeneous firm model in two respects: (i) heterogeneous
sales across firms by destination, and (ii) heterogeneous production functions across firms within a
sector, reflected in firm-specific labor and input shares. We investigate the consequences of these


                                                 25
two sources of heterogeneity in turn. First, we prove analytically that if production functions are
identical across firms within a sector, the real GDP change due to a foreign shock is invariant to the
distribution of market shares across firms. This theoretical result provides a sharp characterization
of where the dampening eect comes from: a necessary condition for dampening is heterogeneity in
the production functions. Though we do not have an analytical result on how production function
heterogeneity aects the size of the GDP response to foreign shocks, we next provide a heuristic
illustration for how this dimension of heterogeneity generates dampening.


Exporting/sales heterogeneity.

Proposition 1 If               =                                                          F following a
                                           and f,n,j = n,j 8f , the real GDP change d ln Ym
                     f,mn,ij       mn,ij

foreign productivity shock or a non-firm-specific foreign demand shock is invariant to the distribution
of firm-level destination-specific sales shares f,nk,j .

Proof: See Appendix B.4.
   The proof proceeds to show that as long as within-sector production functions are identical
across firms, the sector-destination-level equations that must be satisfied in equilibrium do not
have sales shares f,nk,j in them, and therefore the macro aggregates are independent of either
initial or post-shock f,nk,j 's. The proof covers all distributions of f,nk,j 's, including zero market
shares. This implies that any extensive margin dierences across model implementations, whereby
firms do or do not serve all or some markets have no eect on GDP changes due to foreign shocks
if these firms have the same production functions.
   The proposition applies in our quantitative framework, which is general in some respects ­
such as unrestricted distributions of f,nk,j and foreign input usage by source country and sector ­
but relies on some key assumptions, notably constant markups. If larger firms had systematically
dierent markups, as in Atkeson and Burstein (2008) for instance, then the GDP change would
not be invariant to the size distribution within a sector even if all firms had identical production
functions. Nonetheless, the constant markup case is an important benchmark, and Proposition 1
clarifies the conditions under which dierent types of firm heterogeneity matter. In robustness
exercises above we showed that variable markups a la Atkeson and Burstein (2008) do not overturn
the macro dampening result.


Importing/production function heterogeneity.                 Having established that sales heterogeneity
will not deliver dierent GDP responses to foreign shocks absent production function heterogeneity,
we now investigate how production function heterogeneity can lead to dampening.
   The intuition is as follows. Raising a firm's imported input share lowers its impact on domestic
GDP. This is because mechanically, a higher imported input share means lower demand for domestic


                                                      26
value added by the firm. At the same time, raising a firm's imported input share increases its
exposure to foreign shocks. Thus, relative to a representative firm world, introducing heterogeneity
in imported input shares leads to a negative covariance in the cross section of firms between impact
on domestic GDP and exposure to foreign shocks. This negative covariance is the source of the
dampening eect of production function heterogeneity.
       To make this more precise, we introduce the following notation. Define firm f 's influence as the
elasticity of GDP with respect to a productivity shock in that firm: f  d ln Ym
                                                                         d ln af (Acemoglu et al.,
                             P      P M
2012).10 Recall that f,IM
                      M     n6=m i f,mn,ji      denotes the combined imported input share of firm
f . Below, we will show by means of numerical illustrations that holding firm size fixed, influence
             M
decreases in f,IM : @             M
                              f /@f,IM   < 0. That is, all else equal a firm that has a higher import share
has a lower influence on domestic GDP. This is intuitive since a higher import share means a lower
share of domestic value added in production.
       At the same time, a firm with a higher import share also experiences a de facto bigger shock
following a foreign productivity improvement. Heuristically, dierences across firms in value added
growth following a foreign shock come from dierential reductions in input prices:
                                                    XX
                                                                               l           M
                       d ln Yf,m,j / (1         )                    (1        f,m,j,   1 )f,km,ij, 1 d ln Pkm,i ,            (13)

since, modulo dierences in labor shares, the other terms that enter value added growth ­ such
as market-specific demand changes ­ are common to all firms. Firms with larger import shares

productivity shock to firm f that would produce a marginal cost reduction equal to the fall in input

                                                                                 1 )f,km,ij, 1 d ln Pkm,i .                   (14)
                                            i       k

The hypothetical productivity shock is increasing in the firm's import share: @ d ln a    M
                                                                                     ~f /@f,IM > 0.
       Now compare a homogeneous to a heterogeneous firm model. In the homogeneous firm model,
there is no variation across firms (within a sector) in either                                 f   or d ln e
                                                                                                           af . By contrast, in the
heterogeneous firm model, there is a negative relationship across firms between d ln e
                                                                                     af and                                      f

the negative relationship between influence and exposure to the shock drives down the response of
GDP to foreign shocks in the heterogeneous model.
   Since this mechanism has not to our knowledge been previously pointed out, we start by illus-
trating it via the simplest possible example: a model with 2 countries (France and the Rest of the
World), 2 sectors (Tradables and Non-Tradables), and 2 firms in each sector. To isolate the impact
of heterogeneity in imported input intensity, we assume that within each sector these firms have
the same sales to all markets, and are thus the same size. We start with the homogeneous firm
model, in which both firms in each sector have the exact same imported input coe cients. These
input coe cients are reported in the top panel of Table 5. In the homogeneous firm model, 24%
of a Tradable sector firm's total costs (intermediates plus primary factors) are spent on foreign
inputs, with the remaining 76% on domestic intermediates and labor. In the Non-Tradable sector,
8% of total costs go to pay for foreign inputs. These values correspond to the WIOD data when
collapsed to 2 sectors and 2 countries, France and ROW.
   We then progressively reassign foreign inputs to Firm 1 in each sector, so that in the final
simulation, in the Tradable sector 47% of Firm 1's costs are spent on foreign inputs (bottom of
Table 5). As we do this, we keep the sector-level share of spending on imported inputs constant in
the Tradable sector at 24%. Thus, Firm 2's share of imported inputs is now 1% (recall that these
firms have the same sales). The same reassignment of import shares occurs in the Non-Tradable
sector. While we kept this economy's overall trade openness constant, we made import participation
heterogeneous.
   Even in this simple example, we obtain the same result as in the full quantitative model that
the GDP change is larger in the homogeneous case than in the heterogeneous one. Figure 4 plots
Tradable sector Firm 1's d ln e
                              af and   f   as a function of its imported input intensity on the x-axis.
As argued above, increasing a firm's input intensity lowers its domestic influence (solid line), while
at the same time increasing the size of the shock that it experiences (dashed line).
   While in the 2  2  2 example we could keep the size of all firms the same, in the quantitative
model firms also dier dramatically in size. That creates an extra eect: making foreign input
shares identical across firms raises the influence      f   of the larger firms, and lowers it for smaller
firms. This is because in the data larger firms import relatively more, and homogenizing production
functions means reducing their foreign input shares. This in turn raises their                f.   The opposite
occurs with smaller firms: making foreign input shares identical tends to raise their foreign input
shares, and hence lower their   f.

   To illustrate this, we consider an alternative homogeneous counterfactual model, in which pro-
duction functions are identical across firms, but firm sizes (governed by f,mn,j 's) are still given by
the data. By Proposition 1, when production functions are identical across firms, the GDP change

following a foreign shock is invariant to the distribution of f,mn,j , and hence the distribution of
firm size. Thus, the GDP change in this intermediate model is identical to the GDP change in
the "Homogeneous firms" model reported in Table 3. At the same time, because the firm sales
distribution in this counterfactual model coincides with the fully heterogeneous firm baseline, each
firm's Domar weight is also exactly the same in this counterfactual and the baseline. Firm-specific
production functions are the only dierence between the two scenarios.
     Figure 5 plots the mean ratio of       f   in the homogeneous relative to the heterogeneous model
(   HOM / HET )   across firm size deciles. In the top size decile, this ratio is above 1: the domestic GDP

influence of the largest firms is higher in the homogeneous production function model compared
to the baseline. The relationship is monotonic across the size distribution, so that progressively
smaller firms experience a greater reduction in their influence when production functions are made
identical.

gross sales to aggregate value added (Hulten, 1978; Acemoglu et al., 2012; Baqaee and Farhi, 2019a).

Baqaee and Farhi (2019c) extend this result to the open economy setting, and show that under
the same assumptions ­ fixed factor supply and perfect competition ­ the result that            f   equals the
Domar weight continues to hold. This property is remarkable in that a sector/firm's import and
export intensity are irrelevant for its influence on domestic GDP. Shocks to two producers (firms or
sectors) with identical total sales have identical GDP impact even if one uses mostly foreign inputs,
while the other uses only domestic ones, for example.
       This invariance result does not hold in our framework. In the illustrative 2  2  2 model, we
keep total firm sales unchanged as input coe cients vary. Thus the Domar weights, reported in
Table 5, are constant for each firm by construction. However, Figure 4 shows that the influence
 f     changes with the firm's import intensity. Figure 5 further underscores the departure of our
model from the classic benchmark where             f   equals the Domar weight. Because all the Domar
weights are exactly the same in the two scenarios, the ratio of Domar weights is simply constant at
1 by construction, and depicted by the horizontal line in Figure 5. However, changing production
functions aects the true influence of firms, systematically along the size distribution.
       Conceptually, the two reasons that     f   is not equal to the Domar weight are endogenous factor
supply and profits. Huo et al. (2020) derive the influence vector in a multi-country input network
model with variable factor supply. When factor supply is fixed, they recover the Baqaee and Farhi
(2019c) result that a sector's influence is its Domar weight. However, under variable factor supply,
a sector's influence is no longer its Domar weight, but rather a function of the entire global input-
output matrix. Thus, changes in that matrix ­ say, as we shue firms' import intensities ­ will
generically aect each firm's influence.11
       The presence of profits implies that the real GDP change cannot be written as a sum of Domar-
weighted changes in true TFP and primary factors. Instead, because profits are a fraction of gross
sales, total intermediate input usage enters measured GDP. Thus, heterogeneity in foreign input
usage will generally induce heterogeneity in a firm's influence on GDP. A firm that imports foreign
inputs demands less from other domestic firms, and thus a positive shock to it generates less profits
for other firms in the home country. Hence, holding sales constant, increasing a firm's input share
lowers its influence. This eect bears some relation to Arkolakis and Ramanarayanan (2009) and
Liao and Santacreu (2015), who show greater transmission of foreign shocks to domestic GDP in
the presence of profits. We experimented with alternative values of parameters that govern the
elasticity of labor supply and the size of profits in the economy. Qualitatively and quantitatively,
either endogenous labor supply or profits alone are enough to generate the eect illustrated Figure 4
that     f   falls in the imported input share.
  11
   We stress that this departure from Hulten (1978)-Baqaee and Farhi (2019c) is not due to second-order terms.
Endogenous factor supply generates first-order departures from Hulten (1978), as shown by Huo et al. (2020).

6       Conclusion

Large firms are more likely to import and export. A natural conjecture is that this greater par-
ticipation in international markets also makes the large firms more sensitive to foreign shocks. In
this paper, we explored both the micro and the macro implications of this joint heterogeneity in
size and international linkages. We first provided firm-level econometric evidence that larger firms
are indeed more correlated with foreign GDP growth. We then implemented a quantitative multi-
country model in which French firms exhibit the observed joint distribution of size, importing, and
exporting.
    We reported one micro and one macro finding. The micro finding is that foreign shocks man-
ifest themselves as largely granular fluctuations in France. Large firms are thus the key channel
through which foreign shocks propagate to the domestic economy. The macro finding is that the
heterogeneity in trade participation actually dampens the impact of a given foreign shock on French
GDP. This is because heterogeneity in importing behavior induces a negative covariance between
the size of the shock experienced by the firm and its contribution to domestic GDP, controlling for
size.

A.1       Harmonizing French Firm-Level Data with Global Sectoral Data

The firm's sector in the French data is reported in the Nomenclature d'Activit´
                                                                              es Fran¸
                                                                                     caises classifi-
cation, which we convert into the 35 sectors of the WIOD nomenclature. Note that the balance-sheet
data do not cover Financial Activities and Private Households with Employed Persons (sectors J
and P in WIOD), and thus those sectors are dropped from the analysis. We also dropped the
"Public Administration" sector (sector L) which represents 23 firms and less than 0.1% of overall
value added in our data.
       Data on individual bilateral imports, together with information on each firm's cost structure,
                                                                               l
are used to recover the firm-specific input shares. Firm-specific labor shares f,n,j are defined as
the ratio of value added over sales, both available in the balance-sheet data. In order to ensure
comparability with the rest of the sample, in which labor shares are calibrated using WIOD for
each country and sector, the distribution of firm-level labor shares is rescaled sector-by-sector in a
way that preserves the heterogeneity but ensures that the weighted average across firms matches
the corresponding information in the WIOD. Namely:
                                                                 l
                                                                 n,j
                                                l       l
                                                f,n,j =~f,n,j     l
                                                                        .
                                                                 ~n,j
                  l
In this equation, f,n,j and  l
                            ~f,n,j are the rescaled and original firm-level coe cients, respectively,
    l
and n,j is the sectoral counterpart recovered from the WIOD data. Finally,  l
                                                                           ~n,j is a weighted
average of the original firm-level coe cients, where each firm is weighted according to its share

       Figure A1 displays the cumulative distribution of labor shares, distinguishing between tradable
and non-tradable sectors. The solid (red) line correspond to the unweighted distributions and the
(blue) circles to the weighted ones. These distributions show a high degree of heterogeneity across
firms, both within and across broad sectors. In traded good sectors, large firms tend to be less labor
intensive, although the pattern is not systematic in all individual sectors and is not very strong.
On the contrary, large firms in non-traded good sectors are often more labor-intensive than smaller
ones.13
  12
      The rescaling procedure implies that some rescaled firm-level coe cients end up lying outside of the range of
possible values ([0, 1]). The corresponding coe cients are winsorized at the maximum and minimum values. This
aects less than 0.02% of the firms in the total sample. The rescaling procedure is applied to all sectors but three,
namely Wholesale; Retail, including Motor Vehicles; and Fuel. For these three sectors, the average labor share is
low in the French data compared to the WIOD. This comes from the treatment of merchandise, which we categorize
as intermediates while WIOD does not. Our approach is consistent with the model in the case of France, where we
assume that consumers never interact directly with foreign firms. From that point of view, all merchandise imported
from abroad is used as inputs by a French firm which ultimately sells to the final consumer. Because this is all
                                                                                                                    l
the more important for retailing and wholesaling activities, we decided to keep the distribution of measured f,n,j
unchanged in these sectors.

      In tradable sectors, the correlation between the firm's labor share and its size varies between 0 and -0.09 (Wood

Notes: This figure plots the cumulative distributions of firm-level labor shares (f,n,j     ), in tradable and in non-
tradable sectors. The solid (red) lines correspond to the unweighted distribution and the (blue) circles to the weighted
distribution, where firms' weights are defined according to their share in aggregate value added. Calculated from
French balance-sheet data together with the WIOD information on sectoral labor shares, for 2005.



    Total input usage at the firm level equals one minus the labor share (in our setting "labor"
stands for the composite of primary factors). We further disaggregate total input usage across
sectors and source countries using the information on imports, by product. This allows us to
            M
recover the f,mn,ij coe cients for n = F rance. While in principle straightforward, calibrating
these parameters entails two key di culties: i) it requires the use of two sources of firm-level data,
which raises concerns regarding comparability; and ii) not all of these coe cients can be recovered
from the firm-level data. In particular, we do not have detailed information on inputs purchased
domestically and thus need to infer their sectoral breakdown using (more aggregated) information
from WIOD. We proceed as follows.
    For each sector i among the subset of tradable sectors and each source country m 6= n, we first
compute the share of bilateral imports of goods produced by country m, sector i in the firm's total
input expenses.14 Since this ratio uses data collected from two databases, the overall import share
                                     M
obtained from the summation of these f,mn,ij coe cients over all tradable sectors and foreign

products) and is often significant. In non-tradable sectors, it is positive and significant in 10 sectors out of 18 and is
as high as 0.13 for Post and Telecommunication Services.
  14
     This requires the conversion of product-level import data expressed in the highly disaggregated Harmonized
System into broader sectoral categories. Since the customs data do not allow us to distinguish between the import
of intermediates and merchandise (goods that are not further processed before being sold by the firm), we measure
the firm's input expenses accordingly as the sum of raw materials and merchandise purchases (taking into account
changes in inventories). See Blaum et al. (2018) for a similar treatment of the data.



                                                               38
countries is larger than one in some cases (for less than 1% of firms). Whenever this happens, the
import share is winsorized to one and the bilateral sectoral coe cients rescaled accordingly.
       Beyond comparability issues between the two firm-level sources, the introduction of these firm-
level import shares into the broader multi-country model also means we must ensure consistency
with the sectoral coe cients in the global data. As we did with the labor shares, this implies
rescaling the overall distribution of firm-level coe cients to the mean observed in the WIOD data:
                                                                  M

sectoral input purchases:   ~mn,ij = f 2(n,j ) !f,n,j f,mn,ij . The normalization preserves as much
heterogeneity across firms as possible, while avoiding overestimating the international transmission
of shocks through foreign input purchases via an exaggeration of the degree to which French firms
actually rely on foreign inputs. From that point of view, our calibration is conservative.
       By definition, the remaining input purchases, those not sourced abroad, include tradable goods
purchased in France and all expenses on non-tradable inputs. While we do not have any information
on how these domestic expenses are spread across sectors, we can recover the firm-level share of

individual input purchases as i f,nn,ij =1     m6=n   i2T f,mn,ij . This domestic input share is
then assigned to domestic input sectors using information in the WIOD:15

                                                   i nn,ij i

       We have tested an alternative calibration strategy in which the input coe cients for non-traded
sectors are all set exactly to their values in the WIOD. The remaining (homogeneous) share in
input purchases is then spread across tradable sectors and countries using the bilateral import
shares available at the firm level. The residual which corresponds to tradable inputs purchased
domestically is spread across sectors using the WIOD coe cients. Note that this strategy tends
to underestimate the share of tradable goods that are purchased domestically, i.e., it overestimates
the participation of French firms to foreign input markets. For this reason, we have chosen to use
the more conservative strategy described above as our benchmark.
  15
     Our definition of non-tradable (NT) sectors is somewhat unconventional since we de facto exclude from the
tradable sector all services that are potentially traded but that we do not observe in the customs data. As a
                                                                                                         M
consequence, some of our NT sectors might display strictly positive foreign input shares in WIOD, i.e. mn,ij   6= 0 for
j 2 N T . We adjust the WIOD data to make them consistent with our definition
                                                                         P       of non-tradable sectors by allocating

all purchases from a NT sector to the same French sector, i.e.: nn,ij  = m mn,ij      and mn,ij    = 0, 8i 2 N T . We
apply the same adjustment to the other countries in the sample, to ensure comparability.

B.1         The GDP Deflator Construction in the Model

This Appendix describes how we replicate the procedures used by the system of national accounts
to compute changes in real GDP and the GDP deflator. The GDP deflator is an implicit deflator
that is defined as the ratio of nominal and real GDP changes. In turn, the real GDP is computed
using the "double deflation" method that records output net of inputs when both are evaluated at
base prices. Specifically, define real GDP, evaluated at base prices (prices at                              1) by:

a survey that catches the minority of firms, and thus implementing (B.2) amounts to using more
data than the statistical agencies do.

   To construct the input price deflator P m,j
We mimic this procedure by computing the input-share weighted change in input prices, where we
use the PPI for the domestic inputs, and the foreign sectoral price changes for foreign inputs.
The important thing is that we carry this out at the sector level, without using any firm-level
information:

   Now we have all the ingredients to compute the real GDP change (B.1). Since the GDP deflator
is defined implicitly as the ratio between the nominal and real GDP change, we need to compute
the nominal GDP change. The nominal GDP change is a weighted sum of all firms' nominal value
added changes. In particular, in our framework nominal value added associated with firm f 's sales
to market n is a constant fraction of its sales there:

conditions in terms of gross changes x                          1   in endogenous variables, to be solved for as a
function of shocks expressed in gross changes, and the pre-shock (" 1") observables. Starting with
(8), we write it as a function of observed expenditure shares:

on which firms use imported intermediates. Since we do not have firm-level information on other
countries, we assume that in those countries there is a representative firm in each sector. Writing

B.2.1        Model Solution and Calibration

The model implementation involves solving equations (B.5)-(B.15). In particular, we solve for the
following equilibrium variables:

                             bmn,j 8m, n, j ;
  1. Changes in trade values X

                      bn 8n;
  2. Changes in wages w

                                  bn 8n, P
  3. Changes in the price indices P      bn,j 8n, j , P
                                                      bmn,j 8m, n, j ;

                             c
  4. Post-shock trade shares mn,j                                 l
                                  8m, n, j , f,nk,j 8k, n, j, f , f,n,j            M
                                                                        8n, j, f , f,mn,ij 8n, m, i, j, f .

We further require several pre-shock data series, either at the firm or sector level. Specifically, we
require information on:

  1. Gross sales Xmn,j,             1   8m, n, j ;

                                                             c
  2. Final consumption shares within a sector across sources mn,j,                                    8m, n, j ;
                                                                                                  1

  3. Firm-level within sector, within-destination trade shares f,nk,j,                                1   8k, n, j, f ;

  5. Shares of labor (factor) income, pure profits, and deficits in final consumption spending sL
                                                                                                n,                                         1,
     sn, 1     and   sD
                      n, 1   8 n;

                          l
  6. Initial input shares f,n,j,                             M
                                                  8n, j, f , f,mn,ij,          8m, n, i, j, f .

The construction of these variables and the relevant data sources are described in Appendix A.
The solution of the model further requires setting a small number of parameter values. These are
summarized in Table 2.

B.2.2        Satisfying Market Clearing

In order to proceed correctly with the hat algebra in each sector/country pair, in the pre-period
the market clearing condition in levels must be satisfied:
                                         X 1X                                                                      X
             c       c                                     l                                    M
Xmn,j, 1 = mn,j,  1 n,j, 1 Pn, 1 Cn, 1 +               (1 f,n,i,                             1 )f,mn,ji, 1             f,nk,i,   1 Xnk,i, 1 .
                                              
                                                             i          f 2i                                       k
                                                                                                                                     (B.16)
In the data, this is unlikely to be the case. We therefore adopt the following approach: in each
mn, j , trivially we can find a wedge mn,j,                      1   such that conditional on all the other data, (B.16)
does hold with equality:
                                                        X            1X                                        X
               c         c                                                       l           M
Xmn,j,   1   = mn,j,   1 n,j,       1 Pn,   1 Cn, 1 +                         (1 f,n,i,   1 )f,mn,ji,      1       f,nk,i,   1 Xnk,i, 1 +mn,j, 1 .
                                                                 
                                                         i             f 2i                                    k


                                                                      44
Then applying the hat algebra to this equation:
                               "   1                                      #

                        X 1X                            X                                         (B.17)
                      +                    l
                                     (1 f,n,i     M
                                               )f,mn,ji           bnk,i Xnk,i, 1

                             i       f 2i                         k

                       +bmn,j mn,j,    1.

   Next, we solve the entire model while feeding in a "shock" that eliminates this wedge, namely:
bmn,j = 0. Finding the model solution will give the a set of X
                                                             bmn,j 's that are required to arrive at
a set of levels of Xmn,j for which the market clearing condition is satisfied with equality for every
mn, j . Then use these Xmn,j as the starting (pre-shock) values for all the real counterfactuals we
run. The antecedent of this approach is Costinot and Rodr´
                                                         iguez-Clare (2014), who use a similar
device to eliminate the trade deficits.

B.3    Simulating Actual Foreign GDP Growth

In any year in the data, there will be a vector of country-specific productivity shocks. Let f,n 
d ln YfF /d ln an denote the elasticity of value added of firm f to a productivity shock in country n (we
drop the m subscript from d ln YfF , as it is understood that firm f is always in France). We obtain
these elasticities for every firm in France and every partner country by simulating country-specific
aggregate productivity shocks d ln an in the baseline model, and recording each firm's responses to
it. Firm f 's real value added growth rate following a vector of foreign shocks is
                                                     X
                                        d ln YfF =        f,n d ln an .                           (B.18)
                                                     n

Then the change in French GDP due to a worldwide vector of foreign shocks is simply:
                                                X
                                          F                            F
                                    d ln Ym =        !f,m,    1 d ln Yf .                         (B.19)
                                                 f

We implement (B.18)-(B.19) in two ways. The first approach feeds the aggregate TFP shocks
from the Penn World Tables directly into (B.18) to compute each firm's response to those foreign
TFP shocks. The second approach uses actual GDP growth rates. To compute the propagation of
foreign GDP growth rates into France, we re-express (B.18) directly in terms of elasticities of French
firms to foreign GDP. Specifically, instead of (B.18) we assume that firm growth rate following a
country-specific shock is:
                                                     X
                                        d ln YfF =        e
                                                          f,n d ln Yn ,                           (B.20)
                                                     n

      f,n  d ln YfF /d ln Yn is the elasticity of firm f 's value added growth to country n's GDP,
where e
rather than the TFP shock directly. The e
                                        f,n 's can be computed by simulating a country-specific

                                                     45
shock and tracking the response of both firm f and the foreign country's GDP. Equation (B.20)
is then combined with (B.19) to compute French GDP growth. Once we simulate the firm and
aggregate growth rates due to actual changes in foreign TFP and GDP for a sample of years, we
can compute the average-granular residual decomposition (1).
   Note that implementing (B.18)-(B.19)-(B.20) amounts to the first-order approach, where firm
and aggregate responses are linear functions of the vector of foreign shocks. Huo et al. (2020)
analyze the properties of the linear solution in a similar environment, and show that the first-order
solution is very close to the exact one.

B.4      Proof of Proposition 1
                                                                              l
Since all firms have the same production function, their initial labor shares n,i,                                                    and input shares
                                                                                                                                  1

         1
        b M
change: Pf,m,j = PbM 8f (see (B.13)). Then, it is immediate from (B.14) and (B.15) that the

                                  l
post-shock labor and input shares n,i     M
                                      and mn,ji are also identical within a sector. The market
clearing condition (B.5) becomes:

since taste and productivity shocks are not firm-specific, and the denominator sums to 1. Thus,
sales shares are unchanged following a foreign shock: f,nk,j = f,nk,j,                                          1   8f, k , or bf,nk,j = 1 8f, k .
   When labor shares        l
                            n,i,         do not dier across firms, the labor market condition (B.6) also does
                                 1
not require firm-level shares, and simplifies to:

                                                                               Xnk,j        bn
                                                                                            w         P              = 0,

which once again is independent of f,nk,j 's or f,nk,j,                            1 's.


                                                                       46
   Finally, the price equation also has no f,nk,j or f,nk,j,   1   terms if taste and productivity shocks
are not firm-specific:

                                                                  m,j

   These equations define the equilibrium in changes, and thus X            bmn,j 's can be found
without knowing the firm-level market shares f,nk,j 's or f,nk,j,        1 's.

   Since markups are constant, all the firm-specific prices change by the same proportional amount:
          bmn,j 8f . Because 
bf,mn,j = p
p                            bf,mn,j = 1 8f, n, all nominal sales changes are the same across firms
within a sector: X bf,mn,j = Xbmn,j . Therefore, none of the steps in constructing real GDP in
Appendix B.1 require firm-level sales shares.
