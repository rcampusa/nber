International Innovation and Diffusion of Air Pollution Control Technologies: The Effects of
NOX and SO2 Regulation in the U.S., Japan, and Germany

Using patent data from the United States, Japan, and Germany, this paper examines both the

innovation and diffusion of air pollution control equipment. Whereas the United States was an early

adopter of stringent sulfur dioxide (SO2) standards, both Japan and Germany introduced stringent

nitrogen dioxide (NOX) standards much earlier than the US. Nonetheless, in both cases, tightened

standards in the U.S. led to more domestic patenting, but not more foreign patenting. Overall, the

data suggest that inventors respond to environmental regulatory pressure in their own country, but

not to foreign environmental regulations. Moreover, any technology transfer that occurs appears to

be indirect. Domestic innovation occurs even for technologies that have already experienced

significant innovative activity abroad. Moreover, utilities in countries that adopt regulations later

nonetheless purchase pollution abatement equipment from domestic firms. However, patent citation

data from the U.S. show that earlier foreign patents are an important building block for NOX

pollution control innovations in the U.S., suggesting that American inventors build on technological

advances made in countries that adopted stringent regulation earlier.

       Technological change has the potential to play a key role in limiting the effects of long-

term environmental problems such as climate change. As such, environmental economists have

increasingly paid attention to the links between environmental policy and technology. These

links traditionally come in one of two ways. First, environmental policy may induce new

innovations by increasing the potential value of producing environmentally-friendly technology.

Second, environmental policy may encourage the diffusion of existing environmentally-friendly

technologies. However, few studies of technological change, either in the environmental or

broader economics literature, link both aspects of technological change. This paper is the first

part of a broader research study designed to fill that gap by looking at international technology

transfer of pollution control technologies.

       This paper uses patent data to investigate flows of air pollution control technology

between the United States, Japan, and Germany. In particular, I examine flows of technologies

designed to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOX) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions by electric utilities.

Most previous empirical studies of innovation and adoption of environmental technologies have

focused on a single country, and the majority focus on US data. In general, this is appropriate, as

the US traditionally has been among the first countries to enact strong environmental regulation

and has also been among the first to develop relevant pollution control technologies. However,

this is not true in the case of NOX. Other nations, particularly Japan and Germany, adopted

stringent NOX regulations earlier than the US. As a result, these nations also developed NOX

pollution control equipment faster than the US. A study of the innovation and diffusion of NOX

technologies in the US thus offers an opportunity to study the international diffusion of

environmental technologies.     In comparison, the US was an early adopter of strong SO2

regulations.   Thus, trends in SO2 patents will serve as a useful control, to check whether
International Innovation and Diffusion of Air Pollution Technology                                            2


differences in international patenting of pollution control technologies are truly due to

differences in international environmental regulation.

        In this paper, I use patent data from each of these three countries to track innovation of

NOX and SO2 technologies. I use these data to answer two related questions. First, what role

does environmental policy play in inducing environmentally-friendly innovation? Do domestic

environmental regulations spur innovation by foreign inventors, as well as domestic inventors?

Second, using patent citations, I examine the role of international knowledge spillovers, asking

what contribution patents from foreign inventors make to innovation by domestic inventors in

the US. The results suggest that international transfer of these technologies occurs indirectly –

via influencing domestic inventors – rather than directly. This finding suggests that for countries

adopting environmental regulations similar to those already in place elsewhere, domestic R&D

will be needed before technology transfer can occur.



I. Motivating Theory/Literature Review

        The goal of this paper is to understand how environmental policies both at home and

abroad affect the stock of knowledge available within a country.1 As such, it draws from two

separate sets of literature. Questions about the direct linkages between environmental policy and

innovation within a country have been studied using an induced innovation framework.

Similarly, questions about flows of knowledge across countries are addressed by papers looking

at knowledge spillovers. Figure 1 illustrates the linkages explored in this paper. Circles illustrate

variables exogenous to this study, while boxes represent endogenous variables. Solid lines

  The concept of a knowledge stock represents the current state of technology available for use by firms. Like a
physical capital stock, it is typically modeled as a function of previous knowledge and current R&D investment.
See, for example, Griliches (1995). In recent years, several climate policy models have made use of knowledge
stocks to model links between environmental policy and technological change. Examples include Goulder and
Schneider (1999), Buonanno et al. (2003), and Popp (2004).

represent links well-established in the literature. Broken lines represent links that are less

established, and thus the focus of this study.

       Within each country, we expect domestic environmental policy to lead to increases in

domestic R&D focused on environmental technologies. Such predictions come from models of

induced innovation (Hicks, 1932; Ahmad, 1966; Kamien and Schwartz, 1968; and Binswanger

1974, 1978a, 1978b), which predict that increased input prices encourage innovation to

economize on usage of the more expensive input. In this framework, by increasing the costs of

using environmental resources, environmental policies induce R&D designed to protect the

environment. Recently, as measures of innovative activity such as patents have become more

readily available, empirical economists have begun to estimate the effects that prices and

environmental policies have on environmentally-friendly innovation.           Examples include

Brunnermeier and Cohen (2003), Popp (2002), Newell, Jaffe, and Stavins (1999), and Jaffe and

Palmer (1997).

       Because of the wealth of data available, each of these studies focuses on innovation in the

United States. US environmental standards are typically among the world’s most stringent,

making it an appropriate study of the need for innovation to comply with environmental

regulations. However, because of their focus on US data, as well as a focus on a broad range of

environmental technologies, these papers do not provide insight to the incentives for innovation

in countries that are latecomers to environmental regulation. Since US coal-fired power plants

faced relatively weak standards for NOX emissions until the 1990s, this paper offers a look at

innovation on a technology when a country is a latecomer to environmental regulation.

       While the above papers establish links between domestic policy and domestic R&D (as

well as the links between foreign environmental policy and foreign environmental R&D in
International Innovation and Diffusion of Air Pollution Technology                              4


Figure 1), little work has looked at the linkages across countries. That is, what effect, if any,

does environmental policy in one country have on environmental R&D in a second country?

The one paper to date that does provide some evidence for this question is Lanjouw and Mody

(1996), who use patent data from the US, Japan, Germany, and 14 low-and middle-income

countries to examine international trends in patenting for a wide range of environmental

technologies. As expected, they find that environmentally-friendly innovation increases as

pollution abatement cost expenditures in the country increase. For the developing countries, the

majority of these patents come from foreign countries. For the US, Japan, and Germany, the

majority of these patents are typically domestic patents. However, this is not always the case. In

their data, the majority of vehicle air emissions patents granted in the US in their sample are

from foreign nations, even though the US was the first country to adopt strict emissions

standards. This suggests that regulations in one country can spur innovation by firms in other

nations. By focusing on individual air pollutants, this project offers a more detailed look at

international patterns of environmental invention than the work of Lanjouw and Mody. In

addition, rather than using the indirect proxy of pollution abatement expenditures as a measure of

regulatory stringency, I make use of specific variations in regulations to more carefully identify

the effects of changes in specific regulations in each country.

       The above research addresses how environmental policy affects innovation in each

country. Also important is how the knowledge represented by these innovations flow into a

country. This is represented by the knowledge stock in Figure 1. There are two potential

avenues by which foreign knowledge can have an influence in the domestic economy. First,

foreign inventions may enter the knowledge stock and be adopted directly by domestic firms.

The direct line between foreign R&D and the available knowledge in Figure 1 illustrates this
International Innovation and Diffusion of Air Pollution Technology                                              5


possibility. If the inventor is not completely compensated for the value of the invention, a

“spillover” has occurred, as the domestic firm receives a net benefit, but a direct knowledge

transfer does not occur, since the ability of the domestic firm to create its own inventions has not

increased (Griliches 1979). Rather, this is a pecuniary externality. Second, foreign knowledge

entering the knowledge stock may affect the productivity of domestic R&D. The “blueprints”

represented by foreign patents may serve to inspire additional innovation by domestic inventors.

These represent true knowledge spillovers, as the knowledge represented by the foreign patent

creates a positive externality – knowledge which is borrowed by the domestic inventor (Griliches

1979). Such spillovers are shown by the line between foreign and domestic R&D in Figure 1. In

addition, the connection between the knowledge stock and domestic R&D flows both ways, as

technological advances may serve as building blocks for future R&D.

        Note that these two avenues have different implications for the timing of innovation and

adoption of new pollution control technologies in countries that are late adopters of

environmental regulations (follower countries). In the case of direct adoption, the technology

will already exist, having been invented in countries that were early adopters of environmental

regulations (leader countries). As such, follower countries should experience rapid adoption of

new technologies.2 However, direct adoption might not be possible. Domestic R&D may be

needed to make modifications of foreign inventions to make them compatible with local markets.

For example, both Cohen and Levinthal (1989) and Griffith, Redding, and Van Reenen (2003)

find positive links between R&D and the ability of firms to absorb knowledge spillovers.

Foreign knowledge can still be beneficial in this case, as it provides knowledge on which


2
 The beneficiaries of the adoption, however, may be the innovators from leader countries, who experience increased
sales due to regulations in the follower country. Such a finding would support the early mover advantage
hypothesized by Porter as one reason why environmental regulations may increase international competitiveness
(Porter and van der Linde 1995).
International Innovation and Diffusion of Air Pollution Technology                                  6


domestic inventors can build. This paper uses the timing of patent applications and regulations

across countries to identify these effects. If direct adoption is the primary means of technology

transfer, most environmental patents in each country should come from the technology leader,

and there should not be a corresponding burst of patenting activity in countries that adopt

regulations later. In comparison, if additional R&D is needed to adapt innovations, we would

expect additional domestic patenting activity as each nation strengthens its own environmental

regulations.

           In addition, I use patent citations to measure knowledge flows across nations, to ask how

important knowledge spillovers from the leader country are to these domestic inventions. When a

patent is granted, it contains citations to earlier patents that are related to the current invention.

In recent years, several economists have used patent citations as a measure of knowledge flows.3

Examples include Jaffe, Fogarty, and Banks (1998), Jaffe and Trajtenberg (1996), Caballero and

Jaffe (1993), Jaffe, Henderson, and Trajtenberg (1993), and Johnson and Popp (2003). Most

related to this work, Jaffe and Trajtenberg (1999) use data from citations granted in the US to

estimate the likelihood of citations across “pairs” of countries.        Looking at broad sets of

technologies (e.g. all chemical technologies), they find that patents are most likely to cite other

patents assigned to inventors from the same country.          Looking at more distinctly defined

environmental technologies, in this paper, I show that this relationship changes for technologies

first developed abroad.

II. Regulation of NOX and SO24

        Both NOX and SO2 have received significant attention from regulators for over 30 years.

NOX emissions are produced by the combustion of fossil fuels, when nitrogen contained in the

fuel combines with oxygen during the combustion process. NOX emissions can be reduced either

by making modifications to the combustion process or by using post-combustion control

techniques.    Major environmental concerns resulting from NOX emissions are ground-level

ozone and acid rain. SO2 emissions come from burning coal or oil as a fuel. The primary

concern form SO2 emissions is acid rain. SO2 emissions can be reduced by switching to cleaner-

burning coal or using flue gas desulfurization (FGD) units (commonly known as “scrubbers”) to

remove emissions. This section reviews the regulation of NOX and SO2 in the US, Japan and

Germany. Figure 2 summarizes NOX regulations in the three countries. SO2 regulations have

not varied over time as much, and are simply described in the text below. Regulations are

expressed in both the local units used in each country and in mg/m3, which is the most

commonly used unit across countries.



A. United States

        In the United States, NOX and SO2 are two of six criteria pollutants regulated by the

Clean Air Acts. The first national standards for NOX and SO2 were set by the 1970 Clean Air

Act (CAA). US SO2 emissions limits have historically been among the most stringent in the

world. The 1970 CAA established a limit of 1.2 pounds of SO2 per million Btu (lbs/mmBtu) of

heat input for power plants (equivalent to 1480 mg/m3). The 1977 CAA kept this limit, but

added technology-forcing language that essentially required the use of scrubbers to achieve at

4
  Except where otherwise noted, information in this section comes from a series of publications on emission
standards published by the International Energy Agency Clean Coal Centre: Vernon (1988), Soud (1991),
McConville (1997), and Sloss (2003).
International Innovation and Diffusion of Air Pollution Technology                                           8


least 90% SO2 removal. The 1990 CAA established SO2 emission permit trading, in which

plants are required to hold permits for each ton of SO2 emitted. The number of permits were

restricted, with the goal of reducing emissions to 10 million tons less than 1980 levels by 2000.

As is well documented, the permit trading program has successfully achieved this goal at costs

significantly lower than would have been possible without trading (see, for example, Ellerman et

al. 1997).

        In comparison, NOX emissions were primarily seen as a local issue until the 1990 Clean

Air Act. NOX emissions results in two major environmental problems – the formation of

ground-level ozone and acid rain. As such, US NOX regulations have focused on areas where

these two problems are primary concerns – California (ozone) and the eastern United States (acid

rain). For NOX, the 1970 CAA established a limit of 0.7 lbs/mmBtu of NOX for power plants

(equivalent to 860 mg/m3). The 1977 CAA tightened the standard slightly, lowering the limit to

0.5-0.6 lbs/mmBtu (equivalent to 615-740 mg/m3).5 In addition, removal of at least 65% of NOX

emissions was required.

        It was not until the 1990s that NOX regulations were strengthened, and even then the

focus was on regions of primary concern. First, the state of California established limits as low

as 0.015 lb/mmBtu (18.45 mg/m3) for the Los Angeles Basin beginning in 1991 (Alfonso et al.

2000). At the national level, the 1990 CAA established the Ozone Transport Commission

(OTC), designed to address the regional problem of acid rain in the eastern US. The resulting

plan, implemented in phases, called for reductions in affected eastern states to 0.2 lb/mmBtu

(equivalent to 246 mg/m3) beginning in May 1999, and reductions to 0.15 lb/mmBtu (equivalent

to 220 mg/m3) by May of 2003, and allowed trading of NOX emission permits across plants in

 Different limits applied depending on the type of coal burnt. The higher 0.6 limit applied to bituminous coal,
which is most commonly used at US coal-fired electric plants.

the region.6 The 1998 NOX SIP Call expanded NOX reductions to 22 eastern states, and required

that emissions reductions be in place by 2004. At the national level, the 1990 CAA tightened

emission standards to as low as 0.4-0.46 lb/mmBtu (490-565 mg/m3) by 2000.7 Unlike previous

legislation, these reductions applied to both new and existing plants.



B. Japan

        Japan’s air pollution regulations follow a similar trend to those of the US, with the

exception that NOX emissions were regulated more quickly. National air pollution regulation in

Japan began with the 1968 Air Pollution Control Law. This law set initial emissions standards

for NOX and SO2. These standards were tightened by amendments in 1970 and 1974, which

introduced formulas for additional emission reductions in “polluted regions”. Within these

regions, both total emissions in the region and plant-level emissions are regulated.

        For SO2, emissions standards vary by plant, according to a formula that considers both

the region’s environmental quality and the “effective stack height” of the plant.8                      Stricter

standards apply for new plants in the most polluted regions. Standards for a sample plant with an

effective stack height of 260 meters range from 245-1250 parts per million (ppm) (equivalent to

700-3600 mg/m3). For new plants in the most polluted regions, such as Tokyo the standard can

be as low as 60 ppm (170 mg/m3). Compared to the US, Japanese regulations are stricter for

sources in polluted areas, but weaker elsewhere.




6
  Affected states are Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New
Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, and the District of Columbia.
7
  This regulation was phased in, with slightly higher standards between 1996 and 1999. Also, note that the
requirements vary by plant. The standards presented apply to tangentially-fired boilers and dry bottom wall-fired
boilers respectively. These are the most common boiler types in the US. Other boilers are allowed more NOX
emissions.
8
  “Effective stack height” is the sum of both the actual stack height and the average plume rise height.
International Innovation and Diffusion of Air Pollution Technology                           10


           In contrast, Japanese NOX regulations have been stricter than the US since the 1974

amendments to the Air Pollution Control Law. At that time, allowable NOX emissions from

coal-fired power plants fell from 902 mg/m3 to 616 mg/m3, making Japan’s NOX standard nearly

30% stricter than the limits in place in the US at the time. Despite stricter regulations, NOX

continued to be a problem in Japan. As a result, the NOX standard was tightened further in 1987,

with a new limit of just 410 mg/m3. Moreover, unlike in the US, where older plants are

grandfathered from new emission standards, these standards apply to both new and existing

plants.



C. Germany

           In contrast to the US and Japan, Germany9 implemented strict air pollution standards

later. The Federal Immission Control Law of 1974 sets general principles for air pollution

control, but specific limits were not set until the mid 1980’s. For large (> 50 MWt) plants, the

Ordinance on Large Combustion plants established emissions standards on June 1, 1983.

Smaller plants (1-50 MWt) are covered by the Technical Instruction for Air Pollution Control,

which was last amended in 1986. As a latecomer to air pollution regulation, Germany could

potentially take advantage of advances made elsewhere. As such, the standards set in the 1980s

were significantly stricter than those in the US or Japan. NOX emissions from the largest coal-

fired power plants (including existing plants) were limited to just 200 mg/m3. Similarly, SO2

emissions were limited to just 400 mg/m3. Both new and existing plants were expected to

comply with these regulations by 1990. The federal government provided assistance through

both research and tax benefits for plant expenditures on NOX control. These tax credits placed

particular emphasis on the development of German-manufactured catalysts. For SO2, existing

International Innovation and Diffusion of Air Pollution Technology                               11


plants were given until April 1, 1993 to meet these standards, and were only required to restrict

emissions to 2000 mg/m3 in the interim. Upon unification, the states of the former East Germany

adopted West German environmental standards. New plants would have to comply immediately,

while existing plants from the former East Germany were given until 1996 to come into

compliance with these regulations.



III. Patent Data

       This paper uses patent data from the US, Japan, and Germany to study trends of

innovation and technology transfer in response to NOX and SO2 regulations. These data come

from various sources, including the EPO’s esp@cent database, the Japanese Patent Office’s

website, the Delphion on-line patent database, the NBER patent citation database, and a set of

CD-ROM’s from MicroPatent. Below I describe how the international patent system works,

discuss how such data should be interpreted, and briefly describe construction of the dataset used

in this paper. A description of patent citation data is presented in section V. Appendix A

provides a more detailed discussion of the construction of the data for this paper.



A. Using Patent Data

       Patents are granted by national patent offices in individual countries. Patent protection is

only valid in the country that grants the patent. An inventor must file for protection in each

nation in which protection is desired. Nearly all patent applications are first filed in the home

country of the inventor. The date of the initial application is referred to as the priority date. If

the patent is granted, protection begins from the priority date. Inventors who desire patent

protection in other nations must file applications in those nations, either directly or by using a
International Innovation and Diffusion of Air Pollution Technology                                              12


Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) that designates the countries in which protection is desired,

within one year of the priority date. If the inventor does file abroad within one year, the inventor

will have priority over any patent applications received in those countries since the priority date

that describe similar inventions.

        These additional filings of the same patent application in different countries are known as

patent families. Because of the additional costs of filing abroad, along with the one-year waiting

period that gives inventors additional time to gauge the value of their invention, only the most

valuable inventions are filed in several countries. Moreover, filing a patent application in a

given country is a signal that the inventor expects the invention to be profitable in that country.

Because of this, researchers such as Lanjouw and Schankerman (1999) have used data on patent

families as proxies for the quality of individual patents. Lanjouw and Mody (1996) use such

data to show that environmental technologies patented by developed country firms are more

general than similar inventions from developing countries, as the developed country inventions

have larger patent families.

        Using patent data offers several advantages. First, patent data from all three countries is

readily available. Second, patent data is available in highly disaggregated forms. Whereas R&D

data is typically available only for specific industries or general applications,10 patent

classifications can be used to distinguish, for example, between pollution control devices

designed to reduce NOX emissions from devices designed to control SO2 emissions. Third, the

number of countries in which an inventor seeks protection for an invention provides a measure of

diffusion of the innovation. Fourth, economists have found that patents, sorted by their date of

application, provide a good indicator of R&D activity (see, for example, Griliches 1990).


10
  For example, in the US, R&D data is available from 1972-1994 for air pollution control, but it is not broken down
by pollutant.
International Innovation and Diffusion of Air Pollution Technology                                                  13


         Nonetheless, when working with patent data, it is important to be aware of its limitations.

The existing literature on the benefits and drawbacks of using patent data is quite large.11 For

this research, it is particularly important to note that although the decision to file a patent

obviously follows from the decision to perform R&D, not all successful research results are

patented. In return for receiving the monopoly rights inferred by a patent, the inventor is

required to publicly disclose the invention.              Rather than make this disclosure, inventors may

prefer to keep an invention secret. Surveys of inventors indicate that the rate at which new

innovations are patented varies across industry (Levin et al. 1987). Fortunately, when studying

the development of a single technology, this is less of a concern than when using patent data to

measure innovation trends across several dissimilar industries.12 Finally, it is also important to

note that the quality of individual patents varies widely. Some inventions are extremely valuable,

whereas others are of almost no commercial value. This is partly a result of the random nature of

the inventive process. Accordingly, the results of this paper are best interpreted as the effect of

an “average” patent, rather than any specific invention.



B. Data Description

         When patents are granted, they are given technology classifications and subclassifications

by various patent offices. These classifications can be used to identify patents pertaining to each

11
   Griliches (1990) provides a useful survey.
12
   One concern that remains is that the propensity to patent may vary over time. For example, the number of patents
filed in recent years in the United States has risen dramatically. Some observers argue that at least part of this
increase can be attributed to recent court decisions that have increased the value of patent protection. One possible
control for this is to use the percentage of all successful domestic patent applications per year in each technology
field as the measure of innovative activity. Using the percentage of applications in each field, rather than a raw count
of applications, accounts for growth in the economy and exogenous changes in patenting behavior. Policy changes
that affect all patent classifications would lead to a change in both the total number of patent applications and the
number of pollution control patent applications in a given year. Results using this method were obtained, and no
major changes in the trends described in section IV were found when these controls were made. As the application
data were not available across all years, and because presenting data in percentages does not allow one to compare
the magnitude of patenting activity across countries, the raw data are presented in section IV.
International Innovation and Diffusion of Air Pollution Technology                                        14


of the technologies described in section IV. Traditional classification systems, such as the

International Patent Classification (IPC) system or the US patent classification system, do not

provide enough detail to distinguish among technologies at the level of detail needed for this

paper. Thus, two alternative classification systems were used. For US and German patents,

relevant patents were identified using the European Classification System (ECLA). The ECLA is

based upon the IPC, but provides additional detail necessary to distinguish between the types of

pollution controlled by various technologies.           ECLA classifications are assigned to patent

examiners at the European Patent Office (EPO). The EPO provides a searchable on-line

database, esp@cenet, that includes ECLA classifications for all German patents and all US

patents granted since 1920.13 However, the EPO database does not include complete updates of

the ECLA for Japanese patents. Thus, Japanese patents were obtained from the Intellectual

Property Digital Library on the Japan Patent Office (JPO) web site.14 The JPO does not use the

ECLA. However, it uses its own system, the F-term, which, like the ECLA, provides greater

detail than the IPC.

        Using these two systems, we identified classifications relevant to the technologies

described in section IV. This process is described in greater detail in appendix A. Appendix B

lists the classifications used for each technology type. In choosing relevant classifications,

particular care was taken to avoid classifications that were too broad – that is, where some

patents in the class pertained to pollution control, but most did not. Using the on-line databases,

we downloaded a list of patent numbers for documents published in the US, Germany, Japan,

and the EPO.15,16 Once the relevant patents had been obtained, descriptive information on these

patents was downloaded from the Delphion on-line database. These data are available for

patents published in the US, Germany, or the EPO, but not for patents from Japan. Descriptive

data downloaded include the application, priority, and issue date for each patent, the home

country of the inventor, and data on patent families. Data on the year of application for Japanese

patents was obtained from the JPO website. However, it is not possible to identify the home

country of the inventor or the priority year for the Japanese patents in the dataset.

         To organize the data, patents were sorted by priority year (or the application year for

Japanese patents). As noted earlier, this date tends to correspond with the actual inventive

activity. Moreover, as the average length of time it takes to process a patent application varies

across countries, using priority dates, rather than the date of grant, provides a common date for

comparisons across countries.            Data from Japan and German includes both successful and

unsuccessful patent applications, as all patent applications are published in each country 18

months after the initial filing. However, the US data includes only patent applications that were

subsequently granted. Until 2001, patents were only published in the US upon grant, so that no

public record exists of unsuccessful US patent applications. Finally, one caveat is necessary for

interpreting Japanese data.           Until 1988, Japanese patent law required a separate patent

application for each unique claim on a patent. For example, the inventor of a bicycle would


15
   Before German unification, this only includes patents granted in West Germany. However, prior to unification,
there are very few patents granted in West Germany to East German inventors. Moreover, there are no spikes in
domestic patent counts after unification, suggesting that unification has little effect on the data.
16
   Beginning in 1978, an inventor desiring protection in Europe could file a single patent application through the
EPO. The applicant designates as many of the 18 EPO member-states for protection as desired. The application is
examined by the EPO. If granted, the patent is transferred to the individual national patent offices designated for
protection. Typically, a patent applicant first files for protection in their home country, and then applies to offices
abroad, such as the EPO. The esp@cenet database returns patent numbers for patents with German priority that
were also filed through the EPO, but does not return the German patent numbers for patents with foreign priority
that were filed through EPO and designated Germany for protection. Thus, foreign patent counts in Germany are
augmented by including EPO patents from non-German inventors that designate Germany for protection.
International Innovation and Diffusion of Air Pollution Technology                              16


require separate patents describing its various parts (Ordover 1991). In other countries, a single

patent can use several claims to describe an invention. Thus, an invention that would result in

one patent in other nations would result in many individual patents in Japan. Even today,

Japanese patents tend to have fewer claims than US patents (Cohen et al. 2002). As such, while

the data are useful to observe trends across time within countries, the level of patenting activity

across countries are not directly comparable using patent data alone.



IV. Pollution Control Innovations Across Countries

       Using the patent data described above, this section examines innovations in pollution

control technologies designed to reduce emission of NOX or SO2 from coal-fired power plants. I

describe the technologies used to control these emissions, and look at patenting trends across the

three countries. Of particular interest are the links between environmental policies in one nation

and patenting activity in a second. Do environmental policies spur patenting activity from

foreign researchers? Moreover, do foreign environmental regulations lead to patenting activity

within a second country?



A. NOX Post Combustion

       NOX emissions can be controlled via modifications to the combustion process or by

treatment of flue gas after combustion. The primary post-combustion techniques are selective

catalytic reduction (SCR) and selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR). In both processes, an

ammonia-based regent is injected into the flue gas stream. A chemical reaction between the

NOX gases and the regent produce nitrogen and water. SCR uses a catalyst to produce this

reaction, allowing it to work at lower temperatures than SNCR technology. SCR has a higher
International Innovation and Diffusion of Air Pollution Technology                            17


capital cost than SNCR, but can reduce emissions by as much as 80-90%, compared to just 30-

40% reduction from SNCR technologies. (CoalPower4 2001, Afonso et al., 2000) As such, SCR

is the technology of choice for plants facing tight NOX emissions restrictions, such as in

Germany and Japan. Table 1 shows the number of plants using post-combustion techniques

versus those using combustion modification, taken from the CoalPower4 database.             This

database, available from the International Energy Agency’s Clean Coal Centre, includes coal-

fired plants in operation as of 2000. 51 of 87 (59%) of Japanese coal-fired power plant units use

post-combustion techniques to control NOX emissions, often in combination with combustion

modification techniques. Similarly, 118 of 228 (52%) plants in Germany use post-combustion

methods. In contrast, just 44 post-combustion treatment techniques were in use in 1150 US units

(3.8%), although another 72 were planned or under construction in response to strengthened NOX

regulations in the late 1990s.

       The complexity of retrofitting SCR on an existing plant depends on both the level of

reduction required and the quality of the coal burned. Higher flue gas sulfur and ash loadings

make retrofitting more difficult in Germany than Japan. German boilers are more similar to US

boilers than those in Japan, suggesting that lessons learned in Germany will be of particular use

as US plants begin to adopt SCR technologies. (Frey 1995) This also suggests that innovations

in one country need not apply to plants elsewhere.

       Trends in patenting of post-combustion NOX control techniques across the US, Japan,

and Germany show the importance of local influences. Figure 3 displays these patents for the

United States. Beginning in 1973, when stricter Japanese NOX limits took effect, until 1988,

when the 1990 CAA was being debated in Congress, as many or more successful NOX post-

combustion patent applications filed in the US came from foreign sources as domestic sources in
International Innovation and Diffusion of Air Pollution Technology                                            18


all but three years (1978, 1980, and 1981). These trends are driven in large part by stricter

regulations in Japan and Germany. Note that NOX post-combustion patents from Japan increase

after passage of stricter NOX regulations in 1973, and German patents peak after passage of NOX

regulations in 1984. Japanese patents also reach a second, lower peak after Japanese standards

were tightened in 1987. In fact, at the peak level of patenting for each country, the number of

patents from each country is greater than the number from US applicants in the same year!

Furthermore, neither German nor Japanese patenting activity respond to the 1990 CAA. In

contrast, domestic (US applicant) and total foreign patents do respond to the 1990 CAA.

Domestic patents increase by a factor of 11 from a post-CAA low of 6 in 1982 to a peak of 68 in

1990.17

          Figure 4 displays the same data for Germany.                 Here, the links between domestic

regulation and innovation are even more apparent.                Domestic NOX post-combustion patent

applications increase by a factor of 5.5 between 1983 and 1985, from 27 to 149. In contrast, total

foreign applications merely double from 12 in 1983 to 24 in 1985. Recall that the regulations

passed in Germany in 1984 were significantly more stringent than NOX regulations elsewhere.

Thus, new innovations were needed to achieve these goals. A look at international patenting

activity of German inventors supports the notion that important innovations were taking place in

response to these innovations. For German NOX post-combustion patents, an average of 30%

were also filed in Japan between 1970 and 2000, and 24% were also filed in the United States.

However, inventors of patents granted in the mid-1980s were more likely to file in Japan. In

1982, just 30.8% such patents also sought protection in Japan. This figure rises to 37.0% in


17
   Note that the growth in US post-combustion patents also begins in the mid-1980s. This is likely in response to
new standards passed for industrial sources of NOX, rather than the German regulations. If these patents were in
response to German regulations, we would expect to see a similar increase of US patent applications in Germany.
As we will see in Figure 4, this is not the case.
International Innovation and Diffusion of Air Pollution Technology                                              19


1983, 45.1% in 1984, and 46.3% in 1985. It drops back to 26.7% in 1986, and doesn’t reach

30% again until 1992, suggesting that the prospects for truly important discoveries began to fall.

This may explain the quick drop in patenting activity that occurs in the late-1980s.18                          As

evidence of the importance of regulation in the target country, note that there was no such

increase in filings to the US, where there was little market for SCR technology due to laxer

regulations. For example, only 17.4% of these German patents also filed for protection in the

U.S. in 1985.

        Finally, Figure 5 displays patent data for Japan. As noted earlier, breakdowns by the

applicant’s home country are not available for the Japanese patents. Once again, the importance

of domestic regulations are important, as NOX post-combustion patents peak after NOX standards

were tightened in 1973 and 1987. Note also that there is no evidence of Japanese inventors

responding to regulatory changes in Germany during the mid-1980s. However, the increase in

patenting activity in 1995 and 1996 may be a reaction to new regulations pending in the United

States, as Japanese patents filed in the US at the same time experience a similar jump.



B. NOX Combustion Modification Techniques
        In contrast to post-combustion techniques, combustion modification techniques are less

costly, as they do not require add-on equipment. Rather, they involve changing the combustion

process to reduce the amount of NOX formed by combustion. Typically, such modifications

work by adjusting the mix of air and fuel used in combustion, which reduces the peak flame

temperature and results in lower NOX formation. Commonly used techniques include low-NOX

burners (LNB) and overfire air (OFA), in which combustion air is separated into primary and



18
  Popp (2002) uses patent citations to support a similar story for US energy innovation in response to higher energy
prices during the 1970s and 1980s.
International Innovation and Diffusion of Air Pollution Technology                           20


secondary flows.   These techniques reduce emissions by 30-40% from uncontrolled levels

(CoalPower4 2001, Afonso et al. 2000). Other techniques used include flue gas recirculation

(FGR), in which some of the flue gas is recirculated and mixed with combustion air. On its own,

this technique reduces emissions by approximately 20%. Thus, it is often used in combination

with other techniques. Finally, fuel staging techniques, such as reburning, use a secondary fuel

directed at a section of the furnace. The secondary fuel breaks down and reacts with NOX

produced by the primary combustion process.       A third, final combustion stage then burns

remaining carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons produced by this second stage. Reburning can

reduce emissions by as much as 70%, particularly when paired with other techniques, such as

SCNR (CoalPower4 2001, Afonso et al. 2000).

       Compared to post-combustion techniques, combustion modification techniques are used

in all three countries. One difference, as shown in Table 1, is the majority of plants using

combustion modification in Germany or Japan also make use of post-combustion techniques. In

contrast, only 22 of the 437 plants using combustion modification in the US also use post-

combustion techniques. Patenting trends reflect these usage patterns. Figure 6 shows these

trends for the US. While all three countries have some combustion modification patents, the US

holds a greater share of such patents. Unlike the post-combustion techniques, there are more

domestic than foreign patents within the US in nearly every year. Japanese and German patents

filed in the US remain low even after the passage of regulations in each country. For example,

German combustion modification patents peak at just 5 in 1985. Japanese patents peak at 8 in

1995, and peak at just 6 after passage of Japanese NOX regulations in the 1970s. This compares

to post-combustion peaks of 29 patents for Germany and 31 for Japan. In comparison, US

combustion modification patents peak at 36 in 1991. Moreover, there is little US patenting until
International Innovation and Diffusion of Air Pollution Technology                              21


the late 1980s, when negotiations for the 1990 CAA began, providing further evidence that

stringency of regulation is important for inducing innovation.

         In Japan and Germany, even domestic combustion modification patents show little

response to policy. There is an increase in combustion modification patents in Japan after

passage of NOX regulations in 1973, but the increase is not as strong as exists for either post-

combustion techniques or SO2 control technologies. Similarly, as shown in Figure 7, combustion

modification patents in Germany do rise in the 1980s, but the response is more gradual than for

post-combustion techniques.      Moreover, the level of patenting activity remains relatively

constant through the 1990s. These patents are no more likely to file for protection in the US than

patents from other years, so this is less likely to be a response to NOX regulations in the US than

a response to the deadline for plants from the former East Germany to comply with emissions

regulations.



C. Sulfur Dioxide

         Sulfur dioxide from coal-fired power plants can be reduced by switching to cleaner coal

or using flue gas desulfurization (FGD) units, commonly known as “scrubbers”. The most

common scrubber technology is the wet scrubber. In a wet scrubber, a sorbent, usually lime or

limestone, is injected into a vessel to interact with the flue gas. The chemical reaction creates a

sludge, which must be disposed of. A second chemical reaction can convert the sludge into

gypsum, which can be sold. Removal efficiencies as high as 99% are possible (CoalPower4

2001).

         As with NOX, the timing of SO2 patenting activity follows regulatory trends in each

country. Figure 8 shows that SO2 patents in the US respond to passage of the CAAs, reaching
International Innovation and Diffusion of Air Pollution Technology                            22


peaks in 1979 (after passage of the 1977 CAA requiring scrubbers) and 1994 (immediately

before the beginning of the SO2 permit program in 1995). A similar spike occurs in the mid-

1970s in Japan. As Popp (2003) notes, the nature of innovation changed during this time, as the

scrubber mandate focused innovation on lowering the costs of compliance, rather than improving

efficiency. In comparison, permit trading increased the rewards for installing more efficient

scrubbers, so innovation after the 1990 CAA had a greater effect on the removal efficiency of

scrubbers. Unlike NOX, we see little increase in patents from either Japan or Germany applicants

in the US, even though there are spikes in patenting activity in each country corresponding with

the implementation of SO2 standards. There is a small jump in German SO2 patents in 1982, but

the increase is not as noticeable as with NOX technologies. It may be that, since the US was also

regulating SO2 emissions, and thus innovating at the same time as Japan and Germany, these

foreign innovations were not perceived as unique enough to also enter the US market. Finally,

note that although Japanese and German SO2 patents do not increase much, there is an increase

in total foreign patents during the late 1980s. These patents come from other EPO nations, and

correspond with passage of the Directive on Controlling of Emissions from Large Combustion

Plants by the European Community in 1988, which established minimum SO2 standards for

European countries (McConville 1997).

       This jump in European patents also affects Germany, as shown in Figure 9. Other than

this spike in European patenting efforts, German SO2 patenting trends follow those of NOX, in

that German inventors are active after the implementation of standards in 1984, but inventors

from Japan and the US do not respond. Moreover, there is not much patenting activity from

Japan and the US in the 1970s, despite higher activity levels in each country. Also, unlike NOX

post-combustion techniques, German inventors tended not to seek protection in Japan and the
International Innovation and Diffusion of Air Pollution Technology                             23


US, even during the spike of patenting in the mid-1980s. At peak patenting levels in 1983, just

12% of German applicants for SO2 patents also filed in Japan, and just 17% in the US. This

compares to over 37% who filed for protection of NOX post-combustion techniques in Japan. In

this case, as a latecomer to SO2 regulation, German innovations simply do not appear as

important as those from Japan or the US.



V. Do Knowledge Spillovers Occur?

       A cursory look at the patent data suggests any spillovers that do occur across countries in

these technologies are indirect.   In each country, firms respond to stricter environmental

standards by increasing innovation. This remains true even for countries that are latecomers to

regulations, such as the US for NOX and Germany for SO2. This suggests that these latecomers

are not simply taking advantage of innovations done elsewhere. As further evidence of this, note

that the suppliers of both NOX post-combustion pollution control techniques in the US and SO2

scrubbers in Germany (both cases of late adoption of regulation) are primarily domestic

companies, as shown in Table 2. This does not necessarily mean, however, that these follower

countries reap no benefits from earlier foreign innovations, as such innovations may influence

the R&D done in each of the follower nations.         Such transfers represent true knowledge

spillovers, as the knowledge represented by the cited patent creates a positive externality –

knowledge which is borrowed and improved upon by the domestic inventor (Griliches 1979).

       This section uses patent citation data for pollution control patents granted in the US to

test for such knowledge spillovers. When a patent is granted, it contains citations to earlier

patents that are related to the current invention. The citations are placed in the patent after

consultations among the applicant, his or her patent attorney, and the patent examiner. It is the
International Innovation and Diffusion of Air Pollution Technology                                              24


applicant’s responsibility to list any related previous patents of which he or she is aware. In

addition, the examiner, who specializes in just a few patent classifications, will add other patents

to the citations, as well as subtracting any irrelevant patents cited by the inventor. Patent citations

narrow the reach of the new patent by placing the patents cited outside the realm of the current

patent, so it is important that all relevant patents be included in the citations.19 For the same

reason, inventors have an incentive to make sure that no unnecessary patents are cited. As a

result, the previous patents cited by a new patent should be a good indicator of previous

knowledge that was utilized by the inventor.20

        The analysis requires data on every citation made by the patents in the pollution control

database.     These come from two sources.                The NBER patent database (Hall, Jaffe, and

Tratjenberg 2001) contains all patents made by US patents granted from 1976-1999. It also

includes descriptive data on patents granted since 1963.                   Data from CD’s available from

MicroPatent were used to update the citation records from 2000-2003. These two sources were

used to create pairs of citing and cited patents for all of the pollution control patents. Descriptive

data such as the year of grant and application, the inventor’s home country, and the technology

class of each cited patent were also included. In addition to patents for NOX post-combustion

control, combustion modification, and SO2 control, I also include a broader group of general air

pollution control patents.         The patent classifications of this broader group are included in

Appendix B.



19
    “Outside the realm” means that the patent holder cannot file an infringement suit against someone whose
invention infringes on qualities of the patented invention that were also included in patents cited by the patent
holder.
20
   The key assumption here is that a citation made to a previous patent indicates a flow of knowledge from the cited
patent to the citing patent, so that patents cited more frequently are considered more valuable to future inventors.
Jaffe, Fogarty, and Banks (1998) investigate the validity of this assumption, using evidence from citations made to
NASA patents. They conclude that, although there is noise in the citation process, aggregate citation patterns
represent knowledge spillovers, although the spillover may be indirect.
International Innovation and Diffusion of Air Pollution Technology                               25


       In making a formal analysis of patent citations, a simple count of subsequent citations is

not enough, for the raw number of citations to any patent depends on the total number of patents

that follow. Instead, it is necessary to look at the probability of citation. To prepare the data, I

sort potentially cited patents for each pollution control technology by the year in which the

patent was granted. I denote this year CTD, for “year cited.” Since a patent application is not

made public in the U.S. unless the patent is granted, the year of grant is the year in which the

patented innovation entered the public domain. Citing patents, denoted CTG, are sorted by year

of application. Sorting by the year of application corresponds with the knowledge available to

the inventor at the time the innovation was made, and allows the results to correspond to the

counts of patent applications described in the preceding section.

       One issue is considering which patents comprise the pool of potentially cited patents for

each technology group. In general, patent citations within a field come from a narrow range of

patents. For example, one would expect pollution control patents to cite inventions made in

chemistry or combustion, but not in sewing, agriculture, or medicine. Thus, considering the

entire universe of patents granted in a given year overstates the pool of potentially cited patents.

This is important, since the size of the pool of potentially cited patents should vary over time as

outside forces change incentives for innovation in a given field. I narrow the pool of cited

patents by considering patents from only the most cited US patent classifications for each

technology group. Data on the US patent classification of each cited patent comes from the

NBER patent database. Table 3 shows the classifications considered as potentially cited patents

for each technology, along with the percentage of citations made by patents in the group that cite

patents in that classification. In general, these groups include over two-thirds of all citations
International Innovation and Diffusion of Air Pollution Technology                                                       26


made, although the figure is slightly lower for the more general air pollution control group. Only

cited patents included in these US classifications are included in the subsequent analysis.21

            In principle, regression analysis could be used on each individual patent in the data set.

However, since most patents are never cited, the dependent variable is zero for most individual

patents. Instead, I use the model first develop by Adam Jaffe and his co-authors and sort the data

into groups of patents that could potentially cite each other (Caballero and Jaffe 1993, Jaffe and

Trajtenberg 1996, 1999). For each combination of citing and cited years, separate groups are

constructed for each technology, i; each citing country, l; and each cited country L. In each case,

the countries considered are the US, Japan, Germany, and all other countries. Thus, one possible

group includes citations made by US NOX post-combustion patents applied for in 1996 to US

NOX post-combustion patents granted in 1994. Another such cohort would include citations

made by US NOX post-combustion patents applied for in 1996 to Japanese NOX post-combustion

patents granted in 1994.              Denoting citations in each group as ci,l,L,CTD,CTG, the number of

potentially cited patents applied for in year CTD as ni,L,CTD, and the number of potentially citing

patents granted in year CTG as ni,l,CTG, the probability of citation, p, for patents within each

group is:

                                                               ci ,l , L ,CTD ,CTG
(1)                                     pi,l,L,CTD,CTG =                                 ,
                                                           (ni , L ,CTD )(ni ,l ,CTG )

            To estimate the likelihood of citation for various groups of patents, it is necessary to

control for factors that affect the likelihood of citation. Following the work of Jaffe and his co-

authors, I estimate the probability of citation using an exponential distribution to model flows of

knowledge. In this model, the probability of citation is written as:



21
     Results using all patents as potentially cited patents are similar, and are available from the author by request.
International Innovation and Diffusion of Air Pollution Technology                                                   27


(2) p(i,l,L,CTG,CTD) = αiαCTDαCTGαi,l,L[1+φL*dumNOXP]exp[-β1(CTG-CTD)][1-exp(-β2(CTG-

     CTD))] + ε.

β1 represents the rate of decay of knowledge as it becomes obsolete, and β2 stands for the rate at

which newly produced knowledge, as represented by a newly-patented innovation, diffuses

through society. Parameters capturing attributes of the citing or cited patents that may influence

the probability of citation, represented by the α parameters, include:22

         •   the likelihood of citation to patents from various years (αCTD),23

         •   the frequency with which patents applied for in the citing year cite earlier patents

             (αCTG),24,25

         •   the likelihood of citations within each technology group (αi), and

         •   the frequency of citations within each citing-cited country pair (αl,L).

         For this paper, it is this last set of variables that is of primary interest. Flows of citations

across countries provide evidence of disembodied technology transfer – that is, the direct transfer

of ideas. Jaffe and Trajtenberg (1999) use this framework to look at citation patterns across a

broad range of technologies, as their paper includes citations made by all US patents. They find

that patents are most likely to cite other patents assigned to inventors from the same country.


22
   Although the model requires us to estimate attributes associated with the cited year, the citing year, and the lag
between them, it is possible to identify attributes related to all three because the age of patents enters the model non-
linearly.
23
   This parameter can be seen as capturing variations in the usefulness of knowledge across time. Using a similar
specification, Popp (2002) finds that this parameter declines over time for energy patents, suggesting diminishing
returns to research over time.

   Changes in citing behavior over time must be accounted for because of institutional changes at the patent office
that make patents more likely to cite earlier patents than was previously true, even if all other factors are equal. In
particular, two changes have played an important role. First, computerization of patent office records has made it
easier for both patent examiners and inventors to locate other patents similar to the current invention. Second,
increasing legal pressure has made it more important for examiners to be sure that all relevant patents are cited.
25
   Although in principle citing and cited parameters could be estimated for every year, the model does not converge
when that is attempted. Thus, citing parameters are grouped into four-year intervals, and cited parameters into five-
year intervals.

They also find US patents more likely to cite patents assigned to Japanese inventors than to

German inventors, although US inventors are 38% less likely to cite Japanese inventions as other

American inventions.

        In section IV, we saw that Japanese inventors were the first to invest substantial resources

in NOX post-combustion pollution control techniques. The bracketed term 1+φL*dumNOXP tests

whether there are differences in the flows of knowledge to the United States for these

technologies. dumNOXP is a dummy variable equal to one for NOX post-combustion techniques.

φL captures the additional likelihood of US inventors citing a patent from country L for this

technology. Positive estimates mean that citations are more likely to country L for NOX post-

combustion techniques. This is interpreted as a greater flow of knowledge into the US from

country L for this technology.

        I estimate equation (2) using non-linear least squares. Because the data are grouped, I

weight each observation by            (n   i , L ,CTD   )(N   i ,l ,CTG   )   to avoid problems with heteroskedasticity

(Greene 1993). For purposes of identification, one parameter of each type is normalized to 1.26

        Table 4 presents the results of this estimation. Results of the parameters for citing and

cited years, as well as the rates of decay and diffusion, are similar to those found in the papers by

Jaffe and others.      Of interest here are the patterns of citations across countries.                        Overall,

inventors are more likely to cite other patents from their own country. For US inventors of

pollution control technologies, they are about 40 percent less likely to cite patents from any other

country, with Germany receiving the next most citations. Japanese inventors are equally likely

to cite American and Germany patents. German inventors, however, are twice as likely to cite



26
  These are SO2 citing patents, citing year 1974-1977, cited year 1963-1968, and US citing US. For the NOX post-
combustion term, US citing US is normalized to 0.
International Innovation and Diffusion of Air Pollution Technology                             29

Japanese inventors as American inventors. Inventors from other nations make slightly more use

of knowledge from the US and Germany than from Japan.

       Of particular interest is whether the pattern of knowledge flowing into the US changes for

NOX post-combustion patents. Here, we see that Japanese patents do provide a more important

source of knowledge for this technology. Japanese patents are 61 percent more likely to be cited

by American inventors for this technology. The overall likelihood of citation, relative to patents

from US inventors, is found by multiplying this result by the overall coefficient for US/Japanese

citing/cited pairs. This equals 0.95, revealing that Japanese NOX post-combustion patents are

just five percent less likely to be cited by US inventors than similar patents from other US

inventors. German patents experience no significant differences for this technology, and patents

from other countries are less likely to be cited for this technology.

       To explore this further, Table 5 shows the result of analogous dummy variables for three

alternative specifications. Column (1) shows the results just discussed. Column (2) presents a

model with separate dummy variables for NOX post-combustion patents granted before or after

1990, the year in which the last Clean Air Act was passed. To see if the results for NOX post-

combustion patents are truly unique, column (3) also includes a dummy variable for SO2 patents.

Finally, column (4) includes both technologies and the pre-or-post 1990 dummies.

       Turning first to column (2), we see the particular importance of the early Japanese

patents. Japanese NOX post-combustion patents are more than twice as likely to be cited by

American inventors as other Japanese patents. In fact, interacting this term with αUS,Jap, we see

that these early Japanese patents are 91 percent more likely to be cited than American NOX post-

combustion patents! In columns (3) and (4), we see that the basic patterns for NOX post-

combustion patents hold when the SO2 dummies are also included in the model. The SO2
International Innovation and Diffusion of Air Pollution Technology                            30

dummies are only significant for Japan and other nations. However, the effects are much

smaller, with citation probability increases of just 15 percent. In each case, US patents remain

the top source of knowledge flows for SO2.



VI. Conclusion

       This paper uses patent data from the US, Japan, and Germany to study international

technology transfer of pollution control technologies. I find that inventors respond to domestic

regulatory pressures, but not foreign regulatory pressures. There is little increase in foreign

patents in either the US or Germany in response to increased emissions standards for NOX or

SO2. There are, however, increases in patents from foreigners when regulations in the respective

home countries increase. Thus, foreign regulatory pressures do increase the knowledge stock of

a country.

       However, at least for the technologies studied here, the resulting technology transfer is

indirect. There is no evidence of domestic firms directly adopting these foreign technologies.

First, even for countries that enact regulations late, such as the US for NOX or Germany for SO2,

domestic innovative activity still increases after new regulations are passed. Second, domestic

utilities do not purchase equipment from foreign suppliers, who have greater experience with

these technologies, but rather from domestic firms. Nonetheless, using patent citation data from

the US, I show that earlier foreign patents do play an important role as building blocks for

domestic inventors.

       These findings have important implications for the relationship between environmental

policy and technological change. It suggests that diffusion of environmental technologies across

borders will be slowed by the need for domestic R&D to adapt these technologies to local
International Innovation and Diffusion of Air Pollution Technology                             31

markets. Moreover, for large-scale models of environmental policy and induced technological

change, it suggests that domestic and foreign R&D are imperfect substitutes. Thus, it is not

enough to model knowledge stocks as a combination of domestic and foreign innovative activity.

Functional forms that require some level of domestic innovation before adoption of foreign

technologies should be used.

       Finally, it is useful to consider the generalizability of these results. It is particularly

striking that even a technological leader like the US does not take direct advantage of foreign

technologies. Still, further research on technology transfer between developed and developing

countries is needed.    We would expect there to be greater differences in technological

sophistication between developing and developed countries than between the US, Japan, and

Germany. This has two conflicting implications for applying these results to transfer from

developed to developing countries. First, greater differences in currently-used technologies

suggest that adopting the technology to local circumstances will be even more important for

developing countries. However, less technological sophistication in developing countries may

hamper the ability to make such modifications, and make developing countries more willing to

accept “imperfect fits” of technology, rather than do adaptive R&D. For example, Lanjouw and

Mody (1996) find developing countries are more likely to patent water pollution control devices

than air pollution control, and explain this difference by noting that water treatment plants must

operate under many different types of local conditions. They also find variation in patenting

levels across countries. Some countries, such as Brazil, experience significant increases in

environmental patenting in their study. Other, such as South Korea, patent less, choosing instead

to import pollution control technology from abroad. More detailed analysis of such differences

would be of great use to both policymakers and economists alike.

The figure shows patents granted in Germany for combustion modification techniques to control
NOX emissions. Patents are sorted by the home country of the assignee and by priority year.
German inventors respond to the passage of strict NOX emission standards in 1983, but not as
dramatically as for post-combustion control techniques.

The figure shows patents granted in the United States for SO2 control techniques. Patents are
sorted by the home country of the assignee and by priority year. Compared to NOX control
technologies, US inventive activity is larger and more consistent, reflecting the stringent nature
of SO2 regulations throughout the period.

The figure shows patents granted in Germany for SO2 pollution control. Patents are sorted by
the home country of the assignee and by priority year. Once again, we see that German
inventors respond to the passage of strict emission standards in 1983, but foreign inventors do
not.

between cited NOX post-combustion patents granted before and after 1990. Columns (3) and (4)
repeat this analysis, including dummy variables for both NOX post-combustion techniques and

                          Data Appendix A – Creation of the Patent Data Set

         When patents are granted, they are given technology classifications and subclassifications

by various patent offices. These classifications can be used to identify all patents for each of the

technologies described in section IV.              For US and German patents, relevant patents were

identified using the European Classification System (ECLA). ECLA classifications are assigned

to patent examiners at the European Patent Office (EPO). The EPO provides a searchable on-line

database, esp@cenet, that includes ECLA classifications for all German patents and all US

patents granted since 1920.27 This classification scheme is based upon the often-used

International Patent Classification system (IPC), but includes classifications at a greater level of

detail. This additional detail allows for separate identification of technologies based on the

pollutants they control. For example, IPC classification B01D 53/86 includes catalytic processes

for pollution control. ECLA class B01D 53/86F2 specifies catalytic processes for reduction of

NOX, and B01D 53/86B4 specifies catalytic processes for reduction of SO2. Moreover, as new

classifications are added, the EPO updates the ECLA of older patents in its database. This is

important, as classifications distinguishing pollution control techniques for specific pollutants

were not added until recently. Using the EPO’s on-line database, a list of all patent numbers in

relevant technology classes was downloaded for the US, Germany, and the EPO.28

         However, the EPO database does not include complete updates of the ECLA for Japanese

patents. Thus, Japanese patents were obtained from the Intellectual Property Digital Library on

   Beginning in 1978, an inventor desiring protection in Europe could file a single patent application through the
EPO. The applicant designates as many of the 18 EPO member-states for protection as desired. The application is
examined by the EPO. If granted, the patent is transferred to the individual national patent offices designated for
protection. Typically, a patent applicant first files for protection in their home country, and then applies to offices
abroad, such as the EPO. The esp@cenet database returns patent numbers for patents with German priority that
were also filed through the EPO, but does not return the German patent numbers for patents with foreign priority
that were filed through EPO and designated Germany for protection. Thus, foreign patent counts in Germany are
augmented by including EPO patents from non-German inventors that designate Germany for protection.
International Innovation and Diffusion of Air Pollution Technology                              A2

the Japan Patent Office (JPO) web site.29 The JPO does not use the ECLA. However, it uses its

own system, the F-term, which, like the ECLA, provides greater detail than the IPC. F-terms

consist of a 5-digit theme code, a 2-digit viewpoint symbol, and a 2-digit number. For example,

consider technologies classified as 4D002 AA12. The 5-digit theme code 4D002 pertains to

“processing of waste gases.” The two letter viewpoint symbol AA pertains to “compounds to be

processed.” Finally, the 2-digit number specifies that NOX is the component processed.

           The first step in assembling the patent data used in this paper was to identify relevant

ECLA classifications.           Information on appropriate technologies was obtained from several

sources.       Much of this information is summarized through documents available from the

International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Clean Coal Research Centre, and is available on-line at

htpp://www.iea-coal.org.uk.            Keyword searches were used to identify potentially relevant

patents. Individual documents were viewed to determine which were, in fact, patents pertaining

to pollution control. A tally of the ECLA classifications of these patents was made, enabling us

to identify classifications that occurred frequently in the data. Then, searches of these ECLAs

were done both separately and in combination with relevant keywords to identify classifications

for which the majority of patents did pertain to pollution control. This last step was particularly

important for combustion modification patents, as many patents in potential combustion

classifications pertain to other aspects of combustion (e.g. for improving horsepower). Once the

relevant ECLA classes were found, they were matched to corresponding F-term classes in the

Japanese system, using both a reading of the various definitions and searches of the Intellectual

Property Digital Library of the JPO using the IPC class most closely corresponding to the ECLA

codes.

           After establishing the patent classifications to use in this research, the next research step

was to obtain a list of all patents from the US, Japan, Germany, and the EPO in these

classifications. Patent numbers from all but Japan were obtained from esp@cenet, and the

Japanese data came from the Intellectual Property Digital Library of the JPO. Because of

differences in patent laws in each country, slightly different data are available from each site.

US data is only available for granted patents, as patent applications were not published by the US

Patent Office until 2001. In contrast, both successful and unsuccessful patent applications are

available for Germany and the EPO. Finally, the Japanese database contains information on all

patent applications since 1971. Using application data, rather than granted patents, is more

reliable for Japan, as the patent examination process in Japan often takes six or more years,

compared to 2-3 years in the United States.

           Both of these sources provide lists of patents, but do not allow the user to download large

quantities of descriptive data about the patents. Thus, we augmented the patent numbers with

descriptive information downloaded from the Delphion on-line database.30                This database,

available only by subscription, allows the user to download multiple patent records in machine-

readable formats. Descriptive data available include the priority, application and issue dates for

each patent, the home country of the inventor, and data on patent families. Unfortunately,

updated ECLA classifications are not available from Delphion. Thus, we downloaded patents

from Delphion that fell in related IPC classifications, and merged these data with the lists of

patent numbers to restrict the analysis to those falling in the relevant ECLA classes.

Also, the Delphion database does not include detailed descriptive data for Japanese patents.

Fortunately, the application year of each patent is available from the JPO website. However, the

priority date of these patents is unavailable.

       * – These IPC classes are included to capture general fluidized bed combustion patents.
           Fluidized bed combustion has its own five digit theme code (3K064). These cannot
           be downloaded separately from the Japanese patent database, as the remainder of
           the F-term is needed for downloading. However, the corresponding IPC classes can
           be downloaded, and are included in the data used in the paper.
