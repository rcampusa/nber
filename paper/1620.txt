                      Educational Achievement in
                      Segregated School Systems:
                            The Effects of
                         "Separate—But—Equal"


                               ABSTRACT




        Educational   achievement in segregated school systems was
considerably lower in the black schools than in the white
schools. Economic historians have argued that the racial
achievement gap reflected the discriminatory funding of the black
schools. This paper assesses counterfactually the historical
effects of a "separate—but—equal" policy of educational finance.
Using cross—sectional data from 1930 and 1940, I estimate race—
specific educational production functions. Eliminating race
differences in inputs supplied by school boards explains 40—50
percent of the racial achievement gap, depending on how
achievement is measured. The remainder appears to reflect the
impact of family background on achievement, of which the most
important effect was adult black illiteracy, a legacy of slavery
and educational backwardness in the late 19th century. The paper
also shows how school boards' marginal valuation of black
achievement can be recovered from the production function
estimates. Compared to preferences that would have led them to
voluntarily practice equality, Southern school boards judged
black   achievement to be worth roughly half the value they placed
on white achievement.

     Th historical indictment of segregated schools enjoys a
widespread consensus. No matter how the nominal attributes of
school systems are measured, few would question that black
children in the South received educations inferior to their white

counterparts during the segregation era.' Less clear is how these
differences in the quality of schooling were translated into the
equally large racial gaps in achievement levels. Numerous
studies, some dating from the early 20th century, attest to the
superior performance by white children on standardized tests,
age—in—grade distributions, and other measures of educational
achievement. But can these differences be traced to the
discriminatory funding of the black schools, or are other factors
primarily responsible?

     The point of departure for this study is a recent paper by
James Smith (1984) analyzing the role of human capital in the
historical evolution of black—white income differences. Blacks
emerged from slavery overwhelmingly illiterate. Literacy rates
among black children rose over time, however, as each successive

cohort remained in school until later ages.        In 1890, for
example, 39.8 percent of black children aged 10—14 were unable to
read or write; by 1930, illiterates numbered only 5.3% of the
same age group.

     In contrast, the racial gap in incomes narrowed at a much
slower pace, in part because race differences in mean educational

attainment remained relatively large until recent decades.2 But



                               1
Smith (p. 692) also conjectured that high rates of adult black
illiteracy, "which [serve] as a crude proxy for family
background, may indicate why advances in the relative market
earnings of blacks were initially so slow." Smith did not
elaborate further on the intergenerational effects of family
background, but one possible conduit was the schools.        The

positive effects of parental schooling and income on the
educational achievement of children are well documented in modern

studies of educational production (Hanushek, 1972; Summers and
Wolfe, 1977) Given the low relative incomes and schooling levels
of black parents in the early 20th century South, a policy of
"equal educational opportunity," narrowly defined to include only
inputs supplied by school boards, may have had only a small
impact on the racial gap in educational achievement.
     This paper presents econometric evidence that strengthens
the traditional indictment of segregated schools, but also
provides for a significant historical role for family background

effects in educational production. Using data from Alabama for
1930 and 1940, I estimate county—level, race—specific educational
production functions. The production function paramaterS are
then used to simulate the historical effects of a "separate—but—

equal" policy of educational finance.   Depending on the measure

of achievement, eliminating race differences in the inputs
supplied by Alabama school boards accounts for 40—50 percent of
the racial gap in educational output. On this evidence, then,
the effects of educational discrimination in segregated school
systems were far from trivial, but they also were not large



                                2
enough to fully account for the racial achievement gap.

       The county—level data are inadequate for addressing the
separate impacts of adult illiteracy and educational
discrimination on achievement, however, and a higher level of
aggregation——state—level data——is required. Cross—sectional
regressions for 1930 also reveal significant effects of
educational discrimination on child literacy rates (ages 10—14),

thus providing some additional support for Robert Higgs' (1984,
p. 8) contention that "the attainment of [black] literacy was
slower than

         -                             non—iscrimint-rv

But children of illiterate parents were at a marked disadvantage
compared to the offspring of literates. Holding constant other
factors, the elasticity of child literacy with respect to adult
literacy was close to one for both races. Black children had
fewer years of schooling before age 10 if their parents were
illiterate, and regardless of race, children of illiterate
parents attended poorer quality schools.
      The production function estimates also shed light on the
racial attitudes and behavior of Southern school boards. Recent
work in labor economics stresses the interactions among parental

preferences, child "endowments't, and the allocation of resources
within   households toward investment in human capital {Behrman,
Pollak, and Taubman, 1982] Similar issues arise in considering
the   allocation of resources in segregated school systems. One
cannot   conclude a riori that school boards valued black
achievement less if they devoted fewer dollars to black students,

if the productivity of school board inputs were lower in the



                                3
black schools. Section V of the paper shows how these relative
valuations can be recovered from the production function
estimates. Alabama school boards ca. 1930—40 appear to have
judged black literacy to be worth far less than white literacy,
roughly half the relative valuation that would have led to them

to practice racial equality in allocating school board budgets.
Shifts in racial attitudes of school boards appear to explain the

changing racial gap in school board supplied inputs during the
1930s.




                                II.




      Since   their inception, state boards of education in the
South, like their counterparts elsewhere in the country, have
issued annual reports. Although their level of detail varies
greatly, the repQrts constitute an important and underutilized
data source.      The Alabama reports for 1930 and 1940 are
particularly valuable. In addition to detailed, race—specific
county—level information on the characteristics of segregated
school systems, they also contain race—specific figures on
literacy rates, ages 7—20.            Similar data are generally
unavailable for other Southern states, except as state averages
for   a somewhat different age group (e.g. ages 10—14, 15—19).
      Modern studies of educational production typically measure
achievment by standardized test scores or the change in test

                                  4
scores over a well—defined time period, and pupil—specific data

are preferred to school or dstrict averages [Summers and Wolfe,
1977].    Although race—specific studies of test scores exist for
the early 20th century [Bond, 1934, pp. 331—357] the results are
highly aggregated, limited to a small number of school districts,
and not directly comparable to modern studies. More to the
point, the micro—data necessary for such an analysis do not exist
in any readily accesible form. This paper treats the county as
the unit of observation (the lowest level of aggregation
available in the published data) and uses county averages as
dependent and independent variables.
     Three   race—specific proxies for achievement are examined in
this paper. The first, LQ1, is the literacy rate of children and
young adults, ages 7—20. This variable is not specific to the
public   schools, but the bias is probably small.3 The second and
third are, respectively, the ratio of second to first graders
(LQ2) and the share of second through six graders in total
elementary  schoo enrollment (LQ3).4 According to Finis Welch
[1973, p. 59]:
          In examining the data of the Negro schools, the most
    striking dimension is the extraordinarily high ratio of
     first to second graders. If all students complete at least
     the second grade, and if there is no growth in total en—

     rollinent ...   then the ratio of enrollment of first to
     second graders is the time required to complete the se-
     cond. Since the second grade cannot be completed in less
     than one year, we can assume that on average a Negro stu—



                                   5
    dent took at least two years to com'ilete the first grade

     between 1920 and 1940.

Under te assumptions stated by Welch, LQ2 is the first grade
promotion rate, or the inverse of the first grade retention
ratio. Although these assumptions appear to have been violated in

practice (see the discussion in Section III), it is nevertheless
clear that high values of LQ2 (and LQ3) are consistent with high
levels of achievement and low values with low levels of
achievement [Welch, 1973, p. 59].
     The educational production function literature suggests
three types of inputs: student time, inputs supplied by the
school board, and family background. Student time is proxied by
the average days attended per pupil enrolled in the elementary
grades (LDAYS).S Estimates of days attended for first graders, or

a more cumulative measure, such as years of prior schooling, are
not available at the county level. Inputs supplied by the county
board are proxied by three variables: teacher salaries per pupil
enrolled in the elementary grades (LPPED); the value of the
school capital stock per pupil (LVCPP); and the proportion of
one—teacher schools (PiTS). School capital was presumably valued

at historical cost; the estimates exclude privately—owned
buildings used for school purposes, which was particularly common

in the black schools. For these reasons, the measurement error
in LVCPP is likely to be considerable, and caution should be
exercised in interpreting the coefficients of this variable.
LPPED and LVCPP are deflated to 1930 dollars using the implicit
price deflator for state and local government expenditures



                                6
[U.S. Department of Commerce, 1975, p. 198].

     Regressions   are also reported in which LDAYS and LPPED are
divided into two components. The components of LDAYS are the
average daily attendance rate (LATTR), and the average number of
days schools were open (LLT). The components of LPPED are the
average daily teacher salary (LDS), and the teacher—pupil ratio
(LCS). LDS isa proxy for teacher quality: analysis of teacher
salaries in the early 20th century South reveals significant
positive associations between the daily wage and teachers' human

capital characteristics, regardless of race Margo, 1984]. All of
the school board inputs should be positively related to the three

achivement proxies, excpt PiTS, which should be negatively
related.

     The number of family background that could potentially be
entered in the regressions is limited. Adult illiteracy, for
example, could not be included because county—level data for 1930

and 1940 are unavailable.6 The principal family background
variable is race, since the regressions are estimated separately
by race. An attempt was made, however, to construct race—
specific   measures of per capita       income. Actual income data are
available   only with the 1950 census, and any algorithm for
constructing estimates for earlier years is necessarily crude.
The estimates employed in this paper are based on weights derived

from the 1950 census breakdown for Alabama of race—specific
incomes by urban, rural—farm, and rural—non—farm status, adjusted
for family size, and applied to the 1930 and 1940 population
distributions within counties.7 Because of the potential for

                                    7
measurement error, the income coefficients reported in this paper

are   probably biased towards ero.
        The limitations of the data are numerous. The aggregate
nature    of the inputs obscures their heterogeneity within
counties.    The current value of school board inputs may be a poor

proxy for the actual quality of schooling if educational change
is rapid, or if inter—county migration of school—age children is

high.    For both reasons, the coefficients of school board inputs
and student time may be biased towards zero.8 On the other hand,

the  omission of family background variables other than race and
income may bias the school board input coefficients upwards if
the left—out variables are positively correlated with both school
board inputs and achievement.9 Without detailed pupil—specific
data and a much richer list of inputs and family background
variables, it is impossible to determine the relative magnitude
of these biases.
        Table 1 exhibits the race—specific arithmetic sample means
by decade. For the purposes of the regression analysis, all of
the   independent variables (except PiTS) and LQ2 are measured in
logs, and LQ1 and LQ3 are expressed in logit form.        The figures

in    brackets are the sample means of the transformed variables.
        Educational   outputs and inputs in the white schools exceeded

their respective levels in the black schools in both years. In
1930, for example, the white literacy rate exceeded the black
literacy rate by 16 percentage       points, and white children could
apparently    complete the first grade in only 63 percent of the
time required by the        average black child.    In both years the


                                     8
racial gap in per pupil expenditures and the school capital stock
were much larger than the racial gap in the length of the school
year or class sizes.

     Achievement and inputs rose regardless of race during the
Depression. The rise in the white first grade promotion rate is
especially marked, and may be biased upwards (see Section III).
The mean race differences in literacy, school term lengths and
daily teacher salaries fell over the decade, while the racial gap
in the per pupil value of the school capital stock increased.
Perhaps the most important change in the black schools was the
increase in mean days attended in the elementary grades.
Assuming he attended the additional days each years, a black
pupil age 12 in school continuously since age 6 would be about a
grade further along in 1940 than in 1930.10




                              III.



    The regression results are shown in Tables 3 through 5. The
regressions were estimated separately for each race, pooling the
data across decades to increase sample size, and including year
dummies for 1940.11

    Days attended was positively related to the three
achievement proxies regardless of race, but the coefficients were

statistically significant only in the LQ1 and LQ2 (white)
regressions. As pointed out in Section II, LDAYS may be a poor
proxy for the student time input, since it is not a cumulative



                               9
measure of school attendance. Decomposition of LDAYS in LATTR and
LLT demonstrates that the 1enth of the school year was a highly
significant determinant of achievement, as Welch [1973, p. 58
conjectured. Within the observed sample range, however, variation

in attendance rates were generally insignificant.
     Achievement was positively and significantly related to
expenditures on teacher salaries regardless of race.
Decomposition of LPPED into LDS and LCS shows that both variables

generally had similar effects on achievement. Evidently the
quality of teaching staffs and class sizes——factors often
stressed by school superintendents and educational historians——
were important determinants of achievement among children of both
races.

     The Impact of the school capital stock proxies on
achievement is unclear. Among black students, the per pupil
value of the school capital stock exhibited a significant
positive effect on literacy and the share of elementary students

beyond the firs.t grade, but was insignificantly (though
positively) related to the first grade promotion rate. In the
white regressions, increases in LVCPP significantly raised the
first grade promotion rate and the share of elementary students
beyond the first grade but had no effect on child literacy. In

none of the regressions did an increase in the proportion of one—
teacher schools significantly reduce achiveinent, although the
coefficient was the correct sign (negative) in 10 of 12 cases.
Welch (1973, p. 59) suggested that "discipline would have
consumed a significant proportion of instructional time and



                               10
energy" in one—teacher schools, but it rny be that the mixing of
students from different grades benefitted younger children, whose
performance     is chiefly recorded in    the achievement proxies
considered    in this paper.
        Although the per capita income elasticities are positive as
expected, they are generally insignificant, except in the
literacy    regressions. The lack of significance of income in the
LQ2 and LQ3 regressions is puzzling,    but may simply    reflect the
crudeness   of the procedure used to generate the income estimates
rather than the absence of an underlying relationship. The
positive and significant effect of per capita income on child
literacy may, in part, be capturing the intergenerational impact
of adult illiteracy on achievement    (see Section IV).
        What was the   effect of educational discrimination on the
racial achievement gap in Alabama? Answering this question
requires a definition of "separate—but—equal". For the purposes
of this paper I define "equality" to be a reduction in the racial
gap in school board inputs to zero in any particular year.'2
Given    this definition the percentage of the (mean) achievement
gap that is "explained" by the (mean) race differences in school
board inputs simulates the counterfactual impact of a "separate—
but—equal" policy of educational finance. These percentages are
shown in Table 6, along with the percentages of the race—specific
changes in achievement over the 1930s that are accounted for by
race—specific changes in school board inputs.     All calculations
are   based on the regressions with LDAYS and LPPED; the
conclusions   are unaffected if the regressions with LLT, LDS, and



                                 11
LCS are used. The across—race figures outside the brackets are
based on the white regressim coefficients, ard the figures in
brackets are based on the black coefficients.13
     Recent historical work on teacher salaries [Margo, 1984; see

also Butler, 1983] demonstrates that 75—85 percent of the racial

gap in daily teacher wages in the early 20th century South cannot
be explained by race differences in teachers' human capital
characteristics or local labor market variables. Assuming that
this unexplained wedge represents wage discrimination against
black teachers, it would be incorrect to raise the salary scale
in the black schools to the white level when measuring the impact
of educational discrimination on student achievement. The early

20th century wage data may yield inappropriate conclusions for
the 1930s, however, and I arbitrarily assume that 50 percent of
the racial salary gap in Alabama was a discriminatory wedge. To
the extent that this figure is too small, the effects of
"separate—but—equal"shown in Table 6 are biased upwards.
    Regardless of how it is measured, the racial achievement gap
would have been narrowed by a considerable amount if "separate—
but—equal" had been enforced. The historical relevance of this
conclusion can be gauged by considering the case of child
literacy. In 1930, 77 percent of Alabama's black children (ages

7—20) were literate; under equality, black literacy would have
risen to 88 percent, the level recorded in 1940.
     In the absence of left—out variables and other specification

or measurement errors that change over time, the across—race
percentages should be similar in both years, and should also be



                               12
comparable to the across—decade percentages (within race).l4
This statement is approximately true for the black percentages
but not the white percentages. The discrepancies are especially

large in the LQ2 and LQ3 calculations, particularly for whites.
This suggests that a significant fraction of the improved
achievement over the 1930s cannot be explained by changes in the

inputs included in the regressions, an interpretation also
indicated by the highly significant, and relatively large decadal
dummies.15Some of the rise over time in the white first grade
promotion rate, however, may be spurious. Evidence for North
Carolina from 1930    suggests that first grade promotion rates
estimated from contemporaneous first and second grade
enrollments (i.e. Welch's procedure) are biased upwards relative
to the true promotion rate as the estimated rate approaches
unity. Adjusting the Alabama white promotion rates for the
probable margin of error implied by the North Carolina data,
however, still leaves most of the differences in the white
percentages unexplained.16 In light of this finding, the black
percentages provide a better indication of the relative impact
of educational discrimination on the racial achievement gap.

       The upshot of this discussion is that somewhat less than
half   of the racial achievement gap in Alabama ca. 1930—40 can be
explained by race differences in school board inputs. While the
effects of educational discrimination thus appear to have been
considerable, the majority of the racial achievement gap remains
unaccounted for. Although it would be wrong to attribute the
residual entirely to the effects of family background (some part,


                                13
for example, is due to race differences in attendance rates and

unmeasured school board inpu:s) such an interpretation is clearly
suggestve.l7 The next section examines the impact of one such
family background variable——adult illiteracy——on achievement,
through an analysis of state—level data on child literacy rates.


                                Iv



     This   section uses state—level data for 1930 to explore the
relationship between child and adult illiteracy, a linkage that
could not be examined in the county—level regressions due to a
lack of data on adult illiteracy. The sample consists of 17
states (plus Washington, D.C.) for which race—specific data on
school board inputs could be obtained.
     The dependent variable is the logit transformation of the
race—specific literacy rate, ages 10—14. The student time input
is proxied by an estimate of the average years of schooling
potentially received between the ages of 6 to 9, adjusted for
differences across states in school term lengths (LAYRS). This
indicator of student time improves upon days attended, since it
captures cumulative exposure to schooling before achievement
(literacy) was measured.'8 In addition, the available state—
level data on days attended pertain to public school students at
all levels, and may be a poor measure of student effort in the
acquisition of basic literacy. School board inputs are
expenditures on teacher salaries per pupil (LEXPP), and the per
pupil value of the school capital stock (LPP), both in 1930



                                14
dollars. LAYRS, LEXPP, and LPP are measured in logs. Adult
illiteracy is captured by LITLA, the log of the adult illiteracy
rate, aces 35 and up. The regression results are shown in Table
seven.

     The effect of years of schooling on child literacy is
positive as expected, and in view of the small sample size,
should be judged significant, especially for blacks. Expenditures
per pupil also exhibits significant positive coefficients,
although the magnitude of its impact appears to have been less
than years of schooling for both races. The per pupil value of
the school capital stock is insignificant in every case, and
fails to display consistently positive coefficients.   As in the
county—level regressions, the interpretation of this variable is
questionable, and measurement error may be a serious problem.

     Adult illiteracy had a highly significant negative effect on
child literacy regardless of race. The coefficients imply only a
slight amount of regression towards the mean, ceteris paribus:
evalutated at the sample mean probabilities, the elasticities of

child literacy with respect to adult illiteracy are —0.85 for
whites and —0.94 for blacks. Controlling for adult illiteracy
substantially reduces the impact of years of schooling on black
child literacy, but has little effect on the white coefficient.
On the other hand, including adult illiteracy decreases the
effect of per pupil expenditures on child literacy to a much
greater degree among whites than blacks. Using the formula for
specification error bias (Theil, 1971, p. 548), the elasticities
of LAYRS and LEXPP with respect to adult illiteracy can be



                              15
calculated (see Table 8).      Evidently children of illiterate

parents, especially whites,   attended poorer quality schools, and

among blacks, adult illiteracy significantly reduced years of
schooling prior to age ten.
     Following the same procedure as in the county—level case,
approximately one—third of the mean racial literacy gap can be
explained by race differences in school board inputs, somewhat
less than in Alabama alone. On the other hand, were there no
race differences in adult illiteracy, the regression coefficients

imply   that the racial achievement gap would have been eliminated
entirely.'9 The constant terms, which are analagous to total
factor productivity effects, are the source of this ambiguity.
Since there is no good historical reason to believe that total
factor productivity was higher in the black schools (indeed,
there   are good reasons to believe the opposite——see Section V) a

strong possibility is that the census literacy rates for black
children may be biased upwards relative to whites.2O If such a

bias were large enough to equalize the constant terms across the
regressions, the percentage of the racial achievement gap
accounted for race differences in adult illiteracy would fall to

60 percent.
        In sum, the regressions strongly suggest that an
interenerational linkage between adult and child literacy
existed in the early 20th century South.2' Adult illiteracy
influenced achievement directly by lowering the productivity of
school board inputs. But the indirect effects were also
substantial: adult illiteracy reduced family income (Smith, 1984)



                                16
and poverty affected achievement indirectly by reducing the
quantity (and presumably the quality) of school board inputs, and
by   lowering the student time input, particularly among blacks.


                                    V.


     The evidence that Southern school boards allocated fewer
resources to black students is overwhelming. On such evidence
one cannot conclude, however, that school officials necessarily
valued black achievement less than white achievement. This
section shows how the relative (marginal) valuation of black
schooling can be recovered from the production function estimates.
      The model of school board behavior I consider is similar in
spirit to recent models of the allocation of resources within
families    [Behrrnan, Pollak, and Taubman, 1982]. The school board
allocates its budget to maximize a social welfare functionV(nh

nbhb) where n1 and h are, respectivly, race—specific enrollment
and achievrnent, i=w,b. Educational achievement is a function of

school board inputs, family background, and student time; the
latter two inputs are supressed in the following analysis. The
school board budget is assumed to be exogenously determined.
      For the case of a single school board input (s1)         the

board's   maximization problem may be    written:



                     Max      V(nhJs), nbhb(b))
                    Sw ,S b




                                   17
                       s.t. nps +        flbPbSb   Z




where   p. is   the race—specific input price, and z is the school

board's budget.
     The first—order conditions are:



                   MV(b)/MV(w) = MP(w)/MP(b)       x p/p

where MV(i) and MP(i) are, respectively, the race—specific
marginal valuation of achievement, and the marginal product of
the school board input. The school board allocates its budget so

that at the optimum, the relative marginal valuation of black
achivement equals the white/black ratio of marginal products,
multiplied by the black/white ratio of input prices.22

     Suppose that =        p   .   Even if the school board were to
follow a "separate—but—equal" policy, MP(w)>MP(b) because of race
differences in family background and the student time input.    If,

however, sw>Sb by.a sufficiently large amount, then IP(w)<MP(b)
and black achievement will be valued less than white achievement.

Thus in the absence of race differences in the price of school
board inputs, a necessary, but not sufficient condition for the
board to value white above black achievement is sw>Sb. The
existence of wage discrimination in the teacher market, however,
strongly suggests that Pb<Pw. In this case the white/black ratio
of actual marginal products is an upper bound on the relative
value placed on black achievement.
     The   enpirical application of this model proceeds in three


                                    13
stages. I first calculate the white/black ratio of marginal
products assuming that "se,arate.butequal" holds; call this
ratio    r(e). I next calculate the white/black ratio of marginal
products at the actual sand 5b; call this ratio r(a). The final
step    is to calculate r(a)/r(e): this ratio measures the extent to
which actual school board preferences deviate from a hypothetical
set of preferences that would have led school boards to choose a
"separate—but—equal" policy. The closer is r(a)/r(b) to zero, the
more racist are the attitudes of the school board. Furthermore,
i-   t-h v1r t-h,t- ,-(         i-in rvr    F4m   nrl   r('/r(P ws

constant    or rising, it follows that the relative valuation of
black   achievement was increasing as well.23
        Table 9 displays some illustrative calculations of the
relative valuation of black literacy by Alabama school boards
based on this approach, for two school board inputs: class sizes
and school term lengths.24 Several aspects of Table 9 merit
comment.     First, the figures do little to change the view that
Southern school, boards undervalued black achievement.           On

average, the acquisition of literacy among black children ca.
1930—40 was worth only half the value attached to white literacy

by Alabama school boards, compared to the hypothetical case of
"separate—but—equal". Second, had the school boards followed a
"separate—but—equal" policy, the marginal product of school board
inputs would have been higher in the white schools than the black
schools, as indicated above. Furthermore, the relative
efficiency    of the white schools apparently increased (e.g. from
1.28 to 1.56) during the Depression. The racial gap in child

                                 19
literacy, however, was larger in 1930 than in 1940. Under the
usual production function asumptions, the greater the initial
racial  3chievernent gap, the relatively more productive would
school board inputs have been if employed in the black schools.
As the racial achievement gap narrowed, the importance of other
factors in educational production, such as family background,
loomed larger, and the relative efficiency of the white schools
increased.

      Third, the white/black ratio of actual marginal products
rose over the decade.       Since part of this rise reflects the
increased relative efficiency of the white schools, school boards
must have valued black achievement higher in 1940 than in 1930.
Such a shift in preferences is clearly suggested by the sharp
rise in the black/white ratio of school term lengths (0.77 to
0.95), but not by the apparent constancy of the black/white ratio

of class sizes. The failure of the latter to rise, however, may
be due to the increase in elementary enrollment in the black
schools over the, decade (see footnote 14); elsewhere [Margo,
1982bJ I have shown that teacher—pupil ratios in the black
schools were negatively related to enrollment growth, at least in
the short run. In sum, shifts in school board preferences appear
to   explain the changing racial gap in school board inputs in
Alabama during the 1930s.


                                 VI.



      This paper has presented an econometric analysis of



                                 20
educational achievement in segregated school systems. Historians
have long argued that Southern school officials greatly
discriminated against black children, and that educational
achievement in the black schools would have been higher had
"separate but equalt' been reality instead of myth. The evidence
in this paper provides support for this conclusion, but also
shows   that family background, particularly adult illiteracy, was
a critical determinant of educational achievement. Without
rewriting history, black children could not avoid this particular
1o,ru rf z1,vpri       1rv thr nmin,tpd f-hp 1h-r market
experience of their parents until recent decades.
      The paper also shows how the racial attitudes of school
officials——in particular, their relative valuation of black
literacy——can be recovered from the educational production
function   coefficients. Compared to preferences that would have
led   them to voluntarily practice equality, Alabama school boards
valued black literacy at roughly half the value attached to white
literacy, somewliat higher in 1940 than in 1930.        The 1940s
witnessed a war, massive black migration out of the South and to

urban  areas, rising black incomes and schooling levels among
black parents, and a quantum leap in black protest and court
activity eventually culminating in Brown, and a pronounced
narrowing in the racial gap in school board inputs (Freeman,
1972). The linkages between these various events, school board
preferences and behavior, and educational achievement are
important topics for future reseach.

                            FOOTNOTES



1. There is a large literature on historical aspects of racial
discriminationin segregated school systems. See, for example,
Bond [1934, 1939]; Harlan [1958], Welch [1973], Freeman [1972],
Kousser [1980], and Margo [1982].

2. The mean race difference in educational attainment was more
than three years (for males) as late as the 1916—1920 birth
cohort; see Smith (1984, Table   4,   p. 688).

3. Although precise figures are unavailable, private school
enrollment was less than 15% of public school enrollment during
the 1930s. Furthermore, the vast majority of private school
students were enrolled in the upper level elementary grades and
in high school.

4. Elementary grades (according to Alabama school law Ca. 1930—
1940) are grades one through six.

5. In the literacy and LQ3 regressions it would be desirable to
proxy student time by the average days attended per elementary
school age child. Unfortunately, county—level data on the
proportion of children of elementary school age (e.g. ages 6—14)
in school are unavailable for both years (but see footnote 14).

6. Prior to 1920, the census reported county—level data on adult


                                 22
illiteracy for males ages 21 and over.     In 1920 and 1930, the
only data reported at the county level pertain to illiterates
ages 10 and over.



7. Specifically, the weights are: white urban, 3.89; white rural
non—farm, 1.58; white rural farm, 1.00; black urban, 1.65; black
rural non—farm, 0.671; black rural farm, 0.350. An alternative

procedure    is to apply race—specific income weights to the
occupation distributions reported in the 1930 and 1940 censuses.
Unfortunately, the 1q60 ensiis is f-he earl jest source providing
sufficient detail to construct such weights (for Alabama).

8.Adownward bias wouldalsoariseif, asargued byBond (1934,
p. 349), the   average ability of children in school fell as the
proportion   enrolled increased, and if the proportion enrolled
rose with increases in school quality.


9. This problem, is akin to the familiar simultaneity bias
potentially present in any production function study.    Suppose,
for the sake of argument, that an increase in parental schooling

raised the efficiency of school board inputs, but parental
schooling was unobserved by the econometrician. To the extent
that better educated parents demand more school board inputs, the

resulting increase in achievement will be assigned to school
board inputs, although some part is clearly due to the effects of

superior family background (i.e. parental schooling). Since the
major purpose of this paper is to establish the historical



                               23
presence of family background effects in segregated schools, an
upper bound measure of the impact of school board inputs on
achieveent is desirable.            Furthermore, to the extent that
unmeasured inputs, including family background, change over time,
an informal specification test is to compare the relative
importance    of school board inputs in accounting for cross—
sectional race differences in achievement versus within—race
changes in achievement over time (see the text, pg.12 ).


10. The increase in mean days attended per black pupil was 28
days (see Table 2). Therefore, a black child entering the first
grade in the late 1930s and attending continuously for six years
would, on average, receive 6 x 28 days= 168 days more schooling
than a child entering first grade in the late 1920s. Since the
average length of the black school year in 1940 was 140 days, the
child would be 168/140=1.2 years further along, or approximately

one grade.


11. Ordinary least squares was used (and to estimate the state—
level regressions; see Section IV). The substantive results of
the paper are not affected if the dataare weighted in the manner
suggested by Theil (1971, p. 636).


12. This is not the only definition of "separate—but—equal" but
it is a plausible one historically. Alternatively, one could
define "equality" in terms of outcomes. Let d(a) be the actual
race difference in school board inputs and d(e) the difference



                                     24
between the level of inputs required in tile black schools to
insure achievement equal to .he white level, and the actual level
of    blac" inputs. The impact of educational discrimination is then
measured by the ratio r(e)=d(a)/d(e). To see this, suppose that
only    school board inputs matter; then d(e)=1 by definition and
r(e)=1. As the relative importance of school board inputs
diminishes with respect to family background, d(e) becomes
larger, and r(e) approaches zero.


13. Let dQ be the mean race difference in achievement. Then the
importance of educational discrimination is measured by BdX/dQ
or BbdX/dQ, where B is the vector of race—specific regression
coefficients    and dX is the vector of mean race differences in
school board inputs. School board inputs are: LLT, LEXPPD,
LVCPP, and PiTS. The coefficient of LDAYS is used to measure the

impact of school term lengths; thi              follows   from   the
decomposition   LDAYS = LATTR + LLT (all variables in logs).



14. This statement follows directly from the linear specification
of the regressions.



15. As pointed out in footnote 5, county—level data on the
proportion   of the   elementary school age population in school are

unavailable for both years.      State—level data on the proportion
enrolled ages 6—14 show an increase for blacks over the decade
fron    74.8 percent to 83.1 percent; the corresponding figures for
whites    are 86.7 percent and 88.8 percent. The white enrollment


                                  25
figures mask, however, considerable reallocation of enrollment
across elementary grades a:d into high school. Accounting for
these   cmposition changes in the white regressions and enrollment

growth in the black regressions would substantially reduce the
magnitude of the decadal dummies in the LQ2 and LQ3 regressions.

It should also be noted that the decadal dummies in the LQ2 and
LQ3 regressions are not independent. To see this, suppose that
p, the promotion rate, does not vary across elementary grades (1—
                   5.     5
6).   Then LQ3=(p1 )/(l÷ p) by definition, and d(LQ3)/dp>0.
               i=1     i=1
16.   County—level data are available for North Carolina in 1930
on first grade enrollments, and the number of first graders
actually promoted to the second grade (State Superintendent of
Public Instruction, State of North Carolina, 1930). Let LQ2(e)

represent the estimated promotion rate (second graders/first
graders) and LQ1(e) the true promotion rate.          The following
regressions were estimated on the North Carolina data:



         Blacks:        LQ2(t)= —0.18 + 0.71 LQ2(e)

                                (1.93) (3.17)



         Whites:        LQ2(t)= —0.36 ÷ 0.54 LQ2(e)    R2=0.30

                                (7.89) (6.26)


(Absolute value of t—statistics are shown in parentheses)
Assuming these regressions can be applied to the Alabama data,
the   increase in the mean white promotion rate (see Table 2) is
overstated by iS percentage points. For blacks the degree of



                                  26
upward bias is smaller (4 percentage points). Allowing for this
bias would approximately louble the within—race white LQ2
percentige (from 7.2% to 14.1%) and increase the within—race
black LQ2 percentage from 33.3% to 43.2% (see Table 6), but would
not    change the substantive results. These adjustments should be
viewed with considerable caution, however, as there is no
evidence that the North Carolina LQ2(t) regressions can be
applied to the Alabama data   in this manner.

17. As Table 2 makes clear, however, mean race differences in
average daily attendance rates were very small. Adjusting LDAYS
to take account of mean race differences in enrollment rates
(ages 6—14; see footnote 14) would explain between 2—10 percent
of    race differences in achievement, depending on   the year and
equation used.



18. LAYRS was constructed by summing     the state—level race and
age—specific   probabilities of school enrollment in 1930 from ages

6 to 9, and multiplying by LT/180, where LT is the race—specific
length of the school year in 1930.



19. Using the white adult illiteracy coefficient, closing the
racial gap in adult illiteracy explains 107.5 percent of the
racial gap in child literacy; using the black coefficient, the
percentage explained is 121 percent.


20. Cohort—specific literacy rates among blacks in the early



                                27
20th century show increases in litera'y as the cohort ages in
excess of what might be exj.ected on the basis of differential
nortality or adult education; see Smith (1984, P. 687, footnote

6).    According to Smith (1984, p. 687), "educational inflation"
reflects the "exaggeration of schooling accomplishments as
education norms in society rise," a point recognized rather
earlier in U.S. Department of Commerce (1918, p. 403).  The

possibility of upward bias in black schooling levels also applies
to the educational attainment data in the 1940 census; see Margo
           IL   iS i11LeLLifl LUaL       simiar race erences are
apparent    in the constant terms in the Alabama LQ1 and LQ2
regressions (see Tables 3 and 4); if the same explanation
applies, the LQ1 and LQ2 percentages in Table 6 are biased
upwards.


21. For an analysis of similar linkages in the 19th century
South, see Soltow and Stevens (1981, pp. 184—188).


22.    A similar model is presented in graphical form in Clotfelter
(1979,   p. 381).    Note that if    school boards value the future
earnings of children rather than achievement directly, the first—

order condition is:



            MV(b)/IV(w) =   e(w)/e(b)    x MP(w)/MP(b) x Pb/Pw



where e(i) is the race—specific returns to schooling. In this
case    MP(w)/MP(b) is   no longer an upper bound on MV(b)/MV(w),



                                    28
assuming that Pb<Pv.



23. Thse conclusions assume that Pb/P remains unchanged in
comparing actual school board behavior to the "separate—but—
equal" case. Furthermore, if pb/pu were falling over time, then
a rise in r(a)/r(e) could be attributed to changes in the demand
for school board inputs in the black schools in response to
changes in relative input prices. Conversely, a fall in
r(a)/r(e) might be due to a rise in Pb/P• In the Alabama case,
however the black/white ratio of daily teacher salaries rose 6%
during the 1930s (see Table 2), suggesting a roughly constant or
slightly rising Pb/Pw, and r(a)/r(e) was rising over time (see
Table 9).

24. The formula for calculating the race—specific marginal
products is:

                dL1/dx =                               i=w,b


where   L1   is the literacy rate, Xj) is the jth school board input,
and the B's are the logit coefficients. The derivation of the
formula is based on the logisitic probability function, and the
fact that dL/d(ln x jj) =        (dLj/dxj   )   x (l/xj )      [recall   that
school board inputs are entered into the regressions in logs]
All calculations of actual marginal products are made at the




                                  29
sample means.   In the "separate—but—equal" calculations L is the
predicted value of black literacy at the sample means of the
white shool board inputs.
