We analyze a comprehensive sample of more than 10,000 U.S. OTC stocks. We provide much
needed descriptive evidence on this market and show that the OTC market is a large, diverse, and
dynamic trading environment with a rich set of regulatory and disclosure regimes, comprising
venue rules and state laws beyond SEC regulation. We also exploit the institutional richness of
the OTC market and analyze two key dimensions of market quality, liquidity and crash risk,
across firms and regulatory regimes. We find that OTC firms that are subject to stricter regulatory
regimes and disclosure requirements have higher market quality (higher liquidity and lower crash
risk). Our analysis points to an important trade-off in regulating the OTC market and protecting
investors: Lowering regulatory requirements (e.g., for disclosure) reduces the compliance burden
for smaller firms, but also reduces market quality.

1.      Introduction

     Aside from its highly regulated traditional exchanges, the U.S. has a large OTC market in

which over 8,000 domestic stocks were publicly traded in 2010. For over 4,500 of these stocks, the

issuer is not an SEC registrant required to provide regular disclosure filings. OTC firms exempt

from federal securities laws are often referred to as “dark.” However, these firms are subject to

state corporate and state securities laws as well as trading venue-based rules requiring disclosures.

Thus, it may be more accurate to characterize the OTC market as a “twilight zone” with many

different regulatory regimes.

     There is little research on this market and, in particular, on the relation between its many

regulatory regimes and market quality. The OTC market generally offers less investor protection

than the traditional exchanges.1 As such, it provides an opportunity to study the trade-off securities

regulators face between their desire to create a viable market for small growth firms and their

charter to ensure investor protection and market integrity. This trade-off also featured prominently

in the discussion about the JOBS Act in 2012.2 The Act intends to lower the regulatory burden on

firms when they access public capital markets, so as to spur the creation of “emerging growth

firms.” One of its key provisions is to loosen ownership limits for SEC registration, which will

increase the number of unregistered OTC securities without SEC disclosures. In light of this

debate, it is important to understand existing regulatory regimes in the OTC market and, in

particular, the roles that SEC registration and disclosure regulation play in shaping market quality.

1
     Fraudulent and abusive practices are common in the OTC market. In 2011, state securities regulators conducted
     over 6,000 investigations and took over 2,600 enforcement actions, resulting in prison sentences, fines or penalties
     in excess of $290 million and more than $2.2 billion in investor restitution orders (NASAA, 2011). While not all
     cases pertain to the OTC market, the largest category is fraud involving unregistered securities.
2
     See, e.g., Coates’ (2011) testimony before Senate Subcommittee. There has also been substantial debate about the
     regulatory burden facing smaller firms after the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. For an overview, see Coates and
     Srinivasan (2014).
                                                                                                                       1
    The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, it provides much needed descriptive evidence on

the broad cross-section of firms trading in different OTC market venues, for instance, with respect

to entry, survival, venue changes, reporting status and trading activity. Towards this end, we

compile and examine a comprehensive sample of stocks trading in the venues that comprise the

OTC market. Second, regarding the aforementioned trade-off, we analyze the effect of OTC

regulatory regimes on market quality. We focus on two key aspects of market quality: liquidity and

crash risk. Both are closely related to core objectives of securities regulation, which are to improve

the functioning of securities markets and to ensure market integrity and investor protection (e.g.,

Goshen and Parchomovsky, 2006; Mahoney, 2009). Liquidity provision is a primary purpose of

securities markets. But concerns about market fairness could result in lower investor participation

and impair liquidity (e.g., Guiso et al., 2008). Similarly, opacity and market manipulation increase

risks to investors, e.g., by making stocks more prone to crashes (Jin and Myers, 2006), which in turn

could hurt trust in market fairness and investor participation.

    There are three venues in the OTC market: the Bulletin Board, the Pink Sheets and the Grey

Market. Bulletin Board firms have had to file with the SEC since the Eligibility Rule in 1999. The

other venues do not require SEC registration. However, until the JOBS Act, any publicly traded

firm with more than $10 million in assets and more than 500 record holders had to file with the

SEC.3 Thus, firms trading in the Pink Sheets or the Grey Market may be SEC filers and hence

provide regular disclosure. For SEC registrants, federal law preempts state regulation and hence

sets the relevant rules. For non-registrants, state corporate law and state securities law provide the

relevant rules for disclosure and registration. State corporate law, which depends on the state of


3
    Rule 12g5-1, Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Note that record holders are not beneficial shareholders. Many
    shares are held in street name by financial institutions, in which case the latter is the holder of record.
                                                                                                                  2
incorporation, may stipulate that shareholders receive financial statements, or can obtain them on

request. State securities laws (also called “blue sky” laws) require registration, which in most states

amounts to a “merit review” of the issuer. State securities laws apply at the trade level, i.e., in every

state where a firm sells securities to the public, as well as in the home state of the issuers. There is

little research on the capital-market effects of state securities regulation.4

    An important way in which firms can comply with state securities laws is to use the so-called

“manual exemption.” In 41 states and the District of Columbia, issuers are exempt from registration

and “blue-sky compliant,” if they appear in “a nationally recognized securities manual.” The

providers of manuals (e.g., Mergent, Standard & Poor’s) perform a basic review of documents

supplied by issuers, e.g., examine business description, corporate history and financial statements.

Manuals are published annually but frequent updates are available via print media and email. We

are not aware of any research on the effects of securities manual coverage on market quality.

    In addition to federal and state regulation, there are venue-based regimes. Aside from the

Eligibility Rule for the Bulletin Board, the Pink Sheets market operator (now called OTC Markets

Group) introduced several tiers and information labels in 2007, differentiating firms for which

current, limited and no information is available. It also created a “Caveat Emptor” label to flag

firms with public interest or fraud concerns. All tier designations and labels are monitored by the

Pink Sheets, and revised as firms’ information status changes. Again, there is limited research on

venue-based regimes (e.g., Bushee and Leuz, 2005; Jiang et al., 2015).

    Our sample consists of 10,583 domestic firms that trade in the OTC market from 2001 to 2010,


4
    An exception is the study by Agrawal (2013) analyzing the link between investor protection and corporate policy
    around the introduction of state securities regulation, which predates the SEC regime. State securities regulators
    have been protecting investors from fraud and abusive sales practices since the passage of the first “blue sky” law
    in Kansas in 1911 (e.g., Macey and Miller, 1991).
                                                                                                                     3
and are incorporated in the U.S., mostly in Delaware, Nevada, and Florida. The OTC market

consists primarily of micro-cap stocks, spanning a broad set of industries. The average market

value is about $52 million, but it is skewed by a few large firms with a capitalization exceeding $1

billion. Most firms have a market value below $20 million. The median share price is $1.01,

consistent with OTC firms being called “penny stocks.” About 17% of the sample firms enter the

OTC market because they delist from the traditional exchanges (“fallen angels”). But over 3,400

“new” firms appear in the OTC market between 2001 and 2010 without having been listed on an

exchange before. The latter finding is striking in light of the recent dearth of U.S. IPOs (e.g., Gao et

al., 2013; Doidge et al., 2015). However, less than 9% of the new OTC firms eventually trade up to

the traditional exchanges during our sample period.5 Even for these “rising stars,” the total return

over the sample period is often negative and on average merely 4% (annualized). Hence, our

analysis shows that the OTC market is not a breeding ground for growth firms that eventually

graduate to the traditional exchanges. At the same time, most OTC stocks survive for long periods

of time, even those delisted from the exchanges. The five-year survival rate is between 60% and

90%, and the median sample firm is quoted for 8.75 years. Thus, the OTC market is more than an

interim home for firms that are on their way out of the public markets.

    The stock return for OTC firms over the sample period is negative for a majority of firms. At

the same time, average monthly volatility is more than twice as high as the volatility of NASDAQ

Small Cap stocks. In addition, a substantial fraction of OTC stocks exhibit episodes of extreme

returns over the sample period (e.g., returns above 100% or below -95%). These findings are

consistent with Ang et al. (2013) and Eraker and Ready (2015). In general, trading activity is much

5
    One of these firms is NASDAQ, which traded on the Bulletin Board between 2002 and 2005. We describe the
    NASDAQ case along with various other examples in Appendix 2. Trading up to the exchanges is most common
    for banks, pharmaceuticals, biotech & health care firms, and oil & gas producers.
                                                                                                         4
lower than on the traditional exchanges. On average, the proportion of trading days is 40% across

all firm-months in the OTC market (i.e., Bulletin Board, Pink Sheets and Grey Market) and, on days

with trading, the average daily volume is only around $37,000. But, as with other characteristics,

there is substantial heterogeneity in the cross-section. For example, about 10% of OTC stocks trade

almost every day, while a quarter of them have zero volume on 95% of trading days. While OTC

trading activity is clearly low, benchmarking against NASDAQ, we find that the average Small Cap

stock does not trade every day (83%) and has an average daily trading volume of about $163,000.

    After this descriptive characterization of the OTC market, we analyze how OTC regulatory

regimes relate to market liquidity and crash risk, both in the cross-section and around regulatory

changes. An extensive body of theory links market liquidity to information asymmetry and adverse

selection in markets (e.g., Copeland and Galai, 1983; Glosten and Milgrom, 1985; Kyle, 1985;

Easley and O’Hara, 1987; Admati and Pfleiderer, 1988; Diamond and Verrecchia, 1991). Similarly,

information asymmetry between insiders and outsiders coupled with opacity about firm

fundamentals has been linked to negatively skewed returns and crash risk (Jin and Myers, 2006;

Hutton et al., 2009).6 Given the theoretical links, we expect disclosure regulation that enhances

transparency and reduces information asymmetries to increase liquidity and reduce crash risk.

    We use principal components analysis to construct proxies for liquidity and crash risk based on

two variables for each measure. Given the low trading activity in the OTC market, we use the

proportion of zero-return days and share turnover as input variables for our liquidity proxy. For

crash risk, we follow Chen et al. (2001) and Hutton et al. (2009) by using the negative skewness of

returns and a binary indicator for a 95% or greater decline in the stock price. To validate these

6
    Other mechanisms, such as short-sale constraints, can independently or in conjunction with opacity about
    fundamentals contribute to negative skewness and crash risk (e.g., Hong and Stein, 2003). See also Campbell and
    Hentschel (1992) and Kirschenheiter and Melumad (2002).
                                                                                                                 5
proxies, we provide evidence that our liquidity proxy is highly correlated with other commonly used

liquidity measures, and that our crash risk proxy increases when firms are subject to pump-and-

dump schemes.

    Starting with trading venue regressions, we find lower market liquidity and higher crash risk in

the OTC market than on the traditional exchanges. Moreover, both market quality proxies change

monotonically when moving from the Bulletin Board to the Pink Sheets to the Grey Market. The

decline in liquidity and increase in crash risk are consistent with a ranking of these venues in terms

of their information environment. Even more directly related to disclosure regulation, we show that

OTC firms that have to file 10-Ks and 10-Qs with the SEC have higher market liquidity and lower

crash risk. These results hold with firm fixed effects and, additionally, propensity matched SEC

and non-SEC filers. Similarly, OTC firms that are covered in Mergent’s or Standard & Poor’s

securities manuals exhibit higher liquidity and lower crash risk, though the latter relation is not

robust to firm fixed effects. At a minimum, the results show that investors recognize differences in

the information regimes across OTC stocks and trading venues. To further tighten identification,

we exploit venue transitions, ticker changes tied to changes in SEC filing status, and differential

regulatory oversight for financial institutions in order to provide evidence that the results are likely

attributable to the venues, the SEC disclosure regime and manual inclusion, rather than endogeneity

stemming from unobserved heterogeneity, changes in firm fundamentals or reverse causality.

    Next, we analyze the effects of differences in states’ blue sky laws. As state securities laws

generally rely on merit reviews by state regulators, the mechanism by which they affect markets is

less obvious than in the case of federal securities laws, which are based on a disclosure doctrine.

Firms’ registration filings with the state regulators are generally not easily accessible. Hence the


                                                                                                      6
information contained in these filings is unlikely to directly contribute to an increase in market

liquidity or a decrease in opacity-induced crash risk. However, merit reviews by state securities

regulators could contribute indirectly by screening out firms for which adverse selection and

concerns about investor protection are more severe. Consistent with this notion, we find that market

liquidity is higher for firms located in states with tougher merit review regimes, although the results

for crash risk are statistically and economically insignificant. To increase our confidence that the

liquidity results are indeed driven by differences in state securities regulation, we show that the

results are stronger in states that do not allow manual publication to substitute for state registration

and merit review. We also exploit changes in firms’ headquarters and show that the results continue

to hold with firm fixed effects.

    Turning to venue-based regulation, we analyze whether firms in higher Pink Sheets information

tiers exhibit higher market liquidity and lower crash risk, as disclosure theory would predict. Again

using firm fixed effects, we find that market liquidity (crash risk) increases (decreases)

monotonically from the lowest to the highest Pink Sheets tier. The Caveat Emptor label for stocks

with investor protection concerns is associated with lower liquidity and higher (future) crash risk.

To further tighten identification, we again exploit differential regulatory oversight for financial and

non-financial firms, and find that the results are present only for the less regulated non-financials.

This is consistent with the results being attributable to the Pink Sheets information tiers.

Furthermore, we exploit four regulatory changes in the Pink Sheets in order to perform a within-

firm, difference-in-differences analysis relative to the Bulletin Board. We show that market

liquidity (crash risk) increases (decreases) as the regulatory regime in the Pink Sheets becomes




                                                                                                      7
tighter. Following the implementation of these regulatory changes, market quality in the Pink

Sheets has essentially caught up with that in the Bulletin Board.

    Our paper makes several contributions to the literature. First, our study paints the most

complete picture of the U.S. OTC market to date. We create a novel dataset that allows us to make

distinctions within the OTC market in terms of trading venue, reporting status and regulatory

regimes. We provide extensive descriptive statistics on industry, location, state of incorporation,

market entry, survival, venue changes, and trading activity. Such descriptive evidence is important

considering how little is known about this market and its regulatory regimes.

    Second, we examine federal-, state-, and venue-specific regulatory regimes in the OTC market

and provide evidence on the link between these regimes and market quality. The OTC market is

often viewed as dark and unregulated but in fact there is a thicket of regulatory regimes. We exploit

this institutional richness to show that market quality increases with stricter disclosure regulation

and regulatory oversight. As such, our analysis points to an important trade-off in regulating the

OTC market and protecting investors: While lowering regulatory requirements (e.g., for disclosure)

reduces the compliance burden for smaller firms, it also significantly reduces market liquidity and

increases crash risk for investors.

    Two important papers, Ang et al. (2013) and Eraker and Ready (2015), also examine the OTC

market. Their analyses focus on asset pricing, stock returns, and investor preferences.7 Our study

adds to these studies by focusing on market quality and its link to previously unavailable trading

venue and regulatory distinctions for a much broader cross-section of firms. We provide a novel

crash risk analysis and our liquidity analysis contributes to a more nuanced understanding of

7
    There are a few other OTC market studies (Luft et al., 2001; Luft and Levine, 2004; Bushee and Leuz, 2005;
    Marosi and Massoud, 2007; Leuz et al., 2008; Bollen and Christie, 2009; Jiang et al., 2015). These studies have
    specific or smaller OTC samples, cover specific events and/or do not make venue and reporting status distinctions.
                                                                                                                    8
investor behavior in the OTC market, suggesting that investors recognize regulatory and

information differences across the OTC regimes and trade (or abstain from trading) accordingly.

      Our paper is also related to the international literature on legal institutions, investor protection

and equity market development, starting with La Porta et al. (1997, 1998). Work in this literature

demonstrates that disclosure requirements exhibit significant associations with other institutional

factors (e.g., investor protection, rule of law) and with various market outcomes (e.g., cost of

capital, size of the equity market, IPO activity, and market liquidity).8 However, the focus is on

countries’ main equity markets, which have extensive disclosure requirements and are populated by

much larger firms than those in our sample. Our findings from a much more opaque market are

therefore of relevance to the regulatory regimes of countries’ markets for younger firms.

      Lastly, we provide novel evidence on institutions in the OTC market, including state merit

reviews, manual exemptions, manual publications as well as Pink Sheets information tiers. We

know very little about these institutions, yet they govern trading for over 7,500 U.S. publicly traded

stocks that are not covered by federal securities laws at some point during our sample period.

2.       Regulatory regimes in the OTC market

      In this section, we introduce the regulatory regimes for quoting and trading securities in the

OTC market during the sample period (see Figure 1 and Appendix 1 for further institutional detail).

2.1      OTC trading venues: Bulletin Board, Pink Sheets and Grey Market

      The Penny Stock Act of 1990 mandated that the SEC create an electronic system for the OTC

market that displays quotes and last-sale information. The Bulletin Board (BB) opened in June


8
      See e.g., Hail and Leuz (2006), La Porta et al. (2006), Lang et al. (2012). See also Karolyi (2015) for an overview.
      As these studies rely mostly on cross-country variation, the identification of particular institutional factors (e.g.,
      the disclosure regime) is limited, and our results could not be inferred from these papers.
                                                                                                                          9
1990 and is currently operated and regulated by FINRA. It is an electronic interdealer quotation

system that transmits real-time quotes, trade prices and volume information to subscribing FINRA

market makers. The BB does not have any minimum size or corporate governance requirements. A

series of changes were made to the BB during the 1990s, culminating in the 1999 Eligibility Rule

(Bushee and Leuz, 2005). This rule states that issuers of securities traded on the BB have to file

current financial information with the SEC or other regulatory authorities (banking or insurance).

Therefore, in our sample, all BB firms provide disclosures to the SEC or other regulators.

     The second venue in the OTC market is widely known as the Pink Sheets, which are operated

by the OTC Markets Group.9 The Pink Sheets compete with the BB by providing an electronic

real-time quotation and execution system for OTC securities. Virtually all BB securities are now

also quoted and traded on the OTC Markets Group’s platform. 10 In addition, the Pink Sheets

provide an electronic real-time quotation and execution system for ineligible firms that do not file

regularly with the SEC and hence cannot be quoted on the BB by virtue of the Eligibility Rule.

     In August 2007, the Pink Sheets introduced a tier system to indicate the levels of financial

disclosure for companies quoted on its platform. This system was revised in 2010. It distinguishes

OTCQB and OTCQX firms, which are subject to SEC or regulatory reporting requirements (and

more), from OTC Pink firms, which have no SEC or equivalent reporting requirements. Firms in

the latter category are further divided into three tiers, Pink Current, Pink Limited and Pink No

Information, based on the level and timeliness of the information they provide to investors (see

Appendix 1.1 for more details). The Pink Sheets also apply a Caveat Emptor label and block quotes

     The market was first established in 1913 as the National Quotation Bureau (NQB). For decades, the NQB reported
     stock quotations via the paper-based Pink Sheets. The NQB changed its name to Pink Sheets LLC in 2000, to Pink
     OTC Markets in 2008, and adopted its current name, OTC Markets Group, in 2010. We use the term “Pink Sheets”
     as the market went by this name for most of our sample period and “Pink” is still used for one market segment.
10
     By October 2010, our dataset contains only eight BB securities that are not also quoted in the Pink Sheets.
                                                                                                                10
on its website when there are investor protection concerns about a company.

      Finally, the Grey Market contains firms that are not quoted in any market, i.e., no bid and ask

prices are available. However, trades in Grey Markets stocks may occur and, if so, are reported by

broker-dealers to their Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO).

2.2      OTC quoting and trading

      In order to quote and trade non-reporting OTC securities, broker-dealers have to rely on Rule

15c2-11 of the 1934 Exchange Act. This rule prescribes information review and maintenance

requirements for broker-dealer firms that publish quotations. Specifically, the rule prohibits a

broker-dealer from quoting unless it has obtained and reviewed current information about the issuer

that the broker-dealer believes is accurate and obtained from a reliable source.

      Such information can be a prospectus for a SEC registered security; an offering circular, the

most recent annual report as well as any quarterly report that has been filed after the annual report.

Moreover, the broker-dealer shall keep this information “reasonably” current, and make this

information “reasonably” available to a potential investor upon request. A broker-dealer may

initiate or resume quotations for an OTC security by filing Form 211 with FINRA.11 Rule 15c2-11

also includes a piggy-back exemption stating that a broker-dealer may begin quoting a security

without filing Form 211, provided another dealer has been publishing quotations for the security

with some frequency over the last 30 days. Hence, only one broker-dealer needs to file Form 211

for a particular security. Importantly, as broker-dealers can subsequently piggy-back on their own

quotations, non-reporting OTC firms do not have to provide regular disclosures to broker-dealers.


11
      The form certifies that the broker-dealer has satisfied all applicable requirements of SEC Rule 15c2-11 and the
      filing and information requirements of NASD Rule 6640. Rule 15c2-11 also contains an exception for quotations
      representing a customer’s unsolicited orders or indications of interest, provided there are adequate records.
                                                                                                                  11
2.3      OTC market regulation: State registration and manual exemption

      The Securities Act of 1933 requires that securities offered or sold to the public in the U.S. are

registered with the SEC. Once a firm’s Securities Act registration is effective, the Exchange Act of

1934 requires the firm to file reports with the SEC on a continuing basis unless the firm falls below

certain size and ownership thresholds.12

      However, issuers can avoid registering securities with the SEC by issuing securities under one

of several exemptions for limited circulation offerings.13 As long as an issuer using one of these

exemptions does not surpass the Exchange Act size and ownership thresholds, it does not have to

file reports with the SEC. These firms still face state laws and venue-based rules regulating

examinations of issuers, financial reporting and secondary trading. This section briefly describes

state securities laws (also called blue sky laws). Appendix 1.2 provides further details.

      State securities laws require registration of offers, sales of securities and of brokers and

investment advisors. Most states also assign liability for securities fraud. Historically, states

examined applications for registration, i.e., conducted merit reviews, to determine whether or not to

allow securities to be sold in the state. However, federal regulation exempts so called “federally

covered securities,” i.e., stocks of SEC registrants that are listed on national exchanges, from merit

reviews. As a result, merit reviews apply primarily to non-reporting OTC firms’ securities.

      To register with the state, applicants have to provide information to the state regulator similar

to what is required for registration under the 1933 Act. State securities registrations are usually


12
      A firm is exempt from SEC registration if it has fewer than 300 holders of record, or it has fewer than 500
      shareholders (of record) and less than $10 million in total assets for each of its last three fiscal years. The JOBS
      Act of 2012, which became effective after our sample period, raises the threshold to 2000 record holders and
      excludes employees and investors that obtain shares via crowd-funding from the definition.
13
      Examples are Rule 144A; Regulation S; the intrastate offering exemption (Section 3(a)(11)); Regulation A
      (Section 3(b)); Regulation D (Rule 504, 505, and 506) and the accredited investor exemption.
                                                                                                                      12
valid for one year only, and many states require the issuer to update the offering information

(prospectus including financial statements) periodically. However, the information filed with the

state securities regulator is used in the merit review, but typically not made publicly available in the

way SEC filings are made available on EDGAR.14 Anecdotal evidence suggests that it is difficult to

obtain registration filings even by visiting the state securities regulators’ offices in person. In fact,

less than half the states require that investors be furnished with a prospectus; even fewer

jurisdictions specify that the distributed prospectus should include recent financial statements.

     As long as the state securities registration is effective, secondary trading of the security is

allowed, provided the trades involve only residents of states where the security is registered. In

other words, if a trade involves investors from two states, the security has to be registered in both

states for the trade to be legal. In addition, issuers are typically required to register in the state of

their headquarters (home-state registration).                 Issuers have to renew their state securities

registration(s) on a regular basis for secondary trading to continue.

     The requirement to maintain effective registrations in multiple states is clearly a cumbersome

way to support secondary trading. Thus, issuers may seek to qualify for one of the exemptions to

state securities registration (see also Appendix 1.2). Perhaps the most effective way for a firm to

obtain an exemption from registering the securities in each state where investors may reside is to be

included in a nationally recognized securities manual (Manual Exemption). The providers of

manuals perform a basic review of a company’s business and its financial statements, and publish

this information in a standardized form. The two most prominent manuals are Mergent (previously

Moody’s) Manual and Standard & Poor’s Corporation Records, and 42 jurisdictions explicitly

14
     In addition, state corporation laws can require firms to provide financial statements to its owners on a regular basis
     or upon request. However, these laws apply at the level of the record holder and hence, to our understanding, do
     not lead to disclosure to beneficial owners or prospective shareholders. See Appendix 1.3 for more details.
                                                                                                                        13
recognize these two manuals when granting exemption from state securities registration.

3.      Data and sample

     Our sample is based by two data sources: a proprietary dataset provided by NASDAQ and

Datastream. The NASDAQ dataset includes the venue history of all equity securities that traded in

the OTC market or the NASDAQ Small Cap Market (SCM) at some point during the period

January 2001 through October 2010.15 Datastream provides capital market data (e.g., stock prices

and returns, market values, trading volume) and industry information for a large set of equity

securities around the world. 16 We match the NASDAQ venue history and Datastream via the

security identifier CUSIP and/or the company name resulting in an initial sample of 16,965 firms.

We eliminate firms that are incorporated outside the United States or file Form 20-F with the SEC.

Furthermore, we exclude REITs and firms whose securities are very rarely traded (see Table 1,

Panel A, for details). Our final sample consists of 10,803 firms.

     Since the NASDAQ venue history distinguishes only between the Bulletin Board (BB) and all

other segments (NBB) within the OTC market, we collect information on specific OTC segments

using two additional proprietary datasets provided by the OTC Markets Group. The first dataset

(PS venue history) allows us to identify firms that are dually quoted on the BB and Pink Sheets and

to distinguish Grey Market and Pink Sheets firms within the NBB. However, the PS venue history

covers a shorter period (February 2003 to October 2010) and includes fewer firms during this period

than the NASDAQ venue history (about 60% of BB/NBB). The second dataset (PS tier history)

enables us to disaggregate the NBB into several information tiers (Pink Current Information, Pink

15
     The NASDAQ dataset comprises the full venue history of each security it covers. This feature enables us to
     identify firms that trade up to (“rising stars”) or down from (“fallen angels”) the traditional exchanges.
16
     Datastream also offers information on trading venues. However, the item is static and, thus, does not allow us to
     identify a venue history, including potential switches between venues.
                                                                                                                   14
Limited Information and Pink No Information) and to identify firms flagged as Caveat Emptor. The

PS tier history also covers a shorter time period (October 2007 to October 2010) and includes only a

subset of firms in the NASDAQ venue history (about 50% of NBB).

       We use directEDGAR to retrieve 10-K and 10-Q filings by our sample firms during the sample

period in order to develop a precise SEC filing history for each firm. We also use directEDGAR to

identify the state of headquarters (SoHqt) and the state of incorporation (SoInc) for SEC filers. For

non-filing firms, we gather SoHqt/SoInc details from a proprietary NASDAQ dataset that includes

issuer profiles for most of the firms in our sample. For non-filing firms that are not covered by the

NASDAQ issuer profiles, we attempt to gather SoHqt/SoInc information manually (e.g., from the

website of the OTC Markets Group).17 Finally, we use Mergent’s Manuals (yearly company lists

from 2001 to 2010) as well as Standard & Poor’s Corporation Records (half-yearly company lists

from 2003 to 2010) to identify firms that are covered in the two key securities manuals.

       Our data collection process results in a dataset that comprises 955,716 firm-month observations

over the period January 2001 through October 2010.18

4.        Descriptive analysis

4.1.      Sample groups

       Table 1, Panel B, classifies our sample into various groups with similar venue histories. 10,583

firms trade in the OTC market at some point. The remaining 220 firms trade in NASDAQ’s small

cap segment throughout; they serve as a benchmark (NASDAQ SCM). The vast majority (77%) of

the OTC sample firms remain in the OTC market throughout, either from January 2001 onwards (In

17
       We were not able to identify SoHqt (SoInc) information through directEDGAR, the NASDAQ issuer profiles or
       manual collection for 374 or 3.5% (254 or 2.4%) of our sample firms.
18
       However, most of the analyses are based on fewer observations due to missing information or sample filters. We
       truncate all capital market variables at the top and bottom 1% unless the variable is naturally bounded or logged.
                                                                                                                      15
OTC only (start in 2001): 5,016 firms) or as new firms that enter the sample after January 2001

(New firms (remain in OTC): 3,134 firms). 1,787 firms (17%) trade down from the traditional

exchanges to the OTC market (Fallen angels (from exchange)). Only 646 firms (6%) trade up from

the OTC market to the traditional exchanges (Rising stars (start in 2001): 370 firms; Rising stars

(new firms): 276 firms). Untabulated statistics show that the number of “new” firms that enter the

OTC market each year without any prior listing is between 300 and 500 for most of the sample

period, declining to about 100 after the financial crisis in 2008. This evidence on new firms is in

contrast to the drop in IPOs on traditional U.S. exchanges starting in the early 2000s (e.g., Gao et

al., 2013; Doidge et al., 2015).

    Table 1, Panel C, shows that 78% of the OTC sample (8,307 of 10,583 firms) files 10-Ks and

10-Qs with the SEC at some point during the sample period. The column Fraction SEC filing while

in OTC shows that, while many Fallen angels tend to stop filing with the SEC after trading down to

the OTC market (fraction of SEC filings: 43%), the vast majority of Rising stars already register

with the SEC before trading up to the exchange (fraction SEC filing: more than 85%). Half of the

OTC sample (5,246 firms) is included in securities manuals in at least one year. While in the OTC,

Fallen angels appear in securities manuals relatively more often than any other sample group. Only

2,126 firms (20%) are completely dark over the entire sample period, i.e., they never file with the

SEC and never appear in the two securities manuals. Since trading venues outside the NBB require

SEC filings, firms that are classified as Rising stars or Fallen angels cannot be completely dark.

    In the Internet Appendix, we break down each sample group by industry, state of headquarters

and state of incorporation (see section IA.1). Financial firms represent the largest group (3,242

firms or 31% of the OTC sample). Firms from industries that face high fundamental uncertainty


                                                                                                     16
(e.g., information technology) are relatively frequent in the Rising stars and Fallen angels groups.

While almost 60% of the OTC firms are incorporated in Delaware or Nevada, their headquarters

tend to cluster in larger states (e.g., California, Florida, New York and Texas). In fact, 74% of the

OTC firms choose to incorporate in a state that is different from their state of headquarters.

       In Appendix 2, we provide an example of a typical firm in each of the OTC sample groups,

giving details on its main business, corporate evolution, trading and reporting history.

4.2.      Survival statistics and trading venue transitions

       Table 2 presents descriptive statistics on firm entries to and exits from the OTC market and our

sample (Panel A), venue transitions (Panel B) and stock price crashes (Panel C). Panel A shows

that 66% (71%) of the OTC firms are part of the sample at the beginning (end) of the sample period

in January 2001 (October 2010). This means that 34% of the OTC firms enter the sample later,

either as new firms or fallen angles, while 29% are removed from the OTC market prior to the end

of the sample period. As expected, the attrition rate is relatively low among new OTC firms. For

example, while only 14% in the New firms (remain in OTC) category fail to survive until the end of

the sample period, this proportion is more than twice as high (at 34%) in the In OTC only (start in

2001) category. The Fallen angels (from exchange) category experiences the highest attrition rate

(46%), which is not surprising given that these firms often delist from the exchanges due to

financial difficulties (see also Harris et al., 2008; Macey et al., 2008).

       In Panel B, we track trading venue changes for the sample firms over three different five-year

windows starting in June 2001, June 2003 and June 2005, respectively. Very few NBB firms trade

up to the BB or the traditional exchanges. For example, of the 3,788 firms on the NBB as of June

2003, only 7% (1%) are trading on the BB (on a traditional exchange) in June 2008; 76% of the

                                                                                                    17
firms continue to trade on the NBB, while 15% have been removed from the OTC market. BB

firms are also unlikely to trade up. For example, of 2,688 BB firms as of June 2005, only 6% trade

on a traditional exchange in June 2010, with 42% still trading on the BB, 36% demoted to the NBB,

and 16% having exited the OTC market. Taken together, this evidence suggests that venue changes

in the OTC market are not uncommon but typically involve transitions to lower ranked venues.

       Panel B shows that the vast majority of the OTC firms “survive” for more than five years, in

that they continue to be quoted. However, it is possible that firms crash and essentially die, yet

continue to trade as shells. To explore this possibility, Panel C tracks the incidence of what we

label a Crash over the same five-year windows.19 Firms are flagged as having crashed if they

experience (i) a cumulative monthly return of -95% at some point during the five-year window and

(ii) subsequently have a stock price below 0.01 USD for at least six months. Depending on the time

period, between 12% and 27% of NBB firms experience such a Crash in the subsequent five years.

The proportion of crashes is slightly lower for BB firms (between 10% and 17%). Thus, even with

this stricter definition of survival, the majority of OTC firms survive for more than five years.

4.3.      Market-based firm characteristics and trading activity

       We present descriptive statistics for a variety of market-based firm characteristics in the

Internet Appendix (see section IA.2). The average (median) company in the OTC sample has a

market value of about $52 million ($17 million) and a stock price of $6.81 ($1.01). While firms in

the Rising stars groups tend to be larger (median market cap of more than $100 million), most firms

that start and remain in the OTC market have fairly low market values (median of about $7 million).

The stock performance of firms in the OTC market is negative on average (over the entire sample

19
       Panel C analyzes sample firms that are not flagged as having crashed at the beginning of the tracking period. The
       number of firms in Panel C is therefore lower than in Panel B.
                                                                                                                     18
period) but varies considerably across sample groups (e.g., Fallen angels vs. Rising stars). In

addition, each sample group contains firms with positive and sometimes extremely high stock

returns (see also Figure 3).20 The volatility of monthly stock returns in the OTC sample is very high

(e.g., a median of 37% per month versus 12% for benchmark firms on NASDAQ SCM). In

summary, OTC firms tend to be small, have low stock prices (consistent with the penny stocks

label), and lottery-like payoffs, that is, negative average but sometimes extremely positive stock

returns and high return volatility. There is substantial variation in these characteristics, both within

and across OTC sample groups.

       Section IA.3 in the Internet Appendix provides statistics on trading activity by trading venue.

In contrast to the statistics discussed thus far, we perform this analysis at the firm-month level (and

not at the firm level). Across all firm-months in the OTC market (i.e., BB and NBB), the mean

(median) proportion of trading days is about 40% (29%). On days with trading activity, the mean

(median) daily trading volume is about $37,000 ($2,500). There is again considerable variation,

with 10% of OTC stocks being traded almost every day and others hardly at all.

4.4.      Market quality proxies

       To examine how regulatory regimes in the OTC market related to market quality, we focus on

two characteristics of market quality: liquidity and crash risk. We use two variables to measure

each characteristic and then combine them into two summary proxies.

       For the liquidity proxy, we use the proportion of zero return days as proposed by Lesmond et

al. (1999) and share turnover following Ibbotson et al. (2012) as input variables due to the low

levels of trading activity in the OTC market. The proportion of zero return days is the fraction of

20
       The statistics in Table IA.2 are based on firm-level log returns, whereas Figure 3 shows the distribution of discrete
       returns at the firm-year level.
                                                                                                                        19
trading days in a given month with zero returns. Share turnover is the average number of shares

traded per day divided by the average number of shares outstanding in a given month. The liquidity

proxy is the first principal component of these two variables, both measured over the current month

(t). Higher (less negative) values of this proxy indicate greater market liquidity. In section IA.4 of

the Internet Appendix, we validate our liquidity proxy by showing that it is highly correlated with

two other liquidity measures that are commonly used in the literature (i.e., price impact and bid-ask

spread) but not as frequently available for our sample. We also check that differences in free float

do not unduly influence the measurement of share turnover.

     For the (future) crash risk proxy, we follow Chen et al. (2001) and Hutton et al. (2009) by using

the negative skewness of returns and a dummy variable capturing large negative returns as input

variables. The negative skewness of returns is the negative coefficient of skewness, i.e., the

negative of the third moment of daily returns divided by the standard deviation of daily returns

raised to the third power. The dummy variable indicates a cumulative return below -95%.21 The

crash risk proxy is the first principal component of these two variables, both measured over rolling

three-month windows that include the current month and two subsequent months (t to t+2). Higher

values of this proxy imply higher future crash risk. We also validate this proxy by providing

evidence that it increases significantly when OTC firms are subject to pump-and-dump schemes

(see section IA.4 in the Internet Appendix).

     Table 3 reports descriptive statistics on both proxies and their input variables by trading venue.

These statistics are computed using pooled data at the firm-month level. Liquidity (crash risk) tends

to be higher (lower) in venues with stricter regulatory and disclosure regimes. For instance, the


21
     We compute the input variables of the crash risk proxy based on log returns because discrete returns exhibit
     extreme outliers (see Figure 3). The use of log returns is also consistent with Chen et al. (2001).
                                                                                                              20
median values of both proxies for the BB are between those for the Grey Market and the NASDAQ

Small Cap market. This association between the strength of OTC market regimes and market

quality is analyzed in the remainder of the paper.

5.        Regression analysis of market quality

5.1.      Trading venues

       In this section, we use multiple regressions to test whether market quality varies systematically

across OTC trading venues. We hypothesize that market quality increases with the strength of the

regulatory and information regime of the trading venue (see Figure 2), and expect market quality to

be the highest for the traditional stock exchanges and lowest for the Grey Market. Table 4 reports

the results. The analyses are based on either the full sample as described in Table 1 (NASDAQ

venue history; January 2001 to October 2010) or a subsample based on the PS venue history

(February 2003 to October 2010), for which we can separate Pink Sheets and Grey Market firms

within the NBB. All regressions are estimated at the firm-month level, and include year-month and

either industry or firm fixed effects.

       The key variables in these regressions are the trading venue indicators: Pink Sheets, BB, SCM

and Exchange. The omitted categories capture the least regulated trading venues (NBB firms when

using the full sample or firms trading solely on the Grey Market when using the PS venue history).

We include lagged Log(Market value) and lagged Return volatility as control variables in the

market liquidity regressions. For the crash risk regressions, we follow Chen et al. (2001) and

include lagged Log(Market value), lagged Return volatility, lagged Share turnover and lagged

Cumulative return as controls. In addition, all regressions include price-level dummy variables that



                                                                                                     21
indicate whether the lagged stock price is below $0.01, $0.10 or $1.00, respectively. The t-statistics

in these and all subsequent regression models are based on standard errors clustered by firm.

    To address potential concerns about reverse causality, we impose sample filters eliminating

observations shortly before trading venue transitions. Specifically, for the liquidity regressions, we

exclude the month in which firms change trading venues. For the crash risk regressions, we impose

a stricter filter to account for the longer estimation window of the crash risk proxy (i.e., we exclude

the month of, and the six months before, venue changes).

    Table 4, Panel A, presents the analysis for the liquidity proxy. The estimated coefficients on

the trading venue indicators are positive and highly significant in all specifications. Thus, the

omitted categories (NBB firms and Grey Market firms, respectively) contain the least liquid stocks.

Furthermore, the coefficient estimates increase monotonically as the venues’ information regimes

become stronger, i.e., they are lowest for Pink Sheets, larger for BB and largest for SCM and

Exchange. The magnitudes of the coefficients are also economically meaningful. For example, the

coefficient estimate on BB (about 0.24) in the full sample regressions corresponds to more than one-

third of the standard deviation of the liquidity proxy of 0.6895 (see Table 3). The results are similar

when we include firm instead of industry fixed effects, mitigating concerns about omitted variables

and suggesting that unobserved firm-level heterogeneity has a limited effect on the association

between trading venue and market liquidity.         The coefficients on the control variables are

significant and have the expected signs.

    Table 4, Panel B, presents the analysis for crash risk. The venue coefficients are again highly

significant with the expected signs and relative magnitudes in all specifications. That is, crash risk

decreases as the information regime of the trading venue strengthens, after controlling for market


                                                                                                    22
value, return volatility, stock performance, and share turnover. The results are similar when using

firm instead of industry fixed effects, again mitigating concerns about omitted variables. The

positive coefficients on the control variables are broadly consistent with Chen et al. (2001).

       To further tighten identification, we study the monthly changes in market quality in a short

window from 6 months before through 6 months after the date of a firm’s transition from one

trading venue to another. As this analysis requires a market quality variable that can be measured

over short intervals, we focus on liquidity and map out the liquidity response by estimating a

separate coefficient for each month in event time, while including year-month and transition fixed

effects. The results are reported in the Internet Appendix (see section IA.5). We find that market

liquidity increases (declines) significantly right around the transition month when firms move to a

trading venue with a stronger (weaker) information regime. The effect is fairly sharp and there is

little evidence of the pre-transition trends in liquidity we would have expected to see if there was

reverse causality. This supplementary analysis supports the interpretation that informational and

regulatory differences across trading venues drive the results in Table 4. The subsequent analyses

dig deeper into the associated regulatory regimes.

5.2.     SEC filings and securities manuals

       Next, we examine the relation between firms’ disclosure status and market quality, while

controlling for venue differences. Specifically, we analyze SEC filings and a firm’s inclusion in

two prominent securities manuals (Mergent’s Manuals and S&P Corporation Records). Both types

of disclosure provide basic but important financial information to investors that otherwise is not

readily available (see section 2). Table 5 reports the regression results.



                                                                                                 23
    The analyses are based on the NASDAQ venue history and include observations from all

venues or from the NBB only (i.e., Pink Sheets and Grey Market). All regressions are estimated at

the firm-month level and include year-month and either industry or firm fixed effects. The key

variables of interest in these regressions are the dummy variables SEC and Manual. SEC is equal to

one for firms that provide 10-Ks and 10-Qs to the SEC, and zero otherwise. All firms outside the

NBB are SEC registrants by definition, that is, SEC equals zero only for those firms in the Pink

Sheets or the Grey Market that do not file with the SEC. Manual is equal to one for firms that are

included in either Mergent’s Manual or the Standard & Poor’s Corporation Records in a given year,

and zero otherwise. In addition, and consistent with the analyses in the previous section, we include

trading venue indicators, lagged control variables and price-level controls.       As in the venue

regressions, we eliminate the month when disclosure changes for the liquidity regressions and the

preceding six months for the crash risk regressions.

    We estimate regressions based on the full sample, but also provide results for a propensity-

matched sample to mitigate concerns that the results are driven by changes in (observable) firm

characteristics, rather than disclosure regime changes. We perform the matching at the half-year

level without replacement and match on Manual (SEC), respectively, using SEC (Manual), lagged

market value, lagged return volatility and lagged stock price, as well as industry, state of

headquarters and half-year indicators.

    In Table 5, Panel A, we present results for liquidity. The estimated coefficients on SEC and

Manual are positive and statistically significant in all specifications, including industry and firm

fixed effects. The latter specifications control for any time-invariant heterogeneity across firms. In

the propensity-matched sample, we also control for time-varying differences in observable firm


                                                                                                   24
characteristics and still find significant, albeit slightly smaller, coefficients. The results indicate that

firms that file with their financial statements with the SEC and/or are included in at least one of the

securities manuals exhibit higher market liquidity.

    In Table 5, Panel B, we present results for crash risk. The coefficient estimate on SEC is

negative and statistically significant in all specifications, indicating that firms filing with the SEC

exhibit lower crash risk. The results tend to become stronger when including firm instead of

industry fixed effects and when using a propensity matched sample. Manual inclusion is also

associated with significantly lower crash risk in most specifications. However, this association

becomes insignificant when we include firm fixed effects.

    In the Internet Appendix, we provide several analyses to tighten identification and corroborate

the interpretation that the aforementioned results are attributable to SEC filings and manual

inclusion. First, we exploit the fact that the Bulletin Board (BB) adds an “E” suffix to a firm’s

ticker to flag to the market that the firm is delinquent in its SEC reporting. Hence, the ticker suffix

is a timely indicator of a firm’s reporting status tied only to SEC reporting. In section IA.6, we

show that firms that are flagged as being delinquent in their SEC reporting experience an immediate

drop in liquidity as well as an immediate increase in future crash risk. These effects are stronger for

firms that never return to SEC compliance and weaker for firms that are only temporarily non-

compliant in their SEC reporting, precisely as one would expect if SEC reporting drives the

deterioration in market quality. Second, we exploit the fact that banks and insurance companies are

required to provide disclosures to their respective regulators and are subject to separate oversight.

We therefore expect SEC filings and manual inclusion to have smaller market quality effects for

financial firms. Our results reported in section IA.7 are in line with this expectation. Finally, in


                                                                                                         25
section IA.11, we show that the coefficients on SEC and Manual are robust to more extensive fixed

effects structures, further mitigating concerns about omitted variables or unobserved shocks. In

summary, the analysis in this section shows that OTC market quality is higher when firms provide

disclosures through SEC filings and securities manuals.

5.3.      State securities laws

       In this section, we examine whether observed market quality reflects differences in the strength

of states’ securities (or blue sky) laws. In contrast to federal securities laws, state securities laws

generally rely on merit reviews instead of a disclosure doctrine. We therefore expect state securities

regulation to have a more indirect effect on market quality, e.g., by screening out firms with

investor protection concerns or by encouraging firms to satisfy blue sky laws via the manual

exemption and hence manual disclosure. However, blue sky laws apply at the trade level or in a

firm’s state of headquarters. Hence, we assign state securities laws according to a firm’s state of

headquarters because most states require home-state registration and trades are often likely to

involve buyers and sellers in the home state. We then test whether firms headquartered in states

with tougher merit reviews enjoy higher market liquidity and lower crash risk.

       The analyses are based on the NASDAQ venue history and include only observations from the

OTC market (BB and NBB) because firms traded on traditional exchanges are exempt from state

merit reviews. All regressions are estimated at the firm-month level and include year-month and

industry fixed effects. The key variable of interest in these regressions is Merit review, which is an

average of three scores for the strictness of state merit reviews.22 In a second specification, we


22
       We combine scores from three sources: (1) Nancy Fallon-Houle (www.nfhlaw.com), a law firm that specializes in
       blue sky laws and tabulates merit review for Regulation A filings on a scale from 0 to 3; (2) Wolters Kluwer Tax
       & Accounting’s CCH Intelliconnect ranks merit reviews for S-33 filings participating in the North American
                                                                                                                    26
estimate separate coefficients on Merit review for states with and without a manual exemption.

This model allows us to examine whether merit reviews matter more in states that do not offer a

manual exemption. We also include a dummy variable SoInc ≠ SoHqt that is equal to one when a

firm’s state of headquarters is not the same as its state of incorporation, and zero otherwise. Since

firms that incorporate outside their home state are probably different (e.g., more sophisticated) than

firms that do not, this control variable is intended to capture unobserved firm characteristics (see

also Litvak, 2011). We include indicators for SEC filings and manual inclusion as well as the same

control variables for firm characteristics as before.

    Table 6 reports the results. Starting with liquidity, we find a significantly positive coefficient

for Merit review. Thus, firms headquartered in states with tougher merit review laws have more

liquid stocks. The second column shows that the estimated coefficient on Merit review is larger in

magnitude for firms from states without the manual exemption. This result lines up nicely with the

role of manual exemptions in state securities laws.              Turning to crash risk, we find that the

coefficient estimates on Merit review are insignificant and close to zero in both specifications.

    In the Internet Appendix, we provide results based on the same regressions using firm fixed

effects (see section IA.8). In this analysis, the coefficients on Merit review are identified by firms

that move their headquarters to states that differ in the strictness of their merit reviews. We find

that the results for liquidity become even stronger with firm fixed effects, but the relevant

coefficients remain insignificant in the crash risk regressions. Thus, while the results indicate a




    Securities Administrators Association’s Coordinated Equity Review Program on a scale from 0 to 3; and (3) the
    Small Business Guide codes SCOR merit reviews on a scale from 0 to 3. In the empirical analysis, we use the
    simple average of these three scores as a measure of the strictness of merit reviews. Our results are robust to
    replacing the average with individual indicators for the strictness of merit reviews.
                                                                                                                27
positive relation between the strictness of state merit reviews and liquidity, they also suggest that

state merit reviews could be ineffective in terms of screening out securities with higher crash risk.

5.4.      Pink Sheets information tiers and Caveat Emptor label

       In August 2007, the Pink Sheets introduced tiers and labels differentiating firms by information

status as well as flagging firms with a public interest or investor protection concern. 23 These

designations are monitored by the Pink Sheets and modified when disclosures change. In this

section, we examine whether market quality varies across these tiers and information labels.24 We

expect market quality to increase for tiers and labels indicating a higher information status.

       The analyses are based on the PS tier history spanning the period October 2007 to October

2010, and include observations solely from the NBB (i.e., Pink Sheets and Grey Market). All

regressions are estimated at the firm-month level and include year-month and either industry or firm

fixed effects. We examine effects associated with the information regimes by adding dummy

variables for firms in the Pink No Info, Pink Limited Info and Pink Current Info tiers, with Grey

Market firms being the omitted category. We also include a dummy variable indicating a Caveat

Emptor flag. Furthermore, we add an indicator for SEC filings, an indicator for manual inclusion

and the same set of controls as in the previous analyses (except that we do not need venue indicators

given the sample restriction). We drop the months in which a firm’s information status changes to

mitigate reverse causality concerns.


23
       See section 2 and Appendix 1.1 for more details.
24
       Jiang et al. (2015) examine whether the new labels attract investor attention and affect prices and liquidity. Their
       analysis is based on three-month windows before and after the introduction of the labels. They find that liquidity
       improves for Pink Current Information firms and deteriorates for Pink No Information firms. They also find a
       positive association between announcement abnormal returns and subsequent liquidity changes. Their analysis
       discards Caveat Emptor firms. Litvak (2009) examines prices around the announcement of the initiative and finds
       that firms subsequently classified as low information providers have negative abnormal returns, suggesting that
       investors have some ability to predict how firms will be classified.
                                                                                                                       28
    Table 7 reports the results. The first set of columns shows that liquidity is positively associated

with the Pink Sheet information tiers. Including firm fixed effects, the estimated coefficients

suggest that liquidity decreases monotonically from stocks in the Pink Current Info tier, to stocks in

the Pink Limited Info tier, to stocks in the Pink No Info tier, and declines further for Grey Market

firms. In this specification, firms with a Caveat Emptor label are even less liquid than Grey Market

stocks, suggesting that investors avoid stocks with this flag. The second set of columns illustrates

that crash risk is negatively associated with the Pink Sheets information tiers. The magnitudes of

the estimated coefficients decrease monotonically, indicating a steady decrease in crash risk as

information provision improves. With industry fixed effects, Caveat Emptor stocks have the

highest future crash risk, consistent with the label’s purpose.

    We perform additional analyses in the Internet Appendix to tighten identification and

corroborate the interpretation that the documented differences in market quality reflect the Pink

Sheets information tiers. In section IA.9, we show that the results are confined to non-financial

firms. The effects of the information tiers are expected to be weaker or perhaps even non-existent

for financial firms, considering that they have to report to their respective regulators (and these

filings can be accessed by investors). In section IA.10, we exploit the strengthening of the Pink

Sheets regulatory regime over our sample period through the staggered adoption of four major

initiatives. Since these initiatives are set at the market level, they are exogenous to a given firm.

Our analysis shows that liquidity improves and crash risk declines for NBB stocks relative to BB

stocks following the adoption of the four regulatory initiatives in the Pink Sheets. By the end of the

sample period, NBB stocks have essentially caught up to BB stocks in terms of market quality. As

we also estimate these effects with firm fixed effects, they do not simply reflect the decline in BB


                                                                                                    29
firms over time. Taken together, the analyses in this section provide evidence that firms in higher

Pink Sheets information tiers exhibit superior liquidity and lower crash risk.

5.5.      Information regimes and return performance

       The previous analyses show that market liquidity and crash risk vary systematically across the

OTC information regimes. A natural question is whether these differences in information regimes

also result in differential return performance. We assess return performance by estimating alphas

for portfolios of stocks in the various information regimes using standard asset pricing models. In

each month, we collect stocks belonging to each information regime, and compute equally-weighted

and value-weighted returns for this portfolio. For instance, we take all Pink Sheets stocks that are

non-SEC filers and not covered in a manual and compute the returns for this portfolio in every

month. If a stock switches regimes, we drop its return in the transition month when computing the

portfolio returns. As in Ang et al. (2013), we estimate a five-factor model including market, size,

value, momentum, and liquidity factors.25 In order to account for thin trading, we include three lags

of each factor in addition to its contemporaneous value.26

       Table 8 reports the alpha estimates for Grey Market and Pink Sheets stocks (NBB) in Panel A,

and for Bulletin Board (BB) and NASDAQ Small Cap market (SCM) stocks in Panel B. Two

conclusions emerge from this analysis. First, the alphas for BB and NBB stocks suggest severe

underperformance for OTC stocks. In contrast, the alphas for SCM stocks are either insignificantly

different from zero or negative but very small in magnitude. The alphas are around -5% per month

for OTC stocks. This underperformance is in line with the results in Eraker and Ready (2015). The
25
       We recognize that these factors are constructed based on exchange-traded rather than OTC stocks. However, our
       intention is simply to examine (relative) abnormal performance of OTC stocks across information regimes.
26
       The models are estimated using log returns given the relative large frequency of extreme discrete returns (see
       Figure 3). Alphas based on discrete returns yield very similar inferences across information regimes but are less
       precisely estimated, which is likely due to large positive outliers in the discrete return series.
                                                                                                                     30
negative alphas are also consistent with the distribution of raw returns for OTC stocks shown in the

Internet Appendix (see section IA.2) and in Figure 3.

     Second, the alphas are similar across the various OTC information regimes that arise from SEC

registration and manual inclusion. In the NBB, the alphas for SEC filers are no larger than those for

non-filers (e.g., for firms not covered in a manual, the alpha based on equal-weighted portfolio

returns is -4.8% for non-SEC filers versus -4.9% for SEC filers). Similarly, the alphas for stocks

with and without manual coverage are generally very similar.

     Thus, in contrast to our market quality results, the information regimes in the OTC market do

not appear to be associated with differential return performance. A potential explanation is that

returns and market quality reflect conditions in the OTC market differently. In the presence of

short-sale constraints and with many retail investors seeking securities with lottery-like payoffs, as

discussed by Ang et al. (2013) and Eraker and Ready (2015), it is difficult for more sophisticated

investors to arbitrage OTC stocks.27 In section IA.12 of the Internet Appendix, we provide novel

evidence that short selling is indeed very difficult in the OTC market. Thus, more sophisticated

investors may simply refrain from trading as the information problems for OTC stocks become

more severe and this response is reflected in the market quality proxies, in particular, liquidity.




27
     Conrad et al. (2014) find that firms with a high probability of death also have a larger predicted probability of a
     high return over the subsequent year. These firms tend to have low and declining institutional ownership and, thus,
     are mainly held by retail investors. Since retail investors have skewness preference (Barberis and Huang, 2008),
     they are likely to overpay for the chance of a jackpot which, in turn, leads to low expected returns. Furthermore,
     these low returns are not arbitraged away because jackpot stocks tend to be small, have low institutional ownership
     and low analyst coverage, and thus are hard to arbitrage. This evidence reconciles negative returns and crash risk
     with the chance of extreme positive payoffs via a ‘limits to arbitrage’ argument. The similarity of returns across
     regimes is also consistent with the evidence and explanations by Conrad et al. (2014).
                                                                                                                    31
6.     Conclusion

     In this paper, we analyze a comprehensive sample of over 10,000 U.S. stocks that publicly

trade in the OTC market. Many of these issuers are not required to register with the SEC and hence

are often referred to as “dark.” However, OTC firms that are exempt from federal securities laws

are subject to state securities laws as well as venue-based rules stipulating disclosures, and hence

not necessarily dark. It is therefore more appropriate to view the OTC market as a twilight zone of

different regulatory and information regimes.

     We characterize this twilight zone and the regulatory regimes in the OTC market. We provide

much-needed descriptive statistics on industry, entry, survival, venue changes, and trading activity

by OTC venue as well as trading history. OTC firms tend to be small, trade at low prices, have

negative average returns and exhibit high return volatilities. We show that a large number of stocks

enter the OTC market without an IPO or prior listing in the major markets. However, relatively few

of these new OTC firms are able to graduate to the traditional exchanges. Yet, firms tend to survive

in the OTC market for extended periods of time, including those delisting from an exchange.

     Next, we examine the role of venues and relevant regulatory regimes in market quality using

two important constructs: liquidity and crash risk. We show that OTC firms that provide SEC

disclosures, publish information in a recognized securities manual, are headquartered in states with

stricter merit reviews, and are in higher-level Pink Sheets information tiers exhibit higher market

liquidity and lower crash risk. In short, we find that differences in OTC regulatory and information

regimes map into differences in market quality. This finding suggests that (at least some) investors

recognize information and regulatory differences across the OTC regimes and trade (or abstain from

trading) accordingly. Thus, our study contributes to a more nuanced understanding of investor


                                                                                                 32
behavior in the OTC markets. Theories on information asymmetry and adverse selection continue

to hold in the OTC market. We emphasize that this conclusion is not at odds with the findings in

Ang et al. (2013) and Eraker and Ready (2015). Their asset pricing results suggest that behavioral

biases of retail investors, gradual diffusion of information, and short-selling constraints explain why

OTC stocks consistently underperform and display very different return characteristics compared to

stocks listed on the traditional exchanges. Our results suggest that some, likely more sophisticated,

investors abstain from trading stocks when information problems become severe, a response that is

likely reflected in the market quality proxies, in particular, liquidity.

    Overall, our study points to an important trade-off facing OTC market regulators aiming to

create a viable market for small growth firms while protecting investors. While lowering regulatory

requirements reduces the compliance burden for smaller firms, it also significantly reduces market

liquidity and increases crash risk for investors. Our paper also highlights the relevance of state

securities laws for the OTC market, including merit reviews, manual exemptions as well as

associated securities manual publications. The OTC market is often viewed as dark and unregulated

but in fact there are many alternative regimes and a thicket of complicated state regulations. We

know very little about the effects of these regimes, which govern the trading of securities that are

not covered by federal securities laws. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to provide evidence

on how these regimes are related to secondary trading, market liquidity and crash risk.

    We conclude with a few cautionary words about the interpretation of our results. Identifying

the causal effects of OTC regulatory regimes is difficult.            For instance, it is possible that

unobservable changes in firm performance or other economic shocks influence market quality

proxies and at the same time are related to trading venues, SEC filing status, manual publication or


                                                                                                    33
Pink Sheets tiers. To the extent that our analyses do not control for the effect of performance

changes on liquidity and crash risk, our results are biased. We exploit several institutional features

and provide extensive sensitivity analyses to mitigate such concerns, but ultimately we interpret the

regression results as associations, rather than causal effects.

Appendix 1: Additional institutional details

1.1      Pink Sheets tiers
      Starting in 2007, the Pink Sheets introduced a tier system for companies whose stock is quoted on its
platform (www.otcmarkets.com). All securities are assigned a tier based on their reporting method (SEC
Reporting or Alternative Reporting Standard) and disclosure category (Current, Limited or No Information).
Each stock’s tier is displayed next to the ticker symbol on the Pink Sheets website.
      Securities in the highest tier, OTCQX, are required to have a current disclosure status and meet
minimum financial qualifications. To be traded on this tier, companies undergo a qualitative review by the
Pink Sheets operator (now called the OTC Markets Group). Companies are not required to be registered
with or reporting to the SEC, but must submit financial information to the Pink Sheets for review and display
on their website. In addition, U.S. companies must be ongoing operations; i.e., they cannot be shells or in
bankruptcy. As the number of U.S. firms in this tier is still very small, we do not analyze it separately.
      Securities in the next tier, OTCQB, must be current in their disclosure and report to the SEC or a U.S.
banking or insurance regulator. This tier was introduced in April 2010 and its requirements were extended in
May 2014. By contrast, securities in the OTC Pink tier have no SEC or equivalent reporting requirements.
They are placed in one of three categories based on the amount and timeliness of financial disclosure:
      1. Pink Current Information companies have submitted information no older than six months to the
          OTC Markets data and news service, or have made a filing on the SEC’s EDGAR system in the
          previous six months. This category can include shell companies or development stage companies
          with little or no operations as well as companies without audited financial statements.
      2. Pink Limited Information companies are unwilling or unable to meet OTC Markets’ guidelines for
          providing adequate current information but have submitted some of the information required. These
          are often firms with financial reporting problems, in distress, or in bankruptcy.
      3. Pink No Information companies are unwilling or unable to provide disclosure to the public markets.
          Firms in this category do not make current information available via the OTC Markets disclosure
          and news service, or if they do, the available information is older than six months. This category
          includes defunct firms that have ceased operations as well as “dark” firms.
      Companies that are deemed to have a public interest or investor protection concern, for example, due to
stock promotion, disruptive corporate actions, or legal proceedings receive a Caveat Emptor flag.




                                                                                                             35
1.2      State securities (blue sky) laws
      State securities laws predate the 1933 and 1934 Acts. While the latter Acts are based on a disclosure
doctrine, state securities laws rely on a merit-based regime.28 In other words, state securities regulators have
the authority to examine applications for registration, and to approve only those applications that are “fair” to
investors. Over the years, several attempts have been made to create more uniform securities laws across
states, via the Uniform Securities Acts (USAs) of 1930, 1956, 1988, and 2002. However, there is still
significant variation across blue sky laws, making compliance challenging for issuers whose stock is traded
by investors in multiple states.
      Recent federal acts have to some extent preempted blue sky laws. 29 For our purposes, the most
important of these is the National Securities Markets Improvement Act (NSMIA) of 1996. This legislation
creates a class of securities called “federal covered securities,” which includes securities listed on national
exchanges, securities issued by a registered investment company, secondary trading of securities issued by
federally registered and SEC reporting companies, as well as securities offered or sold without SEC
registrations based on one of the exemptions mentioned in footnote 35. NSMIA prevents states from
imposing additional disclosure or “merit” standards on such offerings, requiring registration by qualification
of such securities as well as prohibiting or limiting the use of any offering document prepared by or on behalf
of any issuer of such securities. However, NSMIA allows states to impose filing requirements for documents
filed with the SEC (such as a prospectus and Form D) and states may impose filing fees.

      Securities Registration
      There are four types of state securities registration: coordination, notification, Small Corporation
Offering (SCOR), and qualification.30 Registration by coordination is used for issues that are simultaneously
registering under the 1933 Act and in the states where the offering is to be sold. Registration by notification
(also called filing) is available for issuers with a class of widely-held equity securities registered under the

      This section draws primarily on individual states’ blue sky laws as reported by Wolters Kluwer Tax &
      Accounting’s CCH Intelliconnect. Virtually all states’ blue sky laws originally included a merit review, but the
      nature of merit review today ranges from the very stringent in states like California and Texas, to a regime which
      in practice mimics the federal disclosure-based process.
29
      These include the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PSLRA”), the 1998 Securities Litigation
      Uniform Standards Act (“SLUSA”), the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996 (“NSMIA”), SOX,
      and the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”).
30
      Arizona and Ohio allow registration by description while Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, and Rhode Island use the term
      registration by filing for processes similar to registration by notification.
                                                                                                                     36
Exchange Act of 1934 that can provide evidence of meeting certain minimum standards.31 In both cases,
NSMIA essentially usurps the state securities regulator’s ability to deny state registration.
     Many states also offer securities registration under the SCOR definition.32 These offerings are designed
to help small businesses raise capital, and are limited in size to no more than $1 million. SCOR offerings are
exempt from SEC Registration following Rule 504 of Regulation D and the Intrastate offering exemption
(Rule 147). Unlike other exemptions under Regulation D (see below), SCOR offerings may be marketed by
brokers and selling agents, and there is no limitation on the number of investors. Security offers and sales
exempt from SEC registration following Rule 505 (up to $5 million) and Rule 506 (unlimited) offerings
under Regulation D still need to be registered in the states where the investors are located. Most jurisdictions
have a simplified process which considers the offer or sale as registered in the state provided the issuer files a
copy of the federal Form D with the state regulator.
     All jurisdictions except New York have statutes that allow registration of securities by qualification, if
none of the other registration types apply.33 When seeking registration by qualification, information similar
to the registration requirements under the 1933 Act has to be provided to the state securities regulator. The
regulator then decides after conducting a merit review whether or not to make the registration effective.
     Costs for securities registration vary widely across states, but the typical state has a fee that is
proportional to the value of the securities offered in the state.34 State securities registrations are usually valid
for one year, and many states require the issuer to update the offering information (prospectus including
financial statements) periodically. As discussed in section 2, information filed with regulators in connection
with a state securities registration is typically not made publicly available in the way SEC filings are made
available on EDGAR.




31
     Eligibility requirements for registration by notification/filing are: that the SEC registered securities are held by
     more than 500 persons on record; that the issuer has a net worth of more than $4 million or a pre-tax net income of
     more than $2 million for two out of the three fiscal years preceding the offering; that the issuer has actively
     engaged in business operations for 36 consecutive months preceding the offering; that at least four market makers
     have been quoting the SEC registered securities for at least 30 days out of the three months preceding the offering;
     that the underwriter commissions will not exceed 10% of the offering; that neither the issuer nor any of its
     subsidiaries have failed to pay a preferred stock dividend or defaulted on any bond or long-term lease; and that the
     price of the offered security is no less than $5.00.
32
     Further information on SCOR requirements and applicable laws can be found at www.nasaa.org/industry-
     resource/corporation-finance/scor-overview.
33
     This type of registration is used by states for Rule 144A offerings, Regulation A offerings, Intrastate offerings
     larger than $1 million (Rule 147), and offerings to accredited investors.
34
     Typically, the rule is 1/10 of 1% or 1/20 of 1%. Note that there are some states with flat fees, and others with no
     maximum fee. The average across states is a minimum fee of $390 and a maximum of $2,525.
                                                                                                                     37
     Secondary Trading and Exemptions
     As long as the state securities registration is effective, secondary trading of the security is allowed
provided the trades involve only residents of states where the security is registered. In addition, most states
require firms to register in the state in which their headquarters are based (home state registration). An issuer
has to renew its state registration(s) in order for secondary trading to continue beyond one year.
     The requirement to maintain effective registrations in multiple states is costly, and issuers may therefore
seek to qualify for one of the exemptions to state securities registration. In addition to federal covered
securities, many states exempt, for example, bank stocks, savings & loans, insurance companies, credit
unions, and public utilities from registration provided that the issuers are regulated by federal and/or state
laws.   USA 2002 also includes twelve exemptions for transactions in securities, and seven of these
exemptions directly address equity trading:35 However, the adoption of the USA 2002 exemptions varies
significantly across states.
     One way for a firm to obtain an exemption from registering the securities in each state where investors
may reside is to list the firm in a nationally recognized securities manual. The most prominent manuals are
Mergent’s (previously Moody’s) Manual and the Standard & Poor’s Corporation Records. These two
manuals are explicitly recognized in 41 jurisdictions (including the District of Columbia) and one state
recognizes Fitch’s manual. To be covered in Mergent’s Manual, for instance, the firm pays an initial listing
fee of $3,600 and an annual renewal fee of $975.
     The manuals contain a company profile which includes the company history, business description,
subsidiaries, plant & property, and management listing.              The manuals also include financials: income
accounts for the most recent 3 years, balance sheets for the last 2 years, as well as a description of the capital
stock. If available, company information is provided, including contact information, website, annual meeting
date, counsel, auditors, long-term debt, number of shareholders, transfer agent, shareholder relations contact,
five-year stock pricing range, and the number of employees.
     The manuals are available in print and online for industry professionals and major research libraries.
Once a firm is listed in a recognized manual, investors from most states can freely trade unregistered shares




35
     The USA 2002 exemptions relevant for transactions in securities are: (1) isolated non-issuer transactions, (2)
     securities listed in a recognized manual, (3) unsolicited orders, (4) transactions involving institutional
     investors/financial institutions, (5) limited offerings, (6) existing security holders, and (7) transactions involving
     securities registered under the 1933 Act. USA 2002 exemptions with the most common adoptions are the limited
     offering exemption (51 jurisdictions), the institutional investor/financial institution exemption (45 jurisdictions),
     and the manual exemption (42 jurisdictions).
                                                                                                                       38
on the secondary market.36 Thus, a manual listing significantly enhances information disclosures to potential
investors and enlarges the pool of investors for which secondary trading would be permitted.

1.3      State corporate laws
      State corporate laws may also contain financial reporting requirements that are relevant to firms not
subject to federal laws. Companies are free to incorporate in the state of their choice, no matter where their
headquarters or operations, and approximately 50% of U.S. firms have chosen to incorporate in Delaware.
The Model Business Corporation Act (MBCA), which is the basis for corporate laws in 24 states, describes
reporting requirements and penalties.       According to the MBCA, firms are required to provide annual
financial statements to shareholders within 120 days of the end of the fiscal year. If a shareholder is not
mailed financial statements and submits a written request, these statements must be mailed. However,
several states (e.g., California, New York, and Delaware) do not follow the MBCA.
      According to the American Bar Association (2002), 15 states require the automatic provision of annual
reports and 26 states require companies to furnish an annual report only upon receipt of a written shareholder
request. The other states do not require annual financial statements to be furnished. Of the states with some
reporting requirement, sixteen states require financials to be mailed within 120 days of the fiscal year end,
while a few states give companies 180 days after the fiscal year end or “a reasonable time” following the
receipt of a request. Several states impose penalties such as fines or the right to legal costs or remedies, if the
firm fails to deliver the financial statements.
      However, while state corporation laws sometimes require firms to provide financial statements
to shareholders, these laws apply at the level of the record holder and hence, to our understanding,
do not necessarily lead to disclosure to beneficial owners or prospective shareholders. For this
reason, the effect of financial reporting mandated by state corporation laws on liquidity and crash
risk is not clear.
      We investigate the associations using the American Bar Association’s (2002) description of
reporting requirements. We define states as having weak (10), medium (26), and strong (15)
financial reporting requirements, and assign firms to each category based on their state of
incorporation. We run the same regression model used to evaluate state securities laws (Table 6).
Overall, the results (untabulated) are inconclusive. In the base specification with industry fixed
effects, firms incorporated in a state with strong state corporate law reporting requirements do not

36
      Exceptions are Alabama, California, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and
      Virginia.
                                                                                                                39
exhibit higher liquidity, although they do have significantly lower crash risk in states with medium
and strong requirements. When we add firm fixed effects, the positive association with liquidity
becomes stronger, but the crash risk associations are now weaker and insignificant. However, there
are only few OTC firms that change their state of incorporation over the sample period and hence
can contribute to the identification of state . We therefore also run specifications, excluding
Delaware and Nevada, the two most commonly chosen states of incorporation, as well as including
a binary indicator for out-of-state incorporation. These two choices should mitigate concerns about
self selection. The results remain mixed. Hence, we conclude that there are no reliable associations
between reporting requirements in the state corporate laws and the two market quality proxies,
potentially reflecting that the financial reports are generally not furnished to beneficial owners.




                                                                                                      40
Appendix 2: Example firms
      This appendix provides details on seven typical OTC firms. For each firm, we state its sample group (as
defined in Table 1) and describe its main business (as of the end of our sample period or the last available
date), sales and employee information (if available), its place of incorporation and location, its evolution
including important corporate events, trading venue and reporting history.

2.1       ZYTO Corp. (OTC only)
      ZYTO is engaged in the manufacturing and distribution of “biocommunication” devices and software
designed to facilitate communication between computers and the human body in a process called a
“biosurvey.” It markets its applications primarily to health care professionals. The firm is in the Surgical
and Medical Instruments industry (SIC 3841). At the end of 2011, ZYTO had approximately 30 employees.
Sales in recent years were $1.7 million (2007), $1.9 million (2008) and $4 million (2011).
      ZYTO is headquartered in Utah and incorporated in Delaware. The firm was created in September 2006
following a reverse merger of Nevada-based ZYTO Corp. with Delaware-based Quiver Corp. In July 2007,
it raised $1.4 million in a Reg D offering from 36 investors (18 of which were unaccredited). As of March
2012, it had 221 holders of record.
      The firm traded in the Pink Sheets from 2006 to April 2011 before it became dually quoted on the
Bulletin Board (BB). The firm has a website (www.zyto.com), which includes a press release section with
quarterly performance reports and other information of interest. The firm did not report any financial
statements before 2008. While solely in the Pink Sheets, its information label fluctuated between No
Information, Limited Information and Current Information. It filed for SEC registration in July 2010 and
made its first 10-K filing in March 2011. In December 2012, the firm announced its voluntary termination of
SEC registration and return to the Pink Sheets, largely for cost reasons. As of April 2013, the firm is labeled
as Current Information, as it continues to provide financial statements (certified by its attorney), despite
being no longer registered with the SEC. Since February 2010, the firm has been covered in the S&P
manual.

2.2       Quri Resources Inc. (OTC only)
      Quri Resources is engaged in the discovery, exploration, and development of gold, silver, copper, and
other mineral resources. Its properties include the Wellington mining project in Ecuador and the Oatman
gold project consisting of various mining concessions in Arizona. The firm is in Metal Mining Services (SIC
108). In 2011, Quri had two employees. Its revenue was $89,000 (2011) and $97,000 (2010). The company



                                                                                                            41
is incorporated in Delaware, with principal places of business in Miami, Florida and Quito, Ecuador. Before
February 2009, Quri was named Transoft Technologies, Inc.
      The firm was quoted in the Grey Market through November 2006 and in the Pink Sheets since then. In
May 2009, the Pink Sheets information label switched from Limited Information to No Information. Since
October 2010, Quri has been labeled Caveat Emptor, warning investors that the OTC Markets Group has
been unable to contact the company or confirm its location. The Pink Sheets website shows Quri’s last
financial report as of November 30, 2008.
      The Quri Resources website (www.quriresources.net) is no longer active, and has been replaced by a
new one (www.quriresources.com). The latter website provides no financial information and calls itself a
“blog.” It describes the company as being “interested in the technology surrounding the recovery of precious
metals and rare gems from the earth’s soil.” The firm is not covered in our two manuals. In September
2010, the SEC charged Quri with orchestrating a “pump and dump” scheme.37 The SEC alleges that the firm
issued several false and misleading press releases about impending acquisitions between February and June
2009, allowing CEO Jaime Gomez to sell shares at inflated prices for a total gain of $27,100.

2.3      Clarent Hospital Corp. (OTC only)
      Clarent Hospital owned and operated acute health-care hospitals and related healthcare businesses. It is
in Health Care Equipment & Services (SIC 8062). The firm was based in Houston, Texas and incorporated
in Delaware in 1980. Its predecessor was Paracelsus Healthcare Corporation, which filed for bankruptcy in
2000. Clarent emerged from these bankruptcy proceedings and reincorporated as a private company in 2001.
In November 2001, Clarent sold its Westwood Medical Center and used the proceeds to boost liquidity and
pay down a portion of its debt. On October 14, 2008, the firm announced that it would pay a dividend of
0.10 per share and the remaining assets would be placed in a liquidating fund. The proceeds of this fund
would go to the shareholders of record as of Dec 19, 2008. As of December 20, 2008 Clarent Hospital Corp.
went out of business.
      Clarent was quoted in the Grey Market and the Pink Sheets. The firm did not have a website and never
filed with the SEC. Neither Mergent nor S&P covered the firm in their manuals.

2.4      Miracor Diagnostics, Inc. (Fallen angel)
      Miracor Diagnostics, Inc. provided medical diagnostic imaging services in the U.S. Its industry is
Services – Specialty Outpatient Facilities (SIC 8093). Originally in the oil and gas sector, the firm became
solely a medical firm in January 1994. Starting in July 1998, it moved into the diagnostic business through

      See http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21675.pdf.
                                                                                                           42
asset acquisitions. By 2005, the firm operated 13 wholly owned centers in California, Florida, Illinois, Ohio,
and Oregon. These centers offered magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography and other diagnostic
imaging services in a patient-friendly environment. The number of employees remained constant between
2003 and 2005 at approximately 100. Revenues increased steadily to a level of $20 million in 2005.
      The company was incorporated in Utah in February 1980 and headquartered in California.38 In 2006,
the firm started to lose money and, in March 2007, it suspended payments to secured lenders and sought to
restructure its debt. In April 2007, Miracor filed for bankruptcy. The firm emerged from bankruptcy in
December 2007 and subsequently abandoned all significant operations. In June 2009, the state of Utah
effectively ordered the company’s administrative dissolution.
      The firm’s shares traded on the NASDAQ SCM until March 1998, when it was delisted and moved to
the BB. It traded in this market until May 2007—between February 2003 and May 2007 it was dually-
quoted on the BB and the Pink Sheets. As of June 2007, the firm was removed from the BB and traded
exclusively in the Pink Sheets, after it filed for bankruptcy and stopped reporting. Consequently, its Pink
Sheets information tier was No Information. In July 2010, the stock was finally removed from the OTC
market.
      The company had a website (www.miracor.com). It was listed in Mergent’s Manual through December
2006, but not covered by S&P. The firm was an SEC filer through 2007. In April 2007, the firm notified the
SEC that it was unable to file its 2006 annual report, and might never file again. In June 2010, the SEC cited
Miracor for being delinquent in its filings.

2.5       True Religion Apparel (Rising star)
      True Religion Apparel, Inc. designs and sells premium clothing (denim jeans and assorted sportswear)
to consumers globally. Its industry is Apparel & Clothing Manufacturers (SIC 2300). As of March 2013, the
company operated 124 stores in the U.S. and 31 international stores. Its products are also sold at major
department stores and the firm licenses its name for selected products. In December 2012, True Religion had
3,086 employees. Its net sales have grown rapidly over the years from $270.0 million in 2008 to $467.3
million in 2012.
      The firm was incorporated in Nevada in 2001 under the name Gusana Explorations Inc. At the time, it
was based in Vancouver, Canada and its business plan was to explore and develop mineral properties. Later,
the firm searched for opportunities in the clothing industry as an extension of its existing operations, and


38
      The firm was incorporated as Gold Probe in 1980 and changed its name to Hailey Energy Corporation in
      September 1981 after acquiring Hailey Energy Company. There were further name changes to Cytoprobe in 1992,
      to Medical Device Technologies in April 1995, and to Miracor in October 1999.
                                                                                                              43
eventually decided to let its mining claims lapse. In June 2003, the firm acquired all the shares of Guru
Denim, Inc. via a reverse merger and, in August 2003, changed its name to True Religion Apparel, Inc., with
headquarters in California. In 2008, it changed its state of incorporation to Delaware. On May 10, 2013, the
firm announced that it would be acquired by the investment management firm TowerBrook Capital Partners
LP in an $835 million deal. The price of $32 per share in cash represented a 9 percent premium over the
previous day’s closing price and a 52 percent increase over the price in October 2012.
      The firm’s shares were quoted on the BB starting in March 2003, and migrated to NASDAQ in August
2005. As of February 2013, True Religion had only 56 holders of record but roughly 11,500 beneficial
shareholders. The firm has a website (www.truereligionbrandjeans.com). It has filed reports with the SEC
every year since 2002 (which are also available on the firm’s website). It has not been covered by the
securities manuals.

2.6       Broadwind Energy (Rising star)
      Broadwind Energy provides technologically advanced products and services to customers in the wind
energy, oil and gas, mining, and infrastructure industries, primarily in the U.S. but also in other industrial
markets. Its operations include the production of wind turbine towers, fabrication of specialty weldments,
production and repair of precision gears and gearing systems, and blade and gearbox maintenance services.
The firm is in the Electrical Apparatus & Equipment industry (SIC 5063).             On December 31, 2012,
Broadwind Energy had 753 employees. Its total revenues were $185.9 million (2011) and $210.7 million
(2012).
      The firm incorporated in Nevada in 1996 as Blackfoot Enterprises, Inc. The business plan was to sell
replica totem poles and cigar store Indians but the firm ran out of funds and became a shell company in
January 1997. In February 2006, following a reverse merger between Blackfoot and privately-held Tower
Tech Systems Inc., Blackfoot changed its name to Tower Tech Holdings Inc., and moved its headquarters to
Wisconsin. In January 2008, the firm reincorporated in Delaware and shifted its headquarters to Illinois,
changing its name to Broadwind Energy, Inc. in February 2008. Over the years, it grew and evolved through
several acquisitions. In 2011, the firm faced class-action lawsuits related to officer breach of fiduciary trust
and SEC inquiries related to accounting irregularities. As of April 2013, these legal matters had not been
resolved entirely. Broadwind Energy had 66 holders of record as of February 2013.
      The firm’s common stock was quoted in the OTC market since March 2004. It was dually quoted in the
BB starting in June 2005. The stock began trading on NASDAQ’s National Market in April 2009, and
changed its listing to the NASDAQ SCM in December 2011.                           The firm has a website
(www.broadwindenergy.com), where it provides 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports. It has voluntarily reported to
                                                                                                             44
the SEC since its beginnings in 1996. The firm was listed in Mergent’s securities manual as of January 2009
and in the S&P manual as of July 2009.

2.7      The NASDAQ OMX Group (Rising star)
      NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. is a holding company providing trading, clearing, securities listing, and
technology services on a global scale. It is in the Security and Commodity Brokers, Dealers, Exchanges, and
Services industry (SIC code 6200). The firm operates the NASDAQ stock market, eSpeed (a new Treasuries
trading platform) in the US, several exchanges in Europe, including those in Stockholm, Copenhagen,
Helsinki, Iceland and the Baltic states. It also operates a derivatives market for power and a clearing house
for freight and seafood in Norway, an interest rates derivatives market in London, as well as energy and
carbon derivatives products (NASDAQ OMX Commodities). As of December 31, 2013, NASDAQ OMX
had 3365 employees. Total revenues were 3.21 billion in 2013 compared to 3.12 billion in 2012 and 3.44
billion in 2011. The firm is incorporated in Delaware and headquartered in New York.
      Nasdaq was founded in 1971 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. (NASD; now FINRA). In 2006, Nasdaq reorganized into a holding company. The NASDAQ
Stock Market became an independent registered national securities exchange in 2007. In February, 2008,
Nasdaq and OMX AB merged their businesses to form the NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.
      Commencing June 2000, the NASD began the process of separating Nasdaq from the NASD, as well as
raising financing for both entities, via a private placement of common stock to NASD members, investment
companies and issuers listed on NASDAQ. Following the expiration of trading restrictions on these shares,
public trading in the common stock started July 1, 2002 on the BB under the ticker symbol NDAQ. The
stock was quoted on the BB through February 9, 2005, then migrated to NASDAQ, following a secondary
offering of shares priced at $9 per share. On February 7, 2014, the firm’s share price was $37.54, and it had
approximately 586 holders of record.
      The firm has a website, http://www.nasdaqomx.com/, where it provides 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports.
As a result of the private placement of its stock, the firm became an SEC filer as of June 2001. The firm was
listed in Mergent’s Manual as of January 2008 and in the S&P manual as of July 2008.

                  Regulatory and disclosure regimes in U.S. capital markets




Figure 2 summarizes the regulatory and disclosure regimes in U.S. capital markets. The hierarchy of markets, going
from the most to the least regulated, is: Exchange (i.e., traditional non-OTC markets including the NASDAQ Small
Cap Market or SCM), the Bulletin Board (BB), the Pink Sheets (PS) and the Grey Market (GM). The regulatory
regimes, going from mandatory disclosure (denoted M) to voluntary disclosure (denoted V), are: SEC reporting
(SEC) mandated by trading venue, SEC reporting for issuers above the thresholds on total assets ($10M) and
shareholders (500) that trigger automatic SEC reporting obligations, voluntary appearance in a securities manual
(Manual), and State Securities Laws. Within the Pink Sheets, there are PS regimes which include initiatives
undertaken by its operator, the OTC Markets Group: the introduction of PS information tiers (OTCQX, OTCQB,
OTC Pink) as well as the move to greater transparency in pricing. Over our sample period, SEC filing has been
mandatory for Exchange, SCM and BB firms (denoted M). PS and GM firms are not required to file with the SEC
unless they exceed asset or shareholder thresholds, but they may do so voluntarily. State securities laws apply in
every state where the firm sells its shares, as well as in the states of both buyer and seller. Finally, state securities
regulation is pre-empted (denoted PE) if issuers are either registered with the SEC or if their securities trade in one
of 42 states where issuers are exempt from state registration requirements in case they are included in “a nationally
recognized securities manual” such as Mergent’s Manuals and Standard & Poor’s Corporation Records.

This table presents the sample selection process (Panel A) and describes the sample composition (Panels B and C).
The sample is based on a proprietary dataset provided by NASDAQ that includes the venue history of all equity
securities that are traded in the OTC market (i.e., the Bulletin Board, the Pink Sheets or the Grey Market) or the
NASDAQ Small Cap Market (SCM) at some point during the period January 2001 through October 2010. Matching
                                             Table 1 (continued)

this dataset with capital market data from Datastream results in an initial sample of 16,965 firms. We eliminate firms
that are incorporated outside the U.S. or file Form 20-F. We also exclude Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and
firms with short capital market histories (i.e., Datastream provides data for less than 50 trading days) or whose
securities trade rarely (i.e., less than five trading days in total and/or no stock price changes throughout). The final
sample comprises 10,803 firms. The sample groups in Panels B and C are defined as follows: In OTC only (start in
2001) includes firms that trade in the OTC market throughout the sample period, i.e. from January 2001 onwards. New
firms (remain in OTC) comprises firms that trade in the OTC market throughout, but enter the sample as new firms
after January 2001. Rising stars (start in 2001) are firms that are in the OTC market as of January 2001 but
subsequently trade up to the traditional exchanges (AMEX, NASDAQ or the NYSE) or the NASDAQ Small Cap
market. Rising stars (new firms) enter the sample after January 2001 as OTC firms and later trade up. Fallen angels
(from exchange) are firms that enter the sample by delisting from the traditional exchanges and trading down to the
OTC market (in or after January 2001). NASDAQ SCM is a benchmark group comprising firms that remain on the
NASDAQ Small Cap market throughout the sample period. In Panel C, we define dark firms as firms that never file
with the SEC and are never included in securities manuals (Mergent’s Manual or the Standard & Poor’s Corporation
Records). The fractions within the OTC are computed by dividing the number of OTC firm-months with SEC filings
or with inclusion in securities manuals by the total number of OTC firm-months.

This table presents statistics on survival and trading venue transitions. Panel A illustrates how many firms enter the
sample at or after the beginning of the sample period (January 2001) and how many firms leave the sample at or before
the end of the sample period (October 2010). These statistics are presented by sample group. For details on the sample
group composition, see Table 1. Panel B shows 5-year venue transition matrices for firms that are part of the sample
in 2001, 2003 and 2005, respectively. The matrices illustrate whether and how the trading venue changes

over the subsequent five years. NBB includes both Pink Sheets and Grey Market firms. BB refers to firms on the
Bulletin Board. SCM/Exchange comprises firms listed on the NASDAQ Small Cap market or on the traditional
exchanges (AMEX, NASDAQ or the NYSE). Removed refers to firms that are no longer traded on any exchange or
venue (including the OTC market). Panel C presents survival statistics for firms that are part of the sample in 2001,
2003 and 2005, respectively, and have not crashed previously. Crash (Alive) covers firms that (i) experience (do not
experience) a cumulative monthly return of -95% at some point during the five-year window and (ii) subsequently
have a stock price below 0.01 USD for at least six months.

This table presents descriptive statistics on our market quality proxies by trading venue at the firm-month level. We
use two proxies: liquidity (Panel A) and crash risk (Panel B). Liquidity is the first principal component of the
proportion of zero return days and share turnover, both measured over the current month (t). The proportion of zero
return days is the fraction of trading days in a given month with zero returns (Panel A1). Share turnover is the average
number of shares traded per day divided by the average number of shares outstanding in a given month (Panel A2).
Crash risk is the first principal component of the negative skewness of returns and a dummy variable capturing large
negative returns, both measured over rolling three-month windows that include the current month and two subsequent
months (t to t+2). The negative skewness of returns is the negative coefficient of skewness, i.e. the negative of the
third moment of daily log returns divided by the standard deviation of daily log returns raised to the third power (Panel
B1). The dummy variable is also based on daily log returns and indicates a cumulative return less than -95% over the
three-month window (Panel B2). NBB includes both Grey Market and Pink Sheets firms. A proprietary dataset
provided by the OTC Markets Group (the PS venue history) allows us to identify these subsamples. The remaining
firms for which this separation is not possible are flagged as NBB Missing. BB refers to firms on the Bulletin Board.
SCM indicates firms on the NASDAQ Small Cap market and comprises firms in the benchmark group (see Table 1)
as well as firms that come from or will switch to the OTC market. Exchange captures firms listed on the traditional
exchanges (AMEX, NASDAQ or the NYSE) that come from or will switch to the OTC market. For consistency with
the regression analysis reported in Table 4 (based on the NASDAQ venue history), we apply the same filters: for
liquidity, we exclude months in which firms change trading venues; for crash risk, the month of and the six months
before venue changes are excluded.

This table presents regression analyses relating liquidity (Panel A) and crash risk (Panel B) to the trading venues of
the sample firms. For details on the proxies for liquidity (t) and crash risk (t to t+2), see Table 3. All regressions are
estimated at the firm-month level and include year-month and either industry or firm fixed effects. The first two
specifications in each panel are based on the full sample as described in Table 1 (NASDAQ venue history; period:
January 2001 to October 2010), and include the following trading venue indicators: BB (firms traded on the Bulletin
Board), SCM (firms on the NASDAQ Small Cap market) and Exchange (firms listed on AMEX, NASDAQ or the
NYSE) with NBB firms (firms traded on the Pink Sheets or the Grey Market) being the omitted category. The third
and fourth specifications exploit the PS venue history as described in Table 3 (period: February 2003 to October 2010),
and refine the analysis by including an additional venue dummy for Pink Sheets firms, with Grey Market firms being
the omitted category. We include the following lagged control variables: Log(Market value) is the natural logarithm
of the median market value over the previous three months (t-3 to t-1); Return volatility is the standard deviation of
weekly log returns over the previous six months (t-6 to t-1); Cumulative return is the cumulative log return over the
previous three months (t-3 to t-1); and Share turnover is average number of shares traded per day divided by the
average number of shares outstanding over the previous three months (t-3 to t-1). We also include, but do not report
the coefficients on, three price-level dummy variables that indicate whether the median stock price over the three
previous months (t-3 to t-1) is below $0.01, $0.10 or $1.00, respectively. The analyses are subject to the following
transition filters: for the liquidity regressions, we exclude months in which firms change trading venues; for the crash
risk regressions, the month of and the six months before venue changes are excluded. The table reports OLS coefficient
estimates and (in parentheses) t-statistics. The t-statistics are based on standard errors clustered by firm. ***, **, *
indicate statistical significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels (two-tailed), respectively.

This table presents regression analyses relating liquidity (Panel A) and crash risk (Panel B) to the SEC filing and
manual inclusion status of the sample firms. For details on the proxies for liquidity (t) and crash risk (t to t+2), see
Table 3. All regressions are estimated at the firm-month level and include year-month and either industry or firm fixed
effects. The analyses are based on the NASDAQ venue history (period: January 2001 to October 2010) and include
firm-month observations either from all venues or from the NBB only (Pink Sheets and Grey Market). SEC is a dummy
variable equal to one for firms that file 10-Ks and 10-Qs with the SEC, and zero otherwise. All firms outside the NBB
are defined as SEC registrants, that is, SEC equals zero only for firms in the Pink Sheets or the Grey Market that do
not file with the SEC. Manual is a dummy variable equal to one for firms that are included in either Mergent’s Manual
or the Standard & Poor’s Corporation Records in a given year and zero otherwise. We also include, but do not report
the coefficients on, trading venue indicators, lagged control variables and price-level controls (see Table 4 for details).
The analyses are subject to the following filters: for the liquidity regressions, we exclude months in which firms
change their SEC filing and/or manual inclusion status; for the crash risk regressions, the month of and the six months
before such changes are excluded. The upper (lower) part of each panel reports regressions results based on the full
sample (a propensity-matched sample). We perform the propensity-matching at the half-year level without
replacement using a caliper of 0.0001. In the regressions based on observations from all
                                            Table 5 (continued)

venues (from the NBB only), we match on Manual (SEC) using SEC (Manual), lagged market value, lagged return
volatility and lagged stock price, as well as dummy variables for industry, state of headquarters and half-years as
matching variables. The table reports OLS coefficient estimates and (in parentheses) t-statistics. The t-statistics are
based on standard errors clustered by firm. ***, **, * indicate statistical significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels
(two-tailed), respectively.

This table presents regression analyses relating liquidity and crash risk to the strictness of Blue Sky laws at the state
level. For details on the proxies for liquidity (t) and crash risk (t to t+2), see Table 3. All regressions are estimated at
the firm-month level and include year-month and industry fixed effects. The analyses are based on the NASDAQ
venue history (period: January 2001 to October 2010) and include only firm-month observations from the OTC market
(BB and NBB). Merit review is a measure of the strictness of the state’s merit review as described in section 5.3. For
each sample firm, we use Merit review for its state of headquarters because most states require home state registration.
In the second specification, we distinguish between states that offer a manual exemption and those that do not (with
or w/o manual exemption). Thus, Merit review (with manual exemption) takes the value of Merit review only when
firms are headquartered in a state with a manual exemption, and is zero otherwise. SoInc ≠ SoHqt is a dummy variable
that equals one for firms incorporated outside the state of their headquarters, and zero otherwise. We also include, but
do not report the coefficients on, trading venue indicators, indicators for SEC filing and manual inclusion status,
lagged control variables and price-level controls (see Tables 4 and 5 for details). No filters are imposed in these
analyses. The table reports OLS coefficient estimates and (in parentheses) t-statistics. The t-statistics are based on
standard errors clustered by firm. ***, **, * indicate statistical significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels (two-tailed),
respectively.

This table presents regression analyses relating liquidity and crash risk to indicators for the Pink Sheets information
tiers and the Caveat Emptor label. For details on the proxies for liquidity (t) and crash risk (t to t+2), see Table 3. All
regressions are estimated at the firm-month level and include year-month and firm fixed effects. The analyses are
based on a proprietary dataset provided by the OTC Markets Group (PS tier history; period: October 2007 to October
2010) and include only firm-month observations from the NBB (Pink Sheets and Grey Market). Caveat Emptor is a
dummy variable indicating firms that are flagged by the OTC Markets Group as having a public interest concern. Pink
No Info, Pink Limited Info and Pink Current Info are dummy variables for firms in the respective Pink Sheets
information tier which were introduced by the OTC Markets Group in 2007. Grey Market firms are the omitted
category. We also include, but do not report the coefficients on, indicators for SEC filing and manual inclusion status,
lagged control variables and price-level controls (see Tables 4 and 5 for details). The analyses are subject to the
following sample filters: for the liquidity regressions, we exclude months in which firms change Pink Sheets
information tiers and/or their Caveat Emptor status; for the crash risk regressions, the month of and the six months
before such changes are excluded. The table reports OLS coefficient estimates and (in parentheses) t-statistics. The t-
statistics are based on standard errors clustered by firm. ***, **, * indicate statistical significance at the 1%, 5% and
10% levels (two-tailed), respectively.

This table presents alpha estimates from monthly time-series regressions that relate equal- and value-weighted
portfolio log returns at the information regime-level (venue, SEC filing and manual inclusion status) to a five factor
asset pricing model comprising market, size, value, momentum and the Pastor-Stambaugh (2003) liquidity factors.
The liquidity factor is available at Lubos Pastor’s website. The other factors come from Kenneth French’s website.
We include the contemporaneous value and three lags of each factor to account for thin trading. Firm-months in which
the information regime changes (e.g., due to a venue switch and/or a change in the SEC filing or manual inclusion
status) are excluded from the regressions. Panel A reports estimates for Grey Market and Pink Sheets firms (NBB).
Panel B reports estimates for firms on the Bulletin Board (BB) and on the NASDAQ Small Cap market (SCM),
respectively. The table reports OLS coefficient estimates and (in parentheses) t-statistics based on Newey-West
standard errors. ***, **, * indicate statistical significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels (two-tailed), respectively.

IA.1     Industry and geographic characteristics by sample group

       Table IA.1 presents statistics on the distribution of industry (Panels A and B), state of

headquarters (Panel C) and state of incorporation (Panel D) for each sample group.

       Panel A shows that financials are the largest group, followed by firms in cyclical services,

information technology and non-cyclical consumer products.           However, there are notable

differences across sample groups. For instance, while financials dominate in most groups, firms

operating in cyclical services and information technology constitute a larger fraction of the

Fallen angels category.      The latter finding is intuitive as these industries face significant

fundamental uncertainty. Panel B provides a more detailed industry classification. Financial

services companies and banks represent the two largest industry groups for firms that remain in

the OTC throughout, while pharmaceuticals and health care firms are among the top five

industries in the Rising stars category and the benchmark group NASDAQ SCM.

       Panel C illustrates that most sample firms are headquartered in California, New York,

Florida or Texas, and shows that the distribution of headquarters across states is related to

population. A relatively large proportion of firms that enter the sample after January 2001 is

based in a country other than the U.S. or Canada (New firms (remain in OTC): 9%; Rising stars

(new firms): 14%). This suggests that the OTC market has become popular among foreign

companies in recent years. Panel D shows that the majority of the OTC firms is incorporated in

Delaware or Nevada. While Delaware dominates in most sample groups, firms in the New firms

(remain in OTC) category are more likely to be incorporated in Nevada. Untabulated statistics

show that 74% of the sample firms choose to incorporate in a state that is different from their

state of headquarters. These numbers are comparable to those in Litvak (2011) showing that

over      80%    of    Compustat    firms    are   incorporated    outside   their   home    state.

                                                                                                 2

This table presents firm-level statistics on industry, state of headquarters and state of incorporation by sample group. Panel A provides information on broad
industry categories. Panel B shows the top 5 industries using a more detailed industry categorization. Panel C reports the top 5 states in which the sample firms
have their headquarters. Panel D focuses on the top 5 states of incorporation. For firms that switch industries or state of headquarters/incorporation, we use the
industry or state where the firm spends the longest time during the sample period. For details on the sample groups, see Table 1 in the paper.

IA.2   Market-based firm characteristics by sample group

    Table IA.2 provides descriptive statistics on market-based firm characteristics for our OTC

sample by sample group.

    Panel A shows that the mean (median) volume-weighted market value is about $52 million

($17 million) across all OTC sample firms. The large difference between the mean and median

indicates a highly right-skewed distribution. Firms in the In OTC only (start in 2001) group tend

to be smallest: the median is about $7.2 million and more than a quarter have market values of

less than $2 million. Firms in the Rising stars (new firms) category tend to be largest, with a

median of about $125 million.

    Panel B shows that the volume-weighted stock price is also skewed with a mean (median) of

$6.81 ($1.01) across all OTC sample firms. The In OTC only (start in 2001) group has a

particularly high proportion of low-priced stocks. In contrast, a large fraction of Benchmark

firms from the NASDAQ SCM trade above one U.S. dollar.

    Panel C shows that firms in the OTC market exhibit, on average, negative annualized returns

over the entire sample period (mean: -60.19%; median: -45.98%). There is substantial variation

across sample groups. For example, while the median annualized return for the New firms

(remain in OTC) group is -59.15% over the sample period, it is 2.54% for firms in the Rising

stars (new firms) category.      Each sample group has firms with large positive returns.

Untabulated statistics show that even among firms that remain in the OTC market there are more

than 1,000 stocks with cumulative returns above 10% over the entire sample period. Figure 3 in

the paper illustrates this heterogeneity with a histogram of returns for all firm years in the OTC

sample. While stock returns are indeed negative for the majority of firm years, some annual



                                                                                                5
returns are extremely high.1 Taken together, these results are consistent with Eraker and Ready

(2015).

         Panel D shows that return volatility (measured as the standard deviation of monthly returns)

is high in the OTC market. Again, large differences are visible across OTC sample groups. For

instance, the median volatility for new firms that remain in the OTC market (0.39) is almost

twice the volatility of firms in the Rising stars groups and three times the volatility of NASDAQ

SCM Benchmark firms.

This table presents firm-level descriptive statistics by sample group. Panel A (Panel B) reports statistics for average
market value (average stock price) in U.S. dollars weighted by trading volume. Panel C summarizes the distribution
of annualized log returns over the entire sample period. Panel D provides statistics on the volatility (i.e., the standard
deviation) of monthly log returns. For details on the sample groups, see Table 1 in the paper.

IA.3   Trading activity in the OTC market

    Table IA.3 provides descriptive statistics on trading activity in the OTC market by trading

venue at the firm-month level.

    Panel A shows that the mean (median) proportion of trading days is 40.12% (28.57%) across

all firm-months in our OTC sample. These statistics are consistent with Ang et al. (2013) who

report a mean proportion of trading days of about 53% across their sample of OTC stocks (see

also Bollen and Christie, 2009). Trading frequency varies substantially in the cross-section of

our sample. For example, while about 10% of OTC stocks trade almost every day (untabulated),

a quarter of all OTC stocks have zero volume on 95% of the days. There is also systematic

variation in trading frequency across venues. For example, the median proportion of trading

days is 57.14% for firms on the Bulletin Board (BB) but only 4.55% for Grey Market firms.

    Panel B shows that trading volume on trading days is generally low, with a mean (median)

of $37,220 ($2,456) across all firm-months in our OTC sample. Again, there is substantial

variation across trading venues. For example, while BB firms have a median volume of $7,258,

the median volume of firms in the Pink Sheets (Grey Market) is merely $428 ($15). In several

instances, the mean values are influenced by large outliers (e.g., for firms in the Grey Market).

    Taken together, this analysis shows that trading activity tends to be low in the OTC market

but also that it varies predictably across venues. By and large, more regulated venues have more

actively traded securities.

This table presents descriptive statistics on trading activity in the OTC market by trading venue at the firm-month
level. Panel A provides statistics on the proportion of trading days (i.e., days with non-zero trading volume). Panel B
reports statistics on the average daily trading volume in U.S. dollars on trading days (i.e., conditional on daily
trading volume being non-zero). NBB includes both Grey Market and Pink Sheets firms. A proprietary dataset
provided by the OTC Markets Group (the PS venue history) allows us to identify these subsamples. The remaining
firms for which this separation is not possible are flagged as NBB Missing. BB refers to firms on the Bulletin Board.
SCM indicates firms on the NASDAQ Small Cap market and comprises firms in the benchmark group (see Table 1
in the paper) as well as firms that come from or will switch to the OTC market. Exchange captures firms listed on
the traditional exchanges (AMEX, NASDAQ or the NYSE) that come from or will switch to the OTC market. No
filters are imposed in these analyses.

IA.4   Validation of market quality proxies

    In this section, we validate our market quality proxies. First, in Table IA.4a, we compare

our liquidity proxy and its input variables with two commonly used liquidity measures: the price

impact measure suggested by Amihud (2002) and the bid-ask spread. For both measures, higher

values indicate more illiquid stocks. As expected, our liquidity proxy is negatively correlated

with both the Amihud measure and the bid-ask spread (see Panel B). These correlations are

sizeable (between -0.6499 and -0.5379) and statistically significant, suggesting that our proxy

does indeed capture stock liquidity. Note that we do not use the Amihud measure or the bid-ask

spread in our main analyses because both measures are available for only a subset of our sample.

Specifically, the Amihud measure (bid-ask spread) is available for merely 53% (23%) of the

firm-months used in the liquidity analysis reported in Table 4, Panel A, of the paper.

    Second, in Table IA.4b, we use data on pump and dump (or P&D) schemes to validate our

proxy for crash risk. A P&D scheme is a fraudulent form of market manipulation that involves

the manipulator taking a long position in a stock before artificially increasing demand through an

unsolicited campaign (e.g., via email, phone or fax). Prior research shows that P&D campaigns

often lead to temporary price increases and subsequent corrections or crashes (e.g., Frieder and

Zittrain, 2008; Hanke and Hauser, 2008). Thus, if our proxy (measured over the current and the

two subsequent months) captures (future) crash risk, we expect it to increase significantly for

stocks that are subject to P&D schemes. We test this relation for a large sample of P&D

schemes based on four different data sources. The regression results confirm the expectation that

the crash risk proxy increases following P&D schemes. The coefficient on the Pump and Dump

indicator is positive and statistically significant in each panel. This increase in crash risk is also


                                                                                                   10
economically large in all specifications. For example, the coefficient estimate of the Pump and

Dump indicator in the first specification in Panel A (0.169) corresponds to roughly one-third of

the standard deviation of the crash risk proxy of 0.4919 (not tabulated, but very similar to the

statistic reported in Table 3, Panel B in the paper; the small difference is due to differences in the

sample filters employed in the main analysis).

     Taken together, the results reported in this section provide evidence that our market quality

proxies capture liquidity and crash risk, respectively.

This table compares our liquidity proxy and its input variables (see Table 3 in the paper for details) with two
commonly used liquidity measures: The Amihud measure is the median daily price impact in a given month. We
follow Amihud (2002) and compute the daily price impact as the absolute log return divided by U.S. dollar trading
volume (measured in thousands). We compute monthly medians using days with non-zero returns (e.g., Daske et al.,
2008). The bid-ask spread is the median daily percent spread in a given month. The daily percent spread is the
difference between the closing ask price and the closing bid price, divided by the midpoint. We use the natural
logarithm of the Amihud measure and the bid-ask spread because both variables are right-skewed. Panel A presents
descriptive statistics at the firm-month level. Panel B reports Spearman (above the diagonal) and Pearson (below the
diagonal) correlations at the firm-month level. All correlations are statistically significant at the 1% level (two-
tailed). For consistency with the regression analysis reported in Table 4 in the paper (based on the NASDAQ venue
history), we exclude months in which firms change trading venues.

This table presents regression analyses relating crash risk to pump and dump (P&D) schemes. For details on the proxy for crash risk (t to t+2), see Table 3 in the
paper. The basic research design is the same as in Table 5, Panel B of the paper including the sample filter (i.e., the month of and the six months before changes
in SEC filing and/or manual inclusion status are excluded). Pump and Dump is a dummy variable equal to one for months in which firms are subject to market
manipulation by the P&D schemes, and zero otherwise. We identify P&D schemes from four data sources: (1) the database compiled by Frieder and Zittrain
(2008); for details, see www.cyber.law.harvard.edu/stockspam; (2) the Stock Spam Effectiveness Monitor that is used by Hanke and Hauser (2008); for details,
see www.crummy.com/features/StockSpam; (3) www.spamnation.info; this website is now offline, we use a copy from February 2012; (4) the Qwoter's Spam
Report; for details, see www.qwoter.com/spam. In Panel A, the Pump and Dump indicator equals one for 1,077 firm-months with a P&D scheme according to at
least one data source. In Panel B, the Pump and Dump indicator equals one for a subset of 356 firm-months with a P&D scheme according to all four data
sources. The table reports OLS coefficient estimates and (in parentheses) t-statistics. The t-statistics are based on standard errors clustered by firm. ***, **, *

IA.5   Liquidity changes around trading venue transitions

    We examine liquidity changes around trading venue transitions to tighten identification. If

venue differences and the associated disclosure regimes drive the differences in liquidity in the

main analysis reported in the paper, we should find a change in liquidity around venue

transitions, with liquidity deteriorating when the regime weakens and improving when the

regime strengthens. Accordingly, we study the change in monthly liquidity in a short window

from 6 months before through 6 months after the date of a firm’s transition from one trading

venue to another. We map out the liquidity response by estimating a separate coefficient for

each month in event time, while including year-month and transition fixed effects.

    Table IA.5 presents the key coefficient estimates.         Figure IA.5 plots these coefficient

estimates for selected specifications. For transitions from NBB (Pink Sheets or Grey Market) to

BB (Bulletin Board), the coefficient estimates on the pre-transition indicators are significantly

negative, while those on the post-switch indicators are significantly positive. Since the base case

is liquidity in the transition month, these coefficients imply that liquidity is lower before the

transition and higher afterwards. The pre-transition coefficients are fairly uniform with no

apparent trend. The difference in the coefficients around the transition (month m+1 relative to

month m-1) is four times larger than the next largest difference in the coefficients for adjacent

months. For BB to NBB transitions, this pattern is reversed.

    These results imply that liquidity improves significantly when a firm moves from the NBB

to the BB (i.e., when the regulatory regime strengthens) and declines significantly when a firm

moves from the BB to the NBB (i.e., when its regulatory regime weakens). The effects occur

right around the transition month. There is little evidence of pre-transition trends in liquidity, as

would be expected with reverse causality.

This table presents regression analyses relating liquidity to trading venue transitions. For details on the proxy for
liquidity, see Table 3 in the paper. The regressions focus on 13-month windows around venue transitions. We
exclude transitions of firms that switch venues multiple times during this window. All regressions are estimated at
the firm-month level and include year-month and transition fixed effects. The first specification examines 842
transitions from the NBB (Pink Sheets or Grey Market) to the BB (Bulletin Board). The second specification
analyzes a subset of 554 clean transitions from the NBB to the BB. This subset includes only those firms that do not
change their SEC filing status during the transition window. The third (fourth) specification focuses on 2,595
transitions (a subset of 567 clean transitions) from the BB to the NBB. All specifications include indicators for each
of the 6 months before and the 6 months after the transition (i.e., the transition month, m, is the omitted category).
We also include, but do not report the coefficients on, indicators for SEC filing and manual inclusion status, lagged
control variables and price-level controls. The table reports OLS coefficient estimates. ***, **, * indicate statistical

IA.6   E-Ticker Analysis

    In this analysis, we exploit the fact that the Bulletin Board (BB) adds an “E” suffix to a

firm’s ticker to flag to the market that the firm is delinquent in its SEC reporting.         This

institutional feature enables us to tighten the link between market quality and SEC reporting,

since the ticker suffix is a timely indicator of the firm’s reporting status and tied only to SEC

reporting. As an additional test, we can compare the estimated market quality effects for firms

that subsequently return to compliance with SEC reporting requirements – causing the “E” to be

removed – and firms that are eventually forced off the Bulletin Board to the Pink Sheets or the

Grey Market (NBB) due to non-compliance. If SEC reporting drives the market quality results

reported in the paper, we expect market quality to deteriorate following the addition of the “E”

suffix. Furthermore, the effect should be smaller for firms that are only temporarily non-

compliant.

    The first specification in each panel shows that the coefficient on E-Ticker is negative for

liquidity and positive for crash risk, and statistically significant in each case. Thus, as soon as

the ticker indicates delinquency in SEC reporting, market quality declines, i.e., liquidity drops

and crash risk increases. The second specification shows that the coefficients are larger in

magnitude for E-Ticker BB-to-NBB than E-Ticker BB-to-BB. Thus, the reduction in liquidity and

the increase in crash risk are larger for firms that never return to SEC compliance compared to

firms that are only temporarily non-compliant. These findings support our interpretation that

SEC reporting requirements drive the stock liquidity and crash risk effects reported in the paper.

This table presents regression analyses relating liquidity and crash risk to delinquency in SEC reporting on the
Bulletin Board. For details on the proxies for liquidity and crash risk, see Table 3 in the paper. All regressions are
estimated at the firm-month level and include year-month and firm fixed effects. The analyses are based on the
NASDAQ venue history (period: January 2001 to October 2010) and include firm-month observations from all
venues. E-Ticker is a dummy variable equal to one if a firm’s ticker is temporarily suffixed with the letter “E”, and
zero otherwise. The Bulletin Board adds this suffix to flag firms that are delinquent in their SEC reporting. E-Ticker
BB-to-BB indicates one subset of the E-Ticker cases where firms subsequently return to compliance with SEC
reporting requirements and are therefore allowed to stay on the Bulletin Board. E-Ticker BB-to-NBB indicates the
other subset of the E-Ticker cases where firms never return to compliance with SEC reporting requirements and are
forced to leave the Bulletin Board. We also include, but do not report the coefficients on, trading venue indicators,
indicators for SEC filing and manual inclusion status, lagged control variables and price-level controls (see Tables 4
and 5 in the paper for details). No filters are imposed in these analyses. The table reports OLS coefficient estimates

IA.7   SEC filing and manual inclusion for financial companies

    This analysis exploits the fact that financial companies (i.e., banks and insurance companies)

are regulated and required to provide disclosure filings to their respective regulators. As a result

of this institutional feature, we expect that SEC reporting and manual inclusion are less

important for the information environment of financial companies. Thus, the effects of SEC and

manual reporting on liquidity and crash risk should be smaller for banks and insurance

companies, all else equal. We consider this analysis as an alternative way to test whether SEC

reporting and manual inclusion drive the market quality results reported in the paper.

    We retrieve industry details from several databases (SNL, Datastream, Worldscope and

Factset) and focus on the subset of firms for which at least two of these databases provide

coincident information. We estimate the models reported in Table 5 in the paper, but add terms

that interact the variables Manual and SEC with a Financials indicator variable that is equal to

one for banks and insurance companies, and zero otherwise.

    Table IA.7 shows that the coefficients on SEC*Financial and Manual*Financial are, as

expected, significantly negative for liquidity and significantly positive for crash risk when using

firm-month observations from all venues. When focusing on the subset of NBB firms (i.e., firms

traded in the Pink Sheets or the Grey Market) that do not report to the SEC, the coefficients on

Manual*Financial are significantly negative for liquidity, but not significant for crash risk.

Thus, in this sample, the manual results are somewhat weaker.               Overall, however, the

coefficients on the interactions are generally significant and of the opposite sign to the main

effects, indicating weaker or even non-existent effects for financial companies. These findings

corroborate our interpretation that SEC reporting and manual inclusion drive market quality and

ease concerns about alternative explanations (such as omitted variables).

                                                                                                 18

This table presents regression analyses relating liquidity (Panel A) and crash risk (Panel B) to SEC filing and manual inclusion status for financial companies.
For details on the proxies for liquidity and crash risk, see Table 3 in the paper. The basic research design is the same as in Table 5 in the paper. In addition, we
interact the key variables Manual and SEC with the dummy variable Financials that is equal to one for banks and insurance companies, and zero otherwise. For
this analysis, we retrieve industry details from several databases (SNL, Datastream, Worldscope and Factset) and focus on the subset of firms for which at least
two of these databases provide coincident information. The first two specifications include firm-month observations from all venues. The third and fourth
specifications focus on firm-month observations from the NBB (Pink Sheets and Grey Market) for firms that are not registered with the SEC. The table reports
OLS coefficient estimates and (in parentheses) t-statistics. The t-statistics are based on standard errors clustered by firm. ***, **, * indicate statistical
significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels (two-tailed), respectively.

IA.8   Adding firm fixed effects to the analysis of state merit reviews

    In order to tighten identification in our state merit review analysis, we employ a more

restrictive fixed effects structure. The regressions in the paper use industry fixed effects. Here,

we employ firm fixed effects. Recall that the state merit review variable is assigned on the basis

of the state in which a firm’s headquarters is located. The inclusion of firm fixed effects means

that the merit review coefficients are identified based on changes in firms’ state of headquarters.

    We identify 1,472 cases in which firms change their state of headquarters during the sample

period. Table IA.8 shows that the results for liquidity become even stronger when we include

firm fixed effects. For example, the coefficient estimate on Merit Review is 0.019 (t-statistic

2.99) with industry fixed effects (see Table 6 in the paper), but is twice as large with firm fixed

effects (0.038; t-statistic 2.56). The coefficient on Merit review (w/o manual exemption) also

doubles. The result that the coefficient on Merit review is larger in states without a manual

exemption than in states with a manual exemption is similar to that reported in Table 6 of the

paper. For crash risk, the coefficients remain insignificant and close to zero, similar to the

results reported in the paper. Overall, these results should ease concerns about alternative

explanations or omitted variables.

IA.9   Pink Sheets information tiers and financial companies

    In this section, we exploit the fact that financial companies (i.e., banks and insurance

companies) are subject to additional disclosure requirements. Consequently, market quality is

less likely to be affected by information regimes in the Pink Sheets. The analysis is similar to

the analysis in section IA.7. Namely, we use the same research design as in our main tests

(Table 7 in the paper) but add terms that interact the key variables with a Financials indicator

variable. This indicator is equal to one for banks and insurance companies, and zero otherwise.

For this analysis, we combine firms in the Pink Limited Information and Pink Current

Information tiers.2

    Table IA.9 shows that the coefficient estimates on Pink No Info*Financial and Pink

Limited/Current*Financial are negative for the liquidity and positive for crash risk. More

importantly, the sum of the main effect and the corresponding interaction term is insignificantly

different from zero in all specifications, which implies that liquidity and crash risk for financial

companies does not vary across the Pink Sheets information tiers. These findings support our

interpretation that Pink Sheets information regimes drive the market quality effects in our main

analysis.




2
    Untabulated statistics show that about 60% of all firm-month observations in the PS tier history belong to the
    Pink No Information tier followed by the Pink Limited Information tier (about 20%) and the Pink Current
    Information tier (about 15%). To boost power, we combine the latter two categories, for which information
    availability is substantially greater than for the first group.

IA.10 Regime changes in the Pink Sheets

    In this section, we examine the effects of four major regime changes in the Pink Sheets that

were aimed at enhancing transparency in this market. 3 This analysis tightens identification

related to the role of information regimes in the OTC market because the regime changes are set

at the market level and hence exogenous to any given firm. If these initiatives are valued by

investors, we expect the changes to increase market quality.

    A first indication that these regime changes have been influential is the steady decline in the

number of firms quoted on the Bulletin Board (BB) but not the Pink Sheets.4 To analyze the

regime changes more formally, we create a Regime index that starts at zero and increases to 0.25

(as of June 2003), 0.50 (as of August 2007), 0.75 (as of June 2009) and to 1.00 (as of April

2010). We then introduce the interaction term BB × Regime index in order to capture the effects

of these regime changes on BB firms (for which the indicator variable BB is one) relative to

NBB firms (i.e., firms traded in the Pink Sheets or the Grey Market).

    Table IA.10 presents the results of regressions that relate liquidity and crash risk to the BB

indicator and the interaction term between BB and Regime Index. The analyses are based on BB

and NBB firm-month observations from the NASDAQ venue history (period: January 2001 to

October 2010). We present models with year-month and either industry or firm fixed effects.

    In June 2003, the Pink Sheets introduced Pink Link, an electronic messaging and automated trade negotiation
    service to replace the telephone-based communication process. In August 2007, they introduced the
    information tiers. In June 2009, they introduced Real-Time+, which offers real-time pricing data to all
    investors at no cost. Traditional exchanges make such data available only with a 15-minute delay. In April
    2010, the Pink Sheets refined their information tiers and introduced the OTCQB category (see Appendix 1.1 in
    the paper).
4
    Untabulated analyses show that the fraction of BB-only firms has fluctuated between 5% and 10% between
    mid-2003 (when we start to have data that allow us to reliably identify finer categories of OTC firms) and mid-
    2007. Starting in August 2007, the fraction declines and falls below 1% in 2010. By October 2010, there are
    eight BB-only firms left in our sample.
                                                                                                                24
Thus, all models include a flexible time trend to capture general and unrelated changes in the

Pink Sheets market.

    The first two specifications show that market liquidity is generally higher for BB firms.

However, the coefficient estimate on the interaction term is negative, implying that the liquidity

advantage for BB stocks relative to NBB stocks declines over time. In fact, the combined effect

at the end of the sample period (when the regime index takes a value of 1) is close to zero

suggesting that, by October 2010, liquidity for NBB stocks is close to that for BB firms. The

third and fourth specifications illustrate that the results for crash risk are similar. Specifically,

BB stocks initially have lower crash risk, but stocks solely quoted in the NBB catch up over

time.

    Overall, the results in this section show that the market quality advantage (i.e., higher

liquidity and lower crash risk) of dually-quoted BB stocks relative to stocks that are solely

quoted in the NBB has declined over time. This advantage seems to have disappeared steadily as

a result of successive regime changes in the Pink Sheets.

This table presents regression analyses relating liquidity and crash risk to regulatory changes in the Pink Sheets
markets. For details on the proxies for liquidity (t) and crash risk (t to t+2), see Table 3 in the paper. All regressions
are estimated at the firm-month level and include year-month and either industry or firm fixed effects. The analyses
are based on the NASDAQ venue history (period: January 2001 to October 2010) and include only firm-month
observations from the OTC market (BB and NBB). BB is a trading venue indicator for firms traded on the OTC
Bulletin Board. Regime index is an ordinal variable that increases with major reforms in the Pink Sheets regulatory
regime. It takes the value of 0 (from the start of the sample period until May 2003), 0.25 (from June 2003 to July
2007), 0.5 (from August 2007 to May 2009), 0.75 (from June 2009 to March 2010) and 1 (from April 2010 to the
end of the sample period). We also include, but do not report the coefficients on, indicators for SEC filing and
manual inclusion status, lagged control variables and price-level controls (see Tables 4 and 5 in the paper for
details). The analyses are subject to the following filters: for the liquidity regressions, we exclude months in which
firms change their trading venue and/or the variable Regime index increases; for the crash risk regressions, the
month of and the six months before such changes are excluded. The table reports OLS coefficient estimates and (in
parentheses) t-statistics. The t-statistics are based on standard errors clustered by firm. ***, **, * indicate statistical
significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels (two-tailed), respectively.

IA.11 Extending the fixed effects structure

      In this section, we provide additional analyses extending the fixed effects structure in our

main models. These analyses gauge the sensitivity of our findings to unobserved industry as

well as geographic shocks to mitigate concerns about omitted variables.                To control for

(observed and unobserved) economic shocks that are specific to certain industries, we interact

industry and year-month fixed effects (see Panel A of Table IA.11). Likewise, we control for

economic shocks that are geographic in nature by including State of Headquarters * year-month

fixed effects (see Panel B) and State of Incorporation * year-month fixed effects (see Panel C).

We also estimate models that include interactions between the trading venue indicators and firm

characteristics, such as return volatility and size, to allow for different coefficients on the key

control variables by venue (not tabulated). We find that these extensions do not materially alter

the coefficient estimates for our key variables Manual and SEC. Thus, the findings reported in

the paper are robust to these extensions. This analysis further mitigates concerns that omitted

variables or unobserved shocks drive our SEC reporting and manual inclusion results.

This table presents regression analyses relating liquidity and crash risk to the SEC filing and manual inclusion status
of the sample firms. For details on the proxies for liquidity (t) and crash risk (t to t+2), see Table 3 in the paper. The
basic research design is the same as in Table 5 in the paper, and uses firm-month observations from all venues. In
this table, we enhance the basic design by including extended fixed effects. In Panel A, we add interacted industry x
year-month fixed effects to capture shocks that are specific to certain industries. In Panel B (Panel C), we add
interacted state of headquarters x year-month (state of incorporation x year-month) fixed effects to control for
shocks that are geographic in nature. The table reports OLS coefficient estimates and (in parentheses) t-statistics.
The t-statistics are based on standard errors clustered by firm. ***, **, * indicate statistical significance at the 1%,

IA.12 Short selling in the OTC market

    In this section, we provide evidence on how difficult it is to short sell stock in the OTC

market. Table IA.12 presents statistics on the supply of stock lending for short selling at the

firm-quarter level. The analysis is based on a dataset that includes information on the supply of

lendable stocks and covers the period 2006Q3 to 2010Q3.5

    Panel A shows that the dataset covers only a fraction of our sample. However, coverage

varies systematically as data are more likely to be available for firms in regulated trading venues

and – within trading venues – for firms that have higher market values. For example, data

coverage is 21.5% for firms in the Bulletin Board (BB) but only 4.3% for firms in the Grey

Market. The median market value is $18.8 million for covered BB firms compared to $9.0

million for the full BB sample. To the extent that stocks of large firms are more likely to be

subject to short selling (e.g., D’Avolio, 2002), the dataset therefore overestimates the prevalence

of short selling activity.

    Panel B illustrates that the supply of lendable stocks is negligible in the OTC market, even

for the subsample of larger firms with available data. There is no supply at all for more than half

of the firm-quarters in the BB and the NBB (Pink Sheets and Grey Market). The mean supply of

lendable stocks across these firm-quarters is $670,000 or 1.46% relative to market value. This

evidence is very different from the statistics in Prado et al. (2016) who focus on U.S. stocks at

traditional exchanges over the same period. They document an average supply of 20.02%

relative to market value.

    We are very grateful to Pedro Saffi for running our sample through his dataset of stock lending supply. See
    Prado et al. (2016) for details on the data.
                                                                                                            29
      Taken together, the analysis in this section provides strong evidence that short selling is

extremely difficult in the OTC market. Consequently, even sophisticated investors will find it

hard, if not impossible, to correct overpricing in this market.
