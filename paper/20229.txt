                                              ABSTRACT

We developed and experimentally evaluated four novel educational programs delivered online: an
informational brochure, a visual interactive tool, a written narrative, and a video narrative. The programs
were designed to inform people about risk diversification, an essential concept for financial decision-
making. The effectiveness of these programs was evaluated using the RAND American Life Panel.
Participants were exposed to one of the programs, and then asked to answer questions measuring financial
literacy and self-efficacy. All of the programs were found to be effective at increasing self-efficacy,
and several improved financial literacy, providing new evidence for the value of programs designed
to help individuals make financial decisions. The video was more effective at improving financial
literacy scores than the written narrative, highlighting the power of online media in financial education.

1. Introduction

Over the past thirty years, individuals have had to become increasingly responsible for

their own financial security after retirement. Prior to the 1980s, many Americans relied

mainly on Social Security and employer-sponsored defined benefit (DB) pension plans.

Today, by contrast, individuals are increasingly turning to defined contribution (DC)

plans and Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) to help finance their retirement years.

The transition to the DC retirement saving model has the advantage of permitting more

worker flexibility and labor mobility than in the past, yet it imposes on workers a greater

responsibility to plan, save, invest, and decumulate retirement wealth sensibly. Thus,

retirement security will depend more and more on individuals’ saving and planning

decisions.

       Unfortunately, studies show that few individuals plan for retirement, and fewer

develop and follow through on a financial plan for retirement (Lusardi and Mitchell,

2007a, 2008, 2009, 2011a,b). Financial literacy, and specifically the knowledge of

financial concepts that are the basis for financial decision-making, is one important

predictor of retirement planning, not just in the US but also worldwide (Lusardi and

Mitchell, 2011c). In addition to knowledge of interest compounding and inflation, risk

diversification has been singled out as a concept that is critically important for retirement

planning and for several other financial decisions (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2011a,b,c, 2014;

Lusardi and De Bassa Scheresberg, 2013). Self-efficacy with regard to financial decision-

making also plays a role in the likelihood that an individual will follow through with

retirement planning (Gutter, Copur, and Garrison, 2009; Shockey and Seiling, 2004). As

employers move to give employees more responsibility for their own financial security in



                                                 2
retirement, ensuring that workers are well equipped to make financial decisions becomes

increasingly important.

       Given the pressing need to improve financial literacy among individuals, financial

education programs have become an important topic of research (Bernheim, Garrett, and

Maki, 2001; Bernheim and Garrett, 2003; Lusardi and Mitchell 2007b, 2014; Atkinson,

2008). While findings are still mixed, there is emerging evidence that financial education

can be made effective (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2014). However, recruiting individuals into

educational seminars is a difficult task, and educational programs often require full-time

instructors or counselors. This makes seminars costly and hence difficult to scale up.

Research also finds that those consumers who need help the most are the least likely to

seek various types of counseling (Meier and Sprenger, 2013).

       The recent connectivity of most households to the Web provides an opportunity to

develop and bring new educational materials to users quickly and efficiently. Moreover,

interventions delivered via the Web could be successful in attracting users due to ease of

accessibility and low time commitment requirements. In this paper, we focus on the

development and evaluation of new web-based educational programs aimed at explaining

the concept of risk diversification. Understanding risk diversification is fundamental both

to optimally allocating wealth and to retirement planning, yet most individuals do not

have a solid grasp of the concept. In fact, when responding to a battery of questions

measuring financial literacy, the majority of individuals fare particularly poorly on

questions related to risk and risk diversification (e.g., Lusardi and Mitchell, 2009,

2011a,b,c, 2014; Lusardi, Mitchell, and Curto, 2012; van Rooij, Lusardi, and Alessie,

2011, 2012).




                                                3
           We designed four different educational programs for delivery online: an

informational brochure, an interactive visual tool, a written narrative, and a video

narrative. All of these programs are designed to improve knowledge of risk

diversification but differ substantially from any previous financial education programs

both because they make use of extensive research on financial literacy and for the

innovative ways in which they communicate the information.

           We evaluated the effectiveness of the educational programs that we developed

using a representative sample of individuals age 20+ from the RAND American Life

Panel (ALP). 1 Eight hundred ninety-two (892) ALP participants were randomized to

receive one of the four programs or were assigned to a control group. After being

exposed to the program, participants completed short questionnaires aimed at evaluating

their knowledge of basic financial concepts related to risk diversification, confidence in

their financial literacy, and self-efficacy. The programs were designed to appeal to young

adults, but were evaluated for use by young and older adults.

           Our main results are as follows: (1) videos were most effective at improving

financial literacy scores and increasing levels of confidence in financial knowledge; (2)

the visual tool increased confidence in financial knowledge, but did not appear to have an

effect on financial literacy scores; (3) participants who were exposed to a video had

significantly higher financial literacy scores than those who were exposed to a written

narrative; and (4) all of the treatments were effective at increasing self-efficacy. Overall

our results provide new evidence for the value of online programs as new ways to

improve financial literacy.

       This paper makes three main contributions to the existing literature on financial

literacy and financial education. First, we show that interventions, even short-duration

ones, can help improve financial literacy, a finding that speaks to the widespread lack of

financial knowledge in the population. Second, interactive programs, such as videos and

visual tools, can be particularly effective in educating individuals about complex

concepts such as risk diversification, a finding consistent with the burgeoning interest in

games and similar tools designed to improve financial literacy. Third, not just financial

literacy but also confidence and self-efficacy can be affected by relatively short-duration

interventions, a finding that can be particularly important for some demographic groups,

such as women.



2. Narratives and Visual Tools

The narratives and visual tools that we developed are grounded in evidence-based

research. For example, in the social sciences, narratives have been established as a

method that is effective for creating cognitive involvement and affecting comprehension

and behavior change. In the field of visual analytics, visual tools have been established as

a way to shift information processing to the human perceptual system and nudge

behavior. However, the use of narratives and visuals (interactive or not) in the financial

literacy domain has remained relatively under-explored. We explain each method in turn.



2.1 Narratives

Narratives are an established method of creating cognitive involvement and emotional

immersion, changing minds, and generating a desire to change course (Bruner, 1987).

Narratives are widely adopted in adult education with demonstrated effects on


                                                5
motivation, comprehension, and recall (Norris, Guilbert, Smith, Hakimelahi, and Phillips,

2005; Davidhizar and Lonser, 2003). Narratives have also been used to improve health

literacy and health-related behavior change (Michielutte, Bahnson, Dignan, and

Schroeder, 1992; Petraglia, 2007; Corby, Enguídanos, and Kay, 1996) and findings

suggest that public perceptions of risk may be shaped more by narratives than by

calculations (Mairal, 2008). While still underused in the area of financial literacy,

narratives could prove to be a natural extension from the health field and well suited to

overcoming the mix of disinterest, anxiety, and non-comprehension associated with

financial issues. In another paper, we use videos to explain basic financial literacy

concepts and show that they affect both knowledge and behavior (Heinberg, Hung,

Kapteyn, Lusardi, Samek, and Yoong, 2014).

           We made use of our team’s expertise in financial literacy, marketing, and

linguistics to create narratives that are powerful both in terms of comprehension and

communication.2 The narratives that we developed were delivered in the format of either

a written story or a video in which actors performed the story. Thus, we were able to

evaluate the effectiveness of both the concept and the mode of delivery. In comparing the

written and video medium, we respected the stylistic and narrative norms of the genres,

giving the reader/viewer the kind of contemporary written anecdote and short (three-

minute) online video to which they may be accustomed. The narrative involved people

engaged in a familiar activity (packing to move) and discussing a financial issue of

personal relevance: what to do with a major monetary gift (see Appendix A for the

script). The story was used to describe and explain risk diversification.



       2
          Our project combines the expertise of financial literacy economists, behavioral economists, visual
analytics experts, psychologists, and linguists.
                                                         6
2.2 Visual tools

Individuals often struggle with processing information that requires extensive

calculations—this type of processing requires a high level of numeracy, which many

individuals do not have (Lusardi, 2012). Graphical representations may be an ideal

approach for overcoming this problem because they shift information processing to the

perceptual system, improving understanding of the concept presented and allowing

decision-makers to quickly learn from trends and patterns in the data (Lurie and Mason,

2007). Related work has found that interactive visual presentations (or visual analytic

tools) encourage exploration of the decision space and reduce search effort (Rudolph,

Savikhin, and Ebert, 2009; Savikhin, Lam, Fisher, and Ebert, 2011; Savikhin, 2012).

      One of our goals in this project is to compare the effectiveness of information

presented in an interactive format with the effectiveness of the same information

delivered in a traditional way, for example via a brochure. Consequently, we developed a

two-page brochure and an interactive visual tool that displayed the same information

about risk diversification in a portfolio setting. Both were aimed at clarifying the

relationship between risk and return and explaining how investing in many assets can

reduce risk. The visual tool allowed interactivity and therefore supported reasoning about

data through “what if” analysis (i.e., analysis based on key visual analytics concepts—see

Keim et al., 2008; Thomas and Cook, 2005). The brochure was made available online;

but in practice, the brochure is in a format that could be printed out and handed to

participants. However, by posting it online we can directly compare it to the visual tool.

      The visual tool that we developed, FinVis (see Figure 1), is a self-contained

educational program that assists the user with understanding key concepts about risk and

risk diversification and imparts actionable knowledge. This interactive tool has four main

                                                7
components: (1) an introduction that describes the way the tool should be used, (2) a

tutorial that introduces risk diversification and demonstrates the concept visually, (3) an

interactive feature that allows the user to explore the tool and make his/her own choices,

and (4) an outcome screen that displays feedback to the user about whether the choices

made were relatively more or less risky and whether the user successfully diversified a

hypothetical portfolio (see Appendix B). Both the tool and brochure use the same visual

representation, i.e., a cone that shows the range of outcomes, as this was found to be an

effective way to communicate risk in prior laboratory studies (Rudolph, Savikhin, and

Ebert, 2009) and is similar to the representation of risk in a recent related paper

(Kaufmann, Weber, and Haisley, 2013).



2.3 Confidence and Self-Efficacy

The programs we developed may also have an effect on increasing levels of confidence

and self-efficacy surrounding financial decisions. According to Bandura’s (1989) social

cognitive theory, self-efficacy expectations influence behavior change. Self-efficacy is

the belief in one’s own ability to perform successfully in a particular situation. For

example, an individual’s belief that he/she will be able to diversify his/her portfolio is a

self-efficacy expectation. Social cognitive theory predicts that self-efficacy helps induce

changes in financial behavior. In fact, related work has established a link between

educational programs that increase self-efficacy and improved financial decision-making

(Shockey and Seiling, 2004). In addition, self-efficacy and confidence have been

associated with improved decision-making in the health domain (Holden, 1991).

      Social cognitive theory describes several methods of strengthening self-efficacy.

Vicarious experience is one of the most important methods and consists of observing the


                                                8
behavior of others. Presenting narratives or videos that describe behaviors of other

individuals should bolster self-efficacy. In fact, previous work has used video-based

rather than live modeling to improve self-efficacy (Gist, 1989). Additional psychological

and social marketing research indicates that narratives of a variety of formats can inspire

behavior change. Previous research has found that narratives can be effective in

generating behavior change and improving motivation through self-efficacy, especially in

the health domain. Moreover, keeping information content constant, presenting narrative

financial education materials in the format of videos rather than written stories may also

significantly impact self-efficacy (Heinberg et al. 2014).

      According to social cognitive theory, a second method for improving self-efficacy

is mastery experience (Bandura, 1989). Mastery experience involves the help of a trained

professional who facilitates completion of step-by-step goals. The creation of the FinVis

tool was an effort to recreate an environment where the user can engage in the task and

meet goals in a short time frame. The tool acts as the “expert,” guiding the user through

the process of diversifying a portfolio. While using visual tools to provide mastery

experience is relatively new in this domain, we believe it has the potential to increase the

effectiveness of the program. Visual analytic tools have been found to increase

confidence in financial portfolio selection tasks performed in a laboratory (Savikhin et

al., 2011). Our measures allow us to determine whether our interventions affect

confidence in knowledge and self-efficacy (where self-efficacy is confidence in one’s

abilities to diversify a portfolio).



3. Evaluation




                                                9
To evaluate the impact of the programs on knowledge, confidence, and self-efficacy, we

designed a randomized experiment using the ALP. The ALP is a representative panel

composed of approximately 6,000 US households who are regularly interviewed over the

Internet (information on ALP sampling is provided in Appendix C). Data routinely

collected in the ALP include a wide array of demographic and economic characteristics.

The experiment was fielded from June to September 2012.

        Eight hundred and ninety-two (892) ALP participants were included in the

evaluation.3 Participants were randomized into one of the four treatment groups or into

the control group, with at least 100 participants in each treatment cell (see Table 1).

Participants randomized into the control group did not receive any treatment. Participants

randomized into treatment received one of four educational programs—(i) a video, (ii) a

written narrative, (iii) a brochure, (iv) an interactive visual tool—and then were asked to

answer a set of questions, like the control group. The experimental design allows us to

compare each treatment group with the control group, providing a rigorous measure of

the effectiveness of each program on the basis of knowledge, confidence, and self-

efficacy. Moreover, we can compare the value of added interactivity and engagement by

comparing the treatment group exposed to the visual tool to the treatment group exposed

to the brochure and the treatment group exposed to the video to the treatment group

exposed to the written narrative. The first row of Table 1 shows the total number of

participants by treatment, while the third row shows the number of participants who were

able to access the programs (accessibility is discussed in greater detail in the next

section.)

                                    [TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE]

3
  All but six people completed the entire evaluation, including exposure to the program and responding to
the questionnaire at the end.
                                                        10
        The questionnaire that we developed consisted of five short, multiple-choice

questions, with one question focused on self-efficacy specific to risk diversification (Q1)

three questions focused on knowledge of risk diversification (Q2-Q4), and one question

focused on confidence in the knowledge of risk diversification (Q5). The precise wording

of the questions is below:

   1.   If I need to make an investment decision, I can select a mix of investments that are in line with
        how much risk I want to take on.
            a.   Not at all true
            b.   Hardly true
            c.   Moderately true
            d.   Exactly true


   2.   In general, investments that are riskier tend to provide higher returns over time than investments
        with less risk.
            a.   True
            b.   False
            c.   Don’t know


   3.   Which of the following is an accurate statement about investment returns?
            a.   Usually, investing $5,000 in shares of a single company is safer than investing $5,000 in
                 a fund which invests in shares of many companies in different industries
            b.   Usually, investing $5,000 in shares of a single company is less safe than investing $5,000
                 in a fund which invests in shares of many companies in different industries
            c.   Usually, investing $5,000 in shares of a single company is equally as safe as investing
                 $5,000 in a fund which invests in shares of many companies in different industries.
            d.   Don’t know


   4.   Suppose you are a member of a stock investment club. This year, the club has about $200,000 to
        invest in stocks and the members prefer not to take a lot of risk. Which of the following strategies
        would you recommend to your fellow members?
            a.   Put all of the money in one stock
            b.   Put all of the money in two stocks
            c.   Put all of the money in a stock index fund that tracks the behavior of 500 large firms in
                 the United States
            d.   Don’t know


   5.   How confident are you that you have a grasp of how risk changes when choosing a different mix
        of investments?
            a.   Extremely confident
            b.   Very confident
                                                        11
           c.   Somewhat confident
           d.   Not very confident
           e.   Not at all confident



       Our working assumption is that financial literacy, confidence, and self-efficacy

are all relevant for behavior and are important components of financial capability. While

financial literacy provides a basic tool for decision-making, confidence and self-efficacy

can proxy for the likelihood of taking action based on the (actual or newly acquired)

knowledge of the individual.



4. Summary of Results

       Table 2 provides a summary of the characteristics of participants. We can

correlate participant responses with demographic information, including age, gender, race

and ethnicity, family income, educational attainment, and number of members in the

household. The sample is about 80% Caucasian, 11% African-American, and 15%

Hispanic. The average highest educational attainment level of this sample is “some

college, no degree” (bracketed) and the average household income is $40,000–$49,999

(bracketed). About 55–65% of respondents are female. The minimum age of participants

is 18, while the average age is 49.5 with a standard deviation of 16.

                                  [ TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE ]

       We should note that participants needed certain updates to their computers in

order to view the videos or use the visual tool, and it is possible that some participants

chose to skip these programs due to slow download speeds. After we received comments

from early respondents about difficulty with accessing the tools, videos, and brochures,

we added a question to the survey asking whether the respondent was able to see the tool,


                                                12
video, or brochure.4 Approximately 81% of asked respondents were able to view the

brochure, 76% were able to view the videos, and 65% were able to use the visual tool.

Consequently, in the analysis that follows, we provide measures of the effect on the

subsample that was “treated” (those who actually accessed the programs), of the “intent-

to-treat” effect (all respondents in the treatment conditions, disregarding access), and of

the “treatment-on-treated” effect. In order to measure the “treatment-on-treated” effect,

which controls for selection bias in subjects’ abilities to view the programs, we used

instrumental variables (IV) regressions where randomly assigned treatment status is used

to instrument for participation (Angrist and Pischke, 2008).

        In the analysis of results that follows, sections 4.1 and 4.2 provide results based

on t-tests and Chi squared tests. Section 4.3 uses regressions and demographic controls as

a robustness check and introduces the “treatment on treated” IV estimates.




4.1 Financial Literacy

4.1.1 Overall Knowledge

        We turn first to the questions measuring knowledge of risk and risk

diversification, our questions Q2–Q4. While Q2 and Q3 are knowledge questions, Q4

was designed to test hypothetical decision-making ability. Overall, the proportion of

correct answers across the three questions was 71% among the control group and

between 73% and 80% among the treatment groups (see Table 3). Columns 1 and 2 of

Table 5 present results from ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions in which the

dependent variable is the proportion of correct responses to Q2–Q4. These regressions

4
 Because the question was added after the survey began, only 50–97% of respondents, depending on
condition, received the question.
                                                  13
use the full sample, not controlling for whether subjects accessed the program. The

proportion of correct responses is higher by 8–10 percentage points for all participants

randomized to the video treatment, and this result is statistically significant (Columns 1-

2). In addition, when including demographic controls (Column 2), we also see a positive

and significant effect not only for the video but also for the brochure (increase of 8

percentage points).

           Result 1: When controlling for demographic characteristics, exposing individuals

to a video or a brochure that explains risk diversification improves their financial

literacy relative to the control group.

                                 [TABLE 3, 5 ABOUT HERE]

4.1.2 “Don’t Know” Responses

           Each of the questions listed several responses (one of which was correct) that the

participant was asked to choose from, including “don’t know.” 5 Choosing the “don’t

know” option may indicate lack of confidence or lack of knowledge. Columns 3–4 of

Table 5 present OLS regression results in which the dependent variable is the proportion

of “don’t know” responses. Both the video and the brochure decrease the proportion of

“don’t know” responses by almost 10 percentage points relative to the control group, a

finding that becomes even stronger when we control for demographic characteristics. The

visual tool also decreases the proportion of “don’t know” responses relative to the control

group, though this effect is smaller in magnitude and only significant at the 10% level

when we control for demographic characteristics.

           Result 2: The video, brochure, and visual tool all decrease the likelihood of

answering “don’t know” to financial literacy questions.

       5
        For a discussion of the importance of “do not know” answers, see Lusardi and Mitchell
(2011a,b,c; 2014).
                                                      14
       The regressions also allow us to compare the video with the written narrative to

assess which is the more effective method of improving financial literacy. In the OLS

regressions where we control for a set of demographic characteristics, we find a much

larger improvement in financial literacy (as measured by the number of correct responses

or the number of “do not know” answers) when exposing individuals to a video rather

than a written narrative.

       Result 3: The video is significantly better than the written narrative at improving

the proportion of correct answers and reducing the rate of “don’t know” responses.



4.2 Confidence and Self-Efficacy

Confidence and self-efficacy are measured using responses to Q5 and Q1, respectively.

On average, confidence in the control group is 2.77–2.84 (between not very confident and

somewhat confident) while confidence in the treatment groups is 2.98–3.42 (between

somewhat confident and very confident) (see Table 4). Table 5 (columns 5–6) presents

OLS regression results in which the dependent variable is confidence in financial

knowledge. The video and brochure significantly improved confidence compared to the

control group. When we control for demographic characteristics, we find that all

treatments significantly improved confidence compared to the control group.

      Result 4: All treatments significantly improve confidence in financial knowledge

relative to the control group.

                                 [ TABLE 4 ABOUT HERE]

      Turning to self-efficacy, we find that self-efficacy levels in the control group are

2.98 on average (between hardly true and moderately true) while self-efficacy levels in

the treatment groups are 3.33–3.41 on average (between moderately true and exactly

                                                15
true). While 50% of respondents in the treatment groups respond exactly true to the self-

efficacy question, only 26% of the control group does so. Columns 7–8 of Table 5

present OLS regression results in which the dependent variable is level of self-efficacy,

as measured in Q1. All treatments significantly improved self-efficacy compared to the

control group.

       Result 5: All treatments (video, narrative, visual tool, and brochure) significantly

improve self-efficacy levels relative to the control group.

         Our results also provide some indication that answers to the financial literacy

questions are related to levels of confidence and self-efficacy. Using a Spearman rank

correlation test, we find a significant and negative relationship between incidence of

“don’t know” responses and reported levels of confidence in knowledge (Spearman

coefficient, -0.46, p-value <0.01) and level of self-efficacy (Spearman coefficient, -0.38,

p-value <0.01). Likewise, correct responses to the financial literacy questions are

significantly and positively correlated with both confidence in knowledge (Spearman

coefficient, 0.43, p-value<0.01) and self-efficacy (Spearman coefficient 0.29, p-value

<0.01).6

         We can also look at mismatches between knowledge and levels of confidence and

self-efficacy, which could be considered a measure of overconfidence. For example, we

count the number of participants who do not provide correct responses to the financial

literacy questions, yet report that they are confident in the subject matter. We classify a

subject who responds very confident or extremely confident in Q5, but actually provides

at least one incorrect response in Q2, Q3, or Q4 as “overconfident.” Out of 413


6
  These coefficients are also statistically significant when evaluating correlations separately by treatment
for all cases (i.e., correlating “don’t know” and self-efficacy within written narrative, visual tool, brochure,
and video separately).
                                                          16
participants who answered at least one question incorrectly, 57 (13.8%) can be labeled as

overconfident using this measure. Overconfidence levels are 11.4% in the control group,

20% in the video group, 9.1% in the written narrative group, 12.3% in the brochure

group, and 23.0% in the visual tool group. The visual tool appears to significantly

increase overconfidence relative to control when using this measure (Wilcoxon rank-sum

p-value <0.05). Wilcoxon rank-sum tests do not indicate significant differences in

overconfidence relative to control for the other treatments.7

        We also observe several effects of demographic characteristics on knowledge that

are reflective of general findings in the literature (e.g., Hung et al., 2009; Lusardi and

Mitchell, 2011b, 2014; Bucher-Koenen, Lusardi, Alessie, and van Rooij, 2012). First,

women tend to have a lower number of correct responses, more incidences of “don’t

know” responses, and lower confidence than men. Second, we tend to see negative

effects on correct answers and self-efficacy and positive effects on “don’t know”

responses for African American and Hispanic respondents relative to Caucasian

counterparts. Third, age seems to be positively correlated with correct responses and

negatively correlated with the proportion of “don’t know” responses—older adults are, at

baseline, more knowledgeable and more confident—in line with related work finding

lower financial literacy of younger adults (Lusardi, Mitchell, and Curto, 2010; Yoong,

2011). Fourth, higher household income is associated with more correct responses on

financial literacy questions and higher self-efficacy measures. Finally, educational

attainment is positively correlated with correct answers, confidence, and self-efficacy and

negatively correlated with the proportion of “don’t know” responses. These findings

confirm results from other studies and can speak to the quality of our data.
7
  A t-test finds that overconfidence in the video treatment is higher than overconfidence in the control
group (t=-1.5315, p=0.0635). However the Wilcoxon rank-sum test finds this difference to be insignificant
(z=-1.527, p=0.1268).
                                                       17
4.3 Treatment on Treated Estimation—Instrumental Variables Regression

Table 6 provides the instrumental variables (IV) regressions using treatment assignment

as an instrument (“treatment on treated” effects). In columns 1 and 2 in Table 6, we see

that the video treatment significantly increases the proportion of correct responses (by

11–13 percentage points). The brochure and written narrative treatments also increase the

proportion of correct responses when demographic controls are included (significant for

brochure and marginally significant for written narrative), while the visual tool does not

show any significant effects on the proportion of correct responses. Possible reasons for

the lack of effectiveness of the visual tool is the small proportion of people able to view

the tool, as well as the small sample size in general (53 respondents report that they could

view the tool, which constitutes 65% of the proportion of people (64%) who are asked. In

any case, both OLS and IV estimates point to similar findings for the effectiveness of the

video and brochure.

       Columns 5 and 6 in Table 6 provide IV regressions on confidence in knowledge.

In this case, the IV estimates support the finding that confidence is increased in the video

and visual tool treatments. The written narrative and brochure treatments have significant

positive effects on confidence but only when demographic controls are included.

Columns 7 and 8 provide IV regressions on self-efficacy. All of the treatments continue

to display positive and significant effects on self-efficacy, with the highest coefficient

estimates for the visual tool treatment.

       Chow tests comparing the written narrative to the video and the brochure to the

visual tool reveal some differential effects between interactive and static treatments. The

effect of the video was significantly different from the effect of the written narrative on


                                               18
the proportion of correct responses (F(1, 871)=3.87, p < 0.05), the proportion of “don’t

know” answers (F(1, 876)=4.80, p < 0.05), and on self-efficacy (F(1, 862)=4.03, p <

0.05). The brochure and visual tool did not differentially impact the proportion of correct

responses, the proportion of “don’t know” answers, or self-efficacy. However, the visual

tool was slightly more effective in improving confidence (F(1, 860)=3.76, p<0.10).

                              [TABLE 6 ABOUT HERE]


5. Discussion and Conclusion

We conducted a study on the ALP, a panel representative of the US population, assigning

participants to different types of educational programs (i.e., exposing them to a video, a

written narrative, a brochure, and a visual tool) and measuring their effects with a set of

questions designed to measure financial literacy, self-efficacy, and confidence in the area

of risk diversification. Our video and interactive tools are innovative in that they engage

the viewer and provide an easy and enhanced way of communicating information that

cannot be achieved by other methods. These were compared to their counterparts—a

brochure and written narrative. We find that the video was most effective at increasing

financial literacy (by increasing the proportion of correct responses to financial literacy

questions and decreasing “don’t know” responses) and improving confidence. The video

almost always outperformed the written narrative, while there were generally no

significant differences between the visual tool and the brochure. All of the programs,

including the written narrative, were effective at improving self-efficacy. The increased

confidence as a result of most programs is particularly strong and robust for the visual

tool and video treatments, in support of Bandura’s (1989) social cognitive theory.




                                               19
          Our results suggest that educational programs that engage the user emotionally or

physically, involving vicarious experience and mastery experience (such as watching a

video or using a visual tool), rather than text-based or passive educational programs (such

as reading a narrative), are key for making gains in both financial literacy and confidence

in financial knowledge. Static visual representations, such as those found in the brochure,

do not seem to fit with the Bandura social cognitive theory methods for increasing self-

efficacy. Yet we find that visual representations may help individuals to grasp complex

concepts such as risk and return.

          More research is needed to develop interactive visual tools that are easy to access.

On the other hand, with increasing technological innovation, there will be a greater range

of interactive visual tools that can be designed to help educate people on important life

skills.

          We would like to note that our methods are effective even though they are of short

duration and are delivered via the Internet. Thus, these programs can easily be scalable to

reach a large number of users. Since take-up is a major problem with existing educational

programs, future work should also investigate whether the same selection bias is present

in the take-up of online programs. In addition, future work should consider further

exploring the link between knowledge, confidence, self-efficacy, and actionable behavior

in practice.

Appendix A: Narratives

Videos can be accessed here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO6FPJw_E1Q


        The narrative was designed to explain and encourage risk diversification. In the narrative, two siblings
helping their grandparents move house debate how to invest the $12,000 gift they have received. Older sister Kate
advocates diversifying into different sectors and degrees of risk. She manages to convince younger brother Sam that
it’s unwise to put all his $12,000 into the company he works for just because the company is doing well. Both Kate
and Sam are young people at an early stage in their own earning and saving.

                                                   Written story


       Sam reflected for a moment. “Kate, what are you planning to do with it all? $12,000 each...”
       “I’m going to invest mine,” said Kate -- and she lowered her voice. “Grandma told me last night that she
wants each of us to have a little “nest egg”.”


        Sam chuckled. “Eggs. That ‘s one of Grandma’s favorite words.” And he imitated his grandmother’s voice:
“Sam, you listen to your Grandparents and don’t put all your eggs in one basket. We didn’t and you and your parents
have all been given a good start in life.”


        “You may laugh”, Said Kate, “ but we had a Planning for your Future seminar in my senior year, and they
also told us about not putting all our eggs in one basket. I’m going to spread the money around.”


       They both began emptying the highest kitchen shelf. Their grandmother had so many plates. What could she
possibly have wanted with them all?


       “But Kate, “ said Sam, “Why not just put it somewhere you know is safe? Some really really safe stock.”


       Kate shook her head: “Well, what is really really safe, Sam? Did you know that some really famous firms
have ended up going bust? Anyway, if you want to make your money grow over time, they said that you have to
take some risk.”


       “But what’s one have to do with the other?” protested Sam.


                                                        Video


SAM
What are you planning to do with the $12,000 they gave you?

KATE
I’m investing mine. Grandma told me last night that she wants each of us to have a little “nest egg”.

SAM
Eggs. That’s one of her favorite words. “Sam, you listen to your Grandparents and don’t put all your eggs in one
basket. We didn’t and you and your parents have all been
given a good start in life.” Kate smiles.

Appendix B: Visuals

The interactive visual tool can be accessed at: http://anyasamek.com/finvis/

       First, the visual tool explains risk and return (including the correlation between these two characteristics),
and explains the difference between stocks and (stocks) funds. Second, the tool provides an interactive explanation
of the benefits of diversification, both across stocks and funds. Third, the tool allows the user to choose a set of
(hypothetical) stocks and funds that are in line with his/her risk preferences.

        Figure 1 is a screenshot of the risk cone. The visual displayed represents the amount of money invested in
hypothetical Year 1 (the left Y-axis) and the probable values that the portfolio may take on in hypothetical Year 2
(the right Y-axis). The risk cone uses a “risk gradient” that is darker for more likely outcomes and lighter for less
likely outcomes. This screenshot features a portfolio with several different assets, and the amount of risk that each
asset contributes is highlighted in a different color for each asset. Assets added at the beginning of the decision
period appear in the middle of the cone, while assets added later appear on the outside of the cone. An important
interactive characteristic of the risk cone is the ability of the user to “sample possible outcomes.” When the user
clicks this button, he/she is able to view a possible outcome drawn from the underlying distribution, which appears
as a small arrow directly on the risk cone.

                               Figure B1: Visualized Risk and Return in FinVis 2.0




        In the tutorial component of the tool, “Kate” and “Sam” ask questions about risk and return, which are
answered when the user clicks on action buttons on the screen that adjust the visual and explain the key concepts.
Figure B2 provides a screenshot of one of the tutorial screens. 5 screens are used to explain the key concepts, and
the user can go back to screens to repeat explanations that were confusing. Each of the tutorial pages utilizes the
core visual tool from Figure 1. In the first part of the tutorial, we introduce a more risky and a less risky fund. Kate
invests in the more risky fund, while Sam invests in the less risky fund. Second, we introduce the idea that while
year-to-year returns may be volatile, returns even out and come closer to the expected return over time. Third, we
introduce risk diversification, whereby Kate invests in several different stocks to reduce her risk, while Sam invests
in several stocks of the same type, which do not reduce his risk (they were generated with a correlation of 1.0).
Finally, Kate and Sam discuss the difference between stocks and funds, and Kate points out the benefit of funds,
which already contain many different stocks.




                                                              34

        The user then proceeds to the interactive component (see Figure B3). The user is given 5 minutes to allocate
$5,000 hypothetical dollars to his/her portfolio. The funds and stocks from the tutorial are possible options for the
user, and the user can add, modify and remove the funds and stocks and watch the risk cone update in real time. The
tool tracks all user actions, and also records the final choice that the user made.


                                         Figure B3: Interactive Component




        After the user is finished making his/her allocation choices, or after the 5 minutes has run out, the user
proceeds to the outcome screen. The outcome screen provides feedback to the user about several key concepts. First,
the user receives feedback about whether he/she invested in all stocks, all funds, or a combination. Users who
invested in funds are congratulated on greater diversification. Users who invested only in stocks receive the
suggestion that investing in funds can lead to greater diversification. Then users are informed that they took on some
risk – and receive feedback in the form of a list of the lowest and highest bound numbers for the risk cone. Because
individuals have different risk preferences, the guidance offered is simply to ask the user to reflect on whether this is
a suitable risk profile for him/her.
       As in Kroll, Levy, and Rapoport (1988), we generated artificial risk and return profiles for each stock and
fund, which are summarized in Appendix B.

Appendix C: ALP Sampling Procedures
ALP respondents have been recruited in one of four ways. Most were recruited from among individuals age 18+
who were respondents to the Monthly Survey (MS) of the University of Michigan’s Survey Research Center (SRC).
A subset of respondents (approximately 500) were recruited through a snowball sample; here respondents were
given the opportunity to suggest friends or acquaintances who might also want to participate. Respondents without
Internet (both in the Michigan sample and the snowball respondents) were provided with so-called WebTVs
(http://www.webtv.com/pc/), which allows them to access the Internet using their television and a telephone line.
The technology allows respondents who did not have previous Internet access to participate in the panel and
furthermore use the WebTVs for browsing the Internet or use email. A new group of respondents (approximately
500) has recently been recruited after participating in the National Survey Project, created at Stanford University
with SRBI. This sample was recruited in person, and at the end of their one-year participation, they were asked
whether they were interested in joining the ALP. Most of these respondents were given a laptop and broadband
Internet access. Finally, in recent years, recruiting of panel members is based on Address Based Sampling (ABS),
where once again potential respondents are given a laptop to allow them to participate if they don’t have Internet
access yet. For more information about the ALP sample recruiting methodology as well as access to the data
collected in the ALP to date, the reader is referred to http://mmic.rand.org
