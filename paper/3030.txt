        EMPLOYMENT, WAGES, AND UNIONISM IN A MODEL OF THE
                AGGREGATE LABOR MARKET IN BRITAIN



                             ABSTRACT


        Two propositions figure prornir.ently in exDianatons for Srttas

comparatively low growth in employment:    first, the wage—setting

mechanism is insufficiently responsive to the growth of nemnp1oymnent

and. seccnd, there exists a well—defined negative causal relaticnship

from   wages to employment with the features of a conventional labor

demand function.    Using aggregate annual observations from 1953 to 1979,

  find the evidence for a conventional labor demand curve to be fragile

and     find little support for the notion that trade union objectives are

unaffected by unemployment as some versions of the "insider—outsider"

hypothesis would maintain.    In general, the empirical results in this

paper emphasize that confident inferences about Britain's employment

record cannot be drawn from aggregate data.

      Britain's discouraging recori on employment during the last 15

years or so has resulted in the revival of the classical explanation for

unep1oyment:    wages have been consistently above market-clearing levels

and employers have responded by moving back on their labor demand

schedules.   This explanation in various guises has figured in many

accounts of the growth in unemployment including those in government

publications and in academic treatises.!"         The heart of this explanation

consists of' two propositions:        first, the wage—setting mechanism is

insufficiently responsive to the growth of unemployment and, second,

there exists a well—defined negative causal relationship from wages to

employment with the features of a conventional labor demand curve.           The

purpose of this paper is to present evidence relevant to both of these

propositions.

      The second proposition is the focus of the research reported in

the first part of the paper.         There is no doubt that, given the

resources available to economists, it is feasible to organize the              aruaI
movements in wages and employment in postwar Britatn in such            3   way- th.t
they   conform to something akin to    labor demand function.       ut       ict
being present at the discovery of this demand function, the reader'                t.s




normally left uninformed of the trail followed by the researcher tn

exploring    and ultimately locating the function and hence it s dtffiout

to   discern whether this employment—wage relationship i readily apparent

or its detection requires subtle and sensitive management of' the data.

Conseuently, it is impossible to know how much confidence to place in

the concept of an aggregate demand function for labor.
       This paper presents an array of'     empirical   results that might be of

assistance in evaluating the robustness of' the aggregate wage—employment

relationship.     In tact, quite early in my examination of this issue,                  I



stunibled   upon a formulation with the appearance of     a conventional labor

demand function, but I    then found it to be a delicate being, one that
was sensitive to small changes in specification.          It is not a

relationship that the data ef'f'ortlessly conform to.

        Having thus ientifie a relationship that (though not robust) has

claim to be labelled a labor demand function, I build upon this a wage-

3ettirlg ode1 that affords an opportunity to evaluate the other

proposition behin the popular story for the growth in unemployment, the

froposition that the mechanism determining wages is urresponsive with

respect to unemployment.     In tact, given the manner in which I

characterize the wage—setting process, this proposition takes the rorm

of examining whether, in pursuing their wage and employment objectives,
                                      —3—




trade unions take account of the unemployrent rate.       This is r-e1ate t

the "insider—outsider" hypothesis that has become popular in recent

years../    I express this proposition in such 3   ay   that it turn5 on the

value assumed by a parameter of the trade union's objective function and

I estimate this Parameter with aggregate time—series data.       Though aairi

unequivocal judgments are not permitted, the point estimates suggest the

goals of British unions have been sensitive to the level of

unemployment.

        Taken as a whole, the empirical work in this paper surely suggests

that aggregate British time—series observations do not allow confident

inferences to be drawn about two propositions central to the classical

unemployment hypothesis.    This does not necessarily negate this

hypothesis:     Britain's wage—setting procedures are decentralized and the

characterization of trade union wage pressure impeding the growth of

employment might be accurate in many labor markets and yet it is somehow

camouflaged in the aggregate data.      This is both a plausible and

testable proposition.    However,   disaggregated studies are unusual and
most studies (including this one) draw inferences from aggregated

data.   These data can certainly be organized to provide support for a

particular characterization of the workings of the British labor market,

but it should be recognized these are primarily exercises in

calibration, that is, quantifying the tnagnitude of presumed

relationships.    The aggregate data leave ample room for doubt about the

exi5tence of these relationships.

      For  references   to  the  literature on the    "insider—outsider"
hypothesis as well as a useful analysis, see Carruth and Oswald (1987).

                      II.   The Determinants of Employment


A.     Introduction
       The purpose of this section is to report the results c esttmatg
equations that might be interpreted as aggregate employment demand
functions.   It is appropriate to spell out my procedures here because
some respects they differ from those followed by some other researchers
on these issues.      First, the emphasis of this section is not one of
measuring the magnitude of presumed relationships.       Rather, the ernp'nasis

is on deternining     whether an eno1oyent equation can be   estirmated that
bears the characteristics of a stylized demand function.       In other
words, I do not presume the existence of a negative sign on wages in an

equation accounting for movements in aggregate employment, but instead I
ascertain what has to be done to generate this result.       The more

convoluted and contorted the specification of the equation ultimately
generating the appearance of a conventional labor demand function, the
less plausible is such a construct.
       Now, of course, given the cost of computing time nowadays and
given the availability ot observations on more and more variables, there
is absolutely no doubt      that a diligent researcher will in due course

unearth an equation desplaying the features of a labor demand function

even it the data have to be skillfully arranged and perhaps

misrepresented to do so.      The most natural way of achieving this goal is

to aunent a naive labor demand function (that is, one containing only

relative prices and an aggregate demand variable) with variables that do

not   appear in textbook labor demand functions, but whose presence can be
                                    -5—




 rationalized by an imaginative researcher.   For instance, at ne time or

another, purportedly employment demand functions have been estimated

that include as regressors the number of strikes, normal weekly hours of

work, a smoothed series on the gross capital stock, the devtation of

world trade from a trend, and the adjusted public sector deficit as a

percentage of potential gross domestic product../    Usually, quite

ingenious explanations are provided for the inclusion of these variables

and I am not going to argue that, in some sense, researchers have been

ill-advised to augment naive labor demand equations with these

variables.

       What I would argue is, first, it is often not clear whether the

presence of these auxiliary variables is necessary for the rest of the

equation to give the appearance of a conventional labor demand function

and, second, the usefulness of the pristine labor demand function is

compromised if it requires for its application the constancy of a whole

string of other variables about which economic analysis has sometimes

little to say.   In other words, the inclusion of te auxiliary variables

is not a matter of truth or falsehood; it is an issue of usefulness for

understanding and organizing economic phenomena.    If an exogenous

increase in real wages depresses employment, but only if strikes, work

hours, the capital stock, world trade, and government's budget deficit


3_I'The strikes and hours of work variables are used by Symons (982) in
his study of British manufacturing industry while the other variables
appear in Layard and Nickell (1986).   Layard and Nickell's world trade
variable is supposed to measure "real demand relative to potential
output."   Why is the volume of transactions any more a demand than a
supply variable and, in any event, how does the volume of exchanges
enter a demand function?
                                      —6—




are held Constant, then perhaps we should be diverting more research
resources into understanding the movements of the auxiliary varia1es

and less into real wages../     Consequently, in this study, I shall e

investigating the degree to which the aggregate data on employment and

other variables conform to a naive, unaugtnented, labor demand function.
       A
           word on identification is needed.     If emp1oynent and real dages

do not trace out the negative relationship implied y a naive demand

function, the rnost natural response is to invoke the identification

problen:     a positive employment—wage association reflecting labor supply

decisions has interfered with the negative slope implied by the labor

demand functton.     I believe this is not a persuasive objection in the

context of the British labor market.        First, standard exclusion

restrictions are applied to lend support to the interpretation of the

relationship as a demand function.!         Second, in a highly unionized

economy such as Britain's, I am extremely sceptical of the relevance to

most labor markets of a model whereby the wage is set through the

intersection of a conventional upward—sloping labor supply function and

a conventional downwards1oping demand function.         Surely, a more

appropriate characterization is a recursive one whereby wages are set by

ur1ion5 employers, or the representatives of government through

collective bargaining procedures and, with wages t1us determined, firms

make their employment decisions.     In this event, the a priori case for

    I maintain that what economists have contributed to an understanding
of movements over time in normal hours of work is meagre and that with
respect to strikes not much more.

      In particular, variables such as the level of unemployment benefits
are   excluded from the equation determining employment.

the observations on employment and real wages mapping cut a 1aor eran
f'unction        seems much more compelling.                  In such an economy, a labcr' 3up21Y
relationship           may involve the size of' the labor force and wages: that i.,
an tncrease in real wages may raise the number of' people who would li<e
to be employed on these terms and this                        will be       manifested in an
expansion of'          the   labor force.         This paper also reports the results frorr
some    sirnple specifications of' this relationship.

of regulation) and given a downward—sloping demand function for their

incorporates    the effects of any time—correlated omitted variables.

the absence of a compelling economic model, the case for complicated

trends is unconvincing.     Indeed, even a quadratic time trend is a little

disconcerting and I should be more comrortable with the estimates if

they prove to be independent of the presence of this trend.

      Equation (1)    is estimated with annual data for Britain from 1953

to 1979.     The estimation technique is instrumental variables where

current and lagged wages and lagged employment are treated as

endogenous.     Wages are endogenous Insofar as wage and employment

decisions    are made jointly.   Treating lagged employment as predetermined

would seem most inappropriate given the fact that relevant determinants

of employment are almost certainly omitted form equation ()      and these

omitted regressors affect employment in earlier years.      The empirical

application of almost any behavioral model of the dynamic demand for

inputs will imply that lagged values of the inputs are jointly

determined with the current values.      I am well aware a case can be made

for treating disposable income as endogenous and, indeed, some equations

were fitted allowing for this possibility.      The implications from this

inquiry were not meaningfully different from those reported.      The lag on

the regressors in equation (1) are conventionally justified in terms of
                                         _i 0—




some (usually unspecified)     costs of    adjustments.    Unfortunately, oni'

under the most restrictive of conditions i11 adjustnent cost rnoie]s

yield explicit expressions in which the lagged values of the regressors

with corresponding fixed coefficients accurately embody the effects of

such adjustment costs.

         The consequences of fitting equation (1) are shown in column            of

Table    2 and the estimates in the other columns show the consequences of
small    changes in the specification.      Thus the estimates in columns   1    and
2   provide support for restricting the effect of lagged employment to two

years.     Conventional t—tests allow us to dispense with contefnporaneous

disposable income and lagged values of the ratio of the prices of

capital to raw materials.      Columns 3,    4, 5, and 6 present, therefore,

more parsimonious versions of equation (1)         in which negative and

significant (by conventional standards) effects of current and lagged

real wages on employment are measured.

         These estimates provide empirical support for the notion of a

conventtonal employment demand function as applied to the aggregate

British economy.      But, unfortunately, this is not a robust relationship,

one that survives small alterations in specification.           For instance,

column 7   of   Table 2 simply removes the quadratic time trend from the

specitication in column 6 and our confidence in the negative effects of

real wages on employment is immediately challenged as is our inference

about the effect of energy and raw material prices on employment.           Or,

to provide another indication of the lack of robustness of these

results, the estimates in column 8 omit          et_2   from the specification in

column 6.     Again, our inferences are immediately Surrounded with much
greater uncertainty.      It is the effects of disposa1e tncome that tend
to be robust with respect to small changes in equation specification,
not the effects of wages.
      A common assumption In this literature is that the services from
physical capital are predeterrined with respect to employment
decisions.     I find the widespread use of this assumption quite
remarkable.    Even if the stocks of buildings and machines were fixed,
their use is certainly not.      However, what difference does it make to
our estimated employment equation If the user cost of capital is
replaced in equation (1) with a measure of the capital stock (whose
logarithm in year     t   is given by    kt)?   This is answered by the
estimates in Table 3.      A compelling case for a negative wage—elasticity
cannot be made from the estimates in Table 3 nor can a strong case be
made for employment being significantly affected by physical capital.
Henceforth, I maintain the assumption that the relevant regressor is the
user cost of capital.

C.    Interpretation
      There are several ways in which to rationalize the more

parsimonious specification in columns 3, 4,        5, and 6 of Table 2.   One is

the tollowin which starts with a static or desired (indicated by an

asterisk) demand for employment

                III.   A Structural Model of the Labor arket


A.      Introduction

        This section builds on the empirical findings earlier by offeririg

a structural model of wage and employment determination for the British

labor market.    The purpose of this structural model is not merely to

give quantitative expression to a popular account of how wages and

employment are set in a highly unionized econony, but also to do so in

such a way as to shed light on what has become a fasionable view of the

nature of union objectives.     This view holds that the objectives of

trade unions embrace the welfare of those currently employed, the so

called "insiders," and little or no weight is given to the un1p1oyed

who are "outsiders' to the wage determination process.      Thus a negative

employment shock reduces the size of the union's constituency and they

will raise their wage demands to levels that make it unprofitable for

the   firm subsequently to hire the unemployed.
       This "insider—outsider" distinction in union objectives appears to
have won a number of adherents although this is not     because   of frequent
or convincing corroboration of its central assumptions or implications
with the evidence.     Indeed, it runs counter to a long tradition of

working cla5s   solidarity   in British trade unionisn where the welfare of

the unemployed frequently figures in the stated concerns of both the

union leadership and the rank—and—file,      Of course, economists are

weaned at an early professional age of the fallacy that word.s

necessarily match behavior, but nevertheless most of us would feel more
                                         —18—




comfortable   if our models' postulates were not quite at odds wtth the

way in which the actors thought they were behaving.

        The model proposed and estinated here identifies tne"             urion as
the leader in setting wages and 'the" employer as the follower in

determining employment.        The strengths and weaknesses of this approach

have been discussed at length elsewhere although evidence of              its
eipirical   performarce   is   restricted to a small number of (sometimes

atypical) iabor markets.        It is surely    a plausible   characterization of

British labor markets where unions are often portrayed as having

considerable power in setting wages and where employers (or their

representatives) are allowed considerable discretion over the level of

employment.   The attractive feature of this model for empirical

researchers is that it allows for a convenient solution to what might be

an intractable bargaining problem.


B.      Specific Functional Forms

        Suppose the union has objectives defined over real wages net of

taxes    (1—i)w/(1+s)p, employment       e, and the size of the labor force          z,


where all the8e    variables   are   expressed in natural logarithms.           In

particular, posit the following expression for the goals of the union:



(6)     r(w,e,z)   -                     +   1)8(e   -        -   5   +




where
               -                     +                   +   3t
                                                   —19—




The     £'5    are stochastic terms incorporating omitted features of the

union's objectives.        Of course, a meaningful definition of objectives

requires        [(1—1)w/(1+s)P)t >                        and      e—          —




  —    1, et —   zt     Zn[1   —    (Ut/Zt))         —    (U/Z)t    and the unemployment rate

figures explicitly in the union's objectives.                        On the other hand, if

  =    0, the union cares about the employed only, the "insiders,' and th

size   of' the employed relative to the labor force (I.e., the unemployment

rate) is not of its concern.              The value of the parameter ,             therefore,
suggests the importance that the "outside' unemployed play in union

objectives.       Note also that by specIfying the reference level ot

wages,           to depend upon past values of wages, we permit current wage

goals to be molded by experience in the manner ct' habit persistence

models of consumption.             This   foriu1at1on        is also consistent with some

represertatioris of the role played in wage bargaining by "target" value8

or real wages.!         The parameter          e     is    closely related to the cyclical

variability of employment relative to that of wages:                        a value of      e



close to zero implies greater variability of erployment while                           0   close

to unity implies greater variability of wages.

         Aecording to the proposed bargaining model, the employer

determines employment          subject to the wage rate set by the trade union.
Suppose       the employment demand function is that represented by equation
(2) aunented by the partial adjustment equation (3)                        where the error

term in that partial adjustment equation is serially correlated.                                n


    See, for instance, Sargari (1980).  Note that the lagged value of
wages is treated as given when current wages are determined implying
that the unions are characterized here as not solving an intertemporal
problem that recognizes the evolution of                     their   wage objectives.
                                                 —20—




addition to allowing firms to adjust employment in                           response to the wage,

let us al3o permit an adjustment from the labor force (whose logarithm

in year      t    is denoted        Zt) as given by the following equations:


(7)                       z*
                               —      +   s1((:)              +           + u7

where


(8)                            z,         +     (l—)zt1           +   u
One would expect that, other things equal, higher real wages induce an

expansion of the labor force so that                      >       0.     The variable   ct

measures the (logarithm of the) real value of unemployment benefit8 30

that, because        Zt    includes the unetployed, one might expect fewer of

the unemployed would drop out of the labor force when these benefits

take on higher real value3 so              S2    is conjectured to be positive.                  The

partial adjustment equation (8) rationalizes the important role played

by one—year lagged value3 of the labor force in accounting for movements

in     Zt   in in3trumental variable regressions.                        Indeed, this

specification wa3 3elected in much the same way that the structural

employment equation waa chosen:                 instrumental variable regressions were

fitted relating z to current and lagged values of real wages and of

real    un1ployment benefits and to lagged values of the dependent
variable.        Some of these regressions are reported in Appendix                         Table A.

An    examination of      these results will show that, in an                    equation
accounting for movements in the labor force,                           a powerful case cannot be

made    for regressors other than contenporaneous values of wage5 and
unemployment benefits and one—year lagged value3                           of the labor force.

as being set by a trade union in accordance with the objective f'unction
given by equation (6) and with ernploymner-it and the labor f'orc erespor.i
in the manner described by equations (2) and (3) and by equations (7)
and (B) respectively.   The following equations for real wages,
employment, and the ]abor force are thereby implied:

for movements in the unemployment rate.

        These equations are long and tedious, but (appearances to the

contrary) not difficult to comprehend.                         Though highly nonlinear in

parameters, they are linear in the logarithms of the variables.                                    They

simplify considerably if the structural parameters assume                                   particular

values.     Thus the absence of serial correlation in the residuals of the
                                        —2'—




employment adjustment equation (that is,       p    =   0) disposes of the             gei
values of exogenous variables while, in addition, the irnediate

adjustment of employment and the labor force (that is,            A    =   I     and

      1, respectively) eliminates their lagged values.           If the

unemployment rate does not figure in the union's objectives (that is,                          t'


      0), not merely are wages and employment independent of the exogenous

variables in the labor force equation, but also                 (A1)1            and the

equations become far less involved.

        Throughout a critical role is played by          8, the exponent on real

wages in the union's objective function.           To illustrate this, consider

an exogenous variable in the employment demand function equation (2),

say, the lagged value of real disposable income, yt—1.                According to

equations (9), (10), and (11), lower values of            5   corresnd to smaller

absolute values of the elasticities of real wages and of the labor force

with respect to disposable income while lower values of                5       are

associated with a larger absolute value of the elasticity of employment

with respect to disposable income.       Hence the widely—held belief that

wages are less variable over the business cycle than employment would

imply a value of    9   closer to zero than to unity.         For this reazon,             0



ha3   been labelled the union's relative aversion to variations in
eiployment,L' a higher value of     5    correspcnding to 'eater cyclical

wage variability and smaller employment variability in response to

exogenous shifts in the employment demand function.

      This term was used in Pencavel and Holmiund (1988) and, of course,
it    alludes  to  the  definition of relative    risk aversion   because

term) is offered also by Jackman (1985) and Pencavel (1984).

likelihood r1iethods were used to calculate the parameters, but these

often involved a great deal of programming time which is a hindrance if

the researcher is interested in exar1iining the consequences of                          a   nur1iber


of different specifications.                 For this reason,       I   turned to nonlinear

three—stage least squares (asymptotteally equivalent to full intormation

maximum likelihood) where the estimating equations consisted of the

first—order condition          ot    the constrained maxinurn o the union's

objective function and the two constraints, the employment and labor

force    equations../        it is   these system three—stage least squares

estimates       that are contained in Table 5.

number of variations on this specification were also estimated.                                For

lagged wages (that is, 2         0) from the employment denand functtor.,
equation (2), and to the omission of the real value of unenp1oyrnent
benefits (that              0) from   the ]abor force equation (7).          In   this
form, each of the independent variables in the etployment denand
function appears just once white the labor force equation incorporates
the effects of real wages only.       The estirnates in column (iii) irdio3te
there is no support ror extending the lag on real wages to three                  year"
while those in column (iv) correspond to a restricted version of the
model whereby the labor force is assumed to be independent of real
wages.     An examination of Table 5 indicates relatively little variation
in the estimates of most parameters across columns and this was also the
case for the estimates corresponding to other modifications of the
estimating equations.      There is good reason, therefore, to concentrate
on the estimates given in one of the columns in Table 5 and in what
follows I examine those reported in column (ii)
         Consider first the estlriiates at'   he   parameters of    the   union's

objective function. The estimate of \ of 0.91 is close to unity and
significantly greater than zero         this is consistent with the notion
that, in forming its bargaining strategy, the union takes account of
unemployment and     it is inconsistent with the 'insider—outsider"



2/    To be precise, the estimates in              column   (iii)   conform to the
specification of     in equation (6) as

hypothesis,      at lea8t in the manner in which it ias been expressed in

this paper.       The estimates of               and 2         (approxirnately   1 .5 and   -.5
respectively)       imply a rising reference level for real wages that

ultimately fully erodes the utility enhancing effects of current real

wages increases.         The estimate of         9     of —O.O4 is insignificantly

different from zero and suggests an extreme aversion to variations

realwages in response to exogenous shocks and a corresponding tolerance

of variations in employment.             Such an extrene result should clearly be

regarded with caution though, in its defence, it should be mentioned it

is con5istent with a common finding of relatively insensitive real wages

in Britain.       For instance, in their analysis of wage movements in 19

OECD economies, Grubb, Jackman, and Layard (1983) identify Britain's

real wage as the most rigid.             A similar result is reported in Klau and

Mittelstadt (1986).             This is also the message being conveyed by our

est imat es.


         The estimates in Table 5 of the parameters of the employment

demand    function are broadly similar to those nonlinear least squares
results in column         (14a)   ot Table 14        Other   than the parameters
(A   and    p)   governing the adjustment and autoregressive process, only
the influence of        disposable income (the coefficient                   comes through

clearly.       The elasticity       of employment with respect to real wages is

small. (—0.03)      and not estimated precisely.               According to the estimate of
     in column (ii) ot Table           5, a   ten percent increase in real wages is
associated with a 1.7 percent expansion in the size of the labor force.

      The implications of the estimates of the      structural parameters         in


column (ii) of' Table 5 for the reduced—form relatiorts for real ages,

employment, the labor force, and the unemployment rate are given t the

columns labelled "solved N3SLS" in Table 6.      By way of comparison,       in


the columns labelled 'OLSRF," Table 6 al3o reports the estimates

obtained from the simnpie application or ordinary least squares to these

reduced—form equations.      In general, the few degrees of freedom render

it extremely difficult to make confident inferences about the nature of

various relationships:      there are 27 observatioris and 16 parameters

computed in the structural model represented in column (ii) of

Table 5.    The consequence is a relatively large number of imprecisely

computed parameters.      This is unavoidable if' one employs   structural
estimation at the macroeconomic level:       specious statistical

significance can be achieved by fitting very parsimonious relationship3,

the simplicity of which cannot be justified normally on conventional

statistical criteria, or the relevance of many different variables can

be admitted with the conzequence (in a setting of relatively few

ob3ervation8)   ot imprecise parameter estimates.
      The resulting imprecision is clearly in evidence in the        real wage

equations   in Table 6:    only terms of clear significance are lagged
                           the

real wages in the solved N3SLS equation. The difrerences in the point
estiniates in the two coluins for real wages are not, in fact, very
meaningful,   the standard errors   accompanying each point estimate usually
span the corresponding point estimate in the other column.          Given the

extraordinary attention given to the role of wages in affecting

unaploytnent,    it may be worth noting that the solved N3SLS estirnates of

the    coefficients   on lagged wages imply that a 10 percent higher level of

wages    raises the unemployment rate y about three percentage poiflts.

However, it is quite evident that this effect is measured quite
imprecise ly



                                 IV.   Conclusion

         This paper examined the nature and meaning of the association

between wages and employment in the aggregate British labor market

between 1953 and 979.       My purpose was to determine what had to be done

,ith    these arid other variables so that they take on the appearance of     a


conventional    labor demand function.    In so doing, I imposed relatively
little prior structure on the empirical expression of the textbook labor
demand curve.       Having arrived at a plausible though not a robust

relationship between e1ploytnent and wages, I built upon this a

structural model of the determination of wages, employment, and the

labor force, and therefore, of the unemployment rate.       This model was

designed in such a way as to evaluate the empirical relevanceof the

popular    distinction   between "insiders' and "outsiders" in the



12!       effects of lagged employment, et_l. and of the lagged labor
         The
force,       on the unemployment rate in the solved N3SL.S column should
be treated with caution.   The implied coefficients on et_     and Zt_l
are insignificantly different from unity.    But there is an approximate
identity  involving current values of      the  unenployment  rate,  the
logarithm of employment, and the logarithm of the labor force, natnely
(u/z)t    : etzt.     Hence, except for the fact that the lagged values of
employment and the labor force appear in the reduced—form unemployment
rate equation, these estimates may be simply mapping an identity!

formulation     of union objectives.      In fact, the point estimates o this

model o not lend much support to the insider—outsider distinction
although the standard errors surrounding these point estimates render

confident inferences unwarranted.

        Given   the imprecision of these estimates, a consequence of using a
relatively short time series and obviously a problem not resolved by
exploiting quarterly or monthly data instead of annual observations, a
natural response is to forego structural estimation and to fit reduced
form equations exclusively. This is an old and          complicated Issue in

applied economics.        My major difficulty with this position is that

reduced form equations rarely provide information that effectively

discriminates        among competing hypotheses and imaginative economists can
think of several different explanations consistent with the results.
Structural estimation is usually necessary (though not always
sufficient)     to    ist1nguish among these different explanations.     And when

the   data are insufficiently rich, we simply have       to confess
agnosticism.         Indeed, the most salient teature of the empirical work

here is the fact that the various relationships computed with agegate

data are sensitive to specification or are estimated imprecisely.           In

either event, the data are signalling to the researcher that they cannot

deliver unambiguou5        answers   to the sort of questions economists ask of

them.     This calls for scepticism whenever researchers claim unequivocal

results    fran using these data to measure structural relationships.
