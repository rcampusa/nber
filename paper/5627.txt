                                            ABSTRACT



        We test whether the time-series positive correlation of inflation and intermarket relative

price variability is also present in a cross-section   of US cities.   We find this correlation to be a

robust empirical regularity: cities which have higher than average inflation also have higher than

average relative price dispersion, ceteris paribus,    This result holds for different periods of time,

different classes of goods, and across different time horizons.        Our results suggest that at least

part of the relationship   between inflation and relative price variability cannot be explained by

moneta~    factors.

I. Introduction

Time series evidence suggests that inflation and relative price changes are strongly positively

correlated.   A variety of theories can explain this correlatio~     but the existing evidence is

inconclusive about the causal mechanism that generates the observed facts, In this paper, we

present new evidence on the relationship between itiation          and relative price variability by

examining a cross-section    of US cities in the post-war period. The value of this approach is that it

controls for nation-wide shocks, including changes in monetary policy and oil prices. We find that

inflation and relative price variability are strongly positively correlated at the city level, suggesting

that aggregate shocks (such as monetary factors) are not entirely responsible for the correlation.

     The movement of individual prices relative to the aggregate price level has been investigated

at least since Mills’ classic description of the US price system (1927). Previous empirical work

has examined time series data on the relationship between relative price variability and inflation in

different countries and in different inflationary environments.       This work has defined relative price

variability as the standard deviation (or variance) of the rates of itiation     of various categories of

goods and services around the average consumer price inflation rate, that is, inter-market price

variability. Vining and Elwertowski     (1976), Parks (1978), and subsequent researchers found

evidence that inflation and relative price variability are positively correlated over time, A

separate, dissenting set of researchers have variously concluded that there is no statistical

relationship between inflation and relative price variability, or that the correlation is caused

entirely by energy and food prices, or that the question or the statistical tests used are ill-defined.

     Figure 1 illustrates the standard result in the literature.    It updates Figure 1 in Fischer (1981),
                                                                                             RPV - Page 2

brief glance at Figure 1 conveys some of the main elements of the debate about inflation and

relative price variability (heretier   RPV) in US postwar history, As noted by Fischer, both series

have peaks around 1974 and 1979, when the price of oil rose due to supply disruptions,          Note

also that RPV rises in 1986, while oil prices and inflation fell.

     The problem with Figure 1 is that it is consistent with many different causal mechanisms.

Some price setting theones imply that RPV causes iflation;       others imply that inflation causes

RPV, A third alternative is that the classical dichotomy holds: in a world where money is neutral

and prices are fully flexible, nominal inflation is irrelevant to RPV. The classical dichotomy would

be fully consistent with the evidence in Figure 1, for example, if the Fed consistently increased the

money supply in response to real shocks to RPV,

     In this paper, using data on annual consumer price inflation, we find that across US cities the

positive correlation between inflation and relative price vanability is a robust empirical regularity.

US cities which have inflation above the national average in a given year also have a higher degree

of relative price vanability.   This relationship holds for different categories of goods and services,

for different subperiods, and controlling for fixed city and year effects,z

     Section II briefly discusses the theoretical underpinnings for the relationship between




         1Fischer uses the consumption deflator; in this paper we study the CPI because it is
available by city. The main difference between these two sources is that using the consumption
deflator, RPV has a much larger peak in 1986 when oil prices fell.

        2 Related evidence from US cities, using a different data source than ours, is presented in
Parsley (1995). He reaches conclusions similar to ours.
                                                                                            RPV - Page 3

tiation   and relative price variability, and outlines the empirical controversy.    Section 111explains

our data and our approach.      Section IV shows our results. We sketch out emensions in Section

V. Section VI presents our conclusions,

II. Theories and Existing Evidence

Fischer (198 1) and Weiss (1993) provide usefil summaries of the theoretical and empirical links

between ifiation    and relative price variability.   One theory is that unanticipated inflation creates

“misperceptions” of absolute and relative price changes, which leads to RPV (Lucas (1973) and

Barro (1976)),     Menu costs may generate a positive relationship between the level of inflation and

RPV (Sheshinski and Weiss (1977)).         Search models also imply a link between inflation and RPV

(Benabou (1988)).

     Ball and Mankiw ( 1994) present a menu-cost model where shocks that raise firms’ desired

prices trigger larger price responses than shocks that lower desired prices. In this world, above

average inflation is in a sense caused by high RPV, and prices are sticky downward.          To preview

our results, we find evidence consistent with this model, since we find that above average inflation

is related to above average RPV but that below average inflation is not, The models presented in

Ball and Mankiw (1 994, 1995) seem particularly relevant to city data since it is chiefly real

shocks, not nominal shocks, that vary at the city level compared to the national level.

      The empirical literature on relative price variability and intlation dates back to Mills (1927)

who provided a comprehensive        sutiey of the US ptice system by examining the levels OR and

movements in wholesale price indexes and their components over the period 1890-1926.              As part

of his survey, Mills examined the relationship between shifis in the price level and changes in the

degree of dispersion (defined as the standard deviation of relative prices),
                                                                                            RPV - Page 4

     Mills’ work was updated and refined by Vining and Elwertowski          (1976) who used the

wholesale price index at the 8 digit level (about 100 items) over the period 1947 to 1974. They

confirmed Mills’ finding that relative price variability was positively correlated with inflation.

Using the standard deviation of changes in the various components of the wholesale price index to

measure variability, their results produced a positive coefficient of 0.43 in a regression of relative

price variability on inflation. They also found that the distribution of price changes exhibited a

positive skew which was increasing in the level of inflation. That is, most price changes were

below the average rate of itiation      but a few prices changed by an amount significantly above

average.

     As a brief check, we reproduced the analysis of Vining and Elwertowski,         using the aggregate

data from Figure 1. The data run from 1954 to 1986 (33 annual observations) and use inflation

rates from 14 different categories of goods to calculate RPV, A regression of the standard

deviation of the inflation rates of the components against the total CPI inflation rate yields a

significant, positive coefficient of 0.32.

     Similar findings of a positive correlation between inflation and relative price variability were

found by Parks (1 978) for the Netherlands (1921-1963)         and the US (1930-1975),    by Graham

(1930) for the German hyperinflatio~         by Glejser (1965) for a cross-section of European

countries, and by Fischer(1981)      and (1982) for the US (193 1-1980) and Germany (1967-1980).

Thus the correlation between relative price variability and inflation has been found across different

countries, in times of hyperitiation,    stable low inflation, uncertain inflation and deflation.

     Some work has attempted to determine whether the relationship is stronger between inflation

and RPV using the level of itiation      or unanticipated changes in inflation. Parks (1978) found that
                                                                                           RPV - Page 5

for the US, it was driven by the relationship between unanticipated itiation       rather than the level

of inflation. Fischer (1981) regressed relative price variability on inflation, changes in inflation,

and expected and unexpected inflation. He found that the relationship between relative price

variability and the actual level of inflation was generally positive and significant, and was stable

after excluding food and energy prices, Both expected and unexpected itiation          had a positive

and significant relationship with RPV, He also found that relative price variability appeared to

respond asymmetrically to changes in inflation, suggesting some degree of price rigidity.

      Critics have strongly disagreed with the conclusions of Vining and Elwertowski,       Parks, and

their successors,   Driffil, Mizon, and Ulph (1990) concluded that Vining and Elwertowski “do not

provide convincing evidence of a strong positive relationship between relative price variability and

itiation,”   while Bomberger and Makinen (1993) attributed Parks’ findings entirely to the oil

shocks.

      Critics have especially focused on specifications which regressed relative price variability on

the absolute value of intlation (or, identically, on inflation during periods when it is strictly

positive) or squared inflation. These variables are definitionally related, so that there will be a

statistical relation between them no matter what the data generating process, as discussed in

Hartman(199     1) and Grier and Perry (1993). Hartman argued that due to the statistical

relationships between the various measures of itiation,     some of the results are spurious        He

supported an analysis along the lines of Hercowitz (198 1), who used monetary variables as

instruments,   However, Hartman concluded that using the level of inflation as a single regressor is

econometrically valid,
                                                                                         RPV - Page 6

     The debate over intra-market RPV parallels the debate over inter-market RPV.3           A number

of authors have found a positive relationship between intra-market price variability and inflation.

Domberger (1987) examined the movements of prices of goods within 4-digit SICS in the UK,

while Beaulieu and Mattey (1994) looked within commodity groups in the US, Van Hoornissen

(1988), Tommasi (1993) and Lath and Tsiddon (1992) used data on the same product across

different stores in countries which were experiencing high rates of inflation.4 These studies

generally repofied a positive relationship between inflation and price variability.

     In contrast, Reinsdorf ( 1994), used data from the Volcker deflation in the US to find a

negative relationship between price dispersion and unexpected ifiation      but a positive relationship

with expected inflation. 5

     Our approach differs horn this existing literature by controlling for nationwide and monetary

disturbances, utilizing the cross-sectional   information from individual US cities, Therefore neither

moneta~     policy nor OPEC oil shocks can be driving our results,

III. Data and Approach

A. Data

Our data consists of two balanced panels of amual Consumer Price Index inflation rates for US




          3 The data used in this paper can not be used to calculate intra-market figures.

          4 Israel 1971-1984, Argentina 1990, and Israel late 1970s and early 1980s, respectively.

         5 Like Beaulieu and Mattey, Reinsdorf examined the distinct concept of relative price
dispersion, defined as the standard deviation of various prices for the same good at a particular
point in time, but across different locations,
                                                                                        RPV - Page 7

cities. The first panel runs from 1954-1986 for 19 US cities,b For each city, we used price indices

calculated by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for the total annual average consumer

price level and for 14 categories of goods and services.’ The second panel runs from 1977 to

1986 and includes five additional cities, four more categories of goods,   and provides a set of

price indices which exclude particular classes of commodities from the total consumer price

index. *

     We chose these two panels to provide long and wide cross-sections      of cities with the greatest

possible level of disaggregation.   The disaggregated components provide almost complete

coverage of the total components of the CPI: in June 1983, the components of the 1954-86

sample represent about 78 per cent of the CPI and the components of the 1977-86 sample

represent 92 per cent of the CPI. In terms of cities, the coverage is less complete: the 26 cities in

the 1977-86 sample represent about half the weight of the CPI. We truncate the sample in 1986

because the BLS changed its methodology after 1986, substantially decreasing the sample size and

frequency of observation that underlie the city price indices, Mer    1986, the city-level

components of the CPI became much more volatile, due to increased measurement error.



         GMore precisely, the geographical unit is the (consolidated) metropolitan statistical area,
or (C)MSA. They are: Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Buffalo, Chicago, Cincimati, Cleveland,
Detroit, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, Minneapolis-St Paul, New York,
Pittsburgh, St. Louis, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington DC.

        7 Cereal and bakery products; meats, poultry and fish; dairy products; fruit and vegetables;
food away from home; shelter; household fiels and utilities; men’s apparel; women’s apparel;
footwear; private transportation; public transportation; medical care; and personal care.

         8 The five cities are Anchorage, Dallas, Denver, Honolulu and San Diego. The four
additional categories are alcoholic beverages, other food at home, entertainment, and household
furnishings. This panel also replaces personal care with the more inclusive “other goods and
services”,
                                                                                                     RPV - Page 8

     It is impofiant to note that US irdlation was almost always positive during this period, as

shown in Figure 1. This means that descriptions of the pricing process which rely on positive

trend inflation (such as Ball andMankiw(1994))                are relevant during this period.

     Using our indexes, we followed standard practice in defining inflation for city j as

                          x@= [nP,, - lnPj ~.l

where Pj~is the price index for city j in year t            Relative price variability for city j at time t was

defined as




where i indexes cornmodities.9

     From these city-level variables, we subtracted the US national itiation                rate and RPV (shown

in Figure 1), creating:

                                  .
                                 ‘jt = ‘jt -         ‘USt



                                 bj~   =   Uj~   –   Uus~



so that the variables are expressed as deviations from national averages.               We also calculated lfij~l,

the absolute value of fijt.

     We focus on deviations from national averages because we want to examine evidence which

is not driven by monetary policy or other national events, In our regressions, we will use fixed




         9 nut and the underlying PM indices are also used to calculate njt and Pjt, so that Pj~is a
weighted average of the Pot. In practice we observe most but not all of the individual price indices
and irdlation rates PU~and TCtit that the BLS uses to calculate the total CPI price index Pj, and ~jt
nj~is thus an almost exact linear combination of the ntit’s.
                                                                                          RPV - Page 9

effects to control for city-specific and year-specific components of city inflation. The fixed city

effects allow cities to have different average inflation and RPV over the sample period, and the

fixed year effects control for different average levels of RPV and itiation    in different years.

     Table 1 shows summary statistics for the city dat~ 1954-1986.       Figure 2 plots fij~(the

difference between the city irdlation rate and the national rate) on the horizontal axis, and bj~(the

difference between the standard deviation (across sub-groups of commodities) in the city and the

standard deviation in the nation) on the vertical axis, afier controlling for city and year effects. 10

Another way of describing the horizontal axis is that it shows the change in the relative price of a

basket of goods in a given city compared to the national average.

B. Empirical Strate~

In testing for a positive correlation between inflation and RPV, our basic strategy is to test for a

positive slope in Figure 2. We are interested in the relationship between 6j~and fij~.11 Other

researchers, for example Tommasi (1993), focus on the relationship between RPV and the

absolute value of inflation, which corresponds to looking for a V-shape in Figure 2.12 We are

hesitant to try to draw inferences (using our data) about the relationship between the absolute

value of inf-lation and RPV. Although we include Ifijll,the absolute value of fijt , as a control

variable in the regressions, we believe city data are likely to cause this variable to be correlated



          10That is, we plot the residuals from a regression of fij~and bjt on a set of dummy variables
(one for each city and each year.) The fact that we use year dummies on the right hand side means
that it is irrelevant whether we subtract the national average from the lefi-hand side, Calculating
the deviation from the national average is only relevant when computing the variable IfijL1.

         11We regress 6jl on fij, to show the contemporaneous    correlation between these two
variables. The reverse regression is shown in Table 6.

        12Tomrnasi (1993) finds rather dramatic V-shapes in his Argentine data.
                                                                                            RPV - Page 10

with RPV.

     First, the data might conform to a V-shaped pattern in Figure 2 (i.e. Ifij,land Gj,might be

positively correlated) due to the definition of the different variables, as in Hartman (1991). Both

[fijtland bj~are finctions   of the realizations of TCti,.Suppose that we examined a set of means and

standard deviations from a series of sets of random numbers with the same mean. Then,

depending on the data generating process, conditional on having an above- or below-average

realized mean in a given set, we might also find a high realized standard deviation in the same

set.13 Even if all cities in the US had identical relative and aggregate prices, but the different

prices were reported with city-level error, we might expect to see Ifill explain bj,.

     The second reason to expect a V-shaped pattern is based on economic theory and depends

on the relative shocks and related adjustment processes of cities in the US, Consider the

following basic story, in which prices are fiIlly flexible and set in competitive markets with fill

information.   Different cities face different relative shocks in different years, This shock could be

a change in the demand for that cities’ production, or a change in the relative (national) price of

goods that city disproportionately    consumes.    Some goods are highly tradeable and intercity

arbitrage forces their prices to be ‘(roughly) equal across cities, Other goods (e.g. houses) are

highly non-tradeable and their prices are different across cities, When a city receives, say, a

negative demand shock compared to the national average, two things happen: (a) the relative

price of all goods in that city falls, so that the city’s inflation rate is less than the national average

and (b) the relative prices of different goods within that city change as well. The first effect, (a),


         13For example, it is easy to generate a V-shaped pattern using iid mean-zero normal
distributions. With 14 categories, for example, one would observe a clear V-shaped pattern by
having TCti- N(O,l) for J< 13 and nti - N(O,1O) forj = 14,
                                                                                          RPV - Page 11

is essentially identical to the familiar real depreciation with fixed exchange rates. The second

effect, (b), occurs since the prices of traded goods are constrained to be equal across cities, but

non-traded goods prices must adjust filly to the shock, so that the price changes of traded and

non-traded goods become more dispersed following a shock. Thus we expect to see higher RPV

in cities that have total inflation that is either higher or lower than the national average,

      Since it is difficult to know whether measurement errors or other factors might be causing a

V-shaped curve to appear in the data, in our empitical tests, we therefore focus on the monotonic

relationship between city inflation and city RPV (or, equivalently, on asymmetries in the V-shape).

We ask: given lfij~l,is fij, positively correlated with 6j,? That is, we ask whether, holding constant

the absolute value of a city’s inflation rate relative to the national average, higher inflation is

associated with higher RPV.

IV.   Regression Results

A. Baseline Results

We stacked our 627 city-year observations and ran fixed-effects regressions, including a dummy

variable for each city and year. The first column in Table 2 reports the coefficients from our

baseline results in the 1954-86 sample. The coefficient of interest, on fi~, is positive (0.21) and

highly significant (with a t-statistic of about 4). The coefficient on Ifij,lis also positive but

insignificant.   In words, column (1) says that holding constant the absolute value of city inflation

relative to the national average, higher itiation   is associated with higher RPV. By estimating

separate coefficients for Ifijtland fij(, we are essentially estimating the slope of two different lines

on either side of the vertical axis in Figure 2, with the left hand side having a slope equal to the

difference between the Ifij,land fij, coefficients, and the right hand side having a slope equal to the
                                                                                            RPV - Page 12

sum. The line in Figure 2 shows the slopes implied by the regression, 14

     In the rest of this section, we describe a battery of cross-sectional regressions testing whether

this positive and significant coefficient on fij, is robust,   We found that the relationship is strikingly

robust to a variety of different assumptions, and is not caused by a particular observation, city,

year, time-horizon, or category of goods and services. This contrasts with the aggregate evidence

on irdlation and RPV in the postwar US time series, the robustness of which is a matter of

dispute.

     We first checked to see our conclusions were tiected          by different assumptions about the

nature of the disturbance term. Table 2 also shows White (1980) standard errors to allow for

unknown forms of heteroskedasticity.       This correction made little difference to the calculated

standard errors, The next column shows the standard errors calculated as in Newey-West ( 1987),

to allow for residuals that are both autocorrelated     and heteroskedastic.15   Last, we also report

standard error estimates that abstract from serial correlation but permit general patterns of cross-

sectional dependence.    We dropped the year dummies from the regression and instead estimated

OLS coefficients and an error covanance matrix which allowed the error term to be correlated for

each pair of cities and to have city-specific heteroskedasticity. 16 The last two columns in Table 2



        ‘4 The line in Figure 2 shows the implied slopes, but it does not show the fitted values
from the regression since those involve the interaction between all the right-hand-side variables,
including the dummies for city and year.

         15The first-order autocorrelation coefficient for the residual was 0.04 and insignificantly
different from zero. We calculated the Newey-West errors using a window of two lags,

        lb We estimated the covariance matrix, allowing for cross-sectional correlation and
groupwise heteroskedasticity as in equation 16-7 of Greene (1 990). We estimated the covariance
terms using T-K in the denominator of Greene’s equation 16-8, as this produced more
conservative (bigger) standard errors in the last column of Table 2.
                                                                                          RPV - Page 13

report the coefficients and standard errors fi-om this regression; again the results are about the

same,

     Table 3 continues the sensitivity analysis. We first checked to see whether using different

control variables affected the coefficient on fij[. Using both the squared value of the inflation

deviation, fij2, as well as Ifij,l,(so that the equation fitted both a quadratic and piecewise linear) did

not materially change the coefficient on fij~in column (1), The results were also robust to the

inclusion of a lagged dependent variable (shown in column (2)), 17Column (3) shows that the

coefficient on irdlation changes only slightly when no other regressors accompany fijt.

        Although we could reject the hypothesis that the city and year dummies were not jointly

significant, we also tried excluding these dummies from the right-hand side, These restrictions

had almost no effect on the coefficient on fij,, as shown in column (4) of Table 3.

     Figure 2 suggests that outliers maybe ifiuencing      the regression results. 18 We therefore

discarded the top and bottom 1 percent of the sample ranked on the values of fijt and ~jt shown in

Figure 2, and reran the regression. 19 Column (5) shows the result: discarding outliers raises the

coefficient on fij~,although the coefficient is not significantly different from the fill sample




       17We also tried adding the lags of the regressors, Ifij,.lland Rj,.l, to the right-hand-side;
these were also insignificant and had no impact on the magnitude and significance of fij,,

        la The prominent outlier in the graph with a standard deviation of above .10 is the
observation for Atlanta in 1972; in that year, the price index for public transportation fell by more
that 50 percent.

         19That is, we discarded observations based on extreme values of fijt and 6jl afier
controlling for time and city as in Figure 2. As an alternative procedure for dealing with outliers,
we also estimated the baseline regression using Least Absolute Deviations techniques. This
procedure resulted in a coefficient of 0.175 on fij, and 0.142 on lfij~l)with standard errors of 0.026
and 0.057 respectively.
                                                                                          RPV - Page 14

estimate (the coefficient on Ifijllfalls, however, as might be expected if it were a statistical artifact

generated by measurement error),20

     We investigated the subsample stability of the estimates by splitting the sample roughly in

half. Since the Nixon price controls were initiated in 1971, we used the two samples 1954-1970

and 1971-1986,    Columns (6) and (7) in Table 3 shows that both the coefficients on fij~were

positive and significant, and were statistically indistinguishable from each other.21 The stability of

the coefficient on fijl is remarkable, given the radically different environment of aggregate irdlation

and oil shocks in the two periods,

     We also tried estimating separate year-by-year equations, so that for each of the 33 years

1954-86, we ran a simple regression on 19 city observations, including fijt, lfij~l,and a constant on

the right hand side (using White standard errors).    Of these 33 regressions (which are not reported

here), 23 had a positive estimated coefficient on fij,.22 Seven of the 23 positive coefficients were

statistically significant (namely 1955, 1969, 1970, 1977, 1978, 1980 and 1985), while none of the

10 negative coefficients were.

     We next investigated whether the results are driven primarily by the non-traded goods in the

sample. We might expect traded goods inflation to be more similar across cities while non-traded

goods inflation may have a significant local component.      Hence we divided the 14 commodities



        20We also tested whether a specific city was driving the results, Were-estimated the
baseline regression 19 times, each time omitting a specific city. This procedure had little impact on
the coefficient on fij~,which ranged between 0.19 and 0,24 and was always highly significant,

       21The latter period includes the 1972 outlier mentioned previously.

        22If the coefficients of fij, were drawn from an IID distribution with 0.5 probability of
being positive, the probability of having 10 or fewer negative observations would be 1.75 percent
(the probability of 10 or fewer of either sign would be 3.51 percent).
                                                                                        RPV - Page 15

into the two types and recalculated 6jt and fij~using only the traded or non-traded goods.23 The

results are shown in Table 4. The coefficient on fijl in the traded goods regression is lower than

that for the non-traded goods, but both estimates are significantly different from zero and are not

significantly different from each other, Correspondingly,   we also dropped each of the 14

commodities in turn from the calculation of bjt. There was no discernible difference in the results

(which are not reported here),

     Were-estimated    the baseline regression using the 1977-86 panel. These results, in Table 4,

are similar to the 1954-86 baseline, with the coefficient on fijl a bit lower. In addition to providing

a larger number of cities, the 1977-86 sample also provides a set of indices calculated by the BLS

which show the effect of specific components of the CPI on the total index.24 The last column of

Table 4 shows the effect of excluding the quintessential non-traded good, housing, from the

calculation of both fij~and 6jt,25 The coefficient of fij~is higher than in the baseline 1977-86 case,

showing that the results are not driven by fluctuations in regional real estate markets.

B. Longer Time Horizons

To investigate whether the correlation between inflation and RPV was a short or long term

phenomenon, we used our data to examine inflation rates and relative price changes over longer




       23Mer reviewing the contents of each category, we judgementally classified food away
from home, shelter, public transpofiation, medical care and personal care as non-traded goods.

        24These indices could in principle be calculated for the entire 1954-86 sample. However,
because the BLS uses different (unpublished) weights for each city and year when calculating the
overall CPI, we were not able to accurately reproduce these series with available information.

        25We used the index of total itiation less shelter where shelter includes rent, homeowners
equivalent rent, house maintenance and repair and lodging while out of town. This is the only
place in this paper where we do not use total CPI itiation in calculating fij, and [fij~[.
                                                                                         RPV - Page 16

horizons.   Ourexpectation,   based onmenu-cost     ortisperceptions   models, wasthat    the

relationship would be short-lived.    We were surprised to find that the correlation persisted for

intervals of up to five or ten years, Since other evidence indicates most prices are changed within

a given five or ten year period, this finding casts some doubt on models (such as menu costs) in

which infrequent price adjustment leads to RPV in response to real or nominal shocks.2b

     We recomputed fij~and 6jl using price changes over 5 year intervals, and re-estimated the

baseline regression in two ways: using overlapping and non-overlapping      observations.27 We

estimated the baseline regression using a dummy variable for each city and time period, Table 5

shows the regression results, For the overlapping observations, the OLS residuals are naturally

highly positively autocorrelated.2s   For both the overlapping and non-overlapping    observations,

we corrected the standard errors on the coefficients for autocomelation    of the residuals (as well as

for possible heteroskedasticity)   as in Hansen (1982) and Hansen and Hodrick (1980).29

     At a five year horizon, the regressions using both the overlapping and non-overlapping      data




       24Kashyap (1995) finds that in 1953-1987, catalog retailers change their prices on average
once every 14.7 months; Cecchetti (1986) finds a lower frequency of three to seven years, for
mag~ine price changes in the 1953-1979 period.

        27So, for the non-overlapping observations, the five year inflation rates were calculated
for the periods 1956-1961, 1961-1966, 1966-1971, 1971-1976, 1976-1981 and 1981-1986 for
each city and category.

         2sFor the overlapping observations, the first-order autocorrelation coefficient is 0.71 for
the 5-year horizon and 0.83 for the 10-year horizon. For the non-overlapping observations, the
coefficients are -0.18 and -0.28, respectively.

        29We assumed that the residual in these regressions had a moving average term of order 4
for the 5-year horizon, and of order 9 for the 10-year horizon. UsingNewey-West(1987)     instead
of Hansen-Hodrick (1980) and Hansen (1982), so that the autocovanance terms are
downweighted, produces standard errors which are extremely similar.
                                                                                          RPV - Page 17

show a positive and significant coefficient on fij~. At a ten year horizon, both sets of regressions

still yield a positive and fairly sizable correlation between inflation and RPV. Not surprisingly,

using the largest possible interval of 34 years shows no relationship whatsoever.

C. Skewness

Ball and Mankiw ( 1995) argue that the skewness of relative shocks is an important determinant of

inflation, and that empirically, “the inflation-skewness   relationship is in fact stronger than the

inflation-variance relationship.”   We investigated this relationship at the city level by calculating

city level ifiation   skewness:




                                      k.w
                                      Jt




and the deviation from national skewness, ~ = k.j~- kus~.

     Ball and Ma&w        (1995) analyze the time series relation between kus. TCus.and Oust, while

we look at the analogous city deviations, $,, fijt, and ~jl. In the tables thus far, we have regressed

the standard deviation on itiation,    to make our results comparable with previous research, Ball

and Mankiw (1995) instead regress the level of itiation      on measures of its standard deviation and

skewness; we attempted to reproduce Ball and Mankiw’s analysis using our data.30

     Table 6 reproduces Ball and Mtiw’s         Table III, using city deviations from national inflation,

standard deviations of inflation rates, and skewness coefficients,     An important caveat is that


        30De Abreu Lourenco and Gruen (1995) reproduce the Ball and Mankiw analysis using
Australian data and find that the effect of RPV is greater at lower inflation rates, while the effect
of skewness is greater at higher inflation rates,
                                                                                         RPV - Page 18

while Ball and Mankiw used itiation      rates for more than 200 different commodities (using the

Producer Price Index), we had ordy 14 categories of goods and services in our 1954-1986 data

set.

       First, note that the reverse regression of inflation on RPV in the column (1) gives results

similar to those presented previously: inflation and RPV are positively correlated at the city

level.31

       Given our crude level of disaggregation,   we find the results in columns (2) through (5) to be

fairly supportive of Ball andMankiw(1995).        Almost all of the signs of the coefficients in Table 6

match with those of Ball and Mankiw.32 Overall, the chief difference between Table 6 and Table

111of Ball and Mankiw (1995) is that we find bj, to be robustly significant and to have more

explanatory power than $~, which is more fragile; they find the opposite result.33 As before, we

briefly checked the sensitivity of the skewness results with respect to outliers, and again found ~jt

robustly significant and positive, but terms involving ~~ more fragile.

       In summary, although we find some evidence that skewness matters at the city level, we

conclude that the strong positive correlation between RPV and inflation is not chiefly a finction

of the statistical relationship between skewness and intlation,




         31Like aggregate inflation (but unlike Gj,), inflation at the city level is positively
autocorrelated; cities with above-average inflation this year are likely to have above-average
inflation next year.

      32Ordy one of the coefficients in Table 6 has a different sign than its counterpart in Ball
and Mankiw (1 995) Tables 111Aand Table ~IB. They find ku~~to be negative in (4),

       33Specifically, they find that u “~1is always insignificant in their Table IH& and that ku~t
and ku~t *u us~are always significant or marginally significant.
                                                                                              RPV - Page 19

V. Extensions

The analysis in this paper, like most of the previous work, has estimated a simple reduced form.

An important extension is to move to structural estimation.          City data has, in addition to the

virtues already mentioned, the added benefit that a variety of usefil instruments exist to measure

exogenous shocks to demand. For example, one could proxy for changes in exogenous demand

by using aggregate movements in sectoral production in combination with the industrial

composition of a city’s manufacturing base, Other traditional instruments, such as milita~

spending, are available at the state level (see Davis, Loungani, and Mahidhara (1995) for an

extensive list), For some cities, manufacturing wages are also available annually, so that

wage-price dynamics could be studied. Blanchard and Katz (1992) report some of the basic facts

about employment at the regional. level within the US.

     Another extension would be to decompose city inflation into expected and unexpected

components.     Econometrically,   this seems straightfomard,   since fij~is autocorrelated     (as shown in

Table 6). However, since the data on city irdlation used in this paper is rarely used by economists

or mentioned in the press, it is not immediately clear whether residents of US cities even know

what fij~ is, much less form expectations about it.

     We have studied inter-market RPV in this paper; studying intra-market RPV in US cities

would also be usefil. Although Reinsdorf (1 994) reports on nine US cities for the three year

period 1980-1982, it might be possible to get a larger cross section of cities for these years and

test whether cities with above average inflation also have above average intra-market RPV.

VI. Conclusion

The main imovation     of this paper is the use of cross-sectional     data on inflation and relative price
                                                                                         RPV - Page 20

variability. In using differences across city, we automatically exclude as explanations those

theories of the inflation/RPV nexus that rely on monetary policy, since different cities do not have

different monetary policy, Although on the national level and in the long run, ifiation      maybe

always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon, by construction our approach only captures

price changes which are caused by relative shocks to cities.34

      Although cross-sectional    data has advantages over time-series data in this respect, it also has

disadvantages in that the evidence presented here does not necessarily directly relate to national

inflation and RPV, That is, national inflation and city-specific inflation are by construction

orthogonal variables, so we cannot aggregate city-specific itiation      and RPV shocks to reach

conclusions about the national variables.     Another limitation is that, as with many studies in this

field, we are simply observing the contemporaneous       correlation of two endogenous variables and

so cannot come to strong conclusions about causality.       Our approach is usefil, however, in that it

illuminates basic facts about the price system that are applicable to the national level. We have

found a robust empirical regularity: across cities, RPV and inflation (relative to the national

average) are strongly correlated.    This correlation cannot be explained by theories that depend on

monetary or federal government action. In addition, we found that the correlation between

itiation   and relative price variability was surprisingly persistent over time.




        34While it is certainly true that monetaty and fiscal policy, oil shocks, and other aggregate
events may have different regional effects, our evidence is by construction orthogonal to the
aggregate events; only the city-specific components of these shocks is examined.
