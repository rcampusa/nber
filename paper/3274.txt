             ASYMMETRIES AND RIGIDITIES IN WAGE ADJUSTMENTS BY FIRMS


                                       ABSTRACT

      In this paper we use micro data from the Employment Opportunity Pilot

Project (EOPP) surveys of firms      in 1980 and 1982 to test for labor market

rigidities and asymmetries in response to demand shifts.      We analyze wage and

employment adjustments to positive and negative shifts, as measured by sales

growth between 1979 and 1981.     The analysis is done for both entire sample of

firms and for selected subsamples based on firm size, unionization, industry and

skill mix.

      The results show that wage adjustments appear to be fairly rigid, compared

with employment adjustments.      They also appear to be quite asymmetric, with

significant adjustments in response to positive shifts but little adjustment in

response to negative shifts.    These asymmetries are not more pronounced in large

firms, manufacturing, heavily-waged or highly-skilled industries than in other

firms or industries.    In contrast, employment adjustments show no consistent

pattern of asymmetry.
