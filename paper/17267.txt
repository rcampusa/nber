The Influence of Irving Fisher on Milton Friedman’s Monetary Economics

                                            ABSTRACT

This paper examines the influence of Irving Fisher’s writings on Milton Friedman’s work in monetary
economics. We focus first on Fisher’s influences in monetary theory (the quantity theory of money,
the Fisher effect, Gibson’s Paradox, the monetary theory of business cycles, and the Phillips Curve,
and empirics, e.g. distributed lags.). Then we discuss Fisher and Friedman's views on monetary policy
and various schemes for monetary reform (the k% rule, freezing the monetary base, the compensated
dollar, a mandate for price stability, 100% reserve money, and stamped money.) Assessing the influence
of an earlier economist's writings on that of later scholars is a challenge. As a science progresses the
views of its earlier pioneers are absorbed in the weltanschauung. Fisher's Purchasing Power of Money
as well as the work of Pigou and Marshall were the basic building blocks for later students of monetary
economics. Thus, the Chicago School of the 1930s absorbed Fisher's approach, and Friedman learned
from them. However, in some salient aspects of Friedman's work we can clearly detect a major direct
influence of Fisher's writings on Friedman's. Thus, for example with the buildup of inflation in the
1960s Friedman adopted the Fisher effect and Fisher's empirical approach to inflationary expectations
into his analysis. Thus, Fisher's influence on Friedman was both indirect through the Chicago School
and direct. Regardless of the weight attached to the two influences, Fisher' impact on Friedman was
profound.

                                          1. Introduction1
Irving Fisher was the most prominent American economist of the early twentieth century. Milton

Friedman was the most prominent economist of the later twentieth century. Fisher’s writings in

monetary economics, especially the Purchasing Power of Money (1911) had a major impact on

Friedman’s theoretical and empirical work in monetary economics. In addition, Fisher’s views

on monetary policy and monetary reform aligned quite clearly with Friedman’s views.

        This paper examines the influence of Fisher’s writings on Friedman’s work in monetary

economics. We focus first on Fisher’s influences in monetary theory ( the quantity theory of

money, the Fisher effect, Gibson’s Paradox, the monetary theory of business cycles and the

Phillips Curve), empirics (eg distributed lags.). Then we discuss Fisher and Friedman's views on

monetary policy and various schemes for monetary reform ( the k% rule, freezing the monetary

base, the compensated dollar, a mandate for price stability, 100% reserve money, stamped

money.) Section 2 provides a brief biography of the two scholars and brings out some of the

similarities of their careers. Section 3 discusses Fisher’s influence on Friedman’s monetary

theory. Section 4 discusses Fisher and Friedman on monetary reform. To clarify Fisher’s

influences on Friedman we document all the citations to Fisher in Friedman’s published work in

Table 1. In section 5 we conclude with some insights on Fisher’s contribution to the evolution of

Friedman’s thinking.

                                      2.1 Irving Fisher

          Irving Fisher (1867 -1947) had a long, distinguished, and amazingly varied academic and

business career. Fisher, the son of a Congregationalist minister, was born in Saugerties New

York. He was an undergraduate and graduate at Yale, and spent most of his academic career at

Yale first in the Department of Mathematics, then in the Department of Political and Social

Science, and finally in the Department of Economics. He served as president of the American

Economic Association in 1918 and as the first president of the Econometrics Society in 1931-33.

          Fisher's academic contributions, many of which we discuss below, spanned a remarkably

wide range. Fisher's major works in economics, many of which are still read and cited include

"Appreciation and Interest" (1896), The Purchasing Power of Money (1911), Stabilizing the

Dollar (1920), The Rate of Interest (1930), and the Debt-deflation Theory of Great Depressions

(1933).

          Fisher was also deeply committed to spreading the gospel of healthful living. One of his

bestselling books, which ran through many editions, was How to Live. Fisher was also a strong

supporter of Prohibition. His book Prohibition at its Worst (1926a) made the case for Prohibition

in part by claiming that it raised productivity. Fisher even made a counterfactual calculation

purporting to show how much national income had been increased through the adoption of

prohibition. An inveterate inventor, one of his inventions, a system for manipulating index cards,

made him a fortune. Fisher formed the Index Visible Company to market the invention and in the

1920s it was merged into the company that became Sperry Rand. The fortune however, didn't

last long; he lost it in the stock market crash of 1929.

                                      2.2 Milton Friedman

Milton Friedman (1912 – 2006) had a long and distinguished career spanning the last six

decades of the twentieth century. Friedman was an undergraduate at Rutgers University in the

early 1930s where he studied under Arthur Burns and Homer Jones. He did his graduate work at

the University of Chicago where Frank Knight, Henry Simons and Jacob Viner trained him in the

Chicago tradition of classical economics. He also studied at Columbia under the mathematical

economist and statistician Harold Hotelling and the institutional and empirical economists

Wesley Clair Mitchell and John Bates Clark. Friedman spent most of his academic career at the

University of Chicago. After retiring from Chicago in 1977 Friedman moved to the Hoover

Institution at Stanford University for the rest of his life.

        Friedman is known for his path breaking work in methodology, economic statistics, price

theory, the consumption function and monetary economics. He was a champion of the modern

quantity theory of money and was a founder (along with Karl Brunner and Allan Meltzer) of the

monetarist school that successfully opposed itself against the dominant Keynesian paradigm of

the post World War II era. In three monumental books ( A Monetary History of the United States

1963, Monetary Statistics of the United States 1970 and Monetary Trends in the United States

and United Kingdom 1982) as well as numerous articles, Friedman and his collaborator Anna

Jacobson Schwartz provided overwhelming evidence on the influence of the quantity of money

secularly on the price level and on real income over the business cycle. In this work and

elsewhere Friedman documented the failures of discretionary monetary policy by the Federal

Reserve from its founding and made the case for rules over discretion. For his scientific research

in economics Friedman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1976.
                                                    5
       Like Irving Fisher, Milton Friedman developed several proposals for monetary reform.

Friedman long championed the case against discretionary monetary and fiscal policy made by

Henry Simons and Lloyd Mints, two of his predecessors at the University of Chicago. Over the

years Friedman devised several rules for policy formulation which have reflected his developing

views on money and the economy. The first rule (1948) would maintain full employment by

offsetting negative (positive) departures by money financed budget deficits ( and surpluses). The

second ( 1960) would have monetary authorities preserve price stability by expanding the money

supply at a steady and known rate sufficient to finance the growth of real output allowing for a

trend in velocity. A 1982 revision to that rule would have monetary authorities freeze the

monetary base. To provide an efficient set of monetary arrangements ( the optimum quantity of

money), the rule would set the rate of deflation equal to the real interest rate, or alternatively

would pay interest on bank reserves and allow competing banks to pay interest on all deposits.

Friedman (1960) also agreed with Simons (1936) on the case for 100% reserve banking and in

1953 made a strong case for flexible exchange rates to govern the economic relationship between

nation-states and against a return to the gold standard (1962b).

       Finally, like Fisher, Friedman was a strong practitioner of normative economics. For over

four decades he acted as the leading American advocate of the classical liberal order—free

markets and free speech. His 1962 work Capitalism and Freedom made a strong case for limited

government intervention in the economy. To address social ills he proposed schemes based on

free market solutions: tuition vouchers to improve education, a negative income tax to help low

income families and the abolition of conscription.

                                  2.3 Parallel Careers

          Milton Friedman called Fisher "the greatest economist the United States has ever

produced" (Friedman 1994, 37). We suspect that Fisher would have admired Friedman as well.

After all, their careers share some remarkable parallels. Early in their careers both Fisher and

Friedman made important contributions to pure theory. Fisher published The Nature of Capital

and Income in 1906 and Friedman with the statistician Leonard Savage published papers on

utility and risk (Friedman 1948, 1952). Both Fisher and Friedman went on, of course, to make

lasting contributions, to monetary economics. Fisher's masterpiece was The Purchasing Power of

Money (1911) and Friedman's, written with Anna J. Schwartz, was A Monetary History of the

United States (1963). Both books use the quantity theory of money as their basic organizing

principle. Both books attempt to estimate the quantity theory empirically and to do that both

authors assembled new data on monetary aggregates. Both Fisher and Friedman, moreover, made

theoretical advances in the construction of index numbers as an outgrowth of their attempts to

assemble data with which to test the quantity theory: Fisher (1922) analyzed alternative formulas

for computing price indexes and Friedman (1962a) analyzed alternative methods for filling gaps

in economic time series. Both books relied heavily on economic history to test the quantity

theory.

          Both Fisher and Friedman were inveterate reformers who dedicated themselves to

improving the world by crafting elegant reforms and then attempting to persuade the public of

their validity. It is not surprising that they would both advocate reforms of the monetary system

based on their studies of monetary history. But the range of reforms championed by both Fisher

and Friedman as indicated by the following table is truly astonishing.

       Even a brief comparison of the two cannot be complete without noting that the reputation

of both men suffered for a time because of predictions that went badly wrong. Fisher's bad

prediction has become legendary. During the 1920s Fisher's opinions about the stock market

were reported regularly in the papers. Fisher computed his own stock market indexes and the

New York Times regularly reported their movements. But on October 15,1929, the Times

reported that Fisher had told a meeting of the Purchasing Agent Association that stocks had

reached “what looks like a permanently high plateau.” the Times went on to report that

       "While the tone of his address proper reflected a moderate optimism, in the informal
       questioning which followed Professor Fisher fell into almost unqualified optimism. In
       reply to one question, he declared that he expected “to see the stock market a good deal
       higher than it is today, within a few months"" (New York Times, Oct 16, 1929, 8.)

Black Thursday was October 24, 1929. Fisher had made his optimistic prediction only weeks

before the start of the most disastrous stock market decline in history.

       Friedman's fall from grace came in the early 1980s. As Edward Nelson (2007) explains in

his careful study of Friedman's post-1963 discussions of monetary policy, Friedman made

inaccurate predictions of prices and the level of economic activity.


       "... from 1982 to 1985, Friedman repeatedly predicted a major revival of inflation that
       never occurred. In 1982 he predicted 8% inflation for 1983; the outcome was around
       4%.... In July 1983, Friedman wrote, “We shall be fortunate indeed if we escape either a
       return to double-digit inflation or renewed recession in 1984... In August 1983, he said,
       “U.S. inflation rates will rise appreciably in 1984, although it’s not yet determined where
       they’ll go from there.”... In April 1984, Friedman said, “I believe [the CPI] will be rising
       in the neighborhood of 8 to 10 percent in 1985.” Even in November 1985, Friedman said:
       “Inflation is not dead. It will emerge once again and will be higher next year than it is this
       year. We almost surely are currently at the bottom of this inflationary episode and are
       likely to be starting up again.”... Defying these predictions, inflation was consistently
       below 5% in every month from 1983 to 1986; moreover, apart from a brief uptick in early
       1984, inflation continued to decline after 1982, and was lower in 1986 than it was in
       1985" (Nelson 2007).


                                                 9
Friedman's predictions for the level of activity were also off the mark.

         “Mr. Reagan may well face a very difficult situation by next fall,” Friedman said in late
        1983. “There is a real threat of a recession in the first half of 1984.” (NYT, 12/31/83).
        Instead, real growth continued throughout 1984, and was exceptionally strong in 1984
        Q1. “I have no easy explanation of what went wrong,” Friedman said after the strong
        output numbers were released (NYT, 04/30/84).

        In Fisher's case, his reputation among economists, at least, has risen. Bad predictions

have been forgiven and an understanding of the wide range and relevance of his contribution has

risen (Dimand 1998). Perhaps the same will be true of Friedman in the long-run.




                                            3. Monetary Theory

                                      3.1 The Quantity Theory of Money

Milton Friedman’s writings in monetary economics began with “ The Quantity Theory of

Money-A Restatement” in Studies in the Quantity Theory of Money ( 1956). In this article,

Friedman made the case for a revival of the quantity theory of money as a framework alternative

to the dominant Keynesian approach to macroeconomics. The quantity theory for Friedman was

a theory of the demand for money, a theory of income determination and a theory of the price

level. According to Friedman, the quantity theory tradition which had been superseded by the

Keynesian Revolution was still alive in the oral tradition of the Chicago School and that his work

followed that tradition.2 Friedman’s Modern Quantity Theory viewed the demand for the stock of


2
 Patinkin (1969) and Laidler (1993) dispute Friedman’s interpretation of the Chicago School and the quantity
theory as developed by Friedman (1956). According to Patinkin, the Chicago School of the 1930s (Simons, Viner
and Mints) followed the Fisherian transactions approach to the quantity theory and did not use the
Cambridge/Keynesian portfolio balance approach followed by Friedman. Laidler (1993) however sees clear
antecedents to Friedman’s approach in the works of Ralph Hawtrey and the Harvard economists, Alwyn Young and
Lauchlin Currie.
                                                     10
real money balances as a stable function of wealth (real permanent income), the relative prices of

a number of important assets (financial and non-financial) and several institutional variables.

Friedman’s approach followed the Cambridge cash balance tradition of Marshall, Pigou and

Keynes which treated money as a temporary abode of purchasing power rather than the

transactions approach of Irving Fisher’s Purchasing Power of Money ( 1911). Friedman ( 1956)

does not cite Fisher although in his earlier “ The Methodology of Positive Economics “ ( 1953)

refers to Fisher along with David Hume, the Cambridge School and Keynes as originators of

major variants of the quantity theory. Several years later, Friedman clarified his position:

       “A more fundamental and most basic development in monetary theory has been the
       reformulation of the Quantity Theory of Money in a way much influenced by Keynesian
       liquidity analysis. That reformulation emphasizes money as an asset that can be
       compared with other assets; its emphasis is on what is called “portfolio analysis”,
       analysis of the structure of peoples’ balance sheets, of the kind of assets they want to
       hold. This emphasis looks at monetary theory as part of capital theory or the theory of
       wealth. This is a rather different emphasis on transactions and money as a mechanical
       medium of exchange somehow connected with the transactions process.” (Friedman
       1964, republished as chapter 3 in Friedman 1969 and 2006, 730)


However in later work, beginning in 1970, Friedman gave ample attention to Irving Fisher’s

seminal work on the quantity theory. In (1970a) he places Fisher at center stage in the monetarist

counter-revolution.

       “ A counter-revolution must be preceded by two stages; an initial position from which
       there was a revolution… . I would like first to make a few remarks about the initial
       position and the revolution… The initial position I shall call the quantity theory of money
       and associate it largely with the name of an American economist, Irving Fisher, although
       it is a doctrine to which many prominent English economists also made contributions.
       The revolution… was made by Keynes in the 1930s. Keynes himself was a quantity
       theorist, so that his revolution was from, as it were, within the governing body. Keynes’s
       name is the obvious name to attach to the revolution. The counter-revolution also needs a
       name--one most widely used in referring to it is ‘the Chicago School’ (Friedman 1970a,
       1).

                                                 11
In 1970b and also in (1982) Friedman goes through Fisher’s equation of exchange in great detail:

              “The most famous version of the quantity equation is doubtless the transactions
       version popularized by Irving Fisher (Fisher 1911, 24-54):
               MV = PT (1)
               or
                MV + M’V’ (2) “
               Where M is the stock of currency, M’ the stock of demand deposits payable by
       check, T the volume of transactions, V the velocity of circulation of currency and V’ the
       velocity of circulation of deposits, and P a price index.

Friedman (1970b and 1982) discusses the problems in empirically implementing Fisher’s

quantity equations, especially those in measuring capital transactions and he makes the case for

the income form of the equation of exchange.

               “ Despite the large amount of empirical work done on the transactions equations,
       notably by Irving Fisher and Carl Snyder ( Fisher 1911, 280-318, Fisher 1919, Snyder
       1934), the ambiguity of the concept of “transactions” and the “ general price level”,
       particularly those arising from the mixture of current and capital transactions—were
       never satisfactorily resolved. The more recent development of national income
       accounting has stressed income transactions rather than gross transactions and has
       explicitly and satisfactorily dealt with the conceptual and statistical problems of
       distinguishing between changes in prices and changes in quantities. As a result, the
       quantity theory has more recently tended to be expressed in terms of income rather than
       of transactions.” (Friedman 1970b, 198).


Further Friedman (1988) discusses why Friedman and Schwartz, Monetary Trends (1982) do not

include Fisherian transactions variables in their demand for money function:

                “ The idea that renders this approach attractive is that there is mechanical link
       between a dollar of payments per unit of time and the average stock of money required to
       effect it—a fixed technical coefficient of production as it were. It is clear that this
       mechanical approach is very different in spirit from the one we have been following. On
       our approach, the average amount of money held per dollar of transactions is itself
       regarded as a resultant of an economic equilibrating process, not as a physical datum… If
       for whatever reason, it becomes more expensive to hold money, then it is worth devoting
                                               12
       resources to effecting monetary transactions in less expensive ways or to reducing the
       value of transactions per dollar of final output. In consequence, our ultimate demand
       function for money in its most general form does not contain as a variable the volume of
       transactions or of transactions per dollar of final output; it contains rather more basic
       technical and cost conditions that affect the costs of conserving money, be it by changing
       the average amount of money held per dollar of transactions per unit of time or by
       changing the number of dollars of transactions per unit of time or by changing the
       number of dollars of transactions per dollar of final output… “(Friedman 1988, 222).


Despite his differences with Fisher, Friedman draws heavily on Fisher’s analysis of the basic

cash balance adjustment mechanism of the quantity theory. Friedman’s (1969, 4-6), famous

example of a helicopter doubling the quantity of money reads very much like Fisher’s discussion

in the Purchasing Power of Money (1911, 153-154).

               According to Friedman:

                “Let us suppose now that one day a helicopter flies over this community and
       drops an additional $ 1000 in bills from the sky… If every individual simply decided to
       hold onto the extra cash, nothing else would happen. Prices (and nominal income) would
       remain what they were before, and income would remain at $ 10,000 per year. The
       community’s cash balances would simply be 10.4 weeks income instead of 5.2. But this
       is not the way people would behave. Nothing has occurred to make the holding of cash
       more attractive than it was before… The assumption that he [ an individual] was in a
       stable equilibrium position before means that he will now want to raise his consumption
       and reduce his cash balances at some rate. He will do so by trying to spend more than he
       receives. But one man’s expenditure is another man’s receipt. The members of the
       community as a whole cannot spend more than the community as a whole receives…
       People’s attempts to spend more than they receive will be frustrated, but in the process
       these receipts will bid up the nominal value of services” ( and since real output is
       assumed by Friedman to be determined by Walrasian general equilibrium, prices).

Compare this to Fisher( 1911):


                      “Suppose… that a doubling in the currency and circulation should not at
               once raise prices, but should halve the velocities instead… [p}rices being
               unchanged [an agent] now has double the amount of money in deposits which his
               convenience has taught him to keep on hand. He will then try to get rid of the
               surplus money and deposits by buying goods. But as somebody else must be
               found to take the money off its hands, its mere transfer will not diminish the
               amount in the community. It will simply increase somebody else’s surplus. Every
                                               13
               body has money on his hands beyond what experience and convenience have
               shown to be necessary. Everybody will want to exchange this relatively useless
               extra money for goods. No one can deny that the effect of every one’s decisions to
               spend more money will be to raise prices… the only way to get rid of a plethora
               of money is to raise prices to correspond.“ [Emphasis ours]. (Fisher 1911, 153-4
               from Laidler (1991, 76.)

Friedman in other writings voices his debt to Fisher’s quantity theory analysis. In his 1972

American Economic Review article indicting the Federal Reserve for precipitating the Great

Inflation, Friedman reflected on an earlier AEA session in 1910 in which Fisher (1911b) debated

Laurence Laughlin on the causes of the mild inflation observed since 1896. Laughlin rejected the

quantity theory and attributed the inflation to wage push and other non-monetary forces. Fisher

attributed it to increases in the quantity of money.

According to Friedman:

               “Irving Fisher began his response, “I find myself unable to agree with most of the
       positions taken by Professor Laughlin in his able paper. In my opinion, “Fisher went on,
       “the old quantity theory is in essence correct. What it needs is to be restated, not rejected”
       (Fisher 1911b, 35). And now I must cease quoting from Fisher, with whom I am in total
       agreement, and proceed instead to plagiarize him—albeit with modifications to bring him
       down to date.” (Friedman 1972, 12).

Finally, Friedman and Schwartz in Monetary Statistics of the United States (1970) acknowledge

their obligation to Fisher for his earlier empirical work in the Purchasing Power of Money in

constructing their money supply series. Unlike Fisher they treat demand deposits as money and

their definition of money as a temporary abode of purchasing power also includes time deposits.

In their reconstruction of existing series of currency and deposits they praise Fisher’s earlier

work. Some of Fisher’s data is incorporated in their final data series.

              “However, only three [earlier researchers] constructed estimates for the period
       before World War I that are sufficiently close to our own to justify detailed attention…


                                                 14
       Irving Fisher, who constructed estimates of currency held by the public and deposits,
       1896-1901…” (Friedman and Schwartz 1970, 260).



                                     3.2 The Fisher effect

Friedman incorporated Fisher’s famous relationship between the nominal interest rate and

expected inflation into his main theoretical and empirical work in money almost from the

beginning. In Friedman‘s “The Quantity Theory of Money—A Restatement” (1956), although

Fisher is not cited, the Fisher equation is included in his discussion of the rates of return on

bonds and equities as arguments in the demand for money (Friedman 1956, 9).

       Later with the buildup of inflation in the mid 1960s Friedman (1968a and 1970a) and

especially with Schwartz in Monetary Trends (1982) gives extensive coverage to the Fisher

effect. In chapter 10 of Monetary Trends, “Money and Interest Rates” in describing the state of

knowledge in 1966 when they wrote the first draft of the chapter:


              “Irving Fisher’s path breaking work, dating from 1896, distinguishing between
       nominal and real interest rates and examining the empirical role of inflationary
       expectations was hardly known and was certainly not part of the received wisdom.
       Accordingly our first draft, which presented a full theoretical analysis incorporating
       Fisher’s work was devoted to testing his conclusions with our U.S. data.” (Friedman and
       Schwartz 1982, 477)

Friedman and Schwartz then describe the explosion of literature on the Fisher effect that

followed in the 1960s and 1970s;


       “ The first round of the explosion, like our first draft, consisted largely of studies along
       the lines pioneered by Irving Fisher ( 1896, 1907, 1930) both redoing his work and
       extending it by introducing more sophisticated devices for estimating inflationary
       expectations. These studies largely confirmed Fisher’s results—in particular, his
       conclusion that inflationary expectations were formed on the basis of a long past period
       and only slowly adjusted to experience. This condition was the centerpiece of his work
                                                  15
        and the basis for his interpretation of the Gibson’s paradox—the long observed
        correlation between interest rates and the level of prices.” (Friedman and Schwartz 1982,
        478).

In chapter 10, section 10.1 “Theoretical analysis” in Monetary Trends Friedman and Schwartz in

analyzing the effects of monetary changes on interest rates, distinguish between the short-run

liquidity effect, the medium–run income effect, and the long-run price anticipation effect

attributed to Fisher.


                “When in our example, prices are rising at 5 per cent a year, the public will come
        sooner or later to anticipate the price rise. As a result, the 4 per cent initial interest rate
        can no longer be the equilibrium rate. We can no longer neglect the distinction to which
        Irving Fisher called attention between the nominal rate of interest and the real rate of
        interest. Initially both equaled 4 per cent. If the nominal interest rate were to stay 4 per
        cent, the real yield would be -1 per cent. Nothing has happened in the real sector. In the
        tentative equilibrium resulting from the impact and income effects alone, to reduce the
        equilibrium real yield. As the inflation comes to be anticipated, lenders will come to
        demand higher interest rates and borrowers will be willing to pay higher interest rates.
        The nominal interest rate must rise above its initial level” (Friedman and Schwartz 1982,
        490).

Friedman and Schwartz (1982, 583) also attributed to Fisher the important difference between ex

post and ex ante real interest rates. Fisher’s analysis is important in the derivation of Friedman

and Schwartz’s long-run money demand function. In discussing the “ Relation Between Yields

on Nominal and Real Assets" they argue that “for the purpose of studying monetary influences

on interest rates—to follow Fisher and assume that the ex post real return on physical assets can

be taken to be roughly constant on the average over time..” ( Friedman and Schwartz 1982, 522)

and in footnote 48, they state “ As Fisher says in his chapter ‘Inductive Verification ( Monetary)’

in The Rate of Interest ( 1907),” ‘ In general the latter factor – unforeseen monetary change is the

more important [compared with factors affecting the real rate on physical assets] … it is of

course, not to be assumed that commodity interest [the real yield] ought to be absolutely

                                                  16
invariable; but it is practically certain that its variation would not be three and a half times the

variations in money interest, unless the price movement were inadequately perceived’ (1982,

279-80). Friedman and Schwartz further reference Fisher;

                In the chapter in his later book, The Theory of Interest ,in which he presents his
       statistical calculations relating interest rates to past price change, Fisher does not
       explicitly discuss the constancy or variability of the real return on physical assets until
       the final two sentences of the chapter.. He writes ‘ while the main object of this book is to
       show how the rate of interest would behave if the purchasing power of money were
       stable, there has never been any long period of time during which this condition has been
       even approximately fulfilled. When it is not fulfilled, the money rate of interest, and even
       more the real rate of interest [i.e the ex post real return on nominal assets] is more
       affected by instability of money than by those more fundamental and more normal causes
       connected with income impatience and opportunity to which this book is chiefly devoted
       ‘ (Fisher 1907, 451).



                               3.3 Gibson’s Paradox

Friedman and Schwartz ( 1982) revisits the debate over Gibson’s paradox, the positive

correlation between nominal interest rates and the price level discussed by Keynes in The

Treatise on Money Volume 2 ( 1930). Fisher (1907) explained the phenomenon in terms of

lagged adjustment of inflationary (deflationary) expectations to actual price change. He argued

that it takes time for market agents to form expectations and that expectations of future price

change would be formed based on past observed price change. Consequently the reason we

observe the paradox of the price level (not the inflation rate) and interest rates moving together

over long periods of time is because interest rates adjust slowly to rising or falling prices.


       “Suppose an upward movement of prices begins. Business profits (measured in money)
       will rise… Borrowers can now afford to pay higher ‘money interest’. If however, only a
       few persons at first see this, the interest will not be fully adjusted, and borrowers will
       realize an extra margin of profit after deducting interest charges. This raises an

                                                  17
       expectation of a similar profit in the future and this expectation, acting on the demand for
       loans, will raise the rate of interest. If the rise is still inadequate, the process is repeated,
       and thus by continual trial and error the rate approaches the true adjustment” (Fisher
       1907, 284-285).

By contrast, Wicksell (1907) and later Keynes (1930) explained the paradox in terms of

movements in the rate of interest. According to their argument, real forces such as technological

progress and businessmen’s expectations explain long swings in the real yield on capital. Thus in

the case of the upswing in the business cycle, the natural (real) rate of interest would rise creating

a rising demand for loanable funds. Faced with the rising demand for loanable funds, banks

would increase their loans and create money, letting their reserve ratios drop. Eventually they

would react to their declining reserve ratios by raising their lending rates. Hence we would

observe interest rates rising with prices.

       To test his explanation, Fisher (1930, 407-44) constructed a measure of the expected rate

of price change as a weighted average of present and past changes.

       “[Fisher] developed distributed lags, and he applied them to the problem. He expressed
       the nominal interest rate as the sum of a real interest rate, implicitly assumed constant,
       and an anticipated rate of price change, and then approximated the anticipated rate of
       price change by a weighted average of prior price changes with the weights declining
       linearly and summing to unity—that is a triangular weighting pattern” (Friedman and
       Schwartz 1982, 547).

Fisher performed these calculations using annual British data 1815-1914 and U.S. data 1870-

1914 for both short-term and long-term securities. Fisher then correlated the levels of interest

rates with his measure of anticipated price change—increasing the length of the lags until R2

was maximized. He found that the mean lag that maximized R2 was 10 years (the average of his

experiments).



                                                  18
       Friedman and Schwartz (1982, 548-565) discuss later criticisms of Fisher’s analysis and

subsequent studies (some by Friedman’s students). The evidence generally corroborates Fisher’s

analysis for the pre World War I period, but finds shorter lags in the interwar period and no

relationship after World War II.

       “ Any shortcoming of Fisher’s explanation of Gibson’s paradox does not… in any way
       diminish the importance of his distinction between real and nominal interest rates, or his
       distinction between ex post and ex ante real yields , or his emphasis on the anticipated
       rate of price change in affecting both the demand and supply of loanable funds. But that it
       does put in serious doubt his highly specialized composite hypothesis that for the purpose
       of studying the influence on interest rates the ex ante real rate can be treated as a
       constant, and that interest rates follow the level of prices because borrowers and lenders
       estimate future inflation by a long weighted average of past rates of inflation” (Friedman
       and Schwartz 1982, 553).

Friedman and Schwartz’s own estimates for the episodes covered by Fisher find lags of

adjustment somewhat shorter than does Fisher,

       “All in all, the net result of these additional calculations is to reinforce our earlier
       suggestion that Fisher’s hypothesis is plausible for the pre World War I period, somewhat
       plausible for the interwar period, but not at all plausible for the Post World war II period.
       “ (Friedman and Schwartz 1982, 563).

Friedman and Schwartz (1982, 564) like Cagan (1965) reject the competing Wicksell/Keynes

hypothesis although later literature (Benjamin and Kochin 1984) and Barsky and Summers

(1988) are somewhat more sympathetic.

       Friedman and Schwartz (1982, 630) conclude their book by lauding Fisher as an early

progenitor of the idea of rational expectations.

       “Irving Fisher was an early and sophisticated user of the basic idea of rational
       expectations. His expectation ( in 1896) that nominal interest rates would be relatively
       high during periods of rising prices and relatively low during periods of falling prices was
       based on the view that lenders and borrowers seek to anticipate price movements and
       allow for them in the interest rates they are willing to accept or pay. His examination of
       empirical evidence persuaded him that there was an effect in this direction but that it was
                                                   19
        very much damped—the conclusion that we too have reached on the basis of experience
        for a much longer period. He suggested an explanation in terms of the slowness with
        which participants adopted their anticipations, leading to an appearance that interest rates
        vary with the price level rather than the rate of change.”



                         3.4 Money and Business Cycles

Friedman and Schwartz (1963) “Money and Business Cycles” showed that NBER specific cycles

in money growth preceded NBER reference cycle turning points, that the degree of severity of

business cycles was closely correlated with the amplitude of cycles of money growth , and that

evidence contradicted the view that cycles in money growth were mainly a lagged response to

changes in the business cycle. They view Irving Fisher as a predecessor to their approach.

        “The topic of money and business cycles has been rather out of fashion for the past few
        decades. Before the Great Depression, it was widely accepted that the business cycle was
        a monetary phenomenon, ‘a dance of the dollar’ as Irving Fisher graphically described it
        in the title of a famous article.”3 (Friedman and Schwartz 1963, chapter 10 in The
        Optimum Quantity of Money (1969) [2006]

Friedman and Schwartz did not refer to the theory behind Fisher’s (1923) empirical analysis. It

was based on the Fisher equation and was developed in Chapter IV of The Purchasing Power of

Money, “The Transition period”.

“The process begins with an initial equilibrium in which prices are steady, hence real and

nominal interest rates are equal. The initiating disturbance is an increase in the gold stock. Prices

rise as do money profits” ( Steindl 1995, 36. Also see Laidler 1991, 77). But according to

Fisher (1911, 59) “ the businessman’s profit will rise more… because the rate of interest he has

to pay will not adjust itself immediately. “Consequently the real rate is lower, having fallen due

3
 Fisher (1935b) also analyzed the transmission of booms and depressions by adherence to a common standard.
Friedman and Schwartz (1963 b) make the same point but do not cite Fisher.
                                                     20
to the sluggish adjustment of the rate. This leads to borrowing from the banks and a rise in

deposits which raise prices more, also the velocity of currency and deposits rises. These effects

further put pressure on prices and temporarily raise transactions (Steindl 1995, 37). The

expansion ends when the nominal interest rate rises by the rate of inflation. Nominal rates rise

because banks cut back on their lending as their reserves fall (Fisher 1911, 64).

       The downswing will then follow because rising interest rates lower asset prices,

businesses fail because they cannot renew their loans at former rates (Fisher 1911, 65), the

public’s currency money ratio will rise and a bank run may follow. “It is then that the rate of

interest rises to a panic figure” (Fisher 1911, 65), leading to a reduction in loans, a decrease in

deposits and downward pressure in the price level (Steindl 1995, 37). According to Fisher (1911,

65-66), “This culmination of an upward price movement is what is called a crisis—a condition

characterized by bankruptcies, and the bankruptcies being due to a lack of cash when it is most

needed” (Fisher 1911, 65-660.).

       Fisher’s “dance of the dollar” reflects mainly fluctuations in the price level whereas

Friedman and Schwartz focus on real economic activity. Also Friedman and Schwartz do not

have a full fledged cyclical model. In their story monetary changes affect the relative rates of

return of different assets (both financial and non-financial) in the community’s portfolio and by

this portfolio balance substitution mechanism then affect the real economy.




                                    3.5 The Phillips Curve

One of the key building blocks of the Keynesian revolution that Friedman challenged was the

Phillips curve—the notion that there was a permanent tradeoff between the rate of charge of
                                                  21
money wages (inflation) and the unemployment rate. This view based on A.W. Phillips (1958)

empirical finding of a negative relationship between the rate of change of money wages and

unemployment for the U.K. from the mid-nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century led to

Samuelson and Solow ( 1960) finding a similar relationship between inflation and

unemployment for the U.S. Based on this evidence it was argued that policy makers could trade

off lower unemployment for higher inflation.

        In his AEA Presidential address in 1968, Friedman demonstrated that the Phillips curve

tradeoff could only be temporary reflecting the lagged adjustment by workers to rising inflation.4

In the long-run the Phillips curve is vertical. Policy makers can only reduce unemployment

below the natural rate by accelerating inflation. When Friedman wrote this paper he was

apparently unaware that Irving Fisher had discussed an empirical relationship between price

changes and unemployment I “A Statistical Relation between Unemployment and Price Changes

“( 1926b). He later acknowledged its importance in a 1974 Institute of Economic Affairs

Occasional Paper.

According to Friedman ( 1974) ” [t]he discussion of the Phillips curve started with truth in 1926,

proceeded through error some 30 years later, and by now has returned back to 1926 and to the

original truth” ( Friedman 1974, 63)

        “Fisher’s article dealt with precisely the same empirical phenomena that Professor A. W.
        Phillips analyzed in his celebrated article in Economica some 32 years later…. Both were
        impressed with the empirical observation that inflation tended to be associated with low
        levels of unemployment and deflation with high levels… There was however a crucial
        difference between Fisher’s analysis and Phillips’, between the truth of 1926 and the


4
 In that lecture Friedman discussed the Fisher effect when he argued that the central bank could not permanently
reduce the market rate of interest below Wicksell’s natural rate of interest.
                                                       22
        error of 1958, which had to do with the direction of causation. Fisher took the rate of
        change of prices to be the independent variable that set the process going.”

According to Fisher,


        “When the dollar is losing value , or in other words when the price level is rising, a
        businessman finds his receipts rising as fast, on the average, as this general rise of prices,
        but not for his expenses, because his expenses consist, to a large extent, of things which
        are contractually fixed… Employment is thus stimulated—for a time at least. ( Fisher
        1926b, 287)”

Further according to Friedman;


        “To elaborate his analysis and express it in more modern terms, let anything occur that
        produces a higher level of spending—or, more precisely a higher rate of increase in
        spending than was anticipated. Producers would not at first interpret the faster rate of
        increase in spending as an increase in the demand for this product. The producers of
        shoes, hats, or coats would discover that apparently there was an increase in the amount
        of goods they could sell at pre-existing prices. None of them would know at first whether
        the change was affecting him in particular or whether it was more general. In the first
        instance each producer would be tempted to expand output, as Fisher states, and also to
        allow prices to rise. But at first much or most of the unanticipated increase in nominal
        demand… would be absorbed by increases (or fewer increases) in employment and
        output rather than by increases (or faster increases) in employment in prices. … Fisher
        was describing a dynamic process arising out of fluctuations in the rate of spending above
        some average trend or norm. He went out of his way to emphasize the importance of
        distinguishing between ‘high and low prices on the one hand and the rise and fall of
        prices on the other’ [Fisher 1926b, 288)… The most important distinction—and it is quite
        clear that this is what Fisher had in mind—is between anticipated and unanticipated
        changes” ( Friedman 1974, 65).
Friedman then goes on to use the analysis of his 1968 AEA Presidential address to criticize

Phillips.

        “Professor Phillips’ approach was from exactly the opposite direction [as Fisher]. He
        took the level of employment to be the independent variable that set the process going.
        He treated the rate of change of wages as the dependent variable. His argument was a
        very simple analysis—I hesitate to say simple-minded, but so it has proved—in terms of
        static demand and supply conditions.” (Friedman 1974, 66).




                                                  23
Friedman then criticizes Phillips for treating the demand and supply of labor as a function of

nominal wages as opposed to real wages, which he attributes to Keynesian thinking.

       “From this point of view, the essential element of the Keynesian revolution was the
       assumption that prices are highly rigid relative to output so that a change in demand of
       the kind considered by Fisher would be reflected almost entirely in output and very little
       in prices… The simple way to interpret Phillips is that he was therefore assuming the
       change in nominal wages to be equal to the change in real wages. [But] what he was
       saying was slightly more sophisticated. It was that changes in anticipated nominal wages
       were equal to changes in anticipated real wages.” (Friedman 1974, 68).

Friedman then goes on to explain this approach as being based on the Keynesian notion that

prices were rigid ” in the sense that people in planning their behavior do not allow for the

possibility that the price level may change” and that “real wages ex post could be altered by

unanticipated inflation “Friedman then shows “that both employers and employees come to

recognize that prices in general are rising which then reverses the rate of rise of anticipated real

wages and effects the temporary boost to employment” ( Friedman, 1974, 73-74)




                                      4. Monetary Policy

Neither Fisher nor Friedman were ivory tower economists. Both studied monetary theory and

history with the idea of formulating policies that would improve the general welfare. Here we

trace the monetary policy proposals of both men, and the relationships between their proposals.




                                        4.1 Bimetallism

       Fisher came of academic age during the great battle of the standards -- the gold standard

or bimetallism? -- in the late nineteenth century. One of his earliest papers was on the theory of
                                                 24
bimetallism (Fisher 1894). Bimetallism was bound to attract Fisher: a policy proposal intended to

improve the general welfare that could be analyzed by combining theoretical analysis and

empirical research. Fisher saw some real merit in bimetallism. The position he adopted was that

whether bimetallism improved stability depended on the bimetallic ratio adopted. The

bimetallists, led ultimately by William Jennings Bryan, wanted to adopt bimetallism at the

traditional ratios (pre-Civil War) of 151/2 or 16 to 1. By the end of the nineteenth century,

however, the world market ratio was far higher. Or to put it somewhat differently, the price at

which the bimetallists proposed to coin silver was far higher than the world market price. The

mint would be flooded with silver, the money supply would rise substantially, and the price level

would rise substantially.

       Honest men must regard with horror the proposal to reintroduce a ratio of 15½ to 1. But
       we must not make the error of associating 'debasement' and 'bimetallism'
       indiscriminately. Bimetallism can be just, if at a ratio equal to the existing ratio, .... It
       then acts as a sort of insurance against further appreciation of gold (Fisher 1894, 536)

       Fisher’s famous paper “Appreciation and Interest” (1896) was also a response to the

bimetallic controversy. The key questions motivating the paper were these: How much had

debtors lost from the deflation under the gold standard and how much would debtors gain if the

deflation could be reversed by adopting bimetallism at the ratio of 16 to 1.

       Fisher was not the first to conceive of the idea that nominal interest rates would adjust to

incorporate expected rates of price change. Probably the idea has occurred to many people

during periods of sustained price change. In his paper Fisher (1896, 5-9) cites a number of

predecessors including John Stuart Mill, Alfred Marshall, Jacob de Haas (1889), and John Bates

Clark (1895). Clark's paper was aimed directly at the bimetallists. The deflation after 1879, Clark

suggested, had been relatively steady and had been clearly foreseen. Therefore, contractual rates

                                                 25
had been adjusted (lowered) to reflect the expected deflation. Debtors had lost nothing; it would

be wrong to reward them by deliberately creating inflation. There is a reason, however, why we

refer to the notion that nominal rates will adjust to reflect the expected rates of price change as

the Fisher effect and not as the Clark-Fisher effect or the Haas-Clark-Fisher effect: Fisher's

paper was a tour de force. Fisher developed the pure theory of the relationship between real and

nominal interest rates and explored many issues that would receive attention decades later

including what happens when rates hit the "zero bound" and how the distinction between

nominal and real rates affects the use of nominal rates as an indicator of monetary policy. He

also drew the implications of his theory for the business cycle. Finally, he put together a large

multi-country data base and used it to estimate the extent to which long-term price movements

had been incorporated in nominal rates. Fisher, of course, did not have access to modern

statistical techniques for analyzing panel data. His ability to squeeze meaningful conclusions

from his data given the tools at his disposal was all the more remarkable.

        Ironically, given the way we typically use the term "Fisher effect," Fisher's main

empirical finding was that the adjustment of nominal rates to sustained price change was

typically slow and incomplete. The debtors who had entered into contracts during the post civil

war deflation had (contra J.B. Clark) lost something: The real rate they eventually paid was

higher than what had been expected when they entered their contracts.5

        Despite this result, Fisher still concluded that bimetallism at 16 to 1 was a bad idea. Most

debts, Fisher noted, were of relatively short duration. Many farm mortgages, for example, ran for

only five years. Therefore, most of the debts contracted during the deflation after 1879 had

5
 Clark (1896a, 1896b) responded to Fisher's claim. Clark did not offer alternative empirical evidence, but instead
reasserted his claim that steady deflation would be incorporated in nominal rates.
                                                        26
already closed: nothing could be done to offset the unexpected losses on those contracts. The

inflation to be expected from the adoption of bimetallism at 16 to 1 would overcompensate the

debtors for deflation experienced under ongoing debts; it would "defraud the lender" (Fisher

1985, 83).6 Mere sympathy for the borrower, moreover, should not blind us to the ethical issues

involved in changing standards at the ratio of 16 to 1.

        He [the farmer who borrows money] may lose and all farmers may lose and the causes
        may be in India or Australia or in the sun spots, but we can scarcely afford to surrender
        the ancient principle of the Inviolability of Contracts, through sympathy with the
        misfortunes of any individual man or group of men (Fisher 1895, 84).
In the end, therefore, Fisher concluded, as he had in his theoretical paper on bimetallism, that

the Populist plan for bimetallism at 16 to 1 was wrong. But there was now an international

dimension to his argument stemming from his new work on interest rates.

        As an improvement on the two single standards now existing, bimetallism, launched at
        the market ratio, may be worth serious consideration. But the proposal now before the
        world is bimetallism at 15 or 16 to 1. Such bimetallism means debasement of the standard
        for any single country which attempts it. If international it means debasement in gold
        standard countries, and a violent contraction and appreciation in silver standard countries.
        In no other way could the influence of the legal ratio on the market be felt. We should
        witness not only losses to creditors in the former countries but losses to debtors in the
        latter, and these losses would be far in excess of those which we have found to follow
        from the slow and half foreseen appreciation of the last twenty years (Fisher 1895, 85).


        Friedman and Schwartz did not consider the mechanics of bimetallism in detail in A

Monetary History and therefore did not cite Fisher's analysis. Bimetallism enters their story as a

political force that produced limited attempts to monetize silver and uncertainty about the

maintenance of the gold standard that in turn influenced the real economy. They did, however,

argue that an early decision in favor of gold or silver would have been clearly better than "the
6
 If debts tended to be "rolled over" ‐‐ a farmer who remained in debt, for example, by renewing a series of 5‐year
mortgages with the same lender ‐‐ then inflation would correctly compensate borrowers for past losses from
unexpected deflation.

uneasy compromise" that prevailed (Friedman and Schwartz 1963, 134). They also ventured a

tentative opinion that a return to a bimetallic standard after the Civil War would have been

preferable (Friedman and Schwartz 1963, 134, n. 52) to the adoption of a pure gold standard.

         Later, Friedman returned to bimetallism in a series of papers reprinted in Money Mischief

(1992). In these papers Friedman provided additional evidence supporting the conjecture in A

Monetary History that an early adoption of bimetallism would have avoided the deflation under

the gold standard thus producing a better behaved price level. Here Friedman acknowledged

Fisher's pioneering work on the economics of bimetallism. Indeed, Friedman's late twentieth

century research led him to conclusions about bimetallism that reinforced those reached much

earlier by Fisher: As a monetary system, bimetallism had much to recommend it when contrasted

with a pure silver or pure gold system, but bimetallism in 1896 at 16 to 1 would have been a

disaster. Friedman, referring to Schumpeter's claim that Walras provided the best theoretical

analysis of bimetallism produced when the controversy over bimetallism was intense, argued that

"Irving Fisher's (1911) analysis is equally rigorous and far more accessible" (Friedman 1990,

92).



                                     4.2 The Compensated Dollar7

Although he saw some potential in bimetallism (at the right ratio of silver to gold) Fisher went

on to advocate a modified version of the gold standard that he called the "compensated dollar."8

 This section is based mainly on Fisher's discussion in Stabilizing the Dollar (1920), Patinkin (1992), and Hall (1997).
We don’t address the empirical question of how well Fisher’s plan would have worked in practice. Burdekin,
Mitchener, and Weidenmier (2011), however, show that a compensated dollar plan based on silver would have
worked well in the late nineteenth century.
                                                          28
The idea -- to judge from Fisher's discussion in Purchasing Power of Money (1911, 337-347) --

grew out of his analysis of the gold exchange standards being adopted in the late nineteenth and

early twentieth centuries, for example in the Philippines after the American takeover. The basic

idea of the gold exchange standard was to fix exchange rates with countries on the gold standard

without making gold coins that circulated from hand to hand a part of the money supply, and

thus to economize on gold. In the Philippines, for example, silver coins continued to circulate

domestically, but they could be used at a fixed rate to purchase bills denominated in gold and

payable from a gold reserve held by the Philippines in New York. Since Filipinos did not hold

gold coins, moreover, it would be relatively easy to change the exchange rate between the silver

coins they did hold and the amount of gold they could purchase with them. Indeed on one

occasion the rate had been changed. Why not create a monetary system that took full advantage

of the flexibility of the gold exchange standard?

         Fisher imagined a monetary base consisting of gold certificates (yellowbacks) backed by

a bullion reserve. The yellowbacks would circulate from hand to hand, but instead of being

convertible into a fixed sum of gold they would be convertible into a varying amount linked to a

general index of prices. The rule Fisher proposed for adjusting the value of the dollar was the

essence of simplicity. Whenever the price level exceeded its ideal (par) value, the price of gold

would be lowered by the same percentage in the next period. If the price level was 5 percent

8
  An alternative scheme to achieve similar results would be widespread indexing of contracts. Fisher discussed
indexing in Purchasing Power Parity (1911, 332‐37). But while he thought that "there could be no material harm
in trying a "permissive" law" (a law that made it legal to use indexed contracts) he saw a number of potential
problems, especially if the final result was a mixture of indexed and non‐indexed contracts. Milton Friedman also
advocated indexation (1974), and noted (1974, 20) Fisher’s (qualified) support for it. But as Alan Meltzer pointed
out to us neither Fisher nor Friedman took into account the effects of a large relative price shock, such as the oil‐
price shock, on an economy where indexing was widespread. In Brazil in the 1970s, according to Meltzer, this
meant that indexation worked to convert a relative price change into a massive inflation that proved extremely
costly.
                                                          29
above par, then the monetary authority would lower the price of gold 5 percent; or equivalently

one could say the monetary authority would increase the amount of gold in a gold dollar by 5

percent. The holder of dollars would be "compensated" for an increase in the price level by being

able to convert his yellowbacks into a larger physical amount of gold. If in the next period the

price level was unchanged, and therefore was still 5 percent above par, the price of gold would

be lowered another 5 percent. The price of gold, in other words, would continue to fall as long as

the price level remained above par.

        Suppose we define the percentage difference between the actual price level and the ideal
                   ~
price level as P and suppose we define the percentage change in the official price of gold made

by the monetary authority as Pg*. Then Fisher's proposal could be written as follows.
               ~
(1) Pg*t+1 = - P       t


        But how would compensation set up pressures that would return the price level to par.

The simplest way to see what is happening under Fisher's plan is to consider the adjustments

under a classic gold standard. Consider the Humean price-specie-flow mechanism. If country X's

price level should rise above the long-run international equilibrium because of some arbitrary

shock to velocity then country X would experience a balance of payments deficit. Exports would

be discouraged because the price in foreign countries (the fixed exchange rate multiplied by the

price in X would rise) and imports would be encouraged because import-competing industries

would find their competitive positions eroded. The balance of payments deficit would mean an

outflow of gold and hence a downward pressure on the money supply and prices. Fisher’s

mechanism would reinforce the classic Humean adjustment. A country that experienced a price

shock would find its exports decreasing even faster under Fisher’s scheme than under a classic

                                                30
gold standard because the par rate of exchange would move against the country with rising

prices.9

           One implication of the compensated dollar scheme, as Fisher’s recognized and critics

pointed out, is that exchange rates would no longer be fixed. And fixed exchange rates were

considered one of the major benefits of the classical gold standard. Fisher later acknowledged

this criticism and suggested that exchange rate stability could be maintained if all countries

simultaneously adopted the compensated dollar scheme. In this case, changes in the world

monetary base would be the key and would reflect gold mining and use of gold in the arts and

industry. Again it would seem that Fisher's plan would reinforce the classical mechanism. An

increase in the price level under the classical gold standard would mean a lower real price of

gold, and hence a lower incentive to mine gold. Under Fisher's compensated dollar the real price

of gold would fall even further because of coordinated reductions in the nominal price of gold.

           Fisher suggested another scheme by which the stock of money could be automatically

adjusted to maintain price stability under the compensated dollar scheme. Suppose as before that

the monetary base consisted simply of yellowbacks entitling the holder to a fixed amount of gold

held in reserve by the government.10 Then the value of the gold reserve would be RPg where R

is the gold reserve held by the monetary authority measured in ounces, and Pg is, as before, the

price of gold measured in dollars per ounce. The government would, as in a conventional gold

standard, create yellowbacks when people deposited new gold in the reserve, and destroy


9
 The story, of course, can be made more complex and realistic by bringing in changes in interest rates, the
elasticities of exports and imports with respect to price changes, and so on. But the circumstances that would lead
to a moderation rather than reinforcement of the classical effects are not obvious.
10
  The story could be made more realistic by making the yellowbacks the monetary base and adding a banking
system that created deposits and held yellowbacks in reserve.
                                                        31
yellowbacks when they cashed them in and converted them into gold. Because of changes in the

price of gold, however, the amount of yellowbacks circulating in the economy might exceed or

fall below the value of the gold reserve. Now suppose that the government adopted a rule of

maintaining the gold reserve at 100% by printing new yellowbacks and depositing them in banks

when the gold reserve exceeded the amount of yellowbacks in circulation or cancelling

yellowbacks paid in as taxes when the gold reserve fell short of the amount of yellowbacks in

circulation. In symbols, the government would follow a policy of maintaining the following

equation.

(2) Mb = RPg

where Mb is the monetary base; the amount of yellowbacks in circulation.

       Combine this relationship with Fisher’s price adjustment rule, and hold constant R and

we can see that Fisher has advocated a simple monetary feedback rule.
                ~
(3) Mb*t+1 = - P    t


where Mb* is the percentage change in Mb.

The monetary base would be reduced, other things equal, as long as the price level was above

par.

       The quantity theory interpretation of the compensated dollar, sketched above, was

somewhat hidden in Stabilizing the Dollar. The reason, as Fisher explains, is that the quantity

theory was controversial. Many people who rejected the quantity theory held some form of

commodity theory of the price level. For them, prices were determined by the amount of

precious metal in the currency. Fisher wanted to broaden the appeal of his proposal by showing




                                                32
believers in commodity theories of the price level that his scheme was something they could

support.



                4.3 A Price Stability Mandate for the Federal Reserve

During the 1920s Fisher was persuaded by the apparent success of the Federal Reserve in

maintaining price stability -- a period Friedman and Schwartz later referred to as the "High Tide

of the Federal Reserve System" -- that the Federal Reserve could manage the money supply so

as to maintain price stability. It was, as Fisher saw it, the story of the leadership of the Federal

Reserve by Benjamin Strong Jr., the highly regarded Governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of

New York. Fisher now argued that the Federal Reserve could and should maintain price level

stability by controlling the stock of money through open market operations and changes in the

discount rate. Fisher's main concern was that the stability enjoyed in the 1920s depended on the

understanding and leadership of one man. Fisher wanted to institutionalize a price stability rule.

He later explained all this in a remarkable letter to Clark Warburton found by Thomas Cargill

(1992). Fisher explained his support of a legal mandate for price stability as follows.

       ... I tried for years to get through Congress a simple bill to require the Federal Reserve
       System "to use all it powers" to stabilize the price level. This was called the Strong Bill,
       named after Congressman Strong of Kansas, no relative of Governor Strong. Governor
       Strong said to me, "if you get that bill passed I will resign. Let me alone. God save me
       from my friends. If you will let me alone I will try to do the best I can but if you make me
       do by law what I am trying to do without legislative control, I will be so afraid that I
       cannot fill the bill that I will not accept the responsibility." I have always believed that
       had Governor Strong lived, we would not have had the tragic depression following the
       stock market crash in 1929 or so big a crash to start with. I think the realization of what
       was going to happen shortened his life. He had because of illness resigned in 1927 and
       died in 1928. I was told that he paced the floor in distress realizing that his policies were
       being abandoned. When he made the above remark to me I said: "Governor Strong I will
       trust you as long as you live but you will not live forever and when you die I fear that
       your policies will die with you." (Fisher to Warburton 1946, Cargill (1992, 1274).
                                                  33
In the same letter Fisher went on to explain that the failure of the Federal Reserve to stem the

depression resulted from a realization of what he had feared in the 1920s -- that leadership would

end up in the hands of someone who did not understand the basic relationships among monetary

policy, the stock of money, and the price level.

       In fact, after he [Strong] died, and after the crash, I was asleep at the switch until in the
       summer of 1931 1 called on Eugene Meyer, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. I
       said: "I am getting alarmed to see demand deposits diminish. It seems to me this may
       make great trouble." He said: "What did you call the figure?" Amazed, I said: "The full
       name is individual deposits subject to check without notice." He rang a bell and asked his
       assistant to bring in the last controller's report open to the page where the figures were
       given for individual deposits subject to check without notice. In a few minutes the report
       came in and I pointed and said: "You see that during the last several call dates there has
       been a continuous reduction." He said, "Yes, I see it." (Fisher to Warburton 1946, Cargill
       (1992, 1275-76).

Clearly in this letter Fisher was working from an interpretation of the origin of the Great

Depression that was very close, if not identical, to what Friedman and Schwartz developed in A

Monetary History. Friedman and Schwartz were not aware of this letter when they wrote A

Monetary History; if they had been (Friedman told Cargill) they would have cited it extensively.

Friedman and Schwartz did, however, cite a published comment by Fisher that contains the

essence of Fisher's and Friedman and Schwartz's critique of the Federal Reserve.

       "Governor Strong died in 1929. I thoroughly believe that had he lived and his policies
       had been continued, we might have had the stock market crash in a milder form, but after
       the crash there would not have been the great industrial depression." (quoted in Friedman
       and Schwartz 1963, 413 n.171.


       In advocating a mandate of price stability Fisher was on the same page as Henry Simons

and Lloyd Mints at the University of Chicago. The clearest statement of the case for a price rule

is to be found in Simons' famous paper “Rules vs. Authorities” (1936). Here Simons considered


                                                   34
but rejected the case for a monetary rule on the grounds that defining a single stable monetary

aggregate would not be possible. Simons might have cited, indeed probably should have cited,

Fisher as an important authority who had advocated the same (or at least a very similar) goal, but

did not. According to Don Patinkin the Chicago economists tended to distance themselves from

Fisher in the 1930s because by that time Fisher had come to be regarded as something of a crank

(Dimand 1998, 206; Patinkin 1993). It was unfair to Fisher's contribution to monetary

economics, but the Chicago economists, like Fisher, were anxious to get their plans adopted, and

Fisher, the vegetarian prohibitionist who made wildly inaccurate predictions about the stock

market, and advocated stamped money (see below), was no longer a voice of authority that

added weight to an opinion.

       There was also a matter of style. Henry Simons did not cite Fisher in "rules vs.

authorities;" but then Simons generally did not waste a lot of ink citing his predecessors. There is

no list of references and no names mentioned in footnotes in his famous paper. Lloyd Mints, on

the other hand, did cite Fisher frequently in A History of Banking Theory (1945). Mints (1945,

272, n. 33) includes Fisher in a large group of economists who had supported some form of price

stability mandate. In Monetary policy for a competitive society Mints (1950, 126) describes

Fisher as the "stoutest advocate of price level stabilization" in recent years although he claims

that Simons, his former colleague, was "the most convincing."

       Milton Friedman (1959) followed in Simon's tradition and advocated a monetary rule, but

broke with Simons and advocated a monetary growth rule rather than a price stability rule.

Friedman saw the problems of choosing a particular monetary aggregate as less important than

Simons. Friedman believed that the monetary aggregates tended to move together and hence the


                                                 35
goal of monetary stability could be attained by choosing any of them. And Friedman believed

that the loose connection between money and prices created a problem for price level targets.

How could the Federal Reserve be held accountable for missing a target when so many

unforeseeable events could prevent them from hitting it? Here Friedman echoed the concerns

that Benjamin Strong had expressed to Fisher. "If you will let me alone I will try to do the best I

can but if you make me do by law [stabilize prices] what I am trying to do without legislative

control, I will be so afraid that I cannot fill the bill that I will not accept the responsibility."

        Friedman always insisted that he had proposed a monetary growth rule as the best that

could be achieved given the limited state of understanding of monetary economics. Later,

Friedman was impressed by Allan Greenspan's handling of monetary policy and praised

Greenspan without insisting that a monetary growth rule would have produced greater economic

stability. In this respect Friedman's response to Greenspan was similar to Fisher's response to

Benjamin Strong.



                                       4.4 Stamped Money

        In the wake of the collapse from 1929 to 1933 Fisher (Fisher, Cohrssen, and Herbert

Wescott Fisher 1933; Fisher, and Herbert Wescott Fisher 1934) championed a radical scheme for

ending the depression: stamped money. Fisher had no doubt that expansionary open market

operations could increase the money supply. But at the height of the slump he feared that the

increase in bank reserves would not be lent out or that an increase in currency would be hoarded.

So he proposed an alternative, stamped money, that he thought would increase velocity. At the

same time the Chicago economists, Mints and Viner, had similar concerns about the

                                                    36
effectiveness of monetary expansion, and their preferred remedy to offset the depression was

money financed fiscal expansion (Steindl 1995, 86-92, 105). For similar reasons, Fisher

abandoned his earlier theory of the business cycle, chapter 4 of Purchasing Power of Money, in

favor of his Debt-Deflation theory of the Depression (Fisher 1933).11

        The basic idea of stamped money was simple. Currency would be issued (by the central

government or even by a local government) to pay for its expenses. Unlike ordinary currency,

however, stamp scrip would require that a tax be paid on the money at regular intervals. If the tax

was not paid, the value of the scrip as currency would be reduced. On a specified date from the

time of issue, for example, a $1.00 bill would sink in value to, say, $.95 cents unless a $.05

stamp was purchased for the bill. The tax might be paid at the local post office where the bill

would be stamped to show that the tax had been paid. The point was to get more money into

circulation and give people an incentive to spend their money rather than hoard it. In advocating

stamped money Fisher was again reacting to current events. Hundreds of communities in the

United States and around the world were issuing scrip as a way of meeting budget deficits, and

providing currency for local communities hard hit by bank failures. Scrip, of course, does not

have to be stamp scrip. It was often simply an IOU issued by a local government, perhaps issued

in a convenient denomination with the hope that it would circulate as money in the local

community. But some communities did experiment with stamped money; following the ideas of

Silvio Gesell, a German merchant and economist whose writing were the economic and spiritual

guidebooks for the stamped scrip movement. Fisher with his usual energy and enthusiasm threw
11
   According to Dimond (2000) Fisher abandoned the quantity theory explanation of the Great Depression and as
alternative proposed his debt‐deflation theory because he believed that velocity was unstable. Later in the 1930s
he became convinced that the apparent instability of velocity was an artifact produced by the misclassification of
deposits by banks that were evading reserve requirements, and he returned to the quantity theory in the last
decade of his life (Dimond 2000, 345).
                                                        37
himself into movement, setting up a kind of clearing house for information about stamped

money and carrying on a vast correspondence with communities looking for advice on how to

issue stamped money.

       Keynes (1936, chapter 23) also wrote favorably about Gesell and stamped money. But

stamped money did not impress the Chicago economists in the 1930s. In his critique of the

Beveridge Report Simons (1945, 236) ventured simply that "I have never liked the Gesell-

Fisher-Dahlberg schemes," one of his few references to Fisher. Friedman, as far as we have been

able to determine, did not take up the idea of stamp scrip. However, in the case of another "wild

scheme" that emerged in the darkest days of the Depression Fisher and the Chicago economists

were on the same page.



                                      4.5 100% Reserves

       The basic idea of 100% money, like the other reforms Fisher championed, is ultimately

very simple. Banks would be required to hold 100% of their deposits in reserve rather than being

permitted to hold fractional reserves banks. Banks would become simply warehouses for money.

To earn a profit they would have to charge fees for storing and transferring cash. Although if the

government paid interest on reserves held at the Federal Reserve, as has recently become the

case, the banks would have another source of income.

       The point of 100% reserves is that it would make impossible in the future the kind of

collapse of the money supply that had occurred between 1929 and 1933. The amount of high-

powered money had not declined drastically, but the money multiplier had. The multiplier is a

function of the reserve ratios of the banks, which had risen, and the currency deposit ratio of the

                                                 38
public which had also risen. Under 100% reserves the money multiplier would always be one.

Fisher believed that with the adoption of 100% reserves and one of his schemes for controlling

the monetary base, price level stability and hence stability of the real economy could be

achieved.

       As usual, Fisher was advocating a fundamental reform that was a logical extension (to

him) of current trends. Like many economists at the time Fisher (1936) looked at the large excess

reserves that banks had been building up simply as a ammunition for a future inflation that could

be defused by raising required reserve ratios. He also pointed out that charging depositors,

especially small depositors, for depositing, withdrawing, and transferring their funds had become

common. The moment seemed propitious for imposing 100 percent reserves.

       Fisher (1936) acknowledged that the case for 100 percent reserves had first been made

during the depression in a mimeo circulated by Simons and other members of the economics

department at Chicago, although Fisher indicated that the same idea had occurred in earlier great

depressions. Fisher also acknowledged the contributions to the development of the idea made by

other economists in the debate that was inspired by the Chicago memo. Fisher saw his

contribution, evidently, as he had in the case of stamped money, as absorbing the thinking of his

fellow economists, and then packaging these radical sounding ideas in a form that would

persuade the public. Although these crusades, like his others, went nowhere, it is unlikely that

anyone else could have done a better job: Fisher could write swiftly, draw on a large store of

historical and current examples, and find striking metaphors with which to illustrate his

argument.




                                                39
       Milton Friedman (1959, 65-75) made 100 percent reserves one of the key elements in his

Program for Monetary Stability. Friedman (1959, 108, n.9) referred to the work of Simons and

Mints as well as several journal articles as his starting point, but did not mention Fisher's work

on 100 percent reserves. Given Fisher's popularizing purpose, this is perhaps understandable.

Like Fisher, Friedman pointed to a recent development in the economy, in this case the massive

purchase of government bonds by banks during World War II, to illustrate the feasibility of the

proposal. In a Program for Monetary Stability, incidentally, Friedman claimed to have modified

the Chicago plan, as 100 percent reserves was sometimes known, in only one way: having the

Federal Reserve pay interest on reserves. This reform was finally adopted in the wake of the

2008 crisis.




                                         5. Conclusion

Irving Fisher had considerable influence on Milton Friedman’s monetary economics. Although

Friedman’s revival of the quantity theory was not based on Fisher’s transactions approach,

Friedman acknowledged Fisher as one of the founding fathers. The Fisher effect of anticipated

inflation on nominal interest rates was a key building block in Friedman and Schwartz’s

theoretical and empirical work in the 1970s and 1980s. Indeed Fisher’s development of

distributed lags were a key component in Friedman’s empirical work and that of some of his

students. Friedman and Schwartz also lauded Fisher’s monetary theory of the business cycle as a

predecessor to their work although they did not adopt Fisher’s theoretical framework. Finally

Friedman acknowledged Fisher as having sketched out a critique of the Phillips curve 40 years

before he did.
                                                 40
       Both Fisher and Friedman as adherents to the quantity theory favored reforms to the

monetary system within that framework. Fisher's proposals included the compensated dollar

which was a scheme to stabilize the price level by altering the gold content of the dollar. But this

was equivalent to stabilizing the monetary base and the money supply. Later, in the 1920s Fisher

was a staunch advocate of the Strong Bill which would have mandated the Federal Reserve to

follow a price stability target. Friedman, operating in a different monetary regime proposed his

k- percent rule of steady and known monetary expansion. Later he favored freezing the monetary

base and thereby creating the optimum quantity of money which brought him close to one of

Fisher's early proposals. Both Fisher and Friedman, moreover, were advocates of 100 percent

reserves. Fisher's debt-deflation theory of the depression and his stamped money proposal were

temporary departures from his earlier emphasis on the supply of money which Friedman did not

embrace. Both Fisher and Friedman blamed the Federal Reserve for creating the Great

Depression and both believed that had Benjamin Strong lived that the outcome would not have

been nearly as dire. And both believed that some sort of legal mandate should be instituted so

that good policy did not depend on anyone individual being at the helm of the Federal Reserve.

In sum, Irving Fisher was a pioneer Friedmanian; and Milton Friedman was a latter day

Fisherian.

       Assessing the influence of an earlier economist's writings on that of later scholars is a

challenge. As a science progresses the views of its earlier pioneers are absorbed in the

weltanschauung. Fisher's Purchasing Power of Money as well as the work of Pigou and Marshall

were the basic building blocks for later students of monetary economics. Thus, the Chicago

School of the 1930s absorbed Fisher's approach, and Friedman learned from them. However, in

                                                 41
some salient aspects of Friedman's work we can clearly detect a major direct influence of Fisher's

writings on Friedman's. Thus, for example with the buildup of inflation in the 1960s Friedman

adopted the Fisher effect and Fisher's empirical approach to inflationary expectations into his

analysis. Thus, Fisher's influence on Friedman was both indirect through the Chicago School and

direct . Regardless of the weight attached to the two influences, Fisher's impact on Friedman was

profound.
