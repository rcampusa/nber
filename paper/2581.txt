                           Interest-Rate Smoothing




                                    ABSTRACT


    The paper develops a model in which targeting of the nominal interest

rate is a reasonable guide for monetary policy.    Expected real interest rates
and output are exogenous with respect to monetary variables, and the central

bank ends up influencing nominal interest rates by altering expected

inflation,   In this model the monetary authority can come arbitrarily close

in each period to its (time-varying) target for the nominal interest rate,

even while holding down the forecast variance of the price level.   The latter

objective pins down the extent of monetary accommodation   to shifts in the

demand for money and other shocks, and thereby makes determinate the levels

of money and prices at each date.   Empirical evidence for the tlnited States

in the post-World War II period suggests that the model's predictions accord

reasonably well with observed behavior for nominal interest rates, growth

rates of the monetary base, and rates of inflation.   Earlier periods,

especially before World War I, provide an interesting contrast because

interest-rate smoothing did not apply.    The behavior of the monetary base and

the price level at these times differed from the post-World War II experience

in ways predicted by the theory.

    Central bankers, including those at the Federal Reserve, seem to talk

mainly in terms of controlling or targeting interest rates.      Given the

pervasiveness    of this outlook, it would probably be useful for economists to

assign interest rates a major role in a positive theory of monetary policy.

Nevertheless,    many monetary theorists—especiallythose of an 'equilibrium'

persuasion (and sometimes    called 'monetarists")—haveviewed monetary policy

mainly in terms of the behavior of monetary aggregates.      In this view the

targeting of interest rates is either impossible or undesirable     (see, for

example, Friedman,    1968, and Brunner, 1968).   One aspect of modern versions

of this skepticism concerns price-level determinism under an interest-rate

rule (see Sargent and Wallace, 1975, and McCallum, 1981).      A major result

here is that an interest-rate target requires some additional     mechanism to

pin down the levels of nominal variables.     However, this observation does not

distinguish an interest-rate    rule from rules related to monetary growth or

inflation, which may also be incomplete with respect to the levels of money

and prices.     In any event, since any of these rules can be extended to

achieve price-level determinism,    this criticism does not constitute   a serious

attack on the logic or desirability of this class of policies.

    Part of the difficulty in thinking of monetary policy in terms of

interest rates concerns the familiar distinction between real and nominal

rates.   It may be that systematically and significantly influencing expected

real interest rates—which is what many macroeconornists imagine when they

view monetary policy in terms of interest rates—is beyond the power of

monetary authorities over periods of interesting length.     In fact, my

assumption throughout this paper is that expected real interest rates are

exogenous with respect to monetary policy.    But even with this extreme

assumption about real rates, the nominal interest rate is a perfectly fine
nominal variable that the monetary authority ought to be able to control—at

least if it does not try simultaneously to regulate some other nominal rate

of change, such as the inflation rate, the growth rate of a monetary

aggregate. or the rate of change of the exchange rate.     Moreover,    since

interest rates can be observed rapidly and with great accuracy, they are good

candidates for variables that the monetary authority could monitor and react

to in a feedback manner.     In this respect, feedback from nominal interest

rates to monetary instruments seems more attractive    than some alternative

suggestions that involve the inflation rate or the growth rate of nominal

GNP.

       In this paper I explore the behavior of monetary policy that is

consistent with an objective of interest-rate smoothing.      I
                                                                  argue that such

an objective appears reasonable, and leads in a theoretical model to well-

defined behavior for the monetary base and the price level.       Furthermore,

this behavior for money and prices provides testable hypotheses       about these

variables under a regime where the monetary authority targets nominal

interest rates.     The empirical results suggest that this regime     is   a good

approximation to reality in the United States in the post-World War II

period, and perhaps also in the interwar period.     The sample before World War

I reveals very different behavior for the nominal interest rate, and

therefore provides an interesting contrast to the recent experience.

       Part I sets out the theoretical model.   Part II considers optimal

monetary policy within this model.     Part III views this optimal policy as a

positive theory to derive hypotheses about the behavior of the nominal

interest rate, the growth rate of the monetary base, and the inflation rate.

Part IV extends the analysis to incorporate seasonal elements.         Then Part V

relates the theory to empirical evidence for the United States since 1890.
I.   The Basic    Theoretical yodel
     I use a simple stochastic model of money supply and demand, which builds

on models of Goodfriend (1987), 4cCallum (1986), and Hetzel (1987).            The

private economy is described by two equations, the first pertaining to

interest-rate determination,           and the second to the real demand for money:




                             (1)     R = Etpt+I   -

                                                                       Vt

                 information available at date t,


          m:     log of quantity of money (measured empirically as the monetary

                 base),

     jJ   > 0:   coefficient of the nominal interest rate in the money-demand

                 function.

The permanent components of the expected real interest rate and money demand

follow random walks,
                                                rt

                         are distributed independently as white noise, (mean 0,

                   at
variances          and
                          , respectively).           If the expected real interest rate is

stationary, then                =   0.

    Equation       (I)    says that the expected real interest rate, rt +               v,   is the

sum of a random-walk and a white-noise component.                      The main restriction in

this specification              is that movements in the expected real rate are

independent of monetary disturbances;                    that is, of shifts in the demand for

money. at and              or in the supply of nominal money.                It is straightforward

to allow for nonzero covariances between the shocks to the expected real

interest rate and the shocks to money demand.                     However, it is more important

that 'monetary policy' cannot affect the expected real interest rate in this

model.

    The specification of money demand                    in equation   (2)   is similar in spirit.

The shifts to money demand,                               include effects from changes in output
                            at and

(permanent and transitory, respectively).                     But these changes—and other

shifts to the level of the money-demand function—are treated as independent

of the behavior of the nominal money stock,                     However, monetary policy can

influence the nominal interest rate, Rt, and thereby affect the quantity of

real money demaded) The particular functional form, with the constant

semi-elasticity          -fi,    is   solely for analytical convenience.

    There are, of course, models in which monetary shocks can affect the

expected real interest rate and output.                     In equilibrium-style frameworks

                                                        real effects of money
(such as Lucas, 1972, 1973, and Barro, 1976, 1980), the

depend on incomplete information about monetary aggregates and price levels.
                                                                                 5



Since the gaps in information may be small and short lived, the quantitative

significance of these effects has often been questioned on a priori grounds.

Even when the information lags are important, the direction of effect of

money on the real variables is ambiguous (Barro and King, 1984). In any case,

the empirical evidence (Barro, 1981a) suggests that the impact of monetary

shocks on expected real interest rates is small.

    Other models where money has real effects involve the influence of

expected inflation on transaction costs and the quantity of real cash

balances.     However, these channels are usually viewed as quantitatively

unimportant.        Finally, money may influence the expected real interest rate

and output in models with sticky prices, although convincing theoretical

accounts of stickiness that matters for real allocations are still absent.

    Overall,    I   treat the expected real interest rate and output as exogenous

with respect to money because I lack an alternative specification that I

regard as theoretically or empirically superior.            However, even if this

assumption is wrong, it may still be satisfactory in the present context if

money matters mostly for nominal variables—such as the price level and the

nominal interest rate—and only secondarily for real variables.

    The monetary authority controls the quantity of nominal money (the

monetary base),             in each period.   Civen the assumed dichotomy between
                     iii,


money and real variables,         it is difficult   to motivate a meaningful objective

for the monetary authority.          For example, any concern about output and

expected real interest rates would not matter for the choice of monetary

policy.     I assume that the monetary authority cares about two things:              first,

the departure of the nominal interest rate,               from a target value,            and
                                                     R,                              R;
second, the spread between the price level,          p,   and people's prior

                              In particular, I assume (as detailed below) that the

                            Fundamentally.     these concerns must reflect some real

consequences from the two types of gaps, which implies that monetary policy

is not fully neutral.               My basic assumption     is that these non-neutralities           are

important enough to motivate an interest in monetary policy,                      but.   not

important enough to generate significant effects on the time pattern of

expected real interest rates and outputs.                   In particular. the real effects

can be neglected for the purpose of using equations (1) and (2) to determine

the time path of the price level and the nominal interest rate.

      It turns out in this model that the monetary authority can keep the

nominal       interest rate,
                                    R,   close to its target,
                                                                       k, ineach period.
Therefore,       if          were constant, the model would predict little variation in

nominal       interest rates.         But it is well known that, especially in recent

years, nominal             interest rates move around a good deal and in a largely

unpredictable             manner.   In fact, even for short-term rates, a random walk is a

pretty good description of the recent data.                   In order to accord with this

observation,      the model         incorporates a time-varying target for the nominal

interest rate that follows               a   random walk,



                                         (4)         =       +
                                                                 ut,



where         is an independent, white-noise process with moments, (0,
          u                                                                                  u).
      The subsequent results would change little if equation (4) were modified

to        =
              p-1 + u,          where p is close to but below unity.            The interest-rate

target would then have a long-run tendency to revert to a stationary mean.

But this change would matter little for the high-frequency                       properties of the

nominal interest rate, monetary growth, and inflation, which are the main
concerns of this study.     In addition,       it would   be straightforward to allow

for nonzero covariances between             and the other disturbance terms.
                                      u
       One motivation for equation    (4)    is that the nominal interest rate is the

tax rate on money, and the government sets this tax rate as part of an

overall problem of optimal public finance.           The desire to smooth taxes

intertemporally, as stressed in Barro (1979) and Mankiw (1987), tends also to

motivate smoothness in individual components of the tax package, such as the

tax rate on     money.   In this context smoothness means that the government

avoids predictable movements up and down of the tax rates.              Consequently,      tax


rates—here the target nominal interest rate,          follow a Martingale
                                             Lt_would
process, as implied by the random-walk model in equation (4).

       Many economists are understandably skeptical that this optimal-tax

argument    is a major element in the conduct of monetary policy in the United

States or many other countries.        However, for subsequent        purposes, the only

significant consideration    is that policy involve an interest-rate target,
                                                                                           ,
that    shifts unpredictably over time.       This behavior could likely be motivated

by models of monetary policy that have nothing to do with fiscal concerns.

       Because of the lower bound of zero on the nominal interest rate, equation

(4)    cannot apply universally.     However, a random walk may be a satisfactory

approximation    for a broad range of nominal interest rates, even if not for

samples (such as that for the 1940s and early 1950s in the United States)

where the rates get close to zero.

       I assume that the monetary authority and the private agents have

symmetric    information, with each observing      m,     Rt,
                                                                and   during period t.
In    contrast, observations on the price level arise with a lag (say           1   to 2

months for accurate indices).        I model this information lag by assuming that
data on              become available during period            t.      Therefore, the iag in

obtaining data on the general price level essentially defines the length of

the period in the model.               This setup accords with the notion that interest

rates are observable more rapidly (and with greater accuracy) than are price

indices.         Also, the approach embodies the idea that the lag in publishing

figures on the money stock (say the monetary base) is short enough to

neglect     .
      A number of economists (such as Brunner, Cukierman, and Meitzer,                       1980)

stress that the monetary authority cannot readily distinguish permanent

shifts to money demand from temporary shifts.                      I model this problem by

assuming that information about the permanent shock arrives with a one-period

lag; that is,                is known at date t.           More realistically, the o's would

never be observed directly, and estimates of                            (formed at date t) would
                                                                  ai

tractable approximation           to this specification.              Similarly, I assume that

people observe the permanent component of the expected real interest rate

with a one-period lag; that is,                        is known at date t.

      Given this informational setup, the monetary authority's optimal choice

of         can be expressed as a function of the state of the economy at date t.

Because the model is linear and the monetary authority's objective                          is assumed

(below) to be quadratic, the optimal rule would be a linear function of the

state of the economy.             In particular, monetary growth can be written in the

form

The coefficients A will be determined by the policymaker's optimization

problem.

     Many macroeconomic models can be thought of in terms of the sign of

starting from         =     and for given         if        rises do you print more money

A1 > 0 (which central bankers know is right, and
this model) tends to arise in Keynesian models where monetary expansion has

an inverse effect on the expected real interest rate.                But, in the present

model, the expected real interest rate is exogenous.                Therefore,    a positive

response of nt-mt1 to an increase in                        > 0) can work to reduce    in
                                              R      (A1                            Rt

             falls.       In other words, an increase in           must create a tendency

for some of today's infusion of money to be taken back in the future; for

example, in the next period.         This effect follows from the term,                   in
                                                                                  A3Ri
equation (5), if A3 < 0.         In fact, it is the negative value of A3, and not

the value of          that matters for interest-rate targeting.             The value of A1
                A1,
is irrelevant    in this context because it turns out to affect equally the

levels of money (and prices) for periods t and t+1.                However, the choice of

     matters if the monetary authority cares not only about targeting nominal
A1
interest rates, but       also—as   I   assume—about the predictability          of the price

level.     This last consideration will pin down the desired response of today's

money to today's interest rate, which then determines                the value of         and
                                                                                    A1,

thereby makes determinate the levels of money and prices at each date.                     For

this reason, the problem of price-level           indeterminism      (as discussed in

Sargent and Wallace,        1975; and McCallunm, 1981) will not arise here.
                                                                                           10



        The linear model described by equations (1)- (5) can be solved (after a

 lot of algebra) in the usual way by the method of undetermined coefficients

 (see Lucas, 1973, Barro, 1976, McCallurn,                1983, 1986, and 6oodfriend. 1987).

The main complication is that the expected price level,                              in equation

 (1),    depends on the expectations,             Ea and    Etwt.

current information about this period's permanent shocks to money demand and

observing today's nominal interest rate,                  R.    and money stock,
                                                                                 mt.    (Recall

where A and B are positive constants.                   The objective    penalizes interest-rate

gaps and price-level surprises                 in the typical future period, which is well

defined because the two expectations of squared gaps in expression                      (6)     end up

objective        involved an expected present value of the terms shown in

equation (6).)

       Instead of examining the solution to the model for arbitrary choices of

the A-coefficients,                 I begin with the optimizing conditions                  that are

intuitive, and then use these restrictions to collapse the equilibrium

solution to a manageable form.                         Recall that equation (5) is



                  =
                                                                                 Asti

       The policymakers optimization implies the following conditions:

real rate, correspond one-to-one to a higher monetary growth rate (if not,

       2) A7      =   -1—given          the long-term behavior of nominal interest rates, an

       3)   A0

      Equation      (18) shows that monetary growth partially accommodates the

current shocks to money demand and the expected real interest rate,

                   that is, the coefficient                   is
                                                                   (        +   2)/2       (where   2   is the total


variance).         The result says that contemporaneous                           monetary accommodation         is

                                                                                               relative

variance of the L( curve and                      +        as the variance of the IS curve, the

results are reminiscent of those found by Poole                                  (1970).       However, in the

present model, the tradeoff is not between targeting nominal interest rates

and targeting monetary aggregates.                        The targeting of the nominal interest

rate is complete here independently of the variances of money demand and the

expected     interest rate (that is, of the relative volatility of the LM and IS

curves).      In the present model, the tradeoff that determines the extent of

current accommodation           comes, in equation (17), from the negative response of

today's monetary growth, it also generates a reversal pattern where next

period's monetary growth falls by more than todays increase.

    A permanent shock to money demand, at =           -           is accommodated
partially    (since it cannot be disentangled from a temporary shock), but there

is no adjustment of monetary growth at date t +           1   when the value of at is

revealed.     Hence the reversal pattern for monetary growth does not arise for

permanent    shifts to money demand.    (If at were observable at date t, money

growth would react one-to-one immediately, and subsequent growth rates of

money would be unchanged.)

thereby leaves    p unchanged.    (If any of the other disturbances—17, at, Vt,

w_were      observable, the policymaker could similarly insulate the price level

from these shocks.)

    One of the prime sources of shifts to money demand,               +         would be
                                                                          at,

movements in output.    The results in equations (17) and (18) imply (for a

given expected real interest rate) that these exogenous shifts in output

would be contemporaneously    negatively correlated with the price level and

contemporaneously   positively correlated with the money supply.                Thus the

results are consistent with Fair's (1979) findings about the relation between

shocks to output and prices for the United States in the post-World War II

period.     Also, the results accord with many analyses that report a positive

correlation between money and output, although the relation in this model

reflects only the endogenous response of the money supply (which has been

This result means that monetary growth would exhibit a countercyclical

reaction to lagged output.                   This type of relation has been found for Ml

growth in the post-World War II United States in Barro (1981b).

    The precise forms of the time-series processes for                          and         depend on
the distributional    specifications for the underlying stochastic shocks.

Furthermore, the results are sensitive to discrepanies                     between the period in

the theory and that in a data set.               However, the general nature of the

results should be robust to these problems.                 Namely, first, monetary growth

and inflation have a unit root if there is a unit root in the nominal

interest rate; second, monetary growth and inflation each have a reversal

pattern, which shows up with a short lag as a negative and substantial

moving-average    term; and third, a weaker but positive moving-average                        term

appears at a longer lag.

    One other result involves a comparison of the variance of
                                                                                   R

growth and inflation.          Inspection of equation (22) shows that the variance of
    -
              involves
                             o plus other positive terms         —therefore, this variance

(VAR(Ft))
            exceeds that of
                                 Rt

the variance of          -                        exceeds           Hence the model predicts

that inflation and monetary growth are each more volatile than the nominal

interest rate.    This result seems to conflict with the common view that

inflation moves relatively little in the short run.                   However, the prediction

turns out to accord with the data.

IV. Seasonals
    So far, the model contains no systematic seasonals. but these are known

to be important for money in the post-World War II period, and for nominal

interest rates before the founding of the Federal Reserve (see, for example,

Kemmerer, 1910, Ch. 2; Macaulay,               1938, Chart 20; Shilier, 1980, pp. 136- 137:

Clark, 1986; Miron, 1986; and Mankiw, Miron and Weil,                                                 1986).   I consider

                                                                      and in
briefly here the implications of systematic seasonals in money demand

the real interest rate.       For simplicity, I now neglect the various stochastic

terms considered before.       Given the linearity of the model, the new effects

would be additive to those from the stochastic terms.

    The model with deterministic               seasonals and no stochastic shocks is

deterministic    model.    Suppose, as has been argued is true of the Federal

Reserve, that the monetary authority sets                                           to offset the effects of Tt and


St on the noninal
                  interest rate.                   Then, with                       R=          PL,   equation (25) implies



                                           -                =           -       r   -

Using   R=    ,   equation    (26) implies

Note that, if the seasonal applied to money demand (St), but not to the real

interest rate             then the seasonal in monetary growth would eliminate the
                  (Tt),
seasonal in inflation along with that in the nominal interest rate.                                              But, if

there is a seasonal in the real interest rate, then a seasonal in inflation

remains.

      Since the seasonals     in money demand and the real interest rate were

assumed to be deterministic           and understood by the monetary authority, the

seasonal    in the nominal interest rate could be eliminated                                        by introducing a

deterministic     seasonal into monetary growth.                                 More generally, the seasonals
                                                                          24



 in   money demand and the real interest rate could evolve stochastically, and

also be unknown to the monetary authority.       But, even in this case, the

policymaker could remove the seasonal in the nominal interest rate by

pursuing the type of feedback reaction to the nominal interest rate that was

considered before.      Hence, if the elimination of seasonals in nominal

interest rates is deemed to be desirable      (on public-finance   grounds?), then

the possibility of removing them in this way strengthens the case for

interest-rate targeting.



V.    Epirical Findings

      The empirical   results involve seasonally unadjusted data since 1890 on

nominal interest rates (4- to 6-month prime commercial paper9), the monetary

base (unadjusted for changes     in reserve requirements),   the consumer price
index (CPI-IJ, available   since 1913, except that the index without the shelter

component was used since 1970), and the producer price index (PPI, all

commodities).    All variables are monthly but observed at the quarterly

intervals of January, April, July, and October.       The identification of the

period in the theory with quarters    is,   of course, somewhat arbitrary.

(Recall that the period in the theory relates especiallyto the flow of

information about the price level.)

      The underlying data are monthly averages of daily figures for interest

rates and the monetary base (except that before August 1917 the figures on

the monetary base are at the end of each month).      The price indices are an

average of observations    during each month, although for the CPI some of the

components are sampled less frequently than once per month.        The 3-month

spacing between each observation    should minimize the problems related to
                                                                       25




time-averaged data.    That is, the formulation approximates point-in-time data

observed once per quarter.

measured at annual rates.     Figure 1 shows the nominal interest

quarterly    interval from 1860 to 1987.   The interest rate displays more high

                                         Fed was established) than
frequency movement before 1914 (when the

afterwards.    As noted by Macaulay (1938, Chart 20), Shiller (1980, pp.

                                                         and Well (1986),

                                 out to reflect seasonals and other temporary
among others, this pattern turns

movements in the nominal interest rate that were much more important during

the earlier period than later on.     In addition, the nominal interest rate

                                               and non-stationary     in the
appears to be stationary in the earlier sample

later one.     Note also that the graph shows the extremely low nominal interest

rates from the mid 1930s to the early 1950s, which includes the period of

                                rates from April 1942 to mid 1947 (and with a
explicitly pegged Treasury Bill
                                                                  its
moving peg from then to the Fed-Treasury Accord of March 1951 and

confirmation    by the Fed in March 195311).   However, it is unclear from the

                                                     or was instead just the
graph whether this pegging involves a special policy

consequence of the nominal interest rate coming close to its lower bound of
                                                   of precise pegging
zero.   Probably it is no accident that the period

coincides with the time of lowest nominal interest rates.

                                                   base at a quarterly
    Figure 2 shows the growth rate of the monetary

interval from 1879 to 1987.     The growth rate for each quarter is expressed at

an annual rate.     For the entire sample period, the plot indicates a great

deal of high frequency variation, which turns out to reflect seasonals and

other temporary fluctuations.     Unlike for the nominal interest rate, it is
                                                                                             26



less    clear visually what sort of break in the monetary process night have

occurred around 1914.

       Figure 3 shows the annualized growth rate of the consumer price index at

a quarterly interval from 1913 to          1987.       Similarly,        Figure 4 indicates the

growth rate of the producer price index at a quarterly                       interval from 1860 to

1987.     The decreasing volatility of each series over time probably reflects,

at least in part, the increasing coverage of goods.

       Table 1 contains regression       results for the recent period, 1954.1 to

1987.4.     Starting in 1954 avoids the extremely low nominal interest rates

through the early 1950s, for which the lower bound of zero would be

significant    (so that nominal interest rates could not be approximated as a

random walk).     Also, this sample excludes any effects on measured price

indices from the controls during World War II and the Korean War.

      The basic format of the empirical results consists of estimated equations

level of .18, while the likelihood-ratio               statistic for seasonals has a

significance       level of .6713         The unrestricted estimate of                is .934,

s.e. =     .030.    The implied "t—value" relative to unity is 2.2, which is below

the .10 critical value of 2.6 from the Dickey- Fuller test (Fuller, 1976,

implies 0       MA(2)   .25.     The estimated MA(2) coefficient on line 4 is                 -

than 25.

    Line 6 of the table shows that the inclusion of more moving-average                           terms

leads to an estimated MA(4) coefficient of .15, s.e. =                 .09.    Thus, the

results accord with the prediction           that the moving-average          terms will be

according to the Dickey-Fuller           test.14

    The ARIMA (0, 1, 2) form for the CPI inflation rate appears on line 9 of

Table 1.    The seasonals are again significant, although less dramatically

than for the monetary base.            The Q-statistic is now significant at the .07

level.   The estimated (A(1) coefficient,          -

the theory.      Corresponding     to MA(l) = - .66, the theory predicts

0 < MA(2) < .20, which is consistent with the estimated value for MA(2) of

 .09, se.    = .09.     The inclusion of more moving-average        terms on line 11 leads

to MA(3) = .26, s.e. = .09.              Finally, lines 10 and 12 show that freely

estimated coefficients for                     are insignificantly different from one
                                        Aptl
(.944, s.e. = .074, and .870, s.e. = .088, respectively).

    The underlying theory regarded the nominal interest rate as controllable

by the monetary authority, but treated the expected real interest rate as

exogenous with respect to monetary variables.               Hence monetary policy affected

the nominal interest rate only by influencing the expected rate of inflation.

Many economists are skeptical about this model because they think of nominal

interest rates as highly flexible and of actual and expected inflation rates

as sticky in the short run.              The results in Table 1 conflict with this view

in that the residual standard deviation for quarterly CPI inflation—2,47. per

year on line 9—is about double that of the nominal interest rate—l.27. per

year on line    1.    Similarly,        as the theory predicts, the residual standard

deviation    for monetary base growth—3.37. per year on line 4—exceeds that for

the nominal interest rate.15

    Table 2 shows comparable results for the interwar period, 1922.1- 1940.4.

There is now some indication of predictable movements in the nominal interest

rate.   For example, in line 2 of the table, the estimated MA(l) coefficient

is .24, s.e. =       .12,   and   the   likelihood-ratio statistic for the seasonals has

a significance level of .04.              However, the seasonal coefficients are small in

magnitude.    The unrestricted estimate of                 on line 3—.949, s.e. = .029—

again differs insignificantly             from one.   Overall, these results for the

interest rate turn out to be a middle ground between those shown in Table 1

for the post-1954 period and those examined below for the pre-1914 period,

which reveal substantial predictable              movements in the nominal interest rate.
                                                                                            30



       The ARIMA    (0,    1, 2) process for monetary-base             growth, shown on line 5 of

Table 2, again exhibits pronounced seasonality, although the pattern differs

from that for the post-1954 period.                 The MA(1) coefficient is substantially

negative    (-   .66,    s.e. =   .12),   but the new element is the significantly

negative MA(2) value (-           .28,    s.e. =   .12).   Even with the inclusion of more

moving-average          terms   (line 7), the results do not reveal the eventually

positive terms predicted by the theory.                    However, the coefficients of        mt1
(lines 6 and 8) still differ insignificantly from one.

       For CPl inflation, the ARIMA (0,1,2) process on line 10 looks similar to

that estimated for the post-1954 period.                   There   is, however,   no appearance of

positive MA coefficients at longer lags (line                   12).     The estimated

coefficients       for
                          _i      (lines 11 and 13) still differ insignificantly from

one

       Table 3 shows results for the period 1890.1- 1913.4, which applies to the

gold standard and precedes the founding of the Federal Reserve.                          For this

period the nominal interest rate may be stationary and a coefficient of zero

            is satisfactory (lines 2 and 3 of the table).                    However, the
for
       R1
estimated    coefficient of                 on line   3—16,     s.e. =    .37—also   differs
                                    Rtl
insignificantly          from one according to the .10 critical value of the

Dickey-Fuller       test.       There is now substantial short-run predictability                of

movements    in the nominal interest rate; in line 2 the likelihood-ratio

statistic for seasonality has a significance level of .001.                       In addition,          the

first three MA coefficients are positive and significant                      (.49, s.e. =       .11;

.22,    s.e. =    .11;    and .26, s.e. =      .11).
       Given the absence of interest-rate smoothing,                   the behavior of the

monetary base and the price level before 1914 should differ from that found
                                                                                          31




in   the later periods.         The results suggest that the growth rate of the

monetary base before 1914 (which coincides in this period with currency in

circulation)        is stationary, and a coefficient of zero for                    is


satisfactory        (lines 5 and 6 of Table 3).           (The estimated coefficient of         mt1
is   -
         .21,   s.e. =   .36, which differs six'ificantly from        I   at about the .01

level according to the Dickey-Fuller             test.)     There are significant seasonals

in nonetary- base growth, as shown on line 5 by the significance level of .000

for the likelihood-ratio statistic.'6               However, this seasonal in the nonetary

base did not eliminate the seasonal in the nominal interest rate.                        In fact.

since the United States was on the gold standard, the behavior of the

monetary base (and the U.S. price level) would have been largely constrained

to be consistent with the world price level, including its seasonal pattern

if it had one.           Therefore,   it would   not generally be possible under this type

of monetary system to choose a seasonal                 in the monetary base that removed the

seasonal in the nominal interest rate.

         Aside from the seasonals, the results for the growth rate of the monetary

base on line 5 indicate a positive (A(l) coefficient,                  .28,    s.e. =    .11.   The

simple specification that monetary-base growth is an                 !i(A(1)   with seasonais

appears satisfactory according to the              Q-   statistic.
         Viewed jointly, the results for the nominal interest rate and the

monetary base in Tables 1-3 are consistent with the viewpoint (expressed

recently by Maukiw, Miron, and Weil, 1986) that shifts in monetary policy

after the founding of the Federal Reserve in 1914 were responsible for the

elimination of predictable temporary movements,                 including seasonals,        in the

nominal interest rate.           The present analysis        identifies these shifts in

monetary policy with specific changes in the process for monetary-base
                                                                                  32



growth.     Namely, the growth rate became non-stationary,       a substantially

negative MA(l) coefficient appeared, and the seasonal patterns changed.

Moreover, the results for the interwar period suggest that the Federal
Reserve did not get the monetary process right immediately. Only in the
post-1954   period does all the short-term predictability of nominal interest

rate movements seem to disappear.       On the other hand, the results are

consistent with the idea that the elimination of a serious
                                                           gold standard—
also occurring in 1914—was responsible for the changed behavior of nominal

interest rates.     The elimination of the gold standard may have been a

prerequisite for the implementation of a monetary policy that successfully

targeted nominal interest    rates.

.11),   which might reflect stochastic variation        in seasonals.   The CPI is

unavailable for this period, except for rough estimates on an annual basis.

(For the later samples, the time-series parameters estimated for PPI

inflation accord in a rough way with those for CPI inflation.)




ConcludingObservations

    Theoretical reasoning suggests that interest-rate targeting is a

reasonable guide for monetary policy.       In   a   model where expected real

interest rates and output are exogenous with respect to monetary variables,

the central bank influences nominal interest rates
                                                   by altering expected rates
of inflation.     It turns out that the monetary authority can come arbitrarily

close to meeting its (time-varying) target for the nominal interest rate.

even while holding down the forecast variance of the price level.         The latter

objective   pins down the extent of accommodation of the money supply to

shifts in the demand for money.      The greater the variance of shocks to money

demand (i.e., of the LI curve) relative to that of the expected real interest

rate (i.e., the IS curve), the greater the degree of accommodation.

    Incipient    increases in the nominal interest rate (caused by     shocks to

money demand or the expected real interest rate) lead in the usual way to

monetary expansion—e.g.. to open-market purchases of bonds.         This response

lowers expected    inflation because the influx of money is temporary.      That is,

the central hank plans to take back later some of today's infusion of money,

and people's expectations of this behavior lowers anticipated growth rates of

money and prices      Therefore,   the nominal interest rate falls back toward its

target value even though the expected real interest rate does not change.

    If the target nominal interest rate moves as a random walk, the

successful targeting by the central bank implies that the nominal interest

rate also follows this pattern.      Given this policy of interest-rate

targeting—and the assumed specification for money demand and the expected

real interest rate—the growth rate of the monetary base and the price level

must follow ARIMA (0,1,2) processes.       The unit roots   in these processes

reflect mainly the non- stationarity of the nominal interest rate.        The

moving-average    terms correspond to the responses to temporary shocks—in

                                                             to incipient
particular, the tendency for infusions of money (in response

rises in the nominal interest rate) to be followed by removal of money in the

future.
     Empirical evidence for the United States since 1890 accords in the main

with the theoretical propositions.        In particular, the results indicate that

shifts in monetary policy after the founding of the Fed in 1914 led to the

elimination of predictable temporary movements, including seasonals,          in the

nominal interest rate (on short-term commercial paper).        The results identify

the changes in monetary policy with specific changes in the process for

monetary-base     growth.   Namely, the growth rate became non-stationary, a

substantially negative moving-average      term appeared (indicating the tendency

for reversals     In monetary growth),   and the seasonal patterns changed.     The

results suggest that it was not until the
                                          post-1954 period that the Fed

smoothed the nominal interest rate in the sense of
                                                   achieving nearly

random-walk like behavior in this rate.

    One interesting topic for future research involves
                                                       applying the model to
other countries.      At a theoretical level this extension raises questions

about the interplay between the exchange-rate regime and the possibilities

for independent interest-rate targeting by individual central banks.          One

issue is why the elimination of predictable short-run movements       in nominal

interest rates appeared to occur simultaneously around World War I in several

industrialized countries      (see Clark, 1986, and Mankiw, Miron and Weil, 1986).

The founding of the Fed and     the elimination   of the classical gold standard

are possible explanations that are worth exploring.

    The empirical    work for the United States (or other countries) can be

usefully extended to consider in more detail the joint determination          of the

nominal interest rate, monetary base, and the price level.        Such a joint

treatment would allow testing of the model's detailed predictions about the

cross-relations    among the time-series processes.    However, these predictions
                                                                        35



tend to be sensitive to parts of the specification—such as the independence

of the underlying shocks—that here not crucial for the results obtained thus

far.   Thus, it will probably be necessary to make the model less restrictive

in this respect.   'With these extensions,   it would be possible to estimate

parameters, such as the interest-sensitivity    of money demand, and the

relative variances of the different disturbances.

1Since         refers to the monetary base, the money-demand shocks could reflect
          rn
shifts in reserve requirements or in other financial regulations.             In this

broader sense, monetary policy can alter the quantity of real money demanded

at a given nominal interest rate.         But these kinds of policies are not

considered here.



2Lucas (1984) views the tax rate on money as a determinant of the relative

cost of cash and credit goods.         Therefore,    if the tax rate on final output

is set optimally,      it is unclear   that the tax rate on money should be

positive—that is, that money-using goods should be taxed more heavily than

credit-    (or barter-) using goods.      (For a similar argument,     see Kimbrough,

1986.)    However, a positive tax rate on money does allow the government to

tax some black-market activities where final product is not taxed.             Also, if

the main existing taxes are on some of the factor inputs, especially            labor,

then it may be desirable to tax other inputs, such as monetary services.



3Given that Pt is not observed at date t, it           is   possible that Pt should be

                                          However, in a setting such as Barro
replaced by     Ep    in equation (1).

(1976), equation (1) can arise as the aggregation over local markets, each of

which observes the current local price,
                                               p(z).
41t would be possible to assume that the monetary authority knows               but the

private sector does not.          However, in the present model, the equilibrium

value for        would reveal        anyway.



5Because          is observable at date t, the lagged price level,              turns

out not to enter in equation (5).




6Shiller (1980, p. 130) recognizes          this possibility but regards it as

implausible:      "he usually think that increasing high-powered money is, if

anything, a signal of higher inflation.           It would seem implausible, then,

that these lower interest rates are due to lower inflationary expectations.

It is conceivable that exogenous increases in the money stock might be            a   sign

of lower inflation over a certain time horizon if the parameters of our model

were just right."         In the present model the parameters turn out to "just

right" as a consequence of the monetary authority's optimizing behavior.



     use McCallum's      (1983, 1986) procedure for selecting the unique bubble-free

solution.




8The choice A3     -+   m seems   also to work.   However, A3     (1+) can be ruled out

on grounds discussed by McCallum (1986,           p. 140, n.7).   In particular, if

       (1÷fl),   then the realization of a shock—say 17__causes an unstable
A3
dynamic response of the price level.



9Results for the nominal interest rate are similar with the 3-month time loan

rate used by Mankiw, Miron and Weil (1986).
                                                                                 43

     The nominal interest rate applies to 4- to 6-month commercial paper

(6-month paper in recent years). as reported since 1890 in          IJ.S.   Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Banking and Jionetary StaJistics;

Banking and lonetary Statistics, 1941-1970: 1nnual          Stalisttcal Digest.
1970-1979 and    later issues; and the Federal Reserve Bulletin.            Earlier data,

from 4acaulay (1938. Appendix Table 10), refer to 60-90 day commercial paper.

(These were adjusted upward by .014 to merge with the other series in 1890.)

The monetary    base since 1914 runes from the Federal Reserve sources noted
above. Earlier data       come from  the National Bureau of Economic Research. The
CPI since 1913       is from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (CPI-IJ, with the CPI
less shelter used since 1970        to avoid problems with mortgage interest costs).

The PPI (all commodities)        since 1913 comes from the Bureau of Labor

Statistics.    Data from 1890 to 1912 are from U.S. Department of Labor, 1928

(kindly provided by Jeff (iron).           Data before 1890 are from 'warren and

Pearson, 1933. Table 1.



11For a discussion of the Accord, see Friedman and Schwartz,           1963, pp. 623ff.




12Schwert    (1987b, Table 9) shows that an ARIMA (0,1,4) process works well on

seasonally adjusted monthly data for the growth rate of the monetary base,

CPI inflation, and      PPI   inflation.




'3Weak    evidence   of seasonality in the nominal interest rate appears in some

sub-samples of the post-1954 period—for example, for 1954.1-1959.4               and the

1970s.    However, the seasonals look very different for these two periods.

The seasonal found for the 1954- 1959 period seems to be consistent with the

results of Diller (1969, Ch. 3).
t4Schwert's (1987a, Table 3) Monte Carlo results indicate that the

Dickey- Fuller test for a unit root works well if the underlying process is

ARIMA (0,1,1).     Therefore this test should be appropriate       in the present

context.




15The estimated residual standard errors for inflation and monetary growth

             to     amd       for equations (22) and (19), respectively.     The
correspond                e
corresponding     standard errors for         and   are .028 and .042, respectively.
                                         Ft
These values each exceed the residual standard error for the nominal interest

rate, .012, as predicted by the theory.



16   have made no adjustment here for the fact that the end-of-month data

before August 1917 apply to different days of the week.           The finding of

significant seasonals     in monetary-base growth before 1914 accords in a

general way with Kemmerer (1910, Ch. 6), but seems to conflict with results

reported by Clark (1986, pp. 106ff.).



17Clark (1986, pp. 85ff.) points out that the main seasonal in nominal

interest rates ended at about the same time—around 1914—in a number of

industrialized     countries.    This outcome accords with the idea that the ending

of the gold standard freed up all the central banks simultaneously.            However,

it would be worthwhile to examine the changes in the monetary processes             for

the various countries.        Also,   it is worth considering   whether interest-rate

targeting    by more than one country is feasible under fixed exchange rates

(even in the absence of a serious gold standard).

NOTES: The dependent variables are 0, the connercial paper rate; Isa, the growth rate of the nonetary bane; and lip, the growth rate of the
       CPI. Sources are given in the text. The underlying data are for January, April, July, and October of each year       Interest rates are
       •easured at annual rates. Growth rates of noney and prices are over a quarterly interval (for exaaple, quarter 1 pertains to
        Januaryof this year relative to October of the previous year), but •eanured at annual rates. Si,..., 54 are seasonal constants
        for each of the four quarters. è is the standard error of esti.ate. q(lo) is the Q-                 statistic
                                                                                                      for serial correlation of residuals,
        based on 10 lap of the residuals. Degrees of freedom and significance level for the statistic are in parantheses Seanonals is a
        likelihood- ratuo test for significance of seasonal du.aies, versus the alternative of a single constant, Thin statistic is
        distributed asynptotically as 2 with 3 degrees of freedo.; the significance level appears in parentheses.
