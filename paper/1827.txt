                                     ABSTRACT

      This paper responds to Franco Modigliani's recent critique of our 1981

paper on the importance of intergenerational transfers for U.S.
                                                                    savings.
Modigliani's paper is the latest salvo in a long running debate over the

importance of intergenerational transfers in explaining savings behavior.

While Modigliani corrects an algebraic error of minor consequences in our

earlier paper, its correction does not, in our view, call into question the

fundamental conclusion that life cycle considerations can account for only a

small part of aggregate capital accumulation.
                                                   Inevitably, it is possible to
challenge aspects of any complex empirical calculation.     Modigliani's attacks
seem to us incorrect in most cases and
                                           generally fail to address our primary
method of determining the importance of intergenerational transfers. Many

considerations at least as important as those raised
                                                        by Modigilani suggest
that our method produces an overestimate of the importance of life cycle

wealth.

      Franco Modigliani's (1984) review of the evidence and analysis in our

 1981 paper is the latest salvo in a long running debate over the importance
                                                                             of
 intergenerational transfers in explaining savings behavior. We welcome this

 opportunity to address his criticisms and to place our 1981 results in

 perspective. While Modigliani corrects an algebraic error of minor

 consequences in our earlier paper, its correction does not, in our view, call

 into question the fundamental conclusion that life cycle considerations
                                                                         can
 account for only a small part of
                                    aggregate capital accumulation. Inevitably,
 it is possible to challenge
                               aspects of any complex empirical calculation.
Modigliani's attacks seem to us incorrect in
                                               most cases and generally fail to
 address our primary method of determining the importance of intergenerational

transfers. Many considerations at least as important as those raised by

Modigliani suggest that our method produces an overestimate of the importance

of life cycle wealth. Modigliani is also extremely selective in his reporting

of the available evidence from other studies on the importance of

intergenerational transfers.

     This paper is organized as follows. Section 1 evaluates the pre—existing

empirical evidence on the importance of intergenerational
                                                            transfers and
adduces a number of considerations
                                     suggesting the plausibility of our
conclusion that life cycle considerations are not paramount in explaining

aggregate savings. Section 2 reviews our principal wealth accumulation method

for estimating the importance of transfers and Modigliani's criticisms of this

method. While Modigliani argues correctly that a modified treatment of

consumer durable expenditures would increase the estimated share of life cycle

wealth, our preferred adjustment is quite small. In addition, we find his

attack on our definition of life cycle wealth as "non—standard" unpersuasive

both historically and analytically. Indeed, we view our definition as
                                     —3—


perfectly reasonable given the issue being addressed. Section 3 examines

estimates based on transfer flows, and shows that the available evidence does

not permit firm conclusions and provides no reason for doubting the

conclusions based on our main approach. Section 4 concludes the paper and

discusses directions for future research.



I. REVIEW OF EARLIER EVIDENCE

     Modigliani's review of the available empirical evidence includes the

assertion that "all other estimates (agree) on the conclusion that wealth

received by inheritance and major gifts represent a modest fraction of the

total and that an exogenous large reduction in the flow of bequests would not

have a major effect on the privately held stock of wealth." This assertion is

belied by a large number of studies appearing before and after our 1981 paper

suggesting the overwhelming importance of bequest and other transfer saving in

aggregate wealth accumulation. Here we review five essentially independent

types of evidence suggesting the importance of intergenerational transfers.

We then argue that the survey evidence cited by Modigliani does not

demonstrate the unimportance of intergenerational transfers.



Historical Saving Patterns

     The essential prediction of life cycle theory is that people save to

prepare for their retirement when they must dissave and consume. Without

periods of retirement or, at least, significantly decreased labor earnings at

the end of life there can be no life cycle motive for savings. Yet

substantial positive national saving rates antedate the advent of retirement

as an important economic phenomenon. Darby (1979) points out that, although

the ratio of expected retirement years to expected life span increased by 67
                                         —4—


 percent from 1890 to 1930, aggregate saving rates showed no increase during

 this period as would be predicted by the life
                                                   cycle theory. Darby states "...
 the saving income ratio during 1890—1930 was 3 to 4 times
                                                           higher than can be
 explained on even a generous reading of the zero—bequest model." Indeed,

 Feldstein's (1977) calculations based on the work of Kuznets suggest that the

 rate of national saving in the United States
                                                 was substantially greater before
 World War I than it has been since then.
                                               Clearly the incentive to save for
 retirement was far smaller in the earlier period than it is today)- Another

 type of evidence suggesting that retirement saving may be less important than

 many think is that the rate of saving today is high in
                                                           many less developed
 countries where retirement is uncommon.



Age—Wealth Profiles

     Decumulation of wealth after retirement is an essential aspect of the

life cycle theory. Yet simple tabulations of wealth holdings by age, Mirer

(1979) or saving rates by age, Thurow (1976) and Danziger et. al. (1984), do

not support the central prediction that the aged dissave. Mirer reports that

wealth holding tends to increase with
                                         age. Thurow reports positive saving
rates for persons in all age groups, while Danziger et.al. report that saving

rates increase with age with ".   . .the elderly spend(ing) less than the
nonelderly at the same level of income and (with) the very oldest of the

elderly having the lowest average propensity to consume". A number of

questions can be raised about these and other analyses of age wealth profiles

including possible selection biases and their failure to take account of the

effects of Social Security. A careful survey of the literature on this issue

by Bernheim (1986) concluded that
                                         —5—


       "While some other studies have found evidence of wealth decumulation
       after retirement, none have found that it occurs as rapidly as predicted
       by life cycle models without bequest motives."


       In his own analysis Bernheim (1986) finds ".   . .relatively   little dissaving

among any group of retirees", and his tests of rates of accumulation lead to

"...   empirical   refutation of life cycle implications."



Evidence from Annuity Markets

       The strict life cycle model without allowance for bequest motives makes

strong predictions about the demand for annuities. Since the date of death is

uncertain and since bequests provide no utility, life cycle models imply that

there should be a very strong demand for annuity insurance. In fact, the

demand for annuities appears to be very weak. Friedman and Warshawsky (1984)

report that the loads on annuity insurance are no higher than the loads on

other frequently purchased types of insurance such as automobile collision

insurance or insurance against theft. Yet annuity purchases are a rarity.

Friedman and Warshawsky argue that it is necessary to invoke bequest motives

to explain this behavior. While Kotlikoff and Spivak (1981) advance a

possible alternative explanation, namely that families will self—insure to a

large extent when annuity insurance is only available on very unfavorable

terms, this cannot fully account for the widespread failure to annuitize.

Bernheim, Shleifer, and Summers (1985) review a number of settings where

annuities are available on a fair or even subsidized basis and report that

even in these cases there is little demand to purchase annuities. They

conclude from this evidence that many consumers must have significant bequest

motives.

 Wealth and Subsequent Consumptjon

      An accounting identity holds that the present value of a consumer's

 future consumption must equal the present value of the income he will receive

 plus his existing wealth minus any transfers that he will make. This suggests

 that the importance of transfers
                                    may be inferred by looking at the fraction of
wealth and future labor income that is devoted to future consumption. Two

studies using very different types of data have taken this approach to

estimating the importance of intergenerational transfers.
                                                               Darby (1979) used
data on individuals' wealth holding and subsequent labor income and

consumption to conclude that at most 29 percent of U.S. private net worth is

devoted to future consumption.
                                    White (1978) used aggregate data on the age

structure of the population, age earnings
                                              profiles and consumption along with
a wide variety of parametric assumptions to conclude that the life cycle

hypothesis can account for only about a quarter of aggregate savings.



Simulation Studies

      Simulation analyses also call into question the pure life cycle model.

Auerbach and Kotlikoff (1985) show, in a detailed life cycle simulation model,

that realistic specification of U.S. demographics, preferences, and fiscal

institutions implies a very much smaller wealth to income ratio than that

actually observed for U.S. Their results differ from those of Tobin (1967)

because of their inclusion of social security and their more realistic

assumptions concerning the growth rate of consumption over the life cycle. In

order to generate substantial life cycle savings Tobin found it necessary to

assume that consumption grows at a much faster rate than actually observed.
                                     —7—


       Other simulation studies by Atkinson (1971) and Oulton (1976) point out

 the difficulty of explaining wealth inequality on the basis of the zero

 intergenerational transfer life cycle model. They find that the substantial

 inequality in wealth relative to earnings can only be explained by bequest

behavior.



Modigliani' s Evidence

     With his Table 1 Modigliani attempts to demonstrate an overwhelming

preponderance of evidence indicating that intergenerational transfers are not

an important aspect of private wealth holdings. Most of his evidence takes

the form of the observation, obtained in several surveys, that most people

report most of their wealth coming from their own saving rather than from

bequests or gifts. There are a nun1ber of problems with Modigliani's inference

from this evidence. First, as he acknowledges, much of total wealth may arise

from intergenerational transfers even if they are unimportant for the vast

majority of people who have little wealth and whose parents have or had little

wealth. Second, Modigliani's survey evidence fails in many cases to take

account of intervivos gifts. Even where gifts are included it is unlikely

that respondents report fully "implicit gifts" such as low interest loans,

shares in the family business, or payments of tuition. Third, none of the

surveys cited by Modigliani take account of the return earned by recipients on

past inheritances or gifts. It is likely that the accumulated value of most

transfers substantially exceeds their nominal value. Forth, the substantial

underreporting of wealth has been documented in the surveys Modigliani cites.

It seems plausible that unearned wealth is particularly subject to

underreporting.
                                     —8—


     Modigliani also attempts in Table 1 to provide estimates of the

importance of transfers based on "bequest flow" methods. These suffer from

the same difficulties of measurement as his other evidence. Some additional

conceptual difficulties are noted in Section III.

      We turn next to a review of our method of accounting and
                                                                 Modigliani's
criticisms of it. Before plunging into the details of the calculation, it is

perhaps appropriate to reiterate that our reading of the evidence is less

extreme than Modigliani suggests. Robert Solow (1982) considers much of the

same evidence, and states "My tentative conviction is that (the) view (that

intergenerational transfers appear to be the major element determining U.S.

wealth accumulation) is essentially right. It is reinforced by general

qualitative considerations."



II. DEFINING AND MEASURING LIFE CYCLE WEALTH

     In his paper Modigliani focuses to a very large extent on two issues. The

first is "bequest flow" estimates of the importance of intergenerational

transfers to savings, and the second is the proper definition of life cycle

versus transfer wealth. Modigliani devotes little space to our main

contribution, the direct calculation of life cycle wealth. We devoted most of

our paper to the direct calculation of life cycle wealth because, as we

stressed, the "bequest flow" approach overestimates life cycle wealth due to

the absence of data on a variety of transfer flows. In addition, unlike the

direct calculation, the bequest flow approach requires invoking steady state

and other simplifying assumptions that may not be valid. This section

considers the measurement of life cycle wealth while the next section treats

the bequest flow calculations.
                                     —9—


     We address first the issue of properly defining life cycle wealth and

then discusses our direct estimates of life cycle wealth, including the proper

adjustment for the consumption of durables stressed by Modigliani. This

adjustment does not alter the basic conclusion that the pure life cycle model

without intergenerational transfers cannot explain the bulk of U.S. wealth.

We also point out several reasons why our calculation of life cycle wealth

appears to be significantly upward biased.



Defining Life Cycle Wealth

     Our definition of life cycle wealth is motivated by the following

question: Are the U.S. data on labor earnings, rates of return, consumption,

and wealth broadly consistent with the view that intergenerational transfers

play a negligible role in U.S. wealth accumulation? Stated differently, can

one reject the null hypothesis that the life cycle model without

intergenerational transfers fully explains U.S. wealth? We defined life cycle

wealth according to the theorectical prediction of the zero intergenerational

transfer, life cycle model, namely as the sum over cohorts of the accumulated

difference between past streams of labor earnings and consumption. We defined

the difference between actual U.S. wealth and life cycle wealth as transfer

wealth. Transfer wealth must equal the sum over cohorts of the accumulated

value of past net intergenerational transfers.

     While Modigliani asserts that this definition is non—standard and

unconventional, it is as standard as the life cycle theory itself; indeed, it

is the definition used by Ando and Modigliani (1963), and it is the definition

used in the two previous extensive analyses by Tobin (1967) and Darby (1979)

of the role of the pure life cycle model in U.S. wealth accumulation. While

Modigliani suggests that this definition yields "nonsensical" results, his
                                     —10—


example of the use of this definition in his Table 2 clearly illustrates its

ability to distinguish between economies with and without significant

intergenerational transfers.

     Rather than totaling over cohorts the accumulated difference between

labor earnings and consumption, Modigliani would have us total over cohorts

the sum of their past saving, where saving is income less consumption. The

problem with this definition is that income may include capital income earned

on previously received intergenerational transfers. Hence, the sum of saving

out of income can not be used to test with maximum power the null hypothesis

that the zero transfer life cycle model accounts for essentially all of U.S.

wealth because income may itself reflect intergenerational transfers. Nor can

Modigliani's definition be implemented without extremely elaborate adjustments

to remove the inflation component of the capital income earned from investing

gifts and bequests. Implementing it without inflation adjustments would lead

to the unacceptable implication that perfectly balanced inflation would

increase the share of life cycle wealth; i.e.   ,   transfer   wealth defined by

Modigliani is the simple sum of past net transfer received by living

generations measured in nominal terms. A final limitation of Modigliani's

definition is that it does not correspond to an answer to any well posed

behavioral question.

     Once one finds that the data are highly inconsistent with the zero

transfer, life cycle formulation, a natural behavioral question to raise is:

What would be the impact on U.S. wealth of eliminating all intergenerational

transfers? We raised this economic, as opposed to accounting, issue in our

paper, indicating how our definition and estimate of life cycle wealth could

be used to address this unrealistic, but nonetheless interesting

counterfactual. The answer to this economic question is, of course,
                                     —11—


independent of accounting convention. Our assessment, to which we still

subscribe, was that totally eliminating intergenerational transfer would, in

partial equilibrium, reduce U.S. wealth by at least 50 percent. This economic

as opposed to accounting statement suggests a much more important role for

intergenerational transfers than has generally been thought to be the case.



The Age of Adulthood

     A second issue of definition discussed in our paper and raised as well by

Modigliani is the proper age of adulthood. As Modigliani points out this is

an arbitrary choice. At one extreme one could assume that adulthood begins at

birth, in which case the accumulated difference between the labor earnings and

consumption of young cohorts would be significant negative numbers, and our

calculation of 1974 life cycle wealth would be substantially smaller than the

figure we report; indeed, this assumption would lead to a negative value for

life cycle wealth. At the opposite extreme one could assume that adulthood

begins at a very late age, say age 40. In this case all the consumption and

earnings of those under age 40 must be imputed to their relatives over age 40,

and the value of life cycle wealth would be very much larger than we report.

     In our calculation of 1974 life cycle wealth we choose age 18 as the age

of adulthood. In our view this age, while appropriate for the post war

generations alive in 1974, is probably too old for older cohorts alive in 1974

some of whom were born in the last century. Many of these older generations

entered the labor force at younger ages than is currently typical, and they

certainly had much shorter lifespans. Hence, it seems reasonable to believe

that the generally perceived age of adulthood for the older cohorts in 1974

was less than age 18, and perhaps as young as 16. Indeed, until the l950s

labor force participation rates were calculated relative to the over 14
                                          —12—


population. Had we used age 16 for older 1974 cohorts as the age of adulthood

we would have reported considerably less life cycle wealth than what we did

report.

         Given our choice of age 18 as the age of adulthood, we ascribe all

consumption expenditures and earnings of those 18 and over to those adults who

are directly consuming the expenditures and supplying the labor.      Hence, the
consumption of a 25 year old graduate student of educational services, as well

as food, clothing, etc. is counted as her consumption rather than that of her

parents. In contrast, Modigliani argues that the consumption of educational

services should be ascribed to the parents when the parents are financing the

education. A problem with this line of reasoning is that money is fungible;

i.e. ,   there   is no reason to treat differently the case of a graduate student

whose tuition is directly paid by her parents and the graduate student who

pays the tuition from her own check book, but receives an equivalent amount of

money from her parents "for" food, "for" a car, "for" a vacation, etc. More

importantly, provision of higher education and support during the period of

education represents a major form of intergenerational transfers and should be

treated as such. In sum, we see no reasonable way to label certain payments

from parents to their adult children as "transfers" and others as "parental

consumption". From the perspective of the customary view of the life cycle

model it would be inappropriate to treat children as adults, but it is equally

inappropriate to treat adults as children.



Consumer Durables

     In our earlier paper we reported 1974 life cycle wealth of $733 billion

compared with 1974 household net worth of $3,884 billion, implying that 1974

life cycle wealth is only 18.9 percent of 1974 total wealth. The life cycle
                                     —l 3—



wealth figure was constructed by accumulating earnings less consumption for

each male and female cohort with living members in 1974. The age and sex—

specific levels of consumption and earnings used in this calculation were

derived by distributing total consumption and labor earnings in each year

beginning in 1900 according to cross section profiles of relative consumption

and earnings by age and sex.

     In forming cross section relative age—consumption profiles we simply used

expenditures on durables rather than imputing rent on durables. As Modigliani

points out, this treatment of durables has the effect of ascribing too much

consumption in a given year to younger individuals and too little consumption

to older individuals and biases our calculation towards too little life
                                                                          cycle

wealth. In retrospect there is a very easy way to adjust for durables. This

is just to exclude the stock of consumer durables from total wealth. Our

previous treatment of durables involved treating durables expenditures as

consumption for purposes of calculating cohort—specific values of consumption,

but, unfortunately, not for purposes of calculating total wealth. Stated

differently, our calculation of life cycle wealth really corresponds to life

cycle accumulation of wealth excluding durables and should be compared with

total wealth excluding durables. Since the stock of durables in 1974 was $530

billion, this correction lowers the total stock of wealth to be explained to

$3,349. Since $773 billion is only 21.9 percent of adjusted total wealth,

this adjustment raises our estimate of the life cycle wealth share only

trivially, from 18.9 percent to 21.9 percent.

     In contrast to this correction of 3 percentage points, the correction for

the failure to impute rent on durables reported by Modigliani is 26 percent

raising from 18.9 to 44.9 percent the share of life cycle wealth. Before

thinking of the straightforward adjustment procedure described in the
                                     —14—


 preceding paragraph, we assisted Modigliani in using the 1972 Consumer

 Expenditure Survey to try to estimate both the stock of durables and the

 implicit rent on durables. This initial crude adjustment for durables

 involved using the 1972 cross sectional durables expenditure information and

invoking steady state assumptions to infer past expenditures on durables by

households in the 1972 survey. These estimated past purchases of durables

were then depreciated to arrive at estimated 1972 stocks of durables, from

which rent was then imputed. The calculation turned out to be quite sensitive

to the assumed steady state growth rate. One version of the calculation

corresponds to Modigliani's reported 26 percent adjustment. We place little

reliance on this adjustment since, unlike any of the other calculations in our

estimation of life cycle wealth, it invokes quite unrealistic steady state

assumptions. These include the assumption that past expenditures on durables

at each age equaled the 1972 expenditure of the corresponding age group

deflated by a constant growth rate factor.

     Modigliani's preferred adjustment raises the estimate of life cycle

wealth from $733 billion to $1,743 billion, or 44.9 percent of total wealth.

Note that while this figure is over twice as large as our much more defensible

21.9 percent adjusted estimate, life cycle wealth is still less than half of

total wealth implying an important role for intergenerational transfers.



Upward Biases in our Original Calculation of Life Cycle Wealth

     As we pointed out in our original paper there are several biases in our

calculation suggesting that we overestimated life cycle wealth. In order to

generate at least some positive value for life cycle wealth we adjusted

upwards standard estimates of the labor income of the self—employed by 20

percent. Since the ratio of self employed workers to employees was
                                    —15—


substantially larger in the prewar period than it is today, the calculated

value of life cycle wealth is fairly sensitive to this assumption. Using

standard estimates of the labor income of proprietors would reduce estimated

life cycle wealth by about $700 billion. We also assumed in the calculation a

ratio of average female earnings to average male earnings equal to .55,

although the data suggest that a ratio closer to .45 is more appropriate.

Using .45 as the ratio would reduce our estimate of life cycle wealth by

between $100 and $150 billion. A variety of other biases also increased our

estimate of life cycle wealth. These include our assumption that the profile

of relative consumption by age is flat after age 75 and our assumption of zero

earnings after age 75. In addition, one could argue that for many older 1974

cohorts an age of adulthood younger than 18 is appropriate. This adjustment

would lower the estimate significantly. Needless to say, if we adjust for

durables by simply excluding the stock of durables from total wealth and make

these additional adjustments to our initial $733 billion figure, we would

arrive at a negative value of life cycle wealth.



Explaining our Result

It may be useful to repeat our basic explanation for why life cycle wealth is

so small in the U.S. Unlike simple class room depictions of hump saving in

which the consumption profile is flat and the earnings profile rises to

retirement, actual age earnings and age consumption profiles, such as those in

Figures 1, and 2 which are reproduced from our paper, have essentially

identical shapes and levels prior to at least age 45. Between ages 45 and 60

there is clearly some hump saving in that earnings profiles continue to rise

through the early 50s and then decline slowly through age 60 while consumption

profiles flatten out, and after age 60 there is clearly dissaving in the sense
                                     —16—


that the age consumption profile exceeds the age earnings profile. However,

since this pattern of hump saving and dissaving occurs quite late in the life

cycle one would not expect a large accumulation of life cycle wealth in the

aggregate because the life cycle wealth of the more numerous generations below

age 45 is so small. The simple fact is that consumption does not rise more

rapidly through life than labor income.



III. LOWER BOUND ESTIMATES OF LIFE CYCLE WEALTH BASED ON THE "BEQUEST FLOW

      METHOD"

     The "bequest flow" method refers to using information on the current flow

of intergenerational transfers and assuming the economy is in a steady state

to estimate stocks of life cycle wealth. In our original paper we presented

estimates for transfer wealth based on this method. Modigliani focuses

extensively on this short section of our paper. We stressed that these were

lower bound estimates because there are no data sources that systematically

report intergenerational transfers made in the form of implicit and explicit

gifts. Explicit gifts, which may be in kind as well as in cash, are clearly

acknowledged as such by donors and recipients. Implicit gifts, such as making

one's son an equal earning partner in a lucrative family business or providing

low interest loans to children, may not be viewed as a gift by donors and

recipients and would be hard to identify and quantify in a survey. Since the

U.S. distribution of wealth is highly skewed implicit gifts, while perhaps

small in number, could be very large in value. Hence, any flow estimates of

transfer wealth, including those of Modigliani, should be viewed as

potentially seriously downwards biased.
                                     —17—


     A second concern with the bequest flow method is that it requires

invoking steady state assumptions that may be far from valid. It may be, for

example, that the flow of intergenerational transfers in relation to the scale

of the economy was much greater in the 1920s than in the 1960s and 1970s, the

period for which our transfer flow data is available. Finally, even if one is

willing to accept the steady state assumption, the simple formulae that we and

Modigliani examine assumes that everyone dies at a given age D, that all

transfers are received at a given age I, and all transfers are made at a given

age, C. This is obviously unrealistic, and it is not clear exactly what

choice of these three ages best approximates reality. As we indicated in the

beginning of our earlier paper, the correct approximation depends critically

on the steady state value of the real interest rate, r, and the steady state

growth rate, n. For example, when r exceeds n, our measure of transfer wealth

depends on the period of accumulation. Hence, if half of transfers are

received at age 20 and half at age 60, using age 40 for I would be

inappropriate, since transfers received at age 20 should receive more weight

in the approximation formula because they are accumulated for a much longer

period than transfers received at age 60 and because the accumulation function

is a nonlinear function of age. In sum, we feel that direct calculation of

life cycle wealth is decidedly preferred to using the steady state "bequest

flow" method both because of the nature of available data and the

approximations required in the latter approach. This view led to the emphasis

in our earlier paper on the direct estimation of life cycle wealth.

     Turning to our actual flow calculation, Modigliani points out an

algebraic error in our formula relating the stock of transfer wealth, T, to

the annual flow of intergenerational transfers, t. The correct formula, which

is simply a rewrite of Modigliani's, is:
                                       —18—




          T —    —s--- e_D
                (r—n)
                              [   i—   e]
In the formula in our paper we omitted the last term e(Tr)I.

     To illustrate the implication of the formula we discussed an example in

which D equals 55 (a real word age of death of 73 if the age of adulthood is

18), (G—I) equals 30, and (r—n) equals .01. Because of our algebraic error we

did not assume a value for I. In his paper Modigliani uses a value of I equal

to 25, which corresponds to a real world age of 43. We favor a value of I

equal to 15 reflecting the fact that the appropriate approximation to I should

be smaller if r exceeds n than if r equals n; i.e., since when r exceeds n,

transfer wealth depends on the period of accumulation using the simple

transfer—weighted age of transfer receipt in the formula would bias downward

the estimated stock of transfer wealth. It appears that a similar statement

is true of the choice of the age gap factor (C—I); thus, it is likely that our

choice of 30 for (C—I) is too small given that we apply the formula to the

case that r exceeds n.

     In the illustration in our paper we used a value of 45 for the factor

multiplying t in the formula for T. Taking I equal to 25 Modigliani

calculates a value of 35 for this factor. With our preferred value for I of

15 the factor is 39. Since we reported a lower bound estimate for t of $45.4

billion our revised upper bound "bequest flow" estimate for the stock of life

cycle wealth, using I equals 15, is $2,113 billion, which is 54 percent of

1974 household wealth. Note that if we use an age gap (C—I) factor of 45

which may be more appropriate since r exceeds n, the upper bound estimate of

life cycle wealth is $1,429 billion, or only 37 percent of 1974 household net

worth.

IV. IMPLICATIONS OF OUR FINDINGS FOR VIEWING THE LIFE CYCLE MODEL AND FOR

FUTURE RESEARCH

     The finding that intergenerational transfers are a key feature of U.S.

wealth accumulation has not lessened interest in the pure life cycle model.

On the contrary, a variety of researchers, including Sheshinski and Weiss

(1981), Davies (1981), Eckstein, Eichenbaum, and Peled (1983), and Abel

(1983), and Hubbard (l984a, l984b) have investigated the potential for

unintentional intergenerational transfers within models in which households

have pure life cycle preferences, but in which annuity markets do not exist.

Kotlikoff, Spivak, and Shoven (1984, 1986) also consider nonaltruistic life

cycle preferences and show that significant intergenerational transfers can

arise in a setting of partial annuity insurance provided by family members.

Other researchers, such as Bernheim, Shleifer, and Summers (1985) view

intergenerational transfers within a pure life cycle model as the implicit

payment by parents to their children for material and other types of support.

A third view of intergeneration transfers that contains an important role for

the pure life cycle model is espoused by Kurz (1984) and others, namely that

society is heterogeneous, with a large number of relatively poor households

with pure life cycle preferences and a small number of relatively altruistic

extended families with significant bequest motives.

     Since the short and potentially long run impact of fiscal policies

depends on the relative number of life cycle households in the U.S. economy, a

statistic that is unknown, it remains important to understand the impact of

fiscal policies within the pure life cycle model. To that end Summers (1981),

Auerbach and Kotlikoff (1986), Seidinan (1984), Gahvari (1985), Lawrence

(1983), and many others have examined fiscal policies within pure life cycle

models. These theoretical and simulation studies have been accompanied by a
                                     —20—
large volume of empirical research testing the implications of the pure life

cycle model.

     In sum, research on, and interest in the life cycle model has never been

greater than in the last few years. Moreover, the nature and heterogeneity of

household saving behavior remains poorly understood. In our view, additional

research investigating the nature of saving preferences rather than additional

wealth accounting holds the key to understanding the very important role of

intergenerational transfers as well as the contribution of pure life cycle

saving motives to U.S. wealth accumulation.

                                    Notes




1.   More recent statistics also point to an inverse correlation between the
     duration of retirement and the U.S. saving rate. Kotlikoff and Smith
     (1983) report that since 1950 the expected duration of retirement and
     other nonworking periods for the average adult has almost doubled. This
     change coincided with a secular decline of over 40 percent in the rate of
     U.S. saving out of net national product (Boskin and Kotlikoff,l985).
