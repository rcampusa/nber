Expanding Governance as Development: Evidence on Child Nutrition in the Philippines
Eli Berman, Mitch Downey, and Joseph Felter
NBER Working Paper No. 21849
January 2016
JEL No. F51,I15,O53

                                            ABSTRACT

Worldwide, extreme poverty is often concentrated in spaces where people and property are not safe
enough to sustain effective markets, and where development assistance is dangerous – and might even
induce violence. Expanding governance by coercively taking control of territory may enable markets
and development programs, but costs to local residents may exceed benefits, especially if that expansion
is violent. We estimate for the first time whether a large counterinsurgency program improves welfare.
We exploit the staggered roll-out of the Philippine “Peace and Development Teams” counterinsurgency
program, which treated 12% of the population between 2002 and 2010. Though treatment temporarily
increased violence, the program progressively reduced child malnutrition: by 10% in the first year,
and by 30% from year three onwards. Improved nutritional status was not due to increased health and
welfare expenditures, but instead to improved governance. Treatment effects are comparable to those
of conventional child health interventions, though conventional programs are likely infeasible in this
setting. Rebels apparently react to treatment by shifting to neighboring municipalities, as malnutrition
worsens there – with statistically significant 'treatment' effects of similar size. Thus overall program
effects are close to zero. These findings invite an evidence-based discussion of governance expansion,
an extensive margin of development.

1        Introduction
    Conflict and unstable governments are currently central challenges to development. Con-
sider development assistance: as Table I illustrates, countries receiving Western Official
Development Assistance (ODA) tend to be not only poor, but also conflict-cursed. The
table lists the top 15 recipients of ODA per capita from the World Bank, the United States,
and the United Kingdom, along with measures of poverty, political instability, and conflict.
These 15 include four of the five least stable countries on the globe, and five of the bottom
ten. Seven have suffered conflict for at least 15 of the last 25 years, with Sudan and Colom-
bia involved in conflict for all 25. Foreign assistance is a major segment of these economies.
From 2003-2012, ODA from these three sources made up more than 5% of GDP in nine of
these countries and more than 25% in the case of Afghanistan.

                                          [Table I about here.]

    Current recipients of development assistance are typically violent and unstable for two
reasons. First, poor governance in general and violence in particular undermines investment
of all types, including in human capital and in institutions. So while countries such as China,
with politically stable governments that protect property and people (at least for elites) have
experienced sufficient growth to graduate out of a need for assistance, the conflict-cursed
countries in the table have not. Somalia, Afghanistan and Sudan, for instance, have average
GDP per capita of less than $2 per day.1
    Second, ODA is often directed at countries such as Iraq and Colombia (who are not
among the poorest) with the objective of helping control their ungoverned spaces as part
of a separate agenda of countering terrorism, narcotics, human trafficking and other global
public bads. Economists might object that this agenda distorts allocation of assistance to
the very poorest. Yet, if development assistance actually helped improve governance, that
allocation might be justifiable on efficiency grounds. That extensive margin of development,
bringing governance to unsafe spaces, is the focus of this paper.
   The centrality of conflict in modern development raises both practical and conceptual
challenges. Practically, development programs insert lootable and extortable resources like
cash, food, equipment and personnel into insecure spaces, inviting predation and targeting by
rebel groups.2 Conceptually, the usual logic by which development programs improve welfare

requires that people and property are safe enough to allow contracting. If so, an injection of
resources implies a welfare improvement if the other conditions of the first welfare theorem
are also met. In the absence of those conditions, development assistance of any form may
reduce welfare of residents by shifting rents to extortionary actors or by inducing welfare
loss through violence and human rights abuses.3
    Recent empirical results underscore this challenge. Using a regression discontinuity de-
sign Crost, Felter, and Johnston (2014) show sharp increases in rebel-initiated attacks in
Philippine villages following the award of small-scale infrastructure grants. Using a multi-
country panel, Besley and Persson (2011) show that in the absence of strong institutions,
increases in foreign aid significantly increase the onset of large-scale political violence. Nunn
and Qian (2014) show that US food aid to conflict-prone countries increases the intensity
and duration of civil conflict. Aid can intensify conflict, perhaps undermining the possibility
of economic development by reducing security of people and property.4
    Rather than implementing development programs in poorly governed spaces, an alter-
native might be to first expand governance into that space. This is often an option; many
countries, like the Philippines, have pockets of ungoverned or poorly controlled space bor-
dering fairly well controlled areas. Expansion of governance is a new topic for economists,
though recently Callen et al. (2015) provide an economic explanation for the expansion of
Pakistan into formerly ungoverneed space, and both Vanden Eynde (2015) and Berman et al.
(2012) have looked at whether potential tax revenue induces government to contest rebel con-
trol, in India and the Phillippines respectively. While as economists we may have normative
concerns about recommending a coercive policy, it would nevertheless be a valuable positive
exercise to investigate what the net welfare effects of such an expansion of governance are.
    Does expanding governance improve development outcomes? The answer is theoretically
ambiguous. We tend to think that a state will provide institutions that are more conducive
to functioning markets (and therefore welfare) than will rebels or informal governance. Yet
states sometimes neglect populations in the periphery, and rebels often provide services.5
Moreover, even if state governance is preferable to that by rebels, the transition is sometimes
coercive and destructive (Machal, 1996), and accompanied by abuses of human rights, as it
has been in the Philippines (Sales, 2009). So the net effect of an expansion of governance
may make it undesirable for residents, even if government is preferred to rebels in a steady

      One option implemented in Afghanistan and Iraq was development programs selected and protected by
the military. Berman et al. (2013) show that development projects, when accompanied by adequate force
levels in Iraq, were security enhancing (in the sense of reducing violent incidents). Discussing development
and counterinsurgency in Afghanistan, NATO force commander McChrystal said: “We view it as a process...
which enables Afghan ownership and reinforces Afghan sovereignty... In some areas, it will be security
assistance. In some areas... it will be more based on help with governance and development...” (McChrystal,
2010).

      Berman (2009) describes provision of services by Hamas, Hezbollah, the Mahdi Army and the Taliban;
Heger (2010) documents community services provided by the Irish Republican Army; Keister (2011) describes
services provided by the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the Moro National Liberation Front in the
Southern Philippines. These sources and anecdotal evidence suggest that when rebels control territory
they typically provide at least some form of security and dispute adjudication services to noncombatants,
apparently at low cost to themselves.

   To date, no empirical research has directly assessed the net benefits of expanding gov-
ernance, despite the volume of assistance now directed at unstable spaces. In this paper,
we attempt to fill that void by evaluating a large counterinsurgency program operated by
the Armed Forces of the Philippines: “Peace and Development Teams” (PDT). Exploiting
unprecedented access to precise program data on location and timing, and the program’s
staggered roll-out over nine years, we estimate effects on one of the few development out-
comes available annually for Philippines municipalities: child malnutrition.
    The program progressively reduced child malnutrition, by about 10% after the first year
and 30% after three years, an effect that is persistent for the seven year duration that we can
estimate.6 These improvements in child welfare occurred despite increased violence associ-
ated with treatment –much of which is initiated by government forces. These improvements
are slightly smaller than the treatment effects of other successful child health interventions,
yet those alternatives would be difficult to implement in such weakly governed spaces. While
we can provide little detail about the mechanism by which PDT reduced child malnutrition,
we can rule out the possibility that it proxies for a general expansion of social services, in-
cluding health services. We therefore conclude that improvements in security, in access to
markets, or in access to existing government services must be the causal mechanisms.
    How do rebels react to PDT implementation? One possibility is that they are deterred,
and retreat into inaction. This is often the working assumption of one-location models, even
when estimated with data from multiple locations (e.g., Berman et al. (2013)). Our evidence
indicates the opposite. Rebels apparently respond to PDT by relocating to neighboring mu-
nicipalities, as evidenced by worsening malnutrition among neighbors following PDT. Thus,
despite the improvements in child nutrition in treated municipalities, the aggregate effect
of the program seems to be nullified by a displacement of malnutrition to neighboring mu-
nicipalities which experience an approximately equal and opposite increase in malnutrition.
This is the first evidence, to our knowledge, of a localized strategic reaction by opponents
to a program of this type.
    In the next section, we discuss the Philippine conflict and the design of the PDT pro-
gram. Section 3 describes our data. In Section 4 we consider non-random selection of where
PDT is implemented. Since we lack a strictly exogenous source of variation in implementa-
tion, Section 4 is useful for understanding threats to causal inference. In Section 5 we use
an “event study” design to estimate the malnutrition effects of PDT. We show that PDT
was not preceded by trends in malnutrition and that our results are unaffected by the se-
lection controls identified in Section 4. Section 6 presents additional results that are useful
for interpreting the estimated effect before Section 7 concludes with a discussion of policy
implications, comparing these estimated effects to those of other malnutrition interventions
and speculating on the larger question of secure governance in development.

2       Context
    The Philippines has suffered low-grade civil conflict for many decades,7 which continues
despite a history of fairly functional multiparty democracy since 1986 (polity score of eight,
since 1989).8 In that sense it is similar to Colombia, Mexico, Indonesia, or Turkey.
    While a number of rebel groups are active, they can be broadly classified into two cat-
egories. The New People’s Army (NPA), the armed wing of the Communist Party of the
Philippines (CPP), form the first category. The NPA has a following among the very poor,
which is exacerbated by severe income inequality and the very gradual pace of land reform,
even in the period of democracy (Montinola, 2013). During the first decade of this century,
the NPA has accounted for nearly two-thirds of violent incidents (Crost et al., 2014). It is
active throughout the Philippines, though more so in rural areas.
    Islamic separatists form a second category, which includes the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF), the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), and the smaller and more
extreme Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG). Separatists are primarily active in the country’s South,
in Mindanao and the Sulu Sea, and are ostensibly fighting for an independent Islamist
state. Past compromises between Islamist militants (primarily the MNLF) and the federal
government have significantly expanded the scope of local authority, with the establishment
of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindinao (ARMM) in 1996, one of the Philippines’
seventeen regions.9
    Importantly, the formal government faces little risk of being overthrown. The asymme-
try of power is heavily tilted in its favor.10 The conflict with the NPA is characterized by
small-scale insurgent attacks in poor rural areas, rather than frequent full-scale battles. Gov-
ernment authority is relatively uncontested in urban areas, where rebel groups have limited
popular support and opportunities to organize. Figure I displays this pattern, showing that
both violent incidents and malnutrition –our key development outcome, are associated with
low population density. Both conflict and poverty are concentrated in rural areas.

                                         [Figure I about here.]

   As part of an effort to expand governance, the Philippine Army launched the PDT
program in 2002, which continued earlier “stabilization operations.” Our sample period
roughly coincides with the Presidency of Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo11 (January 2001 until
June 2010), though the program has continued under her successor.12 According to the
    7
      Here, we provide only a brief review of these conflicts. The interested reader should see Crost and
Johnston (2010), Felter (2005), Hernandez (2014), Quimpo (2012), or Schiavo-Campo and Judd (2005).

      Since 1989, the Philippines has maintained a polity score of eight. This score, originated by Ted Gurr,
ranges from -10 (least democratic) to 10 (most democratic) and is based on executive recruitment, executive
constraints, and political competition (Marshall and Cole, 2011).
    9
      Regions are the largest subnational division of government.

      In asymmetric conflicts like these, governments struggle to obtain information that helps them locate
insurgents, rather than struggle to defend territory (Berman and Matanock, 2015).

clear out entrenched rebels, assess community needs, and connect the village to government
programs and services. In principle, this might include building schools or clinics (though
we report evidence below to the contrary).14 Treatment more likely included protecting
local business or markets from rebel extortion, securing roads to nearby villages or cities,
or simply providing sufficient security for other government or international agencies to do
their work. Each PDT implementation is relatively short, averaging less than three months,
but is meant to establish a basis for continuing government involvement.
    The PDT program is quite significant in scale. Table II reports PDT implementations
per year, as well as cumulative implementations through 2010. In any given year, 500-1,000
of the Philippines’ 42,000 villages, accounting for 1-2% of the population, were treated. Over
the full period, over 5,000 villages (fully 12% of the population) received treatment. The
Philippines has about 1,600 municipalities, nearly half of which (47% of the population)
contained a village treated with PDT during the sample period.15

   Figure II maps implementations. Note that PDT treatment is spread throughout the
Philippines, though disproportionately in peripheral locations with low population density.

   In conclusion, the PDT program represents a concerted effort by the government to sys-
tematically expand control into areas that are relatively poor, violent and rural. It includes
security and, in principle, development elements. To estimate treatment effects we will
exploit staggered roll-out over nine sample years.


3      Data
    We have three primary variables: PDT implementations, malnutrition rates, and vio-
lent incidents. Additional variables (e.g., population, geography, etc.) are discussed in an
uprisings: a mutiny in July 2003, a state of emergency in February 2006 in reaction to an alleged coup attempt
and a small rebellion in November 2007. None of these seem to affect program rollout (analysis available
upon request).
    13
       Officially, the program is implemented within barangays, subnational political units smaller than mu-
nicipalities. Barangays are mutually exclusive and exhaustive and are located entirely within municipalities.
The Philippines has approximately 42,000 barangays, with an average population of about 3,000. Through-
out the paper, we refer to barangays as “villages.” The exact number of villages and municipalities in the
Philippines changes every year, as these units merge and split. For analysis we use a consistent set of village
and municipality definitions that closely corresponds to official 2009 definitions used in Felter (2005).
    14
       Unfortunately, we lack data about the specific set of services offered in PDT operations.
    15
       The geographic unit immediately larger than villages is the municipality, which have considerable po-
litical authority. The Philippines draws a distinction between “municipalities” and “cities.” Technically
speaking, there are about 1,500 municipalities and 140 or so cities, which have larger populations. The polit-
ical distinction between these units is small so for simplicity, we use the term “municipalities” to collectively
refer to cities and municipalities.

3.1     PDT
    This research is enabled by access to a dataset unique in the study of counterinsurgencies.
The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) have shared with us the location and timing of
all PDT implementations from 2002 through 2010.16 While the AFP had been expanding
governance and providing development services long before 2002, we lack systematic data
on those efforts. (So we can only study the effects of this particular wave of interventions,
without being able to account for how previous programs might influence current treatment
effects.)


3.2     Violent incidents
    Our incident data include the full universe of violent incidents reported by the AFP.
They were first compiled and analyzed in Felter (2005)17 and subsequently updated as part
of the Empirical Studies of Conflict project. The data are based on underlying AFP incident
reports.18 For each incident, the data includes rebel, civilian, and government casualties;
the number of rebels captured or surrendered; and a geographic code corresponding to the
village where the incident occurred.19 A unique characteristic of these data is an indicator
for whether the incident was rebel- or government-initiated.


3.3     Malnutrition
    Malnutrition data is from the Philippines National Nutrition Council’s (NNC) Opera-
tion Timbang (OPT) project. Operation Timbang is the NNC’s largest program, seeking
to annually weigh every child in the country aged 0-71 months. In the late 1970’s, the
Philippine government established village-based health care provision as a national strategy
(Phillips, 1986). Since that time, it has conducted a number of large-scale programs to sys-
tematically establish permanent health care experts in local villages. Currently operating
programs include the Barangay (village) Nutrition Scholars (BNS) program (established in
1978), Day Care Centers (established in 1990), the Barangay Health Worker (BHW) pro-
gram (established in 1995), and the Rural Health Midwives Placement Program (RHMPP)
through which placements began in 2008.
  16
      For 75% of implementations, we also observe end dates. For a small fraction (0.6%) of implementations,
the geographic code corresponded to a municipality. We coded these as having occurred in each village
within that municipality. Because of changes in the definition of villages over time, we were unable to merge
two of the 6,819 implementations with the rest of our data.
   17
      See also Crost et al. (2014) and Crost et al. (2013).
   18
      Because the data originally come from AFP incident reports, they likely undercount attacks in which
the AFP was not involved. This complicates the variable’s interpretation, but does not bias our results.
   19
      For about 7% of incidents, the geographic code corresponds to a municipality. These incidents are
excluded from village-level analyses. Since our main analyses are conducted at the municipality-level, this
has little bearing on our empirical results.

                                                     6
    Weighing is conducted by an OPT Plus Team, which includes village health and day care
workers, members of the Barangay Council, and sometimes other local community leaders
and mothers. This team seeks to compose an exhaustive list of all children in the village age 5
and under.20 The team designates an accessible location where weighing can occur. The NNC
specifies that this “may be held in a barangay hall, day care center, barangay health station,
health and nutrition post, home or any place easily accessible to the target population.”
Beginning in January, the OPT Plus Team is provided with instructions and materials from
the federal government for the weighing procedure. Weighing occurred between January and
March each year, with results reported to the federal government. The OPT program receives
significant attention in the local media and results are widely publicized and discussed. They
inform government resource allocation decisions.
    The details of the Operation Timbang process are important for two reasons. First, the
village-centric measurement process probably increases data reliability. Particularly because
we are interested in unstable places where the government has limited authority, we might
be concerned if federal agencies were directly responsible for weighing children. Since OPT
is implemented by local staff from the same village they are likely to know of and have access
to all children.21 Second, the systematic nature of the program (e.g., the standards for the
establishment of the OPT Plus Team, the provision of a consistent set of instructions and
materials, etc.) gives us some confidence in comparability over time and across locations.
    We use the official estimated malnutrition rate, based on weight-for-age z-scores. This
definition of malnutrition,22 and of the reference population used, follow the recommenda-
tions of the World Health Organization (WHO). The publicly available NNC data has two
limitations relative to the underlying data collected. First, it is aggregated over villages up to
the municipality level. This still provides quite detailed data for analysis, as the Philippines
has approximately 1,600 municipalities, but does not match the village-level precision of the
PDT data. Second, rather than report the distribution of weight for age, the data report only
the malnutrition rate (defined as the percent of children who are two standard deviations
below the age-specific mean of an internationally-recognized reference population).
    Table III displays descriptive statistics for our three key malnutrition variables: mal-
nutrition rates, severe malnutrition rates, and the OPT estimate of coverage – the percent
of children in the municipality who were weighed. The first panel presents all available
observations. It suggests significant heterogeneity in malnutrition: the 75th percentile has
two and a half times the malnutrition rate of the 25th percentile. The second panel weights
  20
      Recall that the average village is 3,000 people.
  21
      Similarly, the involvement of local midwives and day care workers increases the likelihood that weighed
children are actually aged 0-71 months, as the program designates.
   22
      This definition of malnutrition, weight-for-age z-scores (WAZ) dates to Gomez et al. (1956). Since then,
Seoane and Latham (1971) have proposed splitting (WAZ) scores into height-for-age and weight-for-height
z-scores (Cole et al., 2007). Height-for-age (HAZ) is considered a measure of long-term malnutrition (“stunt-
ing”) and weight-for-height (WHZ) is considered a short-term acute measure (“wasting”). Unfortunately
the OPT data include only malnutrition defined according to WAZ scores. In 2010, following the recom-
mendation of the World Health Organization, the Philippines switched from the International Reference
Standard (IRS) to the WHO Child Growth Standard (CGS), which defines malnutrition in the same way,
but uses a different reference population (Growth Reference Study Group, 2006). This was done to maintain
consistency with international standards.

municipalities by their population to obtain estimates more representative of the country.

                                         [Table III about here.]

    Of particular concern is the coverage measure, which is often quite low and sometimes
quite high. We might be concerned that the malnutrition estimates from these municipalities
are not reliable. Thus, for our main analyses, we exclude municipalities for which a) coverage
is less than 66% or greater than 110%, and b) population is greater than twice the mean.23
The third panel displays malnutrition characteristics for this sample, which trims about 13%
of observations.
    Finally, OPT contains no data from the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao
(ARMM), where Islamist rebel groups are most active. This is because the autonomous
regional government has overwhelming legal authority and is not required to cooperate with
federally sponsored data collection. As such, our malnutrition results are driven by PDT
implementations outside the ARMM, under-representing regions affected by Islamist rebels
and over-representing those affected by NPA. Recall that the NPA is responsible for nearly
two-thirds of violent incidents (in data which are representative).
    Importantly, malnutrition rates decline throughout the sample period, as illustrated in
Figure III, which reports the weighted mean and 90/10 range over time. To account for
this national trend our analyses below will include year fixed effects. Because this rate
of decline may well vary across municipalities, we will focus on results that also allow for
municipality-specific linear trends in malnutrition.

                                        [Figure III about here.]


3.4     Summary statistics
   Our main analyses will be conducted at the municipality-year level. Table IV presents
summary statistics, including separate figures for municipalities that received PDT and those
that did not.24

                                         [Table IV about here.]

   Municipalities receiving PDT tend to be relatively disadvantaged: They have higher
malnutrition rates (10.1% compared to 8.6%), are more likely to experience violent incidents
  23
      Coverage is the number of children weighed as a percentage of the estimated number of children age 0-71
months. Thus, it can exceed 100 for a number of reasons, including children being weighed multiple times
or, more likely, inaccurate population estimates. The NNC recommends caution with measurements outside
80 and 110. We felt 80 was too restrictive. We only exclude municipality-years with poor coverage when
they are large because we weight by population and were primarily concerned about inaccurate measurement
among particularly influential observations.
   24
      The determination of key variables is discussed in Section 4. The Table reports statistics for our main
estimation sample, and uses the population weights used in the final analysis.

                                                     8
(70% of municipality-years compared to 41%) and, when experiencing violence, tend to have
more intense violence (7 incidents per year per 1,000 residents compared to 4.4). These de-
scriptive statistics foreshadow the formal results regarding non-random PDT implementation
discussed in the next section.
    Table IV also reports several other facts relevant to estimation. First, municipality fixed
effects alone account for over 79% of variation in malnutrition, our dependent variable,
leaving less than 21% with which to estimate treatment effects conditional on municipality.
Second, conditional on a PDT implementation within a given municipality-year, only 12.5%
of the population live in a treated village. Thus, our estimated municipality-level treatment
effects are based on treatment experienced directly by, on average, only about a seventh of
the measured municipality population. Finally, we observe malnutrition for years after PDT
implementation (2.6 years after the most recent, on average) allowing us to estimate delayed
effects.


3.5    PDT implementation
   Three aspects of the program are important in understanding PDT implementation:
PDT implementations are geographically clustered; repeat implementations are common;
and nominal implementation is preceded by a period of government-initiated incidents.
    Geographic clustering of PDT makes operational sense. Villages are quite small, with
an average population of about 3,000, so a collection of five neighboring villages remains a
relatively small area and clustering implementations would simplify the logistics of organizing
military units locally. Moreover, PDT might simply push rebels to the next village, which
would then require attention, so treating clusters would be efficient.
   We investigate spatial clustering by estimating

        P DTit = αi + δt + β3 N eighborP DTi,t−1,t−3 + β6 N eighborP DTi,t−4,t−6 + εit .   (1)

Here P DTit is an indicator that PDT was implemented in village i during month t, δt is a
month effect, N eighborP DTi,t−1,t−3 is the fraction of the four villages nearest to i in which
PDT was implemented between 1 and 3 months ago, and N eighborP DTi,t−4,t−6 is the fraction
of these villages receiving PDT between 4 and 6 months ago. As shown in Table V below,
these neighboring implementations are highly predictive. The first columns shows that the
effect of having all four nearest neighbors receive PDT in the last three months increases the
probability of PDT receipt by over 3 percentage points, from a base of only .12%. Columns
(2)-(4) show that village fixed effects reduce this effect to about 2 percentage points, but it
remains highly statistically significant (p < .01).
    Given this evidence of geographical clustering, and the possibility that it is due to relo-
cation of rebels across space, we will control for spillovers between neighbors in estimating
selection into PDT treatment.

                                    [Table V about here.]


                                               9
    The second fact underlying our selection specification is that repeat implementations of
PDT are common, suggesting that the expansion of governance is not a monotonic, univer-
sally successful process. Table VI reports on the distribution of implementations across the
5,188 villages that received PDT at least once between 2002 and 2010. About one quarter
of villages received multiple implementations. A possible predictor of PDT treatment will
therefore be time since last implementation in the same village.

                                             [Table VI about here.]

    To better understand repeat implementations, Figure IV plots the probability that a
repeat PDT is observed against the year of first PDT implementation (in our sample period).
The probability of a repeat PDT implementation declines in program year, from between
40 and 50% in the first three program years to zero in the last. One interpretation of these
data is that the program improved over time in reducing recidivism. Another is that the
most difficult villages were selected first. A third interpretation is simply that the data are
right-truncated, so that many of the single-PDT villages may not have experienced persistent
success either, they simply received PDT too late to experience a repeat by the end of 2010
when our sampling period ends. That last interpretation would suggest that about half of
villages will eventually experience multiple treatments.

                                            [Figure IV about here.]

    Taken together, the evidence of repeated PDT interventions suggests that, like job-
training, counselling, or many other programs evaluated by social scientists, PDT does not
always work. We estimate the effects of the average PDT implementation, rather than
restricting to a municipality’s first implementation.
    We turn now to violence. PDT implementation in principle follows a “clear, hold,
build” logic: offensive force first is used to reduce rebel presence, then a defensive posture
is adopted to retain control, followed by implementation of governance and development
improvements. That sequencing is consistent with complementarity between security and
development (Berman et al., 2013).
   To assess whether PDT follows that sequencing we use an event study specification
which regresses government-initiated violent incidents on indicators for the months preceding
and following PDT implementation, estimating the following specification using monthly
(indexed t) village (indexed v) data,
                                                               18

                                V iolencevt = αv + δt +                βτ P DTvt + εvt     (2)
                                                              τ =−18

.
   Figure V plots the estimated event study βτ coefficients for the 37 months around PDT
implementation (month 0 in the figure being the month of implementation).25 For reference,

         For regression results, see Table BI of the appendix.

mean violence for the omitted category (months more than a year and a half before or after
PDT) is .0024 incidents per month per 1,000 population.

                                        [Figure V about here.]

    Figure V shows that government-initiated violence increases about fivefold nine months
before a nominal PDT implementation date, increases again the month before implementa-
tion, remains high for about four months, and then drops to the pre-implementation plateau
and declines gradually back to the year-before mean over the next half-year. For our pur-
poses the key is that the “clear” stage can be dated to nine months before the nominal
implementation date, a fact reflected clearly in the precisely estimated spike reported in
Table BI. 26


4        Selection into PDT
   We seek to estimate the effect of PDT implementation on malnutrition, but are sensitive
to the possibility of selection bias – namely that villages may be selected for PDT treat-
ment on criteria that themselves predict malnutrition so that estimated treatment effects
are confounded with selection. In this section we investigate the selection mechanism in
order to help design estimates which avoid that bias. In the next section we will take two
approaches to selection bias: using an event-study specification that examines estimated
pre-implementation trends directly, and including predictors of selection as regressors.
     Formally, we aspire to estimate the coefficents of an equation like this one,

                    ln(M alnutritionRate)it = αi + β1 F ractionP DTit−1 + εit                          (3)

where i indexes municipalities and t years, the malnutrition rate (weight for age) is measured
as explained above, and the fraction of the municipality’s population in PDT-treated villages
is measured by F ractionP DT . A municipality-specific fixed effect accounts for fixed factors
that might predispose municipalities to have high malnutrition absent PDT.
    We estimate a PDT selection equation with four features. First, to account for the
“clear” stage, we date PDT implementations as beginning nine months before their nominal
start date. Second, because PDT is implemented in geographic clusters, we control for PDT
implementations in the nearest four villages over the previous three and six months (column
1). Third, to allow for previous violence to predict implementation, we include three and six
month lags of incident rates in the village (column 2) and in the village’s municipality (column
3). Finally, to account for complicated patterns of repeat implementations, we include an
indicator for whether the village has previously received PDT and a linear (column 4) and

    26
      One might be concerned that violence actually causes reactive PDT at a nine month lag, rather than
the opposite. To check, we created the same figure using rebel-initiated violence (rather than government-
initiated), and found no similar lead pattern, leaving us to conclude that causality more likely flows from
planned PDT to pre-PDT, government-initiated violence.

    Table VII reports these results, estimated at the village-month level.28 The three major
findings of the previous section again express themselves in predicting PDT implementation.
PDT in neighboring villages during the previous three and six months predict new PDT
starts, as we saw in Table V. Lagged incidents predict PDT, over the previous three and
six months. Finally, recent PDT in the same village predicts an increased probability of
repeat treatment, though that effect fades over time. While all of these findings hold after
including village fixed effects (column 7), all coefficients drop substantially. This suggests
that a large part of the non-random selection is accounted for by time-invariant unobserved
heterogeneity.

                                       [Table VII about here.]

    To summarize, the AFP seems to select villages for treatment by violence, proximity
to treated neighbors and recent treatment. That selection has the potential to bias our
estimates of PDT on malnutrition (equation (3)), which we now turn to.
    Unfortunately, our outcome measure (child malnutrition) is available for municipalities
rather than villages and only annually. Appendix B reports the model presented in Equation
(4) aggregated to the municipality-year level to match the units of observation we will use
to estimate treatment effects. The key results in Table VII hold at these higher levels of
aggregation (see Table BII).
   With a set of predictors of PDT implementation in hand, we can check for robustness
to selection bias in estimating the treatment effects of PDT on malnutrition. Short of
an instrument for selection, or the ethically disturbing idea that coercive force would be
randomly assigned across municipalities, this is the best we can hope for.


5        Estimated Treatment Effects

5.1       Estimating equation
    We can now estimate the effect of PDT on malnutrition while checking for possible
selection effects. We use two methods to deal with selection bias: first, we include a set of
    27
       To avoid imputing PDT end dates, we use a time trend in months since the last PDT began. Since we
include an indicator of whether the village had previously received PDT, the value of that time trend for
villages never receiving PDT does not apply to those villages.
    28
       Table BII in the appendix shows the same specification estimated at the municipality-year level.

                                                   12
lead coefficients in an “event study” specification (Jacobson, LaLonde, and Sullivan, 1993;
Hoynes, Page, and Stevens, 2011; Sandler and Sandler, 2013), that also allows municipality
specific trends, and province-year effects as controls; second, we include predictors of PDT
suggested by the analysis of selection in the previous section.
    Our base estimating equation is
                                                             k

                                                            τ =−k


where m indexes municipalities, p indexes provinces, and t years. ln(M alnRate) is the
natural logarithm of the malnutrition rate, P DTmt−τ is the fraction of municipality m’s
population living in a village receiving PDT in year t − τ . As in the previous section, we
date PDT at nine months before the nominal start date to account for the “clear” evident
in Figure V of Section 3.5 above. We use log malnutrition because we expect a proportional
response to treatment.29
   The βτ coefficients for τ < 0 are the coefficients on PDT leads, which we include in order
to check for pre-existing trends in malnutrition before treatment. The coefficients βτ for
τ > 0 estimate lagged impulse-response as the result of PDT treatment. This may occur
because governance is persistent, or because the economic effects of governance take some
time to set in. In particular, we might expect investment in physical and human capital
to accumulate over years as a result of improvements in property rights, safety, and access
to markets. The health effects of improved health and nutrition would also take time to
accumulate in weight for age.
    Our specification drops the 1-year lead of PDT to form a reference point (the regression
constant) in checking for pre-existing trends. Given the reference point and the timing of
measurement (January through March of every year), treatment effects should primarily be
reflected in the lag coefficients βτ for τ >0.
    Rebels may respond to PDT treatment by displacing their activity to untreated areas.
To the extent that this happens within the same municipality it will be captured in the
estimated treatment effect, since our unit of observation is a municipality. Should rebels
relocate their activity to neighboring municipalities, we can estimate the effect of possible
spillovers by including as a regressor the average level of PDT in the four nearest neighbor
municipalities (measured by geometric distance from midpoint).



   29
     The malnutrition rate is the percent of children whose weight falls below an age-specific threshold
recommended by the World Health Organization (on the basis of a standard reference population). In a
model where PDT has a linear effect on children’s weights near the threshold, the effect will be larger
where the mass near the threshold is larger. Unfortunately we do not observe the mass near the threshold.
However, because children’s weights tend to have bell-curve type distribution (The WHO assumes Box-Cox
Power Exponential) and because the threshold is likely to the left of this distribution’s peak (since the average
malnutrition rate is only about 10%), we expect the mass to be larger when the malnutrition is higher. The
log transformation generates larger effects when the malnutrition rate is higher. The malnutrition rate is
never zero (Table III), so no observations are lost by taking logarithms.

    where N eighborP DTmt−τ is the population-weighted average of PDT in the four nearest
municipalities so that the lag coefficients θτ estimate spillovers from neighboring munici-
palities. Following the discussion above, those spillovers cannot be signed in theory. They
might increase malnutrition due to transition effects and degradation in governance between
government and rebel control, or they might improve nutrition if rebel governance is actually
an improvement.


5.2    Treatment effects
     Our main results are illustrated in Figure VI which plots the estimated coefficients of
equation (6). Visually, there is little evidence of a pre-existing trend in PDT before treat-
ment, in years t=-5 through t=-2. The year t-1 coefficient is normalized to zero. From the
year that treatment begin (t=0), we see a persistent reduction in malnutrition, which levels
off five or six years after treatment. Standard error bands indicate that none of the estimated
coefficients are statistically different from zero (at the 5% level).

                                     [Figure VI about here.]

    Table VIII reports estimated coefficients. In order to gain precision coefficients are re-
stricted to be equal for lag combinations (3,4), (5,6) and 7 or more, as reported in column
1. (The full set of lags and leads illustrated in the figure is reported in Appendix table
BIV.) Specifications reported in this table all include a full set of municipality fixed effects,
municipality specific trends, and province x year fixed effects. (Appendix table BIV reports
that results are sensitive to excluding municipal trends, and that province x year fixed effects
improve precision.)

                                     [Table VIII about here.]

    In this specification (and those that follow) the coefficients on PDT leads are generally
small. We test for selection or some other source of pre-existing trends with an F-test of the
joint significance of the four lead coefficients (which fortunately share the same sign). The
F-test has a p value of 0.56, which indicates no evidence of a pre-existing trend.
   Treatment effects of PDT on malnutrition are reflected in the contemporaneous and
lagged coefficients: a reduction of 6.6 log points in the treatment year, 18.1 log points the

                                                  14
year after, 25.9 log points after two years... through a 33.6 log point reduction after seven
years. These are large reductions. Nevertheless, the F-statistic on the joint significance of
the six contemporaneous and lagged coefficients has a p-value of 0.06, not quite significant
at the 5% level.
    More precision can be gained for testing by further restricting the set of lagged coeffi-
cients, but before we pursue that, the true size of our F-tests requires some attention. Our
standard errors are clustered at the province level (for the 78 Philippine provinces). Recent
results by MacKinnon and Webb (2014) indicate that when clustered entities are unbal-
anced (i.e., come in very different sizes), or when the proportion of clusters treated is small,
sampling distributions of the cluster robust variance estimator diverge from asymptotic ap-
proximations, even for fairly large sample sizes, resulting in test size distortions and frequent
overrejection of the null hypothesis.
    As a check, Column 2 reports the same set of coefficient estimates with standard errors
estimated by the wild cluster bootstrap method of Cameron et al. (2008), which are con-
sistent. Note that these boostrapped standard errors are about ten percent larger than the
analytic in Column 1, indicating a possible size distortion in testing. More importantly, a
wild cluster bootstrap of the F-test indicates that our F-statistic rejects a true null hypoth-
esis fully 14 percent, more than twice the 6 percent estimated of the asymptotic p (labeled
“analytic” in the Table).30
    To illustrate this point, Figure VII compares the empirical distribution of the boot-
strapped F-statistic, the histogram, to the analytical F distribution, which is drawn as a
curve. The histogram clearly has a lot of density to the right of the curve. The vertical red
line indicates the realized F-statistic of 2.228, with six percent of the curve to the right of it,
but 14 percent of the histogram. This discrepancy suggests skepticism about the analytical
p-value, and about our asymptotic approximations in general, when clustering by province.

                                     [Figure VII about here.]

    Faced with a lack of precision, despite our wealth of observations, we must make some
assumptions. One approach would be to impose uncorrelated errors across municipalities (as
well as across provinces). This assumption would be violated if rebels responded to PDT by
relocating their activity to neighboring municipalities in a way that affected child nutrition.
Column 3 reports estimates of the same specification with standard errors clustered by 1513
municipalities. Standard errors of estimated treatment effects (lags) are generally larger un-
der this assumption, leading to an F-statisic of 1.035 with a p-value of 0.346 (bootstrapped),
even further from rejection. Larger standard errors under an assumption of uncorrelated
residuals indicate that εmt may be negatively correlated across municipaliites in equation
(5), which would be consistent with spillover effects of PDT across municipalities through
rebel relocation. Henceforth, we stick with clustering standard errors at the province level.
   Before turning to a test for spillovers across municipalities, we try an alternative route
to precision by restricting lead and lag coefficients. This should yield precision gains since
  30
     We thank our discussant Matthew Webb for alerting us to this possible problem, and for generously
assisting with Stata code for testing.

                                                 15
PDT is highly serially correlated within municipality, so that estimated coefficients have high
(negative) sample covariance. The event study plot in Figure VI indicates many options
for constraining coefficients, since lead coefficients look statistically identical and lagged
coefficients change very little from three years after treatment onwards. Column 4 reports
the effect of restricting the coefficients on leads two through four to be equal, while also
restricting coefficients on lags three onward to equality. Estimated treatment effects are
similar through lag three, with a long run estimated reduction in malnutrition of 27.8 log
points. In this specification the F-test on leads indicates joint insignificance (p=0.47), while
the F-test on lagged and contemporaneous coefficients rejects at p=0.026 (wild clustered
bootstrap) and 0.017 (analytical).
    Further precision can be obtained by restricting the contemporaneous and lagged coeffi-
cients to a spline function that restricts coefficients in years zero, lag one and lag two to be
linearly related with a constant slope (τ +1)*β. That specification is reported in Column 5,
yielding a slope of 0.084 for treatment year, the next year and the following year (reductions
in malnutrition of .084, .168 and .252 log points) and a long run effect of -0.286 after year
three. With that restriction, the joint F test rejects a null of no treatment effect at p=0.01
(wild clustered bootstrap).
    Figure VIII illustrates the splined specification of Column 5 with a solid line in a shaded
confidence region. Compared to the unconstrained results, the estimated treatment effects
are indeed smaller (i.e., less malnutrition reduction). Nevertheless, from one year after
treatment onwards the treatment effect is precisely enough estimated to be statistically
different from zero, with a long run, precisely estimated, reduction in malnutrition of 28.6
log points, or 25 percent.31

                                       [Figure VIII about here.]


5.3     Spillovers
    We return now to the possibility of spillover effects of PDT on malnutrition in neighboring
municipalities. Geographical relocation of rebels is common in asymmetric civil wars, and is
anecdotally present in the Philippine context in particular. Having established that PDT has
a treatment effect, it would not be surprising to find that relocation of rebels has an opposite
effect, through reduced security of people and property or reduced access to markets. That
type of spillover was also suggested by the discovery of negatively correlated residuals across
municipalities in Table VIII.
    Table IX reports the results of estimating equation (6), which augments estimated treat-
ment effects with spillover coefficients reflecting the effects of PDT in neighboring munici-
palities. Column 1 reports again the estimated treatment effects from Table VIII Column 5,
using the spline specification to maximize precision.
  31
     The estimated five year lead coefficient has very low precision for lack of data. Table BIII (below)
displays the distribution of the number of years since the most recent PDT, across municipality-years in the
estimation sample. About 75% of observations are within four years of a PDT implementation and 90% are
within six years.

                                                    16
                                         [Table IX about here.]

    Column 2 adds analogous coefficients for neighbor PDT, again imposing the spline re-
striction on lagged coefficients, as in Column 1, but this time on both own and Neighbor
PDT. The coefficients on PDT in neighboring municipalities (averaged over the four nearest
neighbors) are positive, indicating that PDT in neighboring municipalities increases malnu-
trition. They are about the same size as the own-PDT coefficients. The long run (3+ years)
coefficient on neighboring PDT is statistically different from zero, indicating a 34.4 log point
increase in malnutrition, as opposed to the long term own PDT coefficient estimate indicat-
ing a 35.5 long point reduction. The neighboring PDT coefficients are jointly just barely
statistically significant at the ten percent level (with an analytical p-value of 0.106 reported
for an F test at the bottom of the table, and a boostrapped p-value of 0.099) but provide
highly suggestive evidence that PDT in neighboring municipalities worsens malnutrition,
especially in the long term.
    Those effects are illustrated by Figure IX, which plots spline coefficents and confidence
intervals for both own PDT and neighbors’ PDT. The effects are approximately symmetric
and of opposite sign, both over the first three years, and thereafter.

                                         [Figure IX about here.]

    One concern with this evidence of spillover is that it may be a statistical “reflection” due
to the correlation of neighbor PDT with own PDT, causing a bias to be transmitted from the
latter coefficients to the former. In column 3 we explore that possibility by estimating the
spillover coefficients (the effects of PDT in neighboring municipalities) for 6001 municipalities
that do not receive PDT during the sample period. 32 We find strong evidence of spillover
even into municipalities that do not receive any PDT: the F-test for joint significance of the
two spline coefficients has a p-value of 0.01. We infer that PDT in neighboring municipalities
truly does increase malnutrition through spillover.
    To complete the split-sample analysis, Column 4 reports estimates of the full spillover
specification for the complementary sample of municipalities that ever experience PDT. Own-
PDT and neighboring PDT coefficients are very close to those reported for the full sample
(Column 2) and statistically indistinguishable. Compared to estimates for muncipalities that
never experience PDT, the spillover effects are much smaller in municipalities that experience
at least some PDT. One possible explanation is that a small amount of PDT is protective
against spillovers. Another is that treatment effects differ with the level of PDT, so that a
log-linear specification provides a poor approximation. Municipalities that never experience
PDT average much lower rates of PDT among neighbors (4.1% vs. 7.7%) as well as lower
malnutrition rates (8.6% vs. 10.1%), as reported in Table IV.
    Returning to the estimated effects in Column 2, the estimated spillover effects invite
interpretation. PDT induces negative spillovers among neighbors, in addition to positive
improvements in child nutrition. Including those coefficients in the longer regression corrects

  32
       We thank David Green and Francesco Trebbi of the University of British Columbia for this suggestion.

                                                     17
a small omitted variable bias (since own PDT is apparently correlated with neighbors’ PDT),
resulting in slightly larger own-treatment effects. The effect for 3+ years is stronger, a
35.5 log point reduction. That effect might also have been slightly overstated in the short
regression due to contamination of comparisons from treatment, but that contamination
would have been diluted among the 1,512 comparison municipalities.
    We have no direct evidence on the mechanism by which spillover takes place, yet anec-
dotal evidence suggests that PDT displaces rebels from treated muncipalities to neighboring
municipalities, reversing the mechanism by which PDT reduces malnutrition. The only other
plausible alternative we can think of by which PDT would lower malnutrition for children
in treated municipalities while increasing it for children in neighboring municipalities is that
PDT redirects other government resources from the neighbors to the treated. We rule that
out with direct evidence on spending below, leaving us to conclude that rebels react to PDT
not by being deterred into inaction but by relocating to neighboring municipalities, which in
turn worsens malnutrition. To our knowledge this is the first empirical evidence of strategic
reaction by rebels to a large scale development program of this type.


5.4     Robustness checks
    The results in Table VIII include municipality and province-year fixed effects and
municipality-specific linear trends. The lead coefficients show no evidence of pre-existing
trends before treatment. However, we can additionally test for selection bias by checking if
estimated treatment effects are robust to including predictors of PDT, which we investigated
in Section 4. There we found that treatment of neighbors was a predictor of PDT, which we
have covered in our discussion of spillover. We also saw that lagged violence predicted PDT,
which we turn to here. In addition, we will check for robustness of results to using only the
first instance of PDT (in a village) and to the calculated timing of treatment.
    Table X shows that the estimated treatment effects are virtually unaffected by adding
violence as a predictor of PDT. Column 1 replicates our preferred specification, column 2
of Table IX. Adding violent incidents comes at a cost: because we don’t observe violent
incidents beyond 2010, controlling for lagged incidents requires dropping 2012 from the
estimation sample. Column 2 replicates column 1 on the sample from 2005-2011. These
results are very similar to those in column 1 except that the estimated treatments effects are
less precisely estimated.33
   Column 3 adds violence as a predictor, estimating

  33
     The loss of precision occurs because we’ve lost nearly 15% of the sample by dropping 2012, including
the part most likely to be informative about post-PDT effects.

                                                     18
    where V iolencemt−1 is the lagged rate of violent incidents in the municipality and
N eighborP DTmt−1 is, again, the population-weighted average of PDT in the four nearest
municipalities. Comparing columns 2 and 3, including a measure of violence has almost no
effect on the estimated treatment effect of PDT, except for a small lead effect suggesting
selection on high malnutrition when lead violence is included as a regressor. So there is
no evidence of omitted variable bias due to omission of violence which predicts PDT. We
conclude that the event study specification (including municipality and province-year effects
and municipality-specific trends) is fairly robust to any selection on malnutrition that we
can predict, though the specification in column 3 suggests that the trend reduction might
be slightly overstated.

                                       [Table X about here.]

    As an alternative robustness check we exclude repeat PDT interventions from the anal-
ysis, using only first instances. As discussed above, treated villages sometimes suffer a type
of recidivism and are selected for repeat treatment. Our preferred approach has been to
estimate the effect all PDT treatments in a village in order to report an average treatment
effect, which includes the possibility that repeat PDT indicates villages predisposed to mal-
nutrition or that a second PDT is less (or more) intense than the first. Column 4 replicates
the specification from column 1, but uses only first PDT implementations received by a
village (and aggregated to the municipality level). Estimated coefficients are similar, though
they show some sign of pre-treatment selection. Given that the selection criteria of villages
for repeat implementation might differ from that of initial implementations, the fact that
estimated effects are similar for both again demonstates robustness, supporting a causal in-
terpretation. The estimated effects for first PDT are a little smaller in absolute value, but
statistically the same as those for any PDT. They are less precisely estimated.
    As an additional robustness test, we check whether results are robust to the estimated
start date of PDT, which we coded as nine months before the nominal start date, as indi-
cated by the evidence of “clear” activity in Figure V. The lead coefficients indeed show evi-
dence that malnutrition rates were higher beyond 1-year before PDT (the omitted category),
though the t tests are statistically unimpressed (as is the joint F, which is not reported).
Importantly, the lead coefficients should now be interpreted as malnutrition relative to the
year before the “official” PDT start date, and, as Figure V shows, government forces were
active in the village for most of that year. Thus, we feel that the positive lead coefficients
in column 5 are evidence of short-term treatment effects, rather than selection bias.
    In summary, PDT provides a statistically significant medium term malnutrition reduction
that accumulates to about 30 percent after three years (35 log points) and is constant until
at least seven years out.34

  34
     A disturbing possible source of bias is that PDT increased child mortality among the malnourished,
reducing the proportion of malnourished children. We checked by estimating whether PDT reduced the
number of children age 5 and under (reported in the OPT data) and found no evidence of such an effect.
We also checked whether PDT increased OPT coverage (the share of children weighed), which was already
quite high, and again found no effects.

                                                  19
5.5    Scaling
    The scaling of our estimated treatment effects requires some explanation. To this point,
we have described PDT’s effects on child malnutrition by directly interpreting the coefficient
on the lagged PDT variables. This is the estimated reduction that would occur if the share
of the population receiving PDT went from 0 to 1, which is realistic for a village. However
our unit of observation for regression analysis is a municipality. The average municipality
has 26 villages and (as Table IV shows) the average implementation only treats 12.5% of
the municipality’s population. Our preferred specification (column 2 of Table IX) implies
that PDT reduces the malnutrition rate by about 30% in the long run. So our estimated
treatment effect is based on linear extrapolation from a program that on average treats only
about one eighth of the municipality’s population to inference about what would happen if
the full population were treated.
    If the effects of PDT accrued only to the population in the treated villages (the 12.5% of
the municipality’s population, on average), then linear extrapolation of our estimates would
imply that a village which receives PDT sees malnutrition fall by 30%. Beyond extrapolation
of a possibly nonlinear effect, there is also the potential for externalities, since PDT may
well affect non-recipient villages within municipalities, just as we have seen that it affects
neighboring municipalities. Other villages may benefit from a nearby PDT implementation
if PDT improves security, infrastructure, or services in the area –access to markets and
regional clinics, for instance, could benefit children in neighboring villages. In that case,
some of the malnutrition reduction we estimate is realized by non-recipient villages in the
municipality and recipient villages must experience a less than 30% decline in malnutrition.
On the other hand, PDT might relocate rebel activity from treatment villages to neighboring
villages within the muncipality, to the detriment of child nutrition, (as we have seen across
municipalities in Table IX). In this case, the malnutrition reduction we estimate includes
improvements for recipient villages, offset by worsening malnutrition in neighboring villages,
and recipient villages actually experience more than a 30% decline in malnutrition. With
those caveats, our estimated treatment effects should be interpreted as a linear approximation
to the effect of a small change in treated population in a municipality, including possible
within-municipality spillovers, possibly positive or negative.


5.6    Net program effect
   Given the evidence of spillovers, what’s the aggregate effect of the PDT program? One
way to answer that question is to test whether the malnutrition increase due to neighbors’
PDT (the θs in equation (6)) negate the decrease due to own PDT (the βs). Specifically,
equation (6) with a spline imposed has two coefficients on lagged own PDT, a linear and a
long term level –call them βlin and βlt , and two coefficients on lagged neighbors’ PDT, –θlin
and θlt . We test whether βlin = - θlin , and whether βlt = - θlt . Those test statistics are
reported in the bottom four rows of Table IX. In neither case are they rejected, indicating
that the own effects of PDT are statistically negated by those of neighbors’ PDT. That
would imply a net treatment effect of about zero if population and malnutrition rates were
balanced across treated municipalities and neighbors experiencing spillover.

                                             20
   Estimating the aggregate effect is a little more complicated because population and mal-
nutrition rates differ across municipalities (they tend to be higher in treated municipalities
than in their neighbors). Predicting the effects of the specification in column (2) of Table
IX by converting log changes to levels and aggregating yields a small aggregate increase in
malnutrition due to PDT of one hundredth of one percent.
    An alternative, more flexible, approach would be to predict an aggregate effect using the
split sample estimates reported in Columns 3 and 4 of Table IX, which allow the spillover
effects to differ between ever-treated and never-treated municipalities. The never-treated
have higher spillover effects but lower baseline malnutrition rates (as we saw in Table III).
That approach yields an estimated aggregate program effect of a one tenth of one percent
improvement (i.e., reduction) in child malnutrition. Our conclusion is that across specifica-
tions, spillovers either largely or completely negate the reductions in malnutrition due to the
PDT program.


6        Interpretation
   While PDT reduces malnutrition quite substantially, we know very little about how.
One possibility is that security and removal of extortionary rebels allow markets to function,
enabling private expenditure on food and medical care for children. Alternatively, given the
evidence of “clear” activity and the program rhetoric about enabling government services,
one might suspect that PDT is only the visible tip of a vast iceberg of associated security
and governance programs, including medical care.
    To check the hypothesis that improved government services are an omitted variable cor-
related with PDT we estimate the effects of PDT on municipal government spending on
health and nutrition as well as total spending (again coding start dates with a nine month
lead, to reflect “clear” activity). Figure X reports coefficients from an event study regression
of the logarithm of health and nutrition spending (Panel (a)) and total spending (Panel (b))
at the municipality level on leads and lags of PDT. There is no evidence that PDT had any
effect on either type of spending, or that PDT was preceded by trends in these spending
variables.

                                        [Figure X about here.]

    A related interpretation would by that a PDT implementation coincides with a broader
increase in federal interest in a municipality. In this case, we would expect to see PDT
accompanied by an increase in federal-municipal transfers, an important revenue source for
municipal governments.35 Figure XI shows that, to the contrary, PDT typically occurs in
the middle of a sustained decrease in federal-municipal transfers.

    35
     While transfer amounts are legally determined by a fixed formula, federal authorities have some discre-
tion. See Troland (2014) for a detailed discussion of Federal-Municipal transfers and their effects on local
public finances.

                                                    21
                                         [Figure XI about here.]

    In summary, the evidence weighs against infering that PDT improves nutrition through
effects on government spending. That leaves two possibilities: either enhanced security
improved the quality of government service provision at constant spending rates, in ways
that favored children’s nutrition; or enhanced government control enabled the functioning of
markets in a way that advantaged nutrition of children.


7        Conclusions
   A major challenge confronting development economics is how to effectively assist people
who unfortunately live in violent, unstable places. Many programs require a minimally
functional government, without which implementing agents face unacceptable risks or entire
populations are left out of reach. Even when interventions can reach these target populations,
implementation is often compromised by leakage, and the implied insertion of capturable
rents into an insecure environment may actually increase violence.
    An alternative, or precursor, to effective development assistance may be expansion of
governance, hopefully enabling provision of basic services, development assistance, and the
functioning of markets. Coercive expansion of governance runs the risk of violence and
human rights abuses, so the net effect on welfare of residents is unclear. We take a first step
towards measuring those net welfare effects, in the context of the Philippines, a middle income
economy with a military subject to weak democratic oversight, experiencing a festering, low
intensity insurgency.
   The Philippines’ Peace and Development Teams, operated by the Armed Forces of the
Philippines, directly reached 12% of the population over nine years. We estimate that the
average implementation reduced child malnutrition by about 30% in treated villages after
three years, and persisted afterwards until at least year seven. As to mechanism, PDT is not
associated with expansions in government expenditure on welfare or health, so we conclude
that improvements in security, access to markets or access to existing government services
must have enabled improved infant health.
   How important is this finding? To put these effect sizes in context, Table XI summarizes
several evaluations of child malnutrition treatments which use weight-for-age z-scores (WAZ)
as an outcome.36 For each study, we summarize the intervention, the measurement of the
dependent variable, the estimated effect in its original form, and the implied reduction in
the malnutrition rate.
    36
      Many studies separate WAZ into weight-for-height and height-for-age (Duflo, 2003; Graff-Zivin, Thiru-
murthy, and Goldstein, 2006; Lavy et al., 1996), something we cannot do with Operation Timbang data. Also
not included in the table are a large number of interventions for which no effects have been found. See Masset
et al. (2011) for a review of mostly unsuccessful agricultural interventions, Morris et al. (2004) for a study
estimating that a Brazilian conditional cash transfer program increased malnutrition, Lind et al. (2008) for
an RCT showing that iron supplements can increase malnutrition for non-deficient infants, and Singh, Park,
and Dercon (2013) for a study estimating that India’s school lunch program did not reduce malnutrition
among participants (although it did protect against the deleterious effects of unexpected drought).

   As the Table makes clear, PDT induced improvements in child nutrition comparable to
the leading examples in the literature. Each intervention estimates a 35-45% reduction in
the malnutrition rate, which is a little more than the estimated long term effects from our
preferred specification (about 30%).
    Moreover, the interventions described in Table XI would likely be infeasible in PDT vil-
lages, given their lack of governance. In the absence of a persistent security presence, it
is difficult to imagine programs distributing medicine or cash to those vulnerable popula-
tions operating safely or successfully. A precursor program such as PDT can enable those
interventions, and has substantial welfare benefits for local residents, even if the rebels it
displaces are relatively benign Marxists conducting a fairly low casualty insurgency.
   Our conclusions come with three important caveats. First, even compared to other
multifaceted interventions, there are deficits in our knowledge of the actual content of the
PDT intervention, and in our understanding of the mechanism by which health improvements
occurred. Research on those topics, which is likely to be qualitative, would be welcome.
Second, the health effects of PDT come from an intervention that connects peripheral villages
to a middle income economy governed by a fairly stable multiparty democracy, making it
more like Turkey or Indonesia than like a less functional setting such as the undergoverned
spaces of the Middle East or Africa.
   Third, and most importantly for policy, the aggregate effects of the intervention on child
wellbeing were approximately zero, since the negative spillover effects of PDT on neighboring
municipalities negated the positive treatment effects. Those negative spillovers suggest that
not only is government good for child development, rebels are bad for it –even in a relatively
low-intensity conflict like that in the Philippines. Nevertheless, though the intervention
benefited children locally, it was not conducted at sufficient scale to accomplish more than
displacing malnutrition associated with rebel activity, unfortunately evoking a “whack-a-
mole” analogy.
   We do not believe that military-centric counterinsurgency programs are a panacea for
human development in poorly governed spaces. We do think that these findings invite an
evidence-based discussion of the role of expansions of governance, as an extensive margin of
development.

A      Additional data details
    Three important variables not discussed in the main text are: municipality populations,
village populations, and geography (used to identify the four nearest neighbors).
   We seek annual estimates of population variables. We obtain these from three data
sources:

   1. Annual province-level population estimates from the National Statistical Coordination
      Board (NCSB) from 2000-2011

   2. Municipality-level population estimates from 2000, 2003, 2007, and 2010

         • Estimates from 2000, 2007, and 2010 are from the Philippine Census
         • Estimates from 2003 are from the NCSB small area poverty estimates

   3. Village-level population estimates from the 2007 Census

    With these data sources, we estimate annual populations in three steps. First, we linearly
interpolate and extrapolate municipality populations for missing years. Second, we propor-
tionally adjust these municipality populations so that they sum to the annual province-level
estimates. Finally, we divide a municipality’s population among its villages using the 2007
population distribution.
    As a basis for the geography variables, we rely on a dataset from the NCSB with the
longitude and latitude of each villages’ centroid. A similar dataset was available for munic-
ipality longitude and latitdue, but inspection revealed it was fraught with inconsistencies.
The village-level longitudes and latitudes were much more reliable.
    Thus, we estimated each municipality’s longitude and latitude using the village data. To
do so, for each municipality, we took the midpoint of the longitude and the latitude from
the various villages within the municipality. This identifies a point which is in the center
of the smallest rectangle that could be drawn to include each village’s centroid. However,
there is no guarantee that this point is actually within the municipality.37 Thus, we define
the longitude and latitude of the municipality to be the village centroid with the smallest
Euclidean distance from this rectangle’s center. This does not guarantee that the municipal-
ity’s “location” is its centroid, but provides a reasonable approximation which guarantees
that the location will actually be within the municipality.
   Finally, we calculate a distance matrix containing the Euclidean distance between each
municipality. The four nearest neighbors were selected to be the four municipalities for which
the Euclidean distance was the smallest.




  37
     Consider, for instance, a u-shaped municipality. This point would lie outside of its borders, despite
being the center of the smallest inclusive rectangle.

B      Additional results
    Table BI reports the coefficient estimates illustrated in Figure V.

                                          [Table BI about here.]

    In Section 3.5, we presented evidence for three important considerations regarding selec-
tion in the PDT implementation decision. These were formalized in Equation (4) in a model
estimated in Table VII at the village-month level. Unfortunately, our key outcome measure
(child malnutrition) is not observed at the village-month level, but is only available at the
municipality-year level, and so we must aggregate this selection model. The main findings
of 3.5 turn out to be robust to both those aggregations – over periods and over space.
    Table BII presents the same selection model at this higher level of aggregation. Instead of
a binary indicator of a PDT implementation beginning in month t, the dependent variable is
the fraction of the municipality’s population living in a village with a PDT implementation
beginning in year t.38 As in Table VII, Table BII codes PDT as starting nine months before
the nominal start date to account for the “clear” period. The municipality-level results
(Table BII) are broadly consistent with the village-level results (Table VII).

                                         [Table BII about here.]

   To fully represent the data and help the reader understand precision issues in estimating
long-term effects, Table BIII shows the distribution of years since most recent PDT for the
municipality-year observations included in the main estimation sample.

                                        [Table BIII about here.]

                                         [Table BIV about here.]




  38
     Most independent variables are analogous to their village-level counterparts. The fraction of four nearest
neighbors is now the fraction of population in the four nearest municipalities living in a village where PDT
began during the previous three and six months. We now include an indicator of whether any village has
previously received PDT and the time trend counts the number of months since any village in the municipality
received PDT.

 The table displays the top 15 recipients, among countries with populations of 10 million
 or more, of total official development assistance (ODA) from the World Bank, the United
 States, and the United Kingdom. World Bank ODA refers to the International Bank for
 Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association
 (IDA) only. USA and UK ODA refer to all sources of bilateral flows. The “Total” column
 refers to the total of these three sources. GDP per capita is adjusted for Purchasing Power
 Parity. ODA and GDP per capita are in 2011 US dollars and are obtained from the World
 Bank’s World Development Indicators. “Pol. Instability” refers to the World Bank’s Political
 Instability measure in the World Governance Indicators (WGI), which ranks 214 countries
 according to “perceptions of the likelihood of political instability and/or politically-motivated
 violence, including terrorism.” Conflict refers to the definition from the Peace Research
 Institute Oslo (PRIO), which defines a conflict as involving 25 or more battle deaths in a
 year.

         nutrition is measured as a weight-for-age Z-score (WAZ). Full sample is based on an
         imbalanced panel of 1,537 municipalities with at least one malnutrition measurement
         from 2005-2012. Estimation sample is based on an imbalanced panel of 1,513 mu-

 “Malnutrition rate” is the percent of children age 5 and under who are two standard deviations or more
 below the mean of an age-specific reference population. “Incidents” is the rate of incidents (mostly
 violent) reported by the Armed Forces of the Philippines, per 1,000 population. It is unavailable in
 2012, and therefore based on a smaller sample. “PDT pop. frac.” is the fraction of the municipality
 living in a village that received PDT in the given year. “Neighboring PDT” is the PDT population
 fraction, averaged over the four nearest municipalities. “Years since PDT” is the number of years since
 at least one village in the municipality received PDT. See text for further details.

  * p < .10, ** p < .05, *** p < .01. Effects of PDT estimated at the municipality-year
  level. PDT is the fraction of the municipality’s population treated. To improve precision
  we impose equality of coefficients (e.g., the 5-year effect is the same as the 6-year effect) in
  Columns 1-3 and linear splines in columns 4 and 5. The “pre” F-statistic tests the null that
  coefficients on all leads are jointly zero. The “post” tests the null that the contemporaneous

 Brown et al. (2002): To convert the impact on individual z-scores to the impact on the malnutrition rate,
 we used the following procedure. First, we assumed that the child weight distribution in the Philippines
 has the same variance as the reference population (this assumption is surely wrong). Then a malnutrition
 rate of 9.59% (our sample mean) implies that the average child’s z-score is -.7, approximately. The
 zinc supplements, then, would move children’s weights by .309, which implies a change in the fraction
 of children with z-scores below -2 (the fraction who are malnourished) from .0959 to .0538, or a 43.9%
 reduction in the malnutrition rate.

 Jankowska et al. (2012): Formally, “drought” is defined as rainfall minus potential evapotranspiration
 (PET). To convert the impact on individual z-scores to the impact on the malnutrition rate, we used the
 following procedure. First, we assumed that the child weight distribution has the same variance as the
 reference population. We also assume that village size is orthogonal to malnutrition rates. Then we can
 directly convert the summary statistics of the village-level average WAZ score (mean: -1.22, standard
 deviation: 0.49) into a distribution of malnutrition rates (mean: 23.9%, standard deviation: 13.9%).
 A reduction in drought would increase the average village-level WAZ score by .159, implying the new
 average malnutrition rate is 20%, or 16.3% lower.

  Source: Authors’ calculations based on data provided by the
  Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP). Table is based on
  the main estimation sample (2005-2012). Because PDT end
  dates are often missing, “Years since PDT” refers to the
  number of years since the most recent PDT implementation
  began, not ended. Because most PDT implementations for
  which end dates are available are less than three months, we
  do not consider this a major problem.

        ity’s population living in a village receiving PDT. The “pre”
        F-statistic corresponds to the null hypothesis that coeffi-
        cients on all leads are jointly zero. The “post” F-statistic
        corresponds to the null hypothesis that coefficients on all

        columns (2) and (3), when province×year effects are added
        because there is only one municipality in the province-year.
        Standard errors are clustered42 by province (n=78). Analytic
        rejection probabilities assume an asymptotic F distribution.

Figure displays population-weighted average violent incident and malnutrition rates for 1,513 municipalities
by population density quintile (1 = least dense, 5 = most dense). Quintiles are constructed to include equal
population shares. Results are similar based on violent incident counts, rather than rates.

Figure plots coefficients, and 95% confidence intervals, corresponding to leads and lags of PDT in equation
(2), which includes month and village fixed effects. Month 0 corresponds to the month of PDT implemen-
tation. Mean violence for the omitted category (months more than a year and a half before or after PDT)
is .0024 incidents per month per 1,000 population.

Figure plots coefficients, and 95% confidence intervals, corresponding to a PDT implementation at time 0.
Coefficients are based on Column (4) of Appendix table BIV. Log malnutrition rates are normalized to zero
during the year preceding treatment. An F-test fails to reject the null that the pre-PDT coefficients are
jointly zero (F = .452, p = .771), but does reject the null that the post-PDT coefficients are jointly zero
(F = 2.285, p = .036).
