New Measures of Port Efficiency Using International Trade Data

                                            ABSTRACT

As the clearinghouses for a major portion of the world's rapidly increasing international trade flows,

ocean ports and the efficiency with which they process cargo have become an ever more important

topic. Yet, there exist very little data that allows one to compare port efficiency measures of any kind

across ports and, especially, over time. This paper provides a new statistical method of uncovering

port efficiency measures using U.S. Census data on imports into U.S. ports. Unlike previous

measures, this study's methodology can provide such estimates for a much broader sample of

countries and years with little cost. Thus, such data can be used by future researchers to examine a

myriad of new issues, including the evolution of port efficiencies over time and its effects on

international trade flows and country-level growth.

INTRODUCTION

        As the clearinghouses for a major portion of the world’s rapidly increasing international

trade flows, ocean ports and the efficiency with which they process cargo have become an ever

more important topic. Poorly-performing ports can substantially reduce trade volumes and may

have a greater dampening impact on trade for small, less-developed countries than many other

trade frictions (Clark et al., 2004, and Wilson et al., 2003). Disruptions to U.S. ports, such as the

recent congestion issues at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, quickly become national

news because they can substantially impact supply chains throughout the country (MacHalaba,

2004). Local governments and port authorities are perhaps the most concerned with port

efficiency, as ports compete with each other for cargo volume.

        Despite the obvious significance of port efficiency, consistent and comparable

measurement of such efficiencies is a daunting task. A myriad of factors contribute to port

efficiency. Some of the more obvious factors include dock facilities, connections to rail and

trucking lines, harbor characteristics (including channel depth and ocean/tidal movements), time

to clear customs, and labor relations. However, both consistent data and methods that allow

construction of a measure or index that allows comparisons across ports are not currently

available. As stated in a recent report to Congress by the U.S. Department of Transportation,

Maritime Administration (MARAD),

        “MARAD concluded that it was unable to provide the requested comparison of the most
        congested ports in terms of operational efficiency due to a lack of consistent national port
        efficiency data … comparing port efficiency would require the creation of new
        methodologies and the collection of data that were not available for this report” (U.S.
        Department of Transportation, Maritime Administration, 2005, p. 8).1

port comparison measures is also echoed in the academic literature by Bichou and Gray (2004).

This concession by MARAD is of great importance as the main motivation for the report was a

Congressional request for a comparison of port efficiency, not only for commercial reasons, but

also for national security concerns in light of Operation Iraqi Freedom. This paper is a first

attempt to provide a new methodology which is relatively simple and costless for the estimation

of port efficiency over time.

         The literature is not devoid of attempts to measure port efficiency. One common

methodology is through the use of surveys. A recent indicator of port efficiency has been

constructed from annual firm-level surveys for the years 1995 through 2000 and reported in the

Global Competitiveness Report. These surveys ask firms to rank countries’ port efficiency from

1 to 7, where 1 indicates that the firm strongly disagrees with the statement “Port facilities and

inland waterways are extensive and efficient”, whereas 7 indicates the firm strongly agrees with

the statement. Other studies have used these measures and found that the measures have a strong

and significant effect on trade. (Clark et al., 2004, and Wilson et al., 2004) Similarly, Sanchez et

al. (2003) use survey data on port efficiency to examine transports costs to Latin American ports

and find that such measures are substantial components of these transport costs and have an

impact on trade flows that is similar in magnitude to that of distance.2

         Drawbacks of survey data are, first, they rely on impressions of survey participants where

observations of port efficiencies per se may be confounded with other factors connected with the

country of the port’s location. Second, existing surveys of port efficiencies have only been

administered at a point in time or for a limited timeframe. Thus, there is almost no information

on how port efficiencies evolve over time from these studies.

2
 Besides studies based on country-level survey measures of foreign port efficiencies, the U.S. Army Corps (ACE)
also conducts approximately ten-year surveys of all facility locations in U.S. ports, including information on depth,
berthing distance to wharf, and railway connections. To our knowledge, no one has used these data to develop
measures of port efficiency. A major difficulty would be aggregation of data across facilities/docks at a port since



                                                          2
                                                                                                                   3


        An alternative methodology to measure port efficiencies, used by a number of studies is

data envelopment analysis (DEA). This procedure uses data on inputs, outputs and production

function theory to derive an estimate of the most efficient production frontier across a group of

ports. This then allows a calculation of port efficiency based on deviations from this frontier.

Examples include Roll and Hayuth (1993), Martinez-Budria et al. (1999), Tongzon (2001), and

Estache et al. (2004).3 Drawbacks of this approach include, first, functional form assumptions

that may not be correct. In particular, these methods typically assume constant returns to scale,

though econometric evidence from production function estimates discussed below typically find

economies of scale. A second drawback is that these methodologies do not generate any

measure of error by which to gauge statistical confidence and are quite susceptible to bias from

outliers. A third drawback is relatively strong data requirements of both inputs and output that

are consistently measured across sample ports and time periods in the sample. This is a likely

reason that most DEA studies are quite limited in the scope of ports analyzed.

        Another alternative is econometric estimation of production/cost functions for ports

which is found in a more limited number of studies. Estache et al. (2002) is an example of such

a study and provides a review of previous analyses using these methodologies. While

econometric estimation provides standard errors for its port efficiency measures in order to judge

confidence in such measures, these studies suffer from similar difficulties with data requirements,

particularly measurement of labor, capital and other inputs. As a result, such studies in the

previous literature focus on only a handful of ports at a time and none that we are aware of have

focused on U.S. ports.



no volume measures are given for each facility/dock. The surveys also occur infrequently which also gives little
time series information on how the port facilities evolve over time.
3
  There is also a related literature on a similar methodology called Free Disposal Hull (FDH) and Wang et al. (2003)
compares these methodologies in measuring container port production efficiencies.

                                                                                                     4


        In response to difficulties encountered by the previous literature, this paper provides an

entirely new method of uncovering port efficiency measures using U.S. Census data on imports

into U.S. port districts (hereinafter referred to as “ports”). This methodology is econometric-

based, providing standard errors of our estimated port efficiency measures, and uses readily

available and high-quality data to estimate port efficiencies across literally hundreds of ports

over a lengthy number of years.

        Our starting point is the information contained in the measure of “import charges”

incurred by the goods in transit, as reported in the U.S. Census data. More specifically, the U.S.

Census defines import charges as:

        “…the aggregate cost of all freight, insurance, and other charges (excluding U.S. import
       duties) incurred in bringing the merchandise from alongside the carrier at the port of
       exportation – in the country of exportation – and placing it alongside the carrier at the
       first port of entry in the United States.”

These import charges consist of three primary components: 1) costs associated with loading the

freight and disembarking from the foreign port, 2) costs connected with transportation between

ports, and 3) costs associated with U.S. port arrival and unloading of the freight. Component 1 is

directly related to the foreign port’s efficiency, at least for the portion of the port services

connected with loading freight and efficient disembarking of ships. There are undoubtedly other

foreign port services and attributes that are not included in this import charges measure.

However, to the extent that the efficiency of these non-included services is strongly correlated

with the efficiency of the included services, component 1 of import charges should be a good

measure of overall foreign port efficiency. In analogous fashion, U.S. port efficiencies are

directly connected to component 3 of import charges. Component 2 costs, connected with

transportation between ports, are identified with a few observable factors. Namely, ocean freight




                                                   4
                                                                                                       5


costs have been found to be highly correlated with distance, while insurance costs correlate with

value per weight of the product (e.g., see Clark et al. (2004), pp. 8-9).

        This study implements a simple statistical analysis to disentangle and separately identify

the effect of these three components. Namely, a regression of import charges on distance

measures, weight and value of the product, and other observables described in the next section,

remove component 2 effects and leave components 1 and 3 in the error term along with random

white noise. Identifying components 1 and 3 can be accomplished through the introduction of

“fixed effects” for the U.S. and foreign ports. In particular, there are repeated shipments to many

U.S. ports in a given year for a given product originating from the same foreign port, we can

include a dummy variable (fixed effect) for each foreign port and uncover its underlying

contribution to import charges. Likewise, with multiple observations for each U.S. port for a

given year and a given product, a dummy variable (fixed effect) uncovers each U.S. port’s

underlying contribution to import charges. These port fixed effects provide measures of port

efficiencies. That is, as a port’s contribution to import charges (i.e., the costs of getting the

products to the docks and unloaded) increases, costs increase, and, thus, will be inversely related

to the port’s efficiency.

        Estimation of these measures of U.S. and foreign port efficiencies allow the construction

of efficiency measures and a ranking of ports by efficiency. These estimates are then compared

with the rankings with the main “survey-based” measures produced by the Global

Competitiveness Report that offer rankings of foreign ports. These comparisons yield a

statistical correlation that suggests the model is, indeed, picking up efficiencies for our sample’s

ports. As mentioned above, unlike previous studies, the approach also allows for a time series

analysis of the data that allows dynamic measures and comparisons of efficiencies over time; i.e.,




                                                   5
                                                                                                                                      6


from 1991 through 2003. We also show how our methodology allows estimation of efficiencies

for a subset of shipments (e.g., containerized) or products.

         The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. The next section provides details of our

statistical methodology to uncover U.S. and foreign port efficiency and describes our data. The

following section provides our results including new efficiency rankings of U.S. and foreign

ports, comparison to previous rankings, and an analysis of changes in rankings over time.



METHODOLOGY

         Our statistical methodology follows Clark et al. (2004), with important modifications to

uncover U.S. and foreign port fixed effects – the measures of U.S. and foreign port efficiencies.

The model estimated is given by equation (1) and is based on a simple cost model of transporting

goods:

   ICijkt =    +   1Distij   +   2Wgtijkt   +   3Valwgtijkt   +   4Contijkt   +   5Volijt      +   6Contijkt×Wgtijkt            +

              7Contijkt×Valwgtijkt     +    8Im_Imbalij +     9Ex_Imbalij     +    i   +   j   +   k   +   t   +   ijkt.            (1)

ICijkt represents import charges and is specified in logarithm form, where (i) indexes U.S. ports,

(j) indexes foreign ports, (k) indexes 6-digit Harmonized System (HS) products, and (t) indexes

year. Distij is the logarithm of nautical miles between port (i) and (j) and is expected to have a

positive coefficient ( 1) as freight charges increase with distance transported. Wgtijkt is the

logarithm of weight for product (k) transported between ports (i) and (j) in year (t) and is

expected to be directly correlated with freight costs and, thus, have a positive sign for                                  2.


Valwgtijkt is the U.S. dollar value of the shipments divided by its weight in kilos in logarithm

form. Holding weight constant, a higher value of the product per unit is expected to increase

insurance costs, and thus,        3   is expected to have a positive sign as well. Contijkt is the percent of




                                                              6
                                                                                                                            7


shipments between port (i) and (j) for product (k) in year (t) that use container ships. Container

shipments are expected to be a more efficient means of transportation, and therefore,                       4   should

have a negative sign. Volijt is the total volume of trade in kilos across all products between port

(i) and (j) for a given year (t) in logarithm form. Economies of scale arguments would suggest a

negative sign for          5,   while congestion effects would suggest a positive sign. The next two terms

are interactions of our containerization variable with weight and value per weight terms to allow

for the possible variation in efficiencies from containerization depending on how heavy or

valuable the product is. The following two terms are included to account for trade imbalances

between foreign and U.S. port pairs, as import charges may be higher if a ship is more likely to

travel empty in one of the directions. Im_Imbalij is the logarithm of the difference between

imports and exports when this difference is positive and “0” otherwise. Similarly, Ex_Imbalij is

the logarithm of the difference between exports and imports when this difference is positive and

“0” otherwise. We expect                  8   and   9   to be positive and identical unless traveling into a U.S. port

empty is systematically more or less costly than traveling out of a U.S. port empty.

        The final sets of estimated parameters are the model’s fixed effects – sets of dummy

variables.      i   is the set of fixed-effects parameters that estimate the separate impact of each U.S.

port on import charges holding all other factors constant. These represent the estimated

measures of U.S. port efficiencies, with lower coefficients suggesting a more efficient port. In

analogous fashion,              j   are the foreign port fixed-effects parameters and identify foreign port

efficiencies.        k   are product fixed-effects that control for other (unobserved) characteristics of

products beyond value per weight that affect import charges differently across products.                         t   is a

set of year effects that capture macroeconomic and technological shocks to import charges.




                                                                    7
                                                                                                      8


Finally,   ijkt   is assumed to be a random, white-noise error term. One effect is excluded from each

set of fixed effects to avoid perfect multicollinearity with our constant term, .

       It is important to stress what our fixed-effects measurements of port efficiency capture

and how they may differ from other “efficiency” measures. Given how import charges are

calculated, we are only capturing factors that affect the shipment costs that are connected with

navigating the harbor and unloading the goods dockside. Efficiency of other port activities,

particularly intermodal connections, are less likely to be captured. However, since import

charges include port tariffs, we are also capturing any factors that affect these tariffs, such as port

administration and financing efficiency. This begs the question why port tariffs are not an

equally appropriate measure of efficiency. The answer is that such tariffs do not necessarily

include costs associated with navigation of the harbor, tide restrictions, and other factors that can

delay shipments into ports. We also note that such harbor and navigation costs do not factor into

efficiency measures derived through DEA calculations of estimation of production or cost

functions that only consider the use of dockside inputs (capital and labor typically) for the

observed output. A port may be fully efficient once the ship is dockside, but a high-cost (hence,

inefficient) port due to navigation difficulties, congestion, etc. This highlights another important

advantage of our methodology.

       The main difference with the specification employed in this paper and that employed in

Clark et al. (2004) is the estimation of foreign port efficiencies with fixed effects. Clark et al.

(2004) does not estimate these, but instead includes survey measures of foreign port efficiencies

reported in the Global Competitiveness Report (various issues) -- henceforth, referred to as GCR

measures -- as a regressor in their specification. In other words, the difference is that in the

present study the import charge data reveal foreign port efficiencies, whereas Clark et al. (2004)




                                                     8
                                                                                                                        9


uses an external data source. There are two main strengths of the fixed effect model relative to

the GCR measure of foreign port efficiencies. First, foreign port efficiencies are measured by

year for as many years as the trade data exist, whereas the GCR measure is only reported

beginning in 1995. Second, the GCR measure is only available for a limited set of countries

(approximately 50), whereas we can estimate such measures for all foreign ports, not just

countries. As in this study, Clark et al. (2004) includes U.S. port fixed effects in its specification.

However, Clark et al. (2004) does not report these, nor do they make the link to using these as

measures of U.S. ports’ efficiencies.4 Towards the end of the paper we compare our

measurements of foreign port efficiencies with the GCR measures.

         A final issue is the role of market power in determining import charges, either from ports

or carriers. Estimation of the specification in (1) is based on a model of marginal costs of

transporting merchandise and handling shipments. For example, as noted by Clark et al. (2004),

it’s possible that two different ports may have identical efficiencies, but one port charges more in

fees due to greater market power. Clark et al. (2004) included measures of market power,

including information on price-fixing agreements and cooperative agreements between ports and

carriers, and found that they did not provide any significant explanatory information for import

charges.5 Finally, to the extent that “larger” ports have greater market power, our volume

measure will control for market power effects.




4
  On a more technical note, Clark et al. (2004) specifies their dependent variable as the logarithm of import charges
divided by the weight of the product. The study also combines the value and weight regressors into one variable by
taking the logarithm of the ratio of value to weight. An obvious statistical concern with this is that the value to
weight regressor is endogenous with the dependent variable as they both contain the weight variable. For this
reason, the present study does not use ratios of the variables.
5
  Sanchez et al. (2003) provided a similar analysis to Clark et al. (2004) focusing only on Latin American ports and
also found no significant correlation between these proxies for market power and import charges.

DATA

        The data used in this analysis are from two sources both provided by the National Data

Center (NDC) of the Army Corps of Engineers (ACE). ACE maintains public-use trade data

comparable to the U.S. Census IA 245 files. These data are generated from Census files and

matched to Customs vessel entrances/clearances for more complete and accurate vessel and U.S.

port data. This data set is used to construct ICijkt, Valwgtijkt, Contijkt, Volij, Im_Imbalij,

Ex_Imbalij, and related interaction terms over all the years available with the necessary data -

1991 through 2003.

        ACE has also developed a preliminary databank containing port-to-port nautical miles.

There are 375 different US ports in these data which connect to 1789 different domestic and

foreign ports. This data set is used to construct the distance (Distij) variable. Merging these

distance data into the trade data was problematic since the files did not have common U.S. port

codes. The authors developed a correspondence between the two datasets for these U.S. port

codes in order to merge the data.

        The combined database contains millions of observations, where the unit of observation

is a U.S. port, foreign port, a six-digit HS product code and year. Such a large data set presents

some computation difficulties. To mitigate this, we first limit our sample to the top 100 foreign

ports by import volume which covers over 81% of all U.S. import activity. Second, we

estimated our model for each year, rather than the full sample. Yearly samples had hundreds of

thousands of observations and each required over 10 hours of computation time on a Linux

machine with 8 Gigabytes of RAM using the statistical package, STATA.

RESULTS AND PORT EFFICIENCY ESTIMATES

       OLS is applied to equation (1) for each year of our sample, 1991 through 2003, and

TABLE 1 provides our econometric results. Before focusing on the estimates for the port fixed

effects (our measures of port efficiencies), a short discussion of the overall fit and efficacy of the

model is provided.

       The fit of the model to the data is quite high and stable across years, with R2 statistics

ranging from 0.90 to 0.92, indicating that our control variables explain 90% (or more) of the

variation in import charges. F-statistics confirm the statistical significance for each of our sets of

fixed effects at the 1% significance level.

       In general, the control regressors separately listed in TABLE 1 have expected signs and

conform to results from previous studies. Given these control regressors are in logarithm form,

the coefficients on these regressors can be read as elasticities. Distance is positively correlated

with import charges and its coefficient ranges from 0.1277 to 0.2123 over the sample years.

Thus, these estimates suggest that a 10% increase in distance will increase import charges from

1.3 to 2.1%. This is consistent with previous studies in that there is not a one-to-one increase in

import charges with distance. Weight and value per unit (VALWGT) are also positively

correlated with import charges. Import charges increase almost one-to-one with weight, as

indicated by a coefficient that averages around 0.91 over the sample years. The coefficient

estimates on VALWGT suggest that a 10% increase in the value per kilo increases import

charges by 5.5%. The volume measure displays an estimated positive correlation with import

charges for all but one year and is typically statistically significant though very small in

magnitude. This suggests that congestion effects of volume slightly outweigh the economies of

scale effects. As expected, the effect of containerization, everything else equal, is a reduction in

import charges, though the elasticity is fairly small, averaging about -0.05 over our sample years.

The terms interacted with the containerization variable are also statistically significant, though

small in magnitude as well. The positive coefficient on CONT×WGT suggests that the cost-

reducing effects of containerization are mitigated for heavier products. On the other hand, the

negative coefficient on CONT×VALWGT reveals that the cost-reducing impact of

containerization is larger for products with higher value per unit. The final controls for which

we list results in TABLE 1 are our trade imbalance measures which are typically not statistically

significant. Clark et al. (2004), using alternative measure of trade imbalances, likewise finds no

robust evidence that trade imbalances affect import charges in a significant manner.



Estimated Port Efficiency Measures

U.S. Port Efficiencies Measures

       The model estimated for our results in Table 1 also includes sets of fixed effects for U.S.

ports, foreign ports, and 6-digit HTS products. Each of these sets of fixed effects is jointly

statistically different from zero at the 1% significance level in all regressions. Column 1 of

TABLE 2 provides the average fixed-effect estimate for the top 50 (by volume) U.S. ports across

all years in our sample and ranks them from most efficient to least efficient port. These port

fixed effects coefficients provide estimates of a port’s impact on import charges that are

independent from other variables included in our regression. The inclusion of product fixed

effects in our regression, for example, means that the port fixed effects should be free of bias

from differences in the mix of products a port handles. The lower (or more negative) the

coefficient, the lower the U.S. port’s effects on import charges all other variables held constant

and, thus, the more efficient the port.




                                                 12
                                                                                                                     13


         To avoid perfect multicollinearity with our constant term, we dropped the Port of

Oakland from the set of U.S. port fixed effects. Thus, the fixed-effects estimates in TABLE 2

are relative to the Port of Oakland’s effect on import charges which is zero by construction.

Given our dependent variable is in logarithm form, the coefficients in column 1 in TABLE 2 are

approximately equal to the percentage difference (in decimal form) in the port’s effect on import

charges relative to the Port of Oakland effect, after controlling for all other factors. For example,

a coefficient of -0.02 indicates that the component of import charges connected with that port is

roughly 2% less than the same port costs in the Port of Oakland for a shipment of the same

product from a foreign port that is the same distance away. To get the percentage difference in

efficiency from Oakland, one simply takes the difference in the exponent of the fixed effect

coefficient minus one and multiplies by 100.6 Statistical confidence of the fixed-effects

estimates for our top 50 ports all average greater than 95% over our sample years.

         An examination of the U.S. port fixed effects estimates reveals that many of the Gulf

Coast and West Coast ports rank in the upper half of the list, with Gulfport, Mississippi topping

the list with a coefficient of -0.087, indicating import charges average roughly 8% less than the

Port of Oakland. The island ports of Honolulu, Hawaii and San Juan are essentially outliers at

the bottom of the list in terms of efficiency with coefficients of 0.349 and 0.609, respectively.

Overall, there is a significant range of estimated port efficiencies. Only 15 of the 50 ports are

within 0.05 of the Port of Oakland; that is, within roughly 5% of the Port of Oakland’s impact on

import charges. The average port has a fixed effect around 0.08 with a standard deviation for the

sample around 0.11.

  This percentage will be quite close to the fixed effect coefficient (in decimal) form when the coefficients are close
to zero, as is true of many of our estimated coefficients.

                                                                                                     14


       We note that precision of our estimates for port efficiencies of ports smaller than the top

50 are generally quite weak and it is difficult to have much confidence in our estimates for these

ports. However, the top 50 ports account for over 97% of all import volume into the U.S., so our

methodology obtains significant results for virtually all U.S. import activity.

       As indicated throughout this paper, an important feature of this study’s new method of

estimating port efficiencies is the ability to derive such estimates for each port over time – not

just a cross-sectional comparison. As an example of the benefit of this time series element,

Column 3 of TABLE 2 provides the change in the U.S. port’s fixed effect coefficient over the

sample years relative to the Port of Oakland’s effect on import charges. These come from

subtracting the port’s average fixed effect for the initial three years of 1991 through 1993 from

the port’s average fixed effect from the final three years of the sample, 2001 through 2003. A

negative coefficient indicates that the port became more efficient relative to the Port of Oakland

over this period, whereas a positive coefficient indicates that it became less efficient.

       There is a wide variation in ports’ efficiency changes over this time period, with the

average experience being a loss in efficiency of 0.06 relative to the Port of Oakland; in other

words, everything else equal, an import shipment to the average port cost roughly 6% more in

import charges relative to Oakland in the early 2000s than in it did in the early 1990s. One other

pattern to note is that Gulf of Mexico ports consistently gained in efficiency relative to Oakland

over this period, whereas East coast ports, generally lost ground.

       To get a more detailed view of time series changes, FIGURES 1, 2 and 3 plot out port

efficiency coefficients (relative to Oakland) on an annual basis for certain select ports. FIGURE

1 plots West Coast ports, FIGURE 2 plots Gulf of Mexico ports, and FIGURE 3 plots East Coast

ports. FIGURE 1 shows that other West Coast ports generally lost ground to the Port of Oakland

in terms of efficiency over our sample period. One can also observe that the Port of Long Beach

lost some efficiency relative to the other ports during this period as well. Gulf Coast ports

displayed in FIGURE 2 show a fair amount of variation in efficiency over the sample period,

though their efficiencies by the end of the period are very similar to the first year of the sample.

Houston and New Orleans have similar efficiency measures over time, while the Port of Mobile

is slightly less efficient, particularly over the late 1990s and early 2000s. The East Coast ports

displayed in FIGURE 3 show the largest changes in relative efficiency rankings over time. In

particular, the Port of Norfolk goes from the most efficient of the group to the least efficient over

time, while Port Everglades goes from the least efficient of the group in 1991 to one of the more

efficient by 2003.



Foreign Port Efficiencies Measures

       Analogous to the estimated U.S. port fixed effects, the estimated foreign port fixed

effects provide measures of foreign port efficiencies, where the smaller (or more negative) the

coefficient, the more efficient the port relative to the port we exclude from our foreign port set –

Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Column 1 of TABLE 3 provides our estimates of foreign port fixed

effects from the OLS results using our entire sample and ranks them from most efficient to least

efficient port. Column 2 of TABLE 3 lists the foreign port’s market share of total U.S. imports,

while column 3 of TABLE 3 provides the change in the foreign port’s fixed effect coefficient

from the early 1990s to the early 2000s relative to the Port of Rotterdam’s effect on import

charges.

       A number of obvious patterns emerge in the rankings of the foreign ports. The upper half

of the list (the most-efficient ports) is primarily European and Japanese ports. The middle of the




                                                 15
                                                                                                  16


list is generally populated by newly-industrialized countries in Southeast Asia, such as Taiwan

and Korea, while the least-efficient ports are primarily Central American and Chinese ports. As

with the U.S. port efficiency measures, most are estimated to be statistically different from zero –

the efficiency of the Rotterdam port by construction – at the 5% significance level or better.

       Column 3 of TABLE 3 shows how estimated port efficiency measures changed over our

sample period. As with the U.S. port data, we calculate this as the average port efficiency from

2001 through 2003 minus the average port efficiency from 1991 through 1993. There is

substantial variation in port efficiency changes over the sample with a standard deviation of 0.16,

but the average change in port efficiency relative to Rotterdam is -0.05, or a 5% efficiency gain.



Comparing Our Foreign Port Efficiency Measures to the GCR Measures

       As mentioned, previous literature has used the GCR measures as proxies for foreign port

efficiency. While these measures are only available for certain countries, one can examine how

comparable this study’s measures are to the GCR measures by aggregating our port measures by

country (using our import market shares as weights) and calculating a pairwise correlation.

Clark et al. (2004) reports and uses the GCR measures for the year 1998. An average country-

level port efficiency measure for the 1997-1999 period using this study’s estimated port

efficiencies is constructed, which yields 29 matches with the GCR data. The pairwise correlation

is 0.33 between the two measures and is statistically significant at the 7% confidence level.

       Interestingly, the two contiguous countries to the U.S. yield unexpected port efficiencies

measures using our methodology, with Canada’s ports ranking as some of the worst and

Mexico’s ports ranking as some of the best in the world. Our current control regressors may not

be adequately capturing these countries special geography with the U.S. If we discard these two




                                                16
                                                                                                   17


observations, the correlation between this study’s estimated measures of port efficiencies and the

GCR measures is 0.65 and statistically significant at the 1% confidence level. This suggests that

our study’s measures are capturing similar port efficiency effects to the GCR measures (with the

exception of contiguous countries). However, this paper’s methodology can provide such port

efficiency measures for many more years than the GCR data and for conceivably all foreign

ports (not just countries) from which the U.S. imports.



U.S. Port Efficiencies for Select Products: Steel and Autos

       Another significant advantage of the methodology in this paper is our ability to easily

estimate port efficiencies for only a subset of products. This is done by simply re-estimating the

model represented in equation (1) for only observations on the products of interest. For example,

TABLES 4 and 5 provide information on U.S. port efficiencies estimated when focusing on only

steel products or autos, respectively, using data for the year 1999. For both products, the port

efficiencies are again measured relative to the Port of Oakland, which is a significant port for

both types of imported products. Panel A of each table displays ports with at least a 1% market

share in the product and which are significantly different than Oakland in terms of efficiency,

while Panel B of each table displays other ports with at least 1% market share that are not

statistically different than Oakland in terms of efficiency. Our estimates reported in TABLE 4

suggest that both the Ports of Tampa and Baton Rouge are significantly more efficient for

handling steel products, while Los Angeles, Chester, Camden, and San Juan are ports with

significant market shares, but less efficient than Oakland in handling these products. In autos

(TABLE 5), the Port of Brunswick, Georgia is estimated to be significantly more efficient than




                                                 17
                                                                                                    18


all other ports, while Long Beach, Norfolk, Charleston, Tacoma, New York & New Jersey, and

Boston are estimated to be significantly inefficient relative to Oakland.



CONCLUSION

       This study provides new measures of ocean port efficiencies through simple statistical

tools using U.S. data on import flows from 1991 through 2003. Unlike previous measures using

surveys, DEA, or production/cost function estimation, this study’s methodology can provide

such estimates for a much broader sample of countries and years with little cost. It also has the

flexibility to quickly provide port efficiency comparisons on a commodity-by-commodity basis

(e.g., which U.S. ports are more efficient at handling steel products). The costliness and strong

data requirements of other methodologies is likely why MARAD was unable to identify or

provide any port efficiency comparison in a recent Congressional request. Beyond the important

role of informing policy makers, the readily-available measures of port efficiency can used by

future researchers to examine a myriad of new issues, including the evolution of port efficiencies

over time and its effects on international trade flows and country-level growth.
