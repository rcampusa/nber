                   Process Consistency and Monetary Reform: Further
                               Evidence and Implications



                                          ABSTRACT




       In   this paper we   provide additional evidence that   process   consistency

may   have   materialized as a restrictive constraint on the money generation

process. In addition to recomputing the time series of process consist-

ency probabilities using new data from the German case, we also supply

our empirical technique to the data from the other hyperinflations

studied by Cagan. We interpret our results as evidence hearing on the

type of transversality condition studied by Brock or by Brock and

Scheinkman     as a sufficient condition to insure a unique     equilibrium in

optimizing    models with perfect foresight and money.

      This century's post-war hyperinflations have displayed rates of price

and money supply increase which have isolated them almost as a separate area

of monetary theory and experience. Economic researchers have treated

hyperinflations primarily as intense monetary experiments, remarkable

opportunities to test basic monetary and expectational theories in environments

devoid of confounding real movements.1

      In Flood and Garber (1980a) we devised a model which employed the

concept of process consistency, the requirement that a money supply process

generate a finite price level, to examine the transition from extreme

hyperinflation to monetary reform. Our empirical results, based on the

German case, provided evidence in favor of the model, in that the reform

occurred at the moment that the probability of process consistency reached

its lowest value. Our study can be interpreted, in line with the usual

treatmient of hyperinflation, as yet another test of abstruse monetary

theory provided by the extreme of the hyperinflationary wind-tunnel.2'3

      In this paper we provide additional evidence that process consistency

may have materialized as a restrictive constraint on the money generation

process. In addition to recomputing the time series of process consistency

probabilities using new data for the German case, we also apply our empirical

technique to the data from the other hyperinflations studied by Cagan (1956).

In the most extreme cases, Hungary II, Germany and Greece, we find that, as

in our earlier study, the probability of process consistency reached its

lowest value at the initiation of the reform.

     We divide the paper into two sections. Section I is designed simply

as a research report on our new results. Section II is a speculation
                                    -3—




concerning how the results can be interpreted as evidence about some of

the more esoteric questions that have arisen recently in monetary theory.

In particular, we interpret our results as evidence bearing on a transversality

condition studied: by Brock (1974) and by Brock and Scheinkman (1980) as a

sufficient condition to insure a unique equilibrium in optimizing models

with perfect foresight and money.

      Since transversality conditions imply that no money supply process

can be inconsistent, they also imply that computations of process consistency

should be related to monetary reform only by coincidence. That such a

coincidence should be present in the most extreme hyperinflations is hard

to ignore. Thus, in section lIb we discuss monetary reform in terms of

the political climate prevailing at the ends of the big hyperinflations.

I.      Empirical Results

        In this section we report our constructed time series for process

consistency probabilities in a number of hyperinflations. The assumptions

and theory behind these computations are those employed in Flood and Garber

(1980a). In particular, we assume that the forms of the money demand

functions and the money supply processes are those which are analyzed in our

previous paper.

     are random disturbances and y              a2, a2 and e are parameters. Agents

do not know the parameters of money supply; they form beliefs about 8 and a2

by means of Bayesian posterior probability density functions.
        Application of standard methods for the solution of difference

equations to (1) yields the following solution for expected price:

                            _1c
                                              —

where
             -= a—   1
                a

        If the money supply is expected to grow rapidly enough relative to

the money demand parameter embodied in 'I', the expected (and actual) price

solution will be infinite. In such a case, no agent will exchange goods

for currency; hence, the supply process will not provide a useful money.

        We classify any money supply process which yields a finite price

level solution as process consistent. Equivalently, any supply process

which yields an infinite expected price solution is called process

inconsistent. If an economy is to continue functioning as a monetary

economy, agents must believe that any supply process which they perceive

as process inconsistentwill be overthrown in favor of a process consistent

money supply process. Therefore, if there were little likelihood that a

supply process is consistent, we would expect a monetary reform.

        Since agents are unsure about the values of the parameters of the

money supply process is process consistent. However, there is a region
         2
of   (,cr )   values           .
                         for which the supply process is process consistent;

therefore, the probability of process consistency at any time can be

determined by integrating the posterior probability density function for

(®2) over the appropriate region.

        Specifically, the construction of the probability of process

consistency is an exercise in the integration of the posterior p.d.f.:

probabilities of process consistency. To insure convergence of the numerical

integration we have altered our previous integration technique somewhat;

in the appendix we explicitly describe our new method.


a)     An Overview of the Hyperinflations

       The seven instances which form the basis of most hyperinflation studies

encompass a wide range of inflationary intensity. Table I (which is

constructed from Cagan's (1956) Table 1, p. 26) arranges the various episodes

by the magnitude of price level change experienced during the course of

the inflation.

       The first three hyperinflations in Table 1 can be categorized as

particularly extreme inflationary episodes; the last three were relatively

mild; and the Russian case lies somewhere between the other two groups. In

studying the extreme hyperinflations, Cagan (1956) was forced to exclude

observations from the final months of each episode because he observed far

more real balances than predicted by money demand relationships estimated

from earlier observations. Following Cagan, others who have studied these
                                   —6—



 inflations have also excluded those months in which prices rose most

 rapidly. Of the other inflatioris, only the Polish case required a similar
                                                                                 5
 exclusion of observations; Cagan deleted the final two months of Polish data.

      For all the hyperinflations except the Greek case, the time of the

reform is defined as the time at which the price level or exchange rate

stabilized; in these cases, a new money supply process clearly was instituted.

In the Greek case, the government announced a monetary reform in November,

1944; the reform proved abortive in that the inflation and money creation

continued, but since we pinpoint this time as a switch in a money supply

process, it is a possible candidate for the time of reform.


b)    The German   Case
      In our earlier examination of the German case, we employed a time    series
on money which, partly due to the availability of data, combined monthly

observations from the inflation's first years with weekly observations from

the last year. In addition, the money supply data from the last weeks of

the German inflation included the newly introduced "fixed value" currencies,

converted into nominal units by a market exchange rate.

      We have recomputed the process consistency probabilities for Germany
                                               a

with two   different alterations in our data series. First, we have constructed

a purely weekly time series by combining the weekly Reichsbankn'ote series

for 1919—1922 reported in Flood and Garber (l980b) with the weekly series

for 1923 used in our (l980a) study.6 Therefore, any statistical problems

which may arise through the combination of weekly and monthly series are

eliminated. Second, we have used a weekly money series consisting only of
                                   —7--




Reichsbanknotes; the fixed value monies which appeared in the final weeks

are ignored.7

      In Table II, we report the series for the probability of process

consistency for each money aggregate. The two money series are identical

until September 15, 1923, when nominal railroad money began to appear;

upon its appearance at the end of October, 1923, fixed value money was

included with nominal currency to form the series for all monies. The

date of the first observation on Reichsbanknotes is December 23, 1918. The

a ued to compute,log i,U was Cagan's estimate, a = — 5.46 months, converted

to weekly time units. The rates of growth of the logarithms of the money

supply (the 's) were the rate per week.

      In the last weeks of the   hyperinflation,   our original series and

the two new series exhibit similar patterns of movement in the process

consistency probabilities. The three cycles beginning on August 15, 1923

appear for all three money aggregates. For the original money series and

for the all—inclusive weekly series, the probability of process consistency

reaches its lowest value on November 15, 1923, the week in which the

reform began. For the Reichsbanknote series, the lowest probability is

reached on August 31; however, the probability of process consistency for

this money series does reach a relatively low value on November 15. The

major change observable in our new results is that the probability of

process consistency is almost   unity   prior to August   15, 1923. Our   earlier
computaciorts indicated that the probability of process consistency moved

between .46 and .58 prior to August 15. The results for the weekly series

indicate that agents could be fairly confident in their money's process

consistency prior to August, 1923.8

              In Figure 1, we reproduce Figure 4 from our previous (l980a) paper;

        this is simply a diagram of the movement through time of the process

        consistency probabilities based on the original money series. Superimposed

        (dashed lines) on Figure 1 is the probability time series computed from

        the all—inclusive weekly money data. While the timing of the cycles are =

        the same in both cases, the cycles for the all
                                                       weekly data exhibit a

       substantially higher amplitude, Observation 92 coincides with November 15, 1923.


       c)    The Greek Case

             We computed the probabilities of process consistency for the Greek

       inflation from January, 1943 through August, 1946. Data are available at

       monthly intervals and we used the end of month
                                                        money series, reported in
       Cleveland and Delive.njs (1948). For the first money supply observation

       we selected July, 1941, the beginning of the Nazi occupation.

             An attempt at monetary reform occurred on Novnber 11, 1944; but this

       reform is generally considered to have been abortive since it was followed

      by nearly two more years of money stock and price increases. A data problem

      coincides with this reform attempt because the money stock is reported

      as of November 11, 1944, rather than as of November 30. Thus, we were

      forced to interpolate to derive a November 30 observation. We tried to

      different methods to produce a continuous time series of money observations.

      tn the first method (Series I)
                                       a linear interpolation in the double
      logarjth of the money supply was performed on the November 11 and

      December 31 observations to yield on observation for November 30. In the

      second method (Series II) the average monthly
                                                          were computed fronthe
      observations on October 31 and November 11 and from the observations on
                                       —12—




November 11 and December 31; this method is essentially the same as

that used in our original German series in that observations taken at

varying time intervals are connected in a time series.

        We report process consistency probabilities for both series in

Table III; of course, the two series are identical prior to November 11, 1944.

The , used to derive log         is that reported by Cagan, a.     - 4.09   months.

        The process consistency probability for the drachma fluctuates

between .55     and .79 from January, 1943 through April, 1944. Starting in
June, 1944 it declines steadily, reaching a value near zero by November 30,

the moment the reform started. By January, 1945, the probability of

process consistency reaches .84, the highest value to date,.and begins a

steady rise toward unity. Thus, the Greek case is similar to the German

case   in    that   the probability of process consistency reaches its lowest

value   at the moment of the reform. The reform did not succeed in halting
the   inflation, but apparently it was        successful in restoring the public's
confidence in the process consistency of the drachna.
        In   Figure 2,   we plot the probabilities of process consistency for
the Series     I data,. Observation 5 corresponds to May, 1943; observation 22

is November, 1944.


d)      The Hungary II Case

        The Hungarian II case, like the German case, is complicated by the

introduction of a "fixed value" currency during the last months of the

inflation. The tax pengo was a demand deposit which was indexed to a

cost-of-living price index, although its units were always measured in

terms of the nominal pengo. Introduced in Jauuary,. 1946, it maintained

its real value until May. The inflation then became so rapid that the

indexation, based on the price index on the day prior to withdrawal, was

not sufficient to maintain its real value; and the tax pengo also depreciated

rapidly in real terms. Thus, the "fixed value" money became a nominal

money in the last months of the inflation. See Nogaro (1948) for a detailed

discussion of this inflation.9

      To account for this difficulty, we again employed two time series

for money. The first (Series I) is a series of nominal money only, which,

prior to January, 1946, is the sum of paper pengos and demand deposits.

From January, 1946 onward, the demand deposits were indexed, so from that

date Series I consists only of paper pengos. The second series (Series iI)..

consists of paper pengos plus the nominal value of tax pengos throughout

the hyperinflation. Series II seems to be the preferable series, since

by the end of July, 1946, the ratio of the nominal value of deposits to

the nominal value of notes was on the order of magnitude of 1010, i.e.

notes had ceased to be money.. With the reform on August 1, 1946, a new

currency, the forint was introduced, and the ratio of notes to deposits

resumed its pre—tax pengo value, approximately six to one.

      In Table IV, we report the money supply figures for the Hungarian II

case so that the reader may obtain an. idea of the magnitudes involved. The

data are the end of month figures. We begin our first money stock observation

in June, 1945.10 Starting in August, 1946, the forint was introduced; it

was exchanged with the pengo at a rate of 400 octillion (1027) pengo/forint.

We have converted all money totals to pengos.

      In Table V we report our computed probabilities of process consistency

for both data series. The used to compute log is Cagan's,          -   3.63

months. The probability series begins with low process consistency

 probabilities, which then rise somewhat. This phenomenon results from our

 starting our money observations in June, 1945; this means that the first

 few      observations, which are increasing, have a strong influence on the

 posterior p.d.f,, causing it to give substantial weight to the non—convergent

 region. The decline in f3. for November-December, 1945 produces the jump

 in the process consistency probability. The probabilities then decline

 until the reform in August, 1946; the Series II process consistency

 probability reaches its lowest value at the moment of the reform and then

 rises steadily. We diagram this series in Figure 3; observation three

 corresponds to January, 1946 while observation 10 corresponds to August, 1946.

        The Series I probability reaches its lowest value in July, 1946,

rises in August, and declines again in September. This phenomenon can

be interpreted from the data in Table IV. Recalling that the process

consistency probability for a given observation is computed using money

data through the prior observation, we note that the ratio of pengos in

June, 1946 to pengos in May, 1946 was an order. of magnitude greater than

the July—June ratio. The       observation for July would then be lower

than that for June causing a rise in the process consistency calculation

for   August. The decline in the probability calculation for September can
be explained by the August reform. The July, 1946 money data indicate that
the pengo notes had become an insubstantial part of the money stock by
that date. The reform on August 1 restored a more normal ratio of notes
to deposits (in terms of forints); when the forints are converted to   pengos
in August, notapDear to have risen by a factor of iolO over July, thereby
causing   a fall in the process consistency probability measured for September.

Obviously, the results for Series I must be treated gingerly.

e)       The Russian Case

         As in the German and Hungarian II episodes, the Rassian experience is

complicated by the introduction of a fixed value currency, the chevronetz,

 prior   to the monetary reform. The reform can be dated around February-March,
 1924; the chevrontsi started to circulate in January, 1923. We computed
 probabilities   of process consistency both for the money series consisting

 of paper rubles alone (Series I) and for the series consisting of paper

rubles plus the paper value of the chevronetz circulation (Series II). The

data for the quantities of money in circulation and the market exchange

rates are available in Katzenellenbauxa (1925).

         We report the results of these computations iii Table VI. The starting

date for the money supply series was November, 1917, the beginning of the

Bolshevik revolution. The      used to compute log    was Cagan's   = - 3.06
months. The computed probabilities of process consistency do not approach

the low levels reached by the more extreme inflations. The lowest level

attained was .526 in February, 1922.11 There is a fairly substantial

decline in the probabilities near the end of the inflation (to .777 for

the paper ruble series in December, 1923), but the reform occurred two or

three months later.


f)    The Polish Case

      To study the Polish case, we used a money supply series observed at

ten-day intervals. The monetary aggregate (central bank notes in circulation)

is the same as that usually used for this case, but the time between observations

has been one month. We obtained our data from weekly issues of Economist

published contemporaneously with the Polish inflation; starting on Augiist 31, 1922,

the money stock was regularly sampled at ten day intervals through the

inflation's end in February, 1924.

Once again Cagan's    = - 2.30   months, altered to conform to the ten day time

 interval, was employed in computing log jr.     The lowest process consistency

probability, .927, occurs on December 10, 1923, two months prior to the

reform.


g)    The Austrian and Hungarian I Cases

      For the Austrian and Hungarian I inflations, we used money supply

series observed at weekly intervals instead of the monthly series used by

other researchers. Weekly data for the Austrian crown are available in

Waires des Bordes (1924); we chose January 7, 1920 for our first observation

on the Austrian money supply. For Hungary, weekly data exists in Economist's

weekly reports on central bank balance sheets in contemporary volumes; we

selected December 31, 1921 as our first observation on the Hungarian money

stock. For Austria, the reform occurred in September, 1922; for Hungary,

the reform can be dated in February, 1924.

      Cagan's a.'s, altered to account for the weekly observation period,

were employed; for Austria,      = - 8.55   months while for Hungary, a.   = - 8.70
months. The Austrian probability of process consistency was computed for

each week in the period March 15, 1922 to December 15, 1922; for all

observations the probab{lity of process consistency is at least .9999. For

Hungary, the probabilities were computed for each week in the period

March 15, 1923 to March 31, 1924; for all but two observations, the probability

of process consistency was at least .99. For two weeks August 23 and

August 31, 1923, the probability fell to .983.

II.     Implications for Behavior at Infinity

        The time series of process consistency probabilities presented in

section   I are a set of data which we constructed. The computation of these
numbers is based on a simple theory of money demand and supply in severe
hyperinflation; and the theory seems to derive some support from the
probabilities' attaining their lowest values at the moment of reform. This
support depends on only three observations, so to push the results into
other   theoretical domains may seem brash. However, these episodes are as

close to infinity as any observable monetary economy has ever approached.

Therefore, we propose to employ them as the only available evidence of

limiting behavior in a monetary economy.

        Our results concern the movement of prices to infinity in finite

time as the rate of money creation expands; somehow process inconsistency

forces a monetary reform. However, in the context of monetary models

with explicit optimizing behavior, transversality conditions or conditions

on utility functions are imposed which prevent real balancea frota reaching

zero in finite time (or, in some   cases, from   approaching zero in the limit)

regardless of the rate of money growth. The purpose of these transversality

conditions is to force unique solutions for equilibrium price sequences,

but they are strong enough to preclude not only embarrassing multiple price

solutions but also process inconsistency.

        Propositions in economics about behavior at infinity usually do not

suffer from the indignity of being confronted by evidence; in fact, our

data have a very limited scope for distinguishing the appropriateness of

the transversality conditions. However small the scope, in this section

we explore the use of our results as such evidence since other means of
                                            -25-



confronting these propositions are not readily available. First, we discuss

the nature       of   the transversality conditions and briefly review the literature

in which they         appear.    Next, we discuss how our results may be used as

evidence for or against these hypotheses. We warn                the   reader at this point

that only the results of the German           case   seem   capable   of distinguishing

whether or not process inconsistency can occur; even in that                 case,   the

distinction is not manifest.


a)        Transversality Conditions

          Itt simple    models   of money demand, like that in equation 1, the

possibility of multiple, explosive price solutions arises. In developing

price solutions in such models, a transversality condition is often imposed

to yield a unique solution. For instance, Sargent and Wallace (1973, p. 331)
                                                     -

Ex        is the current expectation of the inflation rate n periods from now.

In   Flood and Garber (1980b, p762—3) we explicitly show that this restriction

on the growth rate of anticipated inflation rates is strong enough to exclude

multiple solutions and to restrict attention to money supply proesses which

are not too explosive; money demand behavior does not preclude process

inconsistency, however.

          Dissatisfied with these mechanical rules to determine money demand,

theorists in the last decade have proposed somewhat less mechanical models

to determine money demand through optimizing behavior in a dynamic framework.
                                      —26—




 Brock (1974) accounted for money demand by placing real balances in the

 utility function. Each period, the typical agent in Brock's model seeks

 to maximize (in Brock's notation)


        E 8t[() + v(m) + b(l)]
       t=l

 subject to a budget constraint. The current period utility function is

additively separable in consumption, c, real balances, m1, and labor supply,

       The restriction (p. 753) that v'(O) +       is   strong enough to rule out

price solutions in which real balances approach zero; in essence, the

possession of real balances becomes so urgent when m is small that agents

will hold an amount E m, bounded away from zero, even when the rate of
                                      12/
money creation approaches infinity.— Aimed at preventing multiple price

solutions, Brock's condition implies money demand behavior for which all

money supply processes are process consistent since the price level cannot

be   infinite in finite time.
       Rather than by placing money directly in the utility function, other
theorists    have sought to explain money demand   by placing explicit payment

or saving technologies in models with explicitly optimizing agents. The

overlapping generations models, e.g. Samuelson (1958), Lucas (1972), Wallace

(1980), produce a demand for money because money serves to transfer consumption

from one period af life to another. These models do not rule out multiple

price solutions in which prices may rise to infinity.

       Wallace does not consider this "tenuous-iss" of money to be a problem;

as in Lucas (1972) he is satisfied (p. 55) to assume away multiple solutions

by assuming that current prices are functions only of the current state of

the economy, where the current state does not include time. This turns        out
                                  -27—



to be a weaker requirement than is imposed by assuming some transversality

condition, since the assumption that the current prices is a function of

the state of the economy does not preclude process inconsistency.--"

      However, other researchers, desiring to close off the possibility of

multiple solutions by explicit behavioral assumptions, have suggested the

use of transversality-type conditions in the overlapping generations model.

Scheinkman (1980) proposes to attach a transversality condition of a type

first used by Brock (1978) to overlapping generations models. If the

young person's utility function is u(c1, c2) =   u(c1) + u(c2), where c
is consumption in the ith period of life (Scheinkman's notation), then


      lim xu'(x) >0
      x-+O
is sufficient to produce a unique price solution (see Scheinkman, pp. 95 — 96).

The reasoning here is that consumption is urgent enough at low levels that

the marginal utility of consumption approaches infinity at least at the

sane rate that x (or real balances) approaches zero. Scheinkman demonstrates

that this condition is equivalent to urn x > 0, where p. is the rate of

growth of money and real balances, x, are a function of the rate of money

growth; this prevents the price level from being infinite in finite time.

      Brock and Scheinkrnan (1980, p.229) argue that any device which prevents

real balances from falling below some arbitrarily small > 0 excludes the

possibility of multiple solutions with the price level rising to infinity.

As alternatives to the transversality conditions, such devices may enter

through the introduction of some tax payable in money or through some payments

technology which cannot speed up sufficiently for available real balances
                                   -28-




 to implement trade in all available real goods. The first argument is a

 theme developed by Starr (1980, 1974), but it does not seem to hold in

 a continuous—time model since money is a stock and taxes are flows.'1

        (1980) model, an example of a transactions technology which sets

 a floor on real balances, also depends on a fixed payments period. Since,

 as Barro (1970) demonstrated, payments accelerate in a hyperinflation,

Lucas' model with an endogenous payments interval added to it would not

 rule out multiple price paths in the absence of a transversality condition.

Also, Scheinkman (1980) shows that adding some auxiliary barter capacity

 to Lucas' model reestablishes the possibility of multiple soultions. It

seems that these e > 0 conditions are merely step-children of the

transverality assumptions. In any case, to assume > 0 for any rate of

money growth is to exclude the possibility of process inconsistency.


b)    Process Inconsistency vs. Transversality Conditions

      Since the transversality conditions or     0 conditions imply that

no money supply process can be inconsistent, they also imply that computations

of process consistency probabilities should be related to the advent of monetary

reform only by coincidence. Since in all three cases of extreme hyperinflation

the probabilities of process consistency reach their lowest values at the

moment of the reform, one is tempted to conclude that more than a chance

association is involved and to allocate these results as the first entries

in the "empirical evidence against" column of the scoresheets for optimizing

monetary theories.

      That such a conclusion is premature lies in our neglect of the political

mechanism that forces a reform. In our (1980a) model of monetary reform we

postulated an "amorphous political mechanism" which transforms a high

probability of process inconsistency into a rationally high subjective
                                  -29—




probability of reform. We interpreted the simultaneity of the

German reform with the lowest process consistency probability as evidence

in favor or our theory. However, we cannot count the result as evidence

against monetary theories which preclude process inconsistency unless we

can show that they predict a different result. To do this we must attach

to them some political mechanism which somehow forces a reform and determine

if the mechanism should force a reform at a different time from our

"amorphous mechanism".

      The urgency of consumption and the inability to transact ot pay taxes

when real balances are low all suggest a political mechanism of reform which

is triggered into action when real balances fall to some critical level

because of the central bank's money creation process.   It seems reasonable

to associate the timing of reform with the date at which real balances

reach their lowest levels. Indeed, in the Hungarian and Greek cases, reform

occurs just after the lowest level of real balances is attained,-' as reference to

Table VIII will indicate. Since, prior to the reform dates in these two

inflations, money grew at ever more rapid rates, our series of process

consistency probabilities should decline steadily and also reach its lowest

value on the reform date simply as a result of our computation method. Therefore,

the coincidence of the reform dates with the low points in our process

consistency probability series should not be a surprise, even though process

consistency has no operational meaning. We conclude that the data from the

Greek and Hungary II cases do not distinguish between these two theories of

monetary reform and certainly cannot serve as evidence against the

transversality condition.

      The German case is somewhat different; for the money series with

Reichsbanknotes alone, real balances declined until October 23, 1923 and rose

substantially in November, 1923, the month of the reform. For the data

which includes all monies, the low point is again October with substantial

increases in real balances in November. Process consistency probabilities

reach the lowest point at the moment of the reform (for the data with all

monies). The simple reform mechanism based on levels of real balances

should have forced the reform a month prior to its actual occurrence. The

reform mechanism based on process consistency probabilities places the

reform at the correct moment (for one of the German money series). This

result seems to distinguish between the two hypotheses and to provide evidence

against the transversality -   ( > 0)   conditions. However, the distinction

is weak since one can readily postulate a lag in the implementation of the

reform, which, though caused by the dearth of real balances in October, did
                              16/
not take effect until November.—

III. Conclusion

       In this study we have applied our technique for measuring process

consistency probabilities to all the hyperinflationary episodes examined by

Cagan. As in our previous work, we find that for the severe hyperinflations

the process consistency probabilities attain their lowest values at the times

of the monetary reforms; however, the phenomena observed at the ends of

these inflations easily can be interpreted as evidence which supports monetary

theories whose assumptions preclude any operational meaning for process

inconsistency. Only in the German case do the data distinguish between

these two types of theories. For obvious reasons, we lean toward interpreting

the German result as evidence in favor of the possibility that process

inconsistency may materialize and against those monetary theories in which

transversality conditions or other similar devices exclude the possibility.

Even the German    evidence seems. weak, so we   are wary of making too strong a

case   for   its powers of distinction. However, since it appears to us that

there exist no other means of empirically confronting this array of

constraints attached to optimizing models of money, we present our results,

because it is possible that they may alter some priors, though we are not

sure of the direction of change.

                                         Appendix

        In this appendix we describe the method which we used to integrate

numerically the p.d.f. in (3) over the region in (4). The function H(e, Z)

is bi-rnodal; one mode occurs in a region where e > 1 and one is in a

region where          < 1.    The function has properties such that for given Z,

       H(9, Z) = 0 and             }I(e, Z) =   0.   For given c,        H(8, Z) =   0.
Along the Z-axis, for given ,           there is a single inflection point. In
the 0-direction        for < 1     and given Z, there is a single inflection point;

similarly,        for 8 >    1 and given Z, there is a single inflection point. The

function is diagrammed in          Figure 4. Point A is an inflection point of            the

ftnction for given 8; B is an          inflection point for given Z; and C and D
are the two modal values.
        We integrated this p.d.f. over 36 contiguous regions in the (e Z)

plane; the probability weights outside of those regions were never significant.

The regions were determined as follows. The 0-axis between .6 and 1.3 was

divided into          eLve senents, six on either side of 0—axis between .6 and 1.3 was

on the 0-axis which define the division were .6 ,.7,.8,.9,. 95, 975, 1.00,

1.01, 1.03, 1.05, 1.075, 1.15, and 1.3. For a given segment of the 0-axis,

the Z-axis was divided into three segments. The position of these segments

depended on the average over the e-segment of the p.d.f.'s Z-direction

inflection points. For instance, the first e segment, between .6 and .7,

was subdivided into 25 subsegments for the numerical integration; for the

endpoint of each subsegment there is a value of Z which locates the                        -


inflection        point of the p.d.f. Define Z* as the average of these Vs across

the   given   e   segment.     Then for the e   segment   between .6 and .7 the Z-axis
was segmented from zero to Z*, from Z* to log $,             and    from log p .5. If, by chance,

                the segments were zero to log , log 'jj to Z*, and Z* to .5.
Z* > log j,, then

      The regions of integration for a given observation in a given
hyperinflation might then appear as in Figure 5.           Region 1 is   the rectangle
defined by [.6< e       .7,   0< Z ZU, where Z is the average of the

inflection points for the .6 < 8     <     .7 segment. Region 2 is the rectangle

[.6 e .7, Z Z log ]; Region 3 is the rectangle [.6< 8 .7, log Z .5];
region 4 is the rectangle [.7        e      .8,   0   Z Z], etc. For purposes
of the numerical integration, each rectangle, except the two rectangles

containing the modal values of (9, Z), was subdivided by splitting its

sides into 25 subsegments; thus, the p.d.f. was evaluated at 625 points in

each region. The sides of the modal rectangles were divided          into 50   subsegments,

so in these two regions the p.d.f. was evaluated at 2500 points.

      We took this care in setting our regions and grid sizes because of

the nature of the p.d.f. Typically, H(, Z) produced a very narrow ridge

running in the e    direction;   the probability weight was so concentrated, that

it was easy to miss significant portions of it by making the mesh of our

grids too Large. Using the inflection points of the p.d.f. assured that we

would catch most of the probability weight. The same reasoning lay behind

our selecting a finer mesh in the modal regions.

      To carry out the integration, we used SimpsOn'S rule twice. See

Zelirier (1971, Appendix C) for a description of this method.

                                  Notes
1/ Less emphasis has been given to the role of hyperinflation as part of
the continuous economic process, producing effects which may still manifest
themselves long after the monetary reform.

2/ En addition, our model is capable of removing the discontinuity between
an extreme hyperinflation and its post-reform era.

3/ Some of our previous work involving the German case has been criticized
on the grouxLd.s that hyperinflation data contains massive measurement errors.
We find this critique hard to take seriously. A relevant measure_.
of the importance of measurement error in data might be the ratio of variance
induced by measurement error to total variance. A measure of unity would
indicate worthless data. Because total variance in the data is so astoundingly
huge, we feel, as did Cagan (1956, pp. 47-51), that measurement error is not
a serious problem.

4/ We assumed that no cuxrent information is used by agents forming
inflation expectations because we wanted a simple method to capture agents'
inability to observe current money currently. A more complex alternative
would involve agents observing prices currently and forming an estimate of
current money from that price information. The imposition of this additional
complication is not pursued. If we did pursue this complication our
results would be a weighted average of our present results and the results
assuming agents to have full current information about money and prices.
The full current information results may be obtained from those presented
below by pushing all of our probabilities back in time one observation
interval.

5/ Cagan suggested that    this phenomenon may have been due to agents' anticipation
of monetary reform. If this suggestion is correct, then agents in the
extreme   inflations must have had a reason to believe in   impending reform
while   agents in the mild inflations had no such reason.

    The need to exclude the last two months of the Polish data as outliers
may have arisen in         empirical technique; Barro (1970) managed to
incorporate the entire Polish data set in estimating his model.

6/ The Reichsbanknotes were the currency which drove the hyperinflation.
While other currencies constituted a third of the money supply in 1918, they
remained relatively stable during the following years, so that by the end
of 1922 they represented only 1.5 percent of the money stock.

7/   Cagan felt that the "fixed value" currencies should be left out of the —-
 money totals since they were not depreciating in terms of goods. - However,
these currencies had no backing; they were promises to pay in soma asset
ienominated in gold which would be available at some point in the future.
                                  —38—




 8/ One reason that this change may have occurred is that use of a weekly
 series quadruples the number of pre-1923 observations from 50 to 200; any
 given 1923 observation would then produce less of an alteration in the
 posterior p.d.f. However, beginning in August the observations on
 deviated substantially enough from the predictable values that the posterior
 p.d.f.'s (at least in terms of the probabilities associated with the
 convergent regions) were essentially the same.

 9/ Bomberger and Makinen (1980) have recently reiterated Nogaro's observations
 in a more modern idiom.

10/ The Russian invasion of Hungary occurred in the early months of 1945,
so this is a reasonable time to start with diffuse priors. Before 1945,
there was a substantial money creation, but with the Russian invasion
Hungarian Nazis ran off with the currency reserves, so there was little
money creation before June, 1945.

11/ There was an attempt to reform the currency in early 1922 by replacing
the old ruble with a new ruble. Table 1 indicates the degree of success
of this reform.

12/ For details of this result the discussion of Figures 2.1 and 3.1 in
Brock (1974), p. 756 and p. 759, is helpful. Brock requires still stronger
restrictions on v(m ) to preclude price solutions in which the nominal price
of goods converges o zero, but this need not concern us here.

13/ This is true provided that the equilibrium price function is selected
from the proper domain. Lucas (1972) restricts the domain so that the price
solution cannot be infinite in finite time in order to fit the assumptions of
the Banach fix-point theorem required in his existence proof. He shows that
a finite solution will always exist regardless of the anticipated growth rate
of money. In the context of Lucas' model, in which money is transferred to
agents according to their money holdings, the transfer offsets any anticipated
depreciation in real value due to inflationary money creation. Process
inconsistency cannot arise as an issue in such a case. In a model in which
money is transferred randomly to agents, process inconsistency may be possible.
In that case, restricting the price solution to a domain which bounds real
balances away from zero may lead to a unique solution which makes no economic
sense.

14/ Assuming that real balances never fall below    implies that the government
can extract arbitrarily large amounts of real resources by increasing the rate
of money creation; at some point, the government will be unable to extract
the direct tax   regardless of the enforcement measures it may take .1?ecause it
will already be extracting most income and wealth indirectly through this
inflation tax.

      The tax argument also does not seem to have much empirical relevance. For
instance in the German case, real taxes collapsed as inflation rates accelerated;
thus, the rise in prices seems to force the c of real taxes payable to the
government in cash to collapse toward zero. We reproduce here a table from
Bresciani—Turroni indicating the sequence of tax revenue during the German
hyperinflat ion.
                                 —39—




15/ Of course, we must ignore the large quantities of foreign currencies
which circulated as money in each of the severe hyperinflations. We have
also neglected the effects of this replacement of domestic by foreign
currency on the    parameter in computing our process consistency probability
series; if a. were actually larger than we assume, than the probability of
process inconsistency would also be larger.

16/ However, the revolutions and social unrest of November, 1923     -

then become difficult to explain (see Flood and Garber (1980a), footnote).
The legal framework establishing the Rentenbank, the vehicle of reform,
was passed in the middle of October, 1923 (See Bresciani—Turroni, pp. 334—348).
