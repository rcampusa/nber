Four Centuries of Return Predictability

JEL No. G12,G17,N2

                                          ABSTRACT

We combine annual stock market data for the most important equity markets of the last four
centuries: the Netherlands/U.K. (1629-1812), U.K. (1813-1870) and U.S. (1871-2015). We show
that dividend yields are stationary and consistently forecast returns. The documented
predictability holds for annual and multi-annual horizons and works both in and out-of-sample,
providing strong evidence that expected returns in stock markets are time-varying. Much of this
variation is related to the business cycle, with expected returns increasing in recessions. We also
find that, except for the period after 1945, dividend yields predict dividend growth rates.

1      Introduction

           There is a large body of work suggesting that price multiples, such as the dividend-to-price

ratio, predict stock returns.1 As a result, modern asset pricing theory increasingly incorporates

time-varying expected returns (Campbell and Cochrane, 1999; Bansal and Yaron, 2004;

Albuquerque, Eichenbaum, Luo and Rebelo, 2016, among others). The majority of the empirical

work underpinning these findings uses U.S. stock market data going back to 1926 or 1945.

           In this paper, we examine whether dividend yields predict returns in a long sample that

covers four centuries of data, going back to the stock market’s earliest years in the 17th century.

In doing so, we provide an out-of-sample test, asking whether results that hold in the recent U.S.

period are generalizable to other times and places (Schwert 1990). Through the extended time-

series, we also obtain more statistical power to reject the null of no return predictability

(Stambaugh, 1999; Boudoukh, Richardson and Whitelaw, 2008).

           In particular, we assemble annual stock market data for the most important equity markets

of the last four centuries: the Netherlands/U.K. (1629-1812), U.K. (1813-1870) and U.S. (1871-

2015). We analyze the data for each sub-period individually and for the sample as a whole. We

consider the most basic form of predictability analyzed by Campbell and Shiller (1988a), Fama

and French (1988) and Cochrane (1992; 2008) and ask whether the dividend-to-price ratio

forecasts returns. There may be many other variables that predict returns. The purpose of this paper

is not to come up with the best possible forecasting model. Instead, we take the most common

predictive variable in the literature and evaluate its forecasting power in an extended sample.

Additional variables would only strengthen the evidence for return predictability.

    Amongst other work, this includes Shiller (1981), LeRoy and Porter (1981), Campbell and Shiller (1988a), Fama

and French (1988), Cochrane (2008), Binsbergen and Koijen (2010).


                                                          2
           Our results confirm that dividend yields predict returns. With 384 annual observations, we

have sufficient statistical power to reject the null hypothesis of no return predictability, both over

short and long horizons. Our estimates are stable across the different markets and periods we

consider. Moreover, returns are forecastable in real time, and in- and out-of-sample estimates have

a similar fit (Goyal and Welch, 2008). This confirms that expected returns are time-varying. In

line with earlier literature (Fama and French, 1989), we find that the documented predictability is

related to the business cycle with expected returns increasing in recessions. Our results also

indicate that the dividend-to-price ratio predicts dividend growth rates, but only for the period

before 1945. In the final section of the paper, we conjecture what could explain the reduced ability

of the dividend yield to forecast dividend growth rates in the recent period.

           An alternative to using a longer sample is to look at a cross-section of countries.2 Data for

most countries typically span relatively short time periods, and markets exhibit a high degree of

co-movement, especially in recent decades. This reduces the statistical power to reject the null of

no return predictability. In contrast, extending the data backwards adds independent variation to

the data. At the same time, many key characteristics of modern financial markets, such as

separation of ownership and control and the ability to freely trade shares, were already present in

the 17th century.

           Apart from a large body of literature on return predictability, our paper is related to other

studies analyzing stock markets in earlier periods. Schwert (1990) combines secondary sources to

reconstruct a U.S. stock index for the 19th century and finds that both the volatility and seasonal

patterns of stock returns are similar in the 19th and 20th centuries. Relying on primary sources,

    Campbell and Shiller (2005) and Rangvid, Schmeling and Schrimpf (2014). Santa-Clara and Maio (2015) perform

a similar analysis on a cross-section of portfolios.

Goetzmann, Ibbotson and Peng (2001) estimate a new index for the New York stock market

between 1815 and 1925. They find little evidence for return predictability, but data limitations

force them to approximate dividends for the period before 1870. Chen (2009) analyzes the

predictability of returns and dividend growth for the U.S. between 1872 and 2005 and documents

that returns are largely unpredictable before 1926 or 1945. At the same time, dividend growth rates

are strongly forecastable.3 In comparison to these studies, we use a much longer sample period

with complete data for dividend payments. Le Bris, Goetzmann and Pouget (2014) analyze six

hundred years of dividend and price data for the Bazacle Company in France. They find evidence

that both time-varying risk premia and changes in expected dividends affect share prices. In

comparison, we analyze the aggregate market. Both studies find that the dividend-to-price ratio

fluctuates around a long-run average of five percent in the early data.

           The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides a brief description of the data and

discusses a number of summary statistics. Section 3 provides the main results. Sections 3.1 and

3.2 document the predictability of returns and dividends growth rates from dividend yields.

Sections 3.3 to 3.5 provide additional statistical tests. Section 4 examines the link between

recessions and predictability. Section 5 discusses the results and concludes.

2      Data

           We extend the annual time series of stock prices and dividends back in time until 1629

using the most important financial market of a specific period. In particular, for the period 1629

through 1812, we look at the equity markets in the Netherlands and the U.K. Between 1813 and

1870, we focus on Great Britain exclusively. For the period after 1870, we rely on U.S. market

data. The indices we use weigh individual stocks by their market capitalization. End-of-year

dividends are obtained by summing dividends within the year.

2.1     Data description

         Below, we provide a brief description of the markets we analyze and the main sources of

the data. Details are in Appendix A.

2.1.1    Netherlands and U.K.: 1629-1813

         Amsterdam was arguably the most important financial center of the 17th and 18th century.

It was closely integrated with the market in London and featured trade in the largest English

securities (Neal 1990). Although technologically less advanced, the market functioned similarly

to today. Harrison (1998) provides evidence that the time series properties of returns in these

markets were similar to more recent periods. Koudijs (2016) shows that stock prices responded to

the arrival of news in an efficient way. The paper’s calculations suggest that trading costs in the

1770s and 1780s were comparable to those on the NYSE between 1993 and 2005. We take the

perspective of an Amsterdam investor who held a value-weighted portfolio of Dutch and English

securities. We convert prices and dividends of English securities from Pounds Sterling to Dutch

Guilders. Since both countries were on metallic standards, exchange rate fluctuations were

relatively small with an annual standard deviation of 3%.

         There is information available for up to nine securities, representing the near universe of

traded equities in Amsterdam and London. All companies had limited liability for their

shareholders and were widely traded. We collect all information available in the secondary

literature, and supplement it with original archival material whenever possible. There are years

where the information for a particular stock is missing, but data coverage is relatively

comprehensive for the five largest securities (Appendix A.1 has details). These include the Dutch


                                                  5
East India Company (VOC, 1629-1794), the Dutch West Indies Company (WIC, 1719-1791), the

(United) British East India Company (EIC, 1692-1813), the Bank of England (BoE, 1696-1813; at

the time a private bank with strong ties to the government), and the South Sea Company (SSC,

1711-1813). Before 1692, our dataset consists of the VOC alone, which was by far the largest

company in the Netherlands and the U.K. at that time. For example, in 1696, after both the EIC

and BoE are added to the index, the VOC still accounts for 63% of total market capitalization. At

the beginning of the 18th century, there is additional information for four smaller British

companies.

       Initially, dividend payments were highly irregular. Companies only started making annual

dividend payments at the end of the 17th century. For the VOC, this seems to have been related to

shareholders having different preferences for dividends. Depending on which shareholder group

dominated in a particular year, dividends were either very high or foregone altogether (Van Lent

and Sgourev, 2013). Following the literature on cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratios (Campbell

and Shiller, 1988b; 2005), we use a ten-year trailing average to smooth out dividend payments

before 1700. Returns are calculated using actual payout. To ensure that the adjustment of dividends

does not drive our findings, we also report results using post-1700 data only.

       To gauge the size of the market, we compare the aggregate value of the securities in our

data with the GDP of the province of Holland, the richest and most populous region of the

Netherlands (including cities like Amsterdam and Rotterdam), for which comprehensive GDP

estimates are available (Van Zanden and Van Leeuwen, 2012). Using information from Bowen

(1989) and Wright (1997), we estimate the fraction of English securities held by Dutch investors.

Market capitalization to GDP ranged from 15% (during the 1630s and again in the early 1800s) to




                                                6
64% (during the 1720s). In comparison, U.S. stock market capitalization amounted to 39% of GDP

in 1913 and 152% in 1999 (Rajan and Zingales, 2003).

2.1.2   U.K: 1813-1870

        For the period between 1813 and 1870, we focus on the U.K. market. After the Napoleonic

Wars, London became the financial center of the world, with the United Kingdom its largest

economy. Starting in the 1810s many new equities were issued. Initially, these were mainly canals

and insurances companies. Later on, banks and railroad companies became the most important

issuers of new stocks. The period includes the so-called Railroad Manias of the 1830s and 1840s.

In contrast to the earlier period, securities issued between 1810 and 1855 generally had full

shareholder liability (Hickson, Turner and Ye, 2011). After 1855, it became possible to issue

shares with limited liability, but many banks and insurance companies continued to maintain full

liability until the end of the sample period.

        Starting in 1825, we use the value-weighted stock market index constructed by Acheson,

Hickson, Turner and Ye (2009) that includes all frequently traded domestic equities in London.

We extend their series backwards to 1813 using the same source material and methodology (details

are in Appendix A.2). The final index covers between 50 (1813) and 250 (1870) different

securities. Total market capitalization accounted for between 10 and 30 percent of English GDP.

2.1.3   U.S.: 1871-2015

        To facilitate comparison with the existing literature, we rely on the U.S. stock market data

starting in 1871 using data from Amit Goyal’s website. For the period between 1871 and 1925,

these data come from Cowles (1939), covering between 50 (1871) and 258 (1925) securities. From

1926, the data are based on the S&P 500 index provided by CRSP. Before 1957, this was actually

the S&P 90.


                                                 7
           In alternative estimates, we focus on the London market for the entire 19th century (relying

on data from Grossman (2002) for the period after 1870), only switching to the U.S. after 1900

when it became the world’s largest economy with New York as an international financial center.

This has the additional advantage that London featured many more securities (~750) than New

York in this period. In the Online Appendix (Table OA.2), we show that our results are robust to

this alternative approach. In the same appendix, we also show that results are similar when using

the broad based CRSP index after 1925 that, again, is comprised of a substantially larger number

of securities (522 in 1926).

2.1.4      Inflation, business cycles, and the risk-free rate

           To account for changes in purchasing power, we obtain data on inflation. For the

Netherlands/U.K. period (1629-1809), we rely on information from the International Institute of

Social History.4 Clark (2015) provides price data for the U.K. period (1813-1870/1900). For the

U.S. period, we use the inflation index (CPI) from Robert Shiller’s webpage.

           We also use data on recessions. For the U.S. period, we rely on the standard NBER

chronology of expansions and contractions. The data are monthly. We classify a year as a recession

if at least six months in that year are characterized as a downturn. For the period 1700-1870, we

focus on recessions in the UK. We rely on peak and through dates from Ashton (1959), Gayer,

Rostow and Schwartz (1953), and Rostow (1972) (details are in Appendix A.4). The latter data are

annual. We let recessions start in the year following a peak and end in the year of a through. There

is no business cycle information available for the 17th century.

           Finally, we collect information on the risk-free rate. For most of the early periods, there

were no liquid short-term government securities. Before 1871, we use returns on Dutch and

                                                     8
English annuities or consols (details are in Appendix A). Information for the years before 1650

and between 1720 and 1727 is missing due to data limitations. Between 1871 and 1919, we use

U.S. interest rates on short-term commercial paper and long-term government bonds to estimate

the risk-free rate (details on the estimation procedure are in Appendix A.3). Starting in 1920, we

use the rate on U.S. T-bills. In sum, before 1920 we only have an estimate of the risk-free rate; the

data are incomplete and the underlying securities were exposed to interest rate and sometimes even

default risk. We therefore run all our regressions on raw instead of excess returns.

2.2   Summary statistics

      Figure 1 plots annual real returns, dividend growth rates and dividend yields. Table 1 reports

summary statistics, in both nominal (Panel A) and real (Panel B) terms. To facilitate comparison

with the existing literature, we divide the data into four periods: 1629-1812 (Netherlands/U.K.),

1813-1870 (U.K.), 1871-1945 (U.S. early) and 1945-2015 (U.S. recent).

       Annual nominal returns are 8% on average and vary between 6% in the early data and 12%

in the recent U.S. period. Inflation, however, is much higher after 1945, and in real terms average

returns across periods are more similar, varying between 6% and 8%. In all our main tests we use

real data. Returns are more volatile after 1870; the standard deviation of real returns is roughly

50% higher compared to the earlier periods. Throughout all centuries, returns exhibit low

autocorrelation. There is weak evidence for negative autocorrelation in the earliest period, possibly

indicative of measurement error. However, the AR(1) coefficient is not statistically significant.

Finally, the data indicate that, for the period as a whole, most of the real return to investors has

come from dividend yields, with 37% coming from price appreciation. This has changed in the

most recent period where price appreciation accounts for 57% of real returns.




                                                 9
        Our estimates indicate that the annual risk premium was relatively low in the early part of

our data, 2-3%, in comparison to 6-8% in the U.S. after 1870. These estimates need to be

interpreted with caution, though, as we use a crude proxy for the risk-free rate before 1920. Also,

because returns are more volatile in the later part of the data, Sharpe ratios differ much less across

periods, although the recent U.S. period (1945-2015) still has a Sharpe ratio that is relatively high

at 0.47, compared to 0.31 for the sample as a whole.

        Annual real dividend growth rates are around 2% on average. In the 17th and 18th centuries

they are below 1%. They start to pick up in the 19th century, with an average growth rate of 5%,

falling to about 2% in the later part of the data. The volatility of dividend growth rates changes

significantly after 1945. Before, its standard deviation lies between 13 and 15%. After 1945, this

drops by approximately half. At the same time, dividend growth becomes much more persistent.

Initially, the AR(1) coefficient for real dividend growth is negative and statistically insignificant.

For the period after 1945, it becomes positive at 0.42 and significant with a t-statistic of 3.50.

        The dividend-to-price ratio is stationary over the sample as a whole, fluctuating around a

long-term average of close to 5%; an augmented Dickey-Fuller test rejects a unit root at the one

percent confidence level. Nevertheless, Figure 1 reveals that dividend yields have been falling

since 1950 and became more persistent, with an AR(1) coefficient of 0.90, compared to 0.78 for

the sample as a whole. The recent period is the only subsample where we cannot reject the presence

of a unit root.

3     Results

3.1    Preliminary evidence

       We start by previewing the key results of the paper in Figure 2. Panel A plots the dividend-

to-price ratio and the subsequent 5-year real return. If dividend yields predict returns, we would


                                                 10
expect that the two lines tend to rise and fall together. Panel B indicates whether specific data

points help in predicting returns. The figure is based on regressions predicting one, three, and five-

year real log returns using the log dividend-to-price ratio. The final points on the graph match the

corresponding full-sample R-squares. The lines indicate where the fit improves or declines (details

are in the caption of Figure 2). Shaded areas indicate recessions (information on recessions is only

available after 1700).

        Panel A confirms that the dividend-to-price ratio tends to increase before a period of high

returns (and tends to decrease before a period of low returns), suggesting that returns are

predictable by the dividend-to-price ratio. This is also apparent from Panel B, which shows that

the fit of the predictive model improves in all four sub-periods. With the exception of the U.K.

period (1813-1870), the fit of the model improves at longer horizons.

        Panel A also suggests that return predictability from dividend yields is related to the

business cycle. Both the dividend-to-price ratio and subsequent returns tend to increase in

recessions. This pattern is strongest for the early U.S. period. Panel B confirms that recession

periods contribute significantly to the fit of the predictive model. For example, the Depressions of

1709-1712 (“among the worst of the century”, Ashton 1959, p. 141), 1873-1878 and 1929-1933

all lead to a higher R-square. In comparison, WWI and WWII do not add to the fit of the model.

Neither do the 1990s, when exceptionally high returns coincide with a decrease in the dividend-

to-price ratio.

        Panels C and D present the same information for dividend growth rates. There is evidence

for dividend yields predicting dividend growth rates in all but the final period, with the caveat that

predictability in the Netherlands/U.K. period (1629-1812) is concentrated in the 17th century,

where the data are largely based on a single company (the VOC). Panel D indicates that the fit of



                                                 11
the model particularly improves during the two World Wars, indicating that the higher dividend-

to-price ratio in these periods reflected a change in expected growth rates. Panel D also suggests

that the increase in dividend yields during the Great Depression partly reflected a downward

revision of expected dividend growth rates. In contrast to the return predictability results, the full-

sample fit of the model is similar across different horizons.

3.2   Main regressions

        In the next sections, we analyze the above results more formally. In Table 2, we report

return and dividend growth predictability results over a one-year horizon and evaluate statistical

significance using Newey-West (1987) t-statistics with one lag. The results show that in the sample

as a whole, and in the four sub-periods individually, dividend yields predict returns with a positive

coefficient. This holds true when we take logs. This relation is highly statistically significant for

the sample as a whole (t-statistic of 3.17, 2.81 when we take logs). For certain sub-periods, t-

statistics fall below two, in particular in the early U.S. period (1870-1945), but the difference with

the full sample coefficient estimates is economically small (especially for the log results) and not

statistically different from zero.

        A different picture emerges from the regressions of dividend growth rates on the dividend-

to-price ratio. For the sample as a whole, dividend yields negatively predict dividend growth rates

(t-statistic of -4.82, -4.09 when we take logs), but this is largely driven by the period before 1945.

In the late U.S. period (1945-2015), there is little evidence that dividend growth rates can be

predicted using the dividend-to-price ratio. The predictive coefficient is close to zero, and the

difference with the rest of the sample is statistically significant (t-statistic of 3.10, 4.12 when we

take logs).




                                                  12
      In the Online Appendix we replicate Table 2 using different variable definitions and

specifications. Table OA.1 uses nominal data, Table OA.2 uses the U.K. stock market until 1900

and broad-based CRSP index (rather than the S&P 500 index) from 1925 onward, and Table OA.3

adds lagged returns and dividend growth rates as additional predictors. Results are qualitatively

similar to our main findings in Table 2. In Table OA.4, to remedy the effects of possible

measurement error, we use a trailing two-year rolling average of the dividend-to-price ratio as a

predictor. This leads to more return predictability in the early U.S. period (1870-1945), while the

evidence for dividend growth predictability in the Netherlands/U.K. period becomes weaker. The

full sample estimates are virtually unchanged though.

3.3    Refined statistical tests

        Nelson and Kim (1993), Stambaugh (1999) and others argue that return predictive

coefficients reported in the previous section may overstate return predictability. In particular, there

is a negative correlation between innovations in dividend yields and the errors in the predictive

regression for returns, leading to an upward bias in the estimated coefficient. This bias is more

pronounced when the negative correlation is stronger, the sample period is shorter, and the

dividend-to-price ratio is highly persistent. In this section, we follow Cochrane (2008) to adjust

test statistics for this issue and to develop additional tests.

        Starting point for the analysis is a simple present value relation linking prices, returns and

dividend growth rates. Define log return rett 1  log[( Pt 1  Dt 1 ) / Pt ] , log dividend growth rate

dgt 1  log( Dt 1 / Dt ) and log dividend-to-price ratio dpt  log( Dt / Pt ) . Using a first-order Taylor

expansion around the long-run mean of the dividend-to-price ratio dp , Campbell and Shiller

(1988a) show that the dividend-to-price ratio can be approximated by:

                                        dpt  rt 1  dgt 1   dpt 1.                                (1)

                                                      13
                                                                           
where all variables are demeaned and   exp(  dp ) / 1  exp(  dp ) is the linearization constant.

Eq. (1) shows that a high dividend-to-price ratio is related to high future returns, and/or low future

dividend growth rates, and/or a high future dividend-to-price ratio. This can be formulated in terms

of the following three predictive regressions:

                                        rt 1   r   r dpt   tr1
                                                                                                    (2)

                                      dgt 1   dg   dg dpt   tdg1
                                                                                                    (3)

                                      dpt 1   dp  dp dpt   tdp1 ,                           (4)

where the coefficients are linked by the approximate identity

                                           r   dg   dp  1                                    (5)

and errors from Eqs. (2) - (4) are linked according to

                                         tr1   tdg1   tdp1  0.                            (6)

       Eq. (5) implies that we can always infer the third predictive coefficient from the other two.

In Table 3 we run all three predictive regressions and report both the direct and implied

coefficients. The identity holds well empirically. In most periods, the direct and indirect estimates

are almost identical. The exception is the earliest period where the relative difference between

estimates is approximately 15%. This is likely a result of the smoothing procedure we use for

dividends before 1700; for the period 1700-2015 direct and implied coefficients are

indistinguishable.

       The return predictive coefficient is upward biased if the errors in Eq. (2) and (4) are

negatively correlated: corr ( tr1 ,  tdp1 )  0 . Table 3 indicates that, in the recent period, this

correlation is indeed negative and high at -0.91. In the full sample, the correlation is less negative,

but still substantial at -0.67. Following Cochrane (2008), we use Monte-Carlo simulations to

                                                      14
construct test-statistics that take the resulting bias into account. We simulate the data using the

empirical estimate for  dp and impose  ret  0 ;  dg follows from the restriction in Eq. (5). We

rely on the sample covariance matrix of               and  , and we let 
                                                  dp           dg                 ret
                                                                                        follow from Eq. (6). The null

hypothesis of no return predictability corresponds to the following system of equations:

                                rett 1   0                 tdg1   tdp1 

                                dgt 1    dp  1 dpt    t 1 
                                                                         dg
                                                                                                                  (7)

                                t 1          dp                              

We simulate 50,000 data sets matching the length of the sample period. For each dataset, we then

re-estimate Eqs. (1) - (3). This yields a distribution of ret coefficients that we use to evaluate the

statistical significance of our empirical estimates.

        The p-value “Sim. Direct” in Table 3 is the fraction of return coefficients from Monte Carlo

simulations that are larger than the empirical estimate. Consistent with Stambaugh (1999) and

Cochrane (2008), once the bias is accounted for, there is only weak evidence for return

predictability in the recent U.S period; the simulated p-value is 0.24 in comparison to 0.05 based

on the Newey-West standard error. In the early U.S. period, both p-values are insignificant. For

the earlier samples, however, the simulated and Newey-West p-values are virtually the same and

close to zero, consistent with a lower correlation of errors. Most importantly, for the sample as a

whole, the simulated p-value is again close to zero. Thus, the long time period, in combination

with a lower correlation of errors and less persistence in the dividend-to-price ratio, yields

sufficient statistical power to strongly reject the null of no return predictability.

        By the same logic, the dividend growth coefficient is downward biased if the errors in Eq.

(3) and (4) are positively correlated: corr ( tdg1 ,  tdp1 )  0 . Table 3 indicates that the correlation is

relatively low in the recent period at 0.23, but gradually increases to 0.62 as we go back in time.


                                                          15
We thus run similar simulations for dividend growth rates, except that we now impose  dg  0 and

let ret follow from Eq. (5). Also, differently from before, we now rely on the sample covariance

matrix of         and  , and we infer 
              dp        ret                 dg
                                                 from Eq. (6).   The p-values (“Sim., Direct”) in

Table 3 are the fraction of dividend growth coefficients from Monte Carlo simulations that are

smaller than the empirical estimate. These p-values are qualitatively similar to the ones calculated

from the Newey-West standard errors. The dividend-to-price ratio generally predicts dividend

growth rates before 1945, but not afterwards.

       Cochrane (2008) shows that one can also test for the predictability of returns by looking at

(the absence of) dividend growth predictability. The intuition is that, if the dividend-to-price ration

is stationary, it should either predict returns and/or dividend growth rates. If the forecastability of

dividend growth rates is weak, dividend yields have to predict returns. Using the distribution of

coefficients simulated under the null of no return predictability (Eq. 7), we report the fraction of

dividend growth coefficients from Monte Carlo simulations that are larger than the estimate in

Table 3 (p-value “Sim., Implied”). The equivalent p-value for dividend growth rates is the fraction

of return coefficients simulated under the null of no dividend growth predictability that are smaller

than their empirical estimate. Consistent with Cochrane (2008), we strongly reject the null that

returns are not predictable for each individual period, including the recent U.S. period.

Accordingly, the p-value associated with the full sample estimate of ret remains close to zero.

This approach also strengthens the evidence for dividend growth predictability, with p-values close

to zero for all but the recent period in which we reject it with a p-value of 0.14.

       Finally, we calculate the long-run estimates implied by the coefficients from Table 3.

Iterating Eq. (1) forward and excluding rational bubbles, the dividend-to-price ratio can be



                                                       16
expressed as an infinite sum of discounted returns and dividend growth rates (since the relationship

holds ex-ante and ex-post, an expectations operator can be added):

                                                                 
                                 dpt  Et   j 1rt  j  Et   j 1dgt  j .                  (8)

Thus, ultimately, any variation in the dividend-to-price ratio is related to future changes in

expected returns and/or expected dividend growth rates. We can express Eq. (8) in terms of

regression coefficients (details are in Cochrane 2008):

                                             
                                                                         r

where  rlr   dglr  1 . The two long-run coefficients capture the fraction of the variance of the

dividend-to-price ratio that can be attributed to time-varying expected returns or dividend growth

rates.

         Table 3 reports the two long-run coefficients and corresponding p-values, either derived

from Newey-West standard errors (using the Delta method) or simulations. Since we use direct

estimates and do no impose the restriction from Eq. (5), the two coefficients do not necessarily

add up to one. With the exception of the early U.S. period, dividend yields significantly predict

returns. Dividend growth rates are predictable until 1945. The p-values for the full sample

estimates are close to zero in both cases. The long-run estimates suggest that changes in expected

returns account for about 40% of the variation of the dividend-to-price ratio in the full sample

(around 45%, if we exclude the years before 1700 where identity (5) holds only approximately).

The remainder, or 55% of price variation, is driven by changes in expected dividend growth rates.



                                                       17
3.4   Long horizon predictability

      The previous long-run estimates assume that the underlying VAR model is correctly

specified. In this section, we use the data to directly test whether dividend yields predict returns

over longer horizons. Fama and French (1988) document that such an approach strengthens the

evidence for return predictability. Boudoukh, Richardson and Whitelaw (2008) argue that the

improved fit of predictive model is largely mechanical and is not statistically significant.

      In Table 4, we directly estimate the predictability of three and five-year real log returns and

dividend growth rates. For comparison, we also report the one-year results. We report t-statistics

based on overlapping and non-overlapping data. In the non-overlapping case, we run three or five

different regressions using alternative samples of non-overlapping observations and report the

average t-statistic across those samples. Additionally, we report Monte Carlo p-values (“Sim.,

Direct”). For comparison with the direct estimates, we report the three and five year coefficients

implied from the annual VAR, using  x , h   x 1   dph ,1  / (1   dp ,1 ) , where h is the length of the

horizon and x stands for returns or dividend growth rates.

      The evidence for dividend yields predicting returns is strong across the different horizons.

When we increase the horizon from one to five years, the estimated coefficients increase

monotonically and the full-sample R-square increases from 3% to 12%. The t-statistics based on

non-overlapping observations increase from 2.81 to 3.17. Simulated p-values are always close to

zero. Also, the three and five-year coefficients are close to those implied by the VAR. All in all,

the evidence for return predictability is largely aligned across horizons. When we break the sample

in 1945, the estimates for 1629-1945 and 1945-2015 are quantitatively similar.

      The dividend growth results are somewhat different. The coefficients increase when we

move from a one to three-year horizon, but relatively less so than for returns. Moving from three


                                                      18
to five years leaves the coefficients virtually unchanged. The full-sample R-square is

approximately the same across all horizons. All coefficients are statistically significant. Simulated

p-values remain close to zero, but the t-statistics based on non-overlapping observations actually

decrease with the increase of the horizon, from -4.09 to -2.23. The long horizon coefficients are

also substantially smaller (in absolute value) than those implied from the annual VAR. This

suggests that there is some mean-reverting component in expected dividend growth rates that the

VAR does not capture. It also means that the implied long-run coefficient  dglr from Table 3 likely

overstates the importance of expected dividends for price movements. The full-sample five-year

coefficient on dividend growth implies an annual coefficient that is half the size of the actual

coefficient (-0.05, rather than -0.10). It also suggests that around 60% (rather than 40%) of the

variation in the dividend-to-price ratio can be attributed to discount rate news. Consistent with

earlier results, we find no evidence that dividend yields predict dividend growth rates after 1945.

      Results are similar if we discount future returns and dividend growth rates by the

linearization constant  (Online Appendix, Table OA. 5).

3.5   Out-of-sample predictability

      Goyal and Welch (2003, 2008) show that the dividend-to-price ratio is a poor out-of-sample

predictor of returns compared to simply using the historical average return; the out-of-sample R-

square is typically negative. This does not necessarily mean that expected returns do not vary over

time. Simulations in Cochrane (2008) indicate that even when all variation in the dividend yield

comes from changes in expected returns, out-of-sample R-squares are seldom positive. The

critique does suggest, however, that dividend yields may not help predicting returns in real time.

      In this section, we present estimates for out-of-sample predictability in our data. Following

Goyal and Welch (2008), we calculate the out-of-sample R-square as:


                                                 19

                                                          ( y  yˆ ) 2

                                                                           ,                    (13)

                                                 T
                                                     1
                                                        ( y  y ) 2

where y is the actual return, ŷ is the return predicted by the dividend-to-price ratio using a

coefficient estimated on the sample up to   1 , and r is the mean return up to   1 . In our main

run, the first training sample is from 1629 through 1700, with the first out-of-sample prediction in

1701; the final prediction is based on the coefficient estimated on data from 1629 to 2014. Besides

one year returns, we also calculate ROOS for predicting three and five-year returns. We use real

returns and express all the variables in logs. We assess the statistical significance of our results

with a Clark and West (2007) t-statistic. We also report the fraction of ROOSs from Monte Carlos

simulations that are larger than the empirical estimate of ROOS (“p-value, Sim.”).

       Table 5 reports the results. The ROOS is always positive and increases with the return

horizon, between 2% and 10%. This compares to 3% and 13% for the in-sample R-squares for this

period (Table 4). According to the statistical tests, the out-of-sample predictions based on the

dividend-to-price ratio present a significant improvement over the historical mean.

       In Figure 3, we plot where ROOS increases or declines, analogous to Figure 2, Panel B.

The patterns in Figure 3 are similar to the in-sample statistics reported in Figure 2, Panel B.

Overall, there is strong evidence for return predictability at both the annual and multi-annual

horizons, with the possible exception of the U.K. period (1812-1870) for longer horizons and the

most recent years of the sample.

       We also consider two adjustments proposed by Campbell and Thompson (2008). In the

second column, we set the predictive coefficient on the dividend-to-price ratio equal to zero if the

regression generates a negative estimate. ROOS is identical to the first column, indicating that this

scenario never materializes. In the third column we set return forecast to zero if the model predicts


                                                 20
it to be negative. This happens occasionally in the recent U.S. period where the dividend-to-price

ratio is very low. As a result, ROOS increases from 2% to 3% for one-year returns and from 10%

to 11% for five-year returns.

       Finally, we address the concern that out-of-sample evidence may depend on the exact

sample split (Rossi and Inoue, 2012; Karapandza and Kolev, 2016). Instead of letting the first

training sample end in 1700, we consider all the possible splits with at least 20% and at most 80%

of observations used for the initial training period. In Table 5, we report the average ROOS across

those sample splits. The out-of-sample R-square decreases somewhat. This is consistent with

Figure 3 that suggests that the out-of-sample evidence is somewhat weaker in the more recent data.

However, ROOS remains positive and statistically significant, at least at the 10% level.


4   Business cycle variation

      The previous results indicate that dividend yields predict returns and, therefore, that discount

rates vary over time. What drives these fluctuations in expected returns? One explanation is that

the market has less risk-bearing capacity in downturns, giving rise to counter-cyclical discount

rates (Fama and French 1989). In this section, we study to what degree return predictability and

business cycle fluctuations are related.

      Table 6 first provides summary statistics related to the business cycle. Because recession

dates are only available from 1700 onwards, results are based on the period 1700-2015. We also

look at the sub-periods 1700-1945 and 1945-2015 separately. In total, there are 62 individual

recession events in the data, ten of which take place after 1945. Realized returns are lower in

recessions than in expansions. The same holds for dividend growth rates, but the difference is only

statistically significant for returns. A visual inspection of Figure 2, Panels A and C, suggests that

the dividend-to-price ratio tends to peak in recessions. Table 6 confirms this pattern. The average

                                                 21
dividend yield is 4.86% in downturns and 4.16% in expansions. The difference is statistically

significant with a t-statistic of 4.58. Looking at 1700-1945 and 1945-2015 separately yields

broadly similar results. In line with Fama and French (1989), these results suggest that the

predictability of returns from dividend yields stems, at least in part, from business cycle

fluctuations. During recessions, prices fall and expected returns go up.

      To explore this further, we include a recession dummy as an additional predictor variable in

the forecasting regressions:

Similar to before, the coefficients in Eqns. 14-16 are linked by the approximate identities

 r   dg   dp  1 and      r   dg   dp  0. We are particularly interested in how r , the

coefficient on the dividend-to-price ratio in the return regression, changes after conditioning on

the business cycle. If it falls, it would suggest that the business cycle is one of the channels through

which dividend yields predict returns. A caveat here is that the dating of recessions happens ex

post, relying on turning points in important macro-economic series. Information about the start or

end of a recession is therefore not necessarily available in real time. Also, a simple classification

of contractions versus expansions does not capture the intensity of business cycles, and misses

long-term changes in business conditions (Fama and French, 1989).

       Results are in Table 7. The approximate identities hold well in the data. Recessions are

associated with higher expected returns. When we condition on the business cycle, r decreases –

in the full sample it changes from 0.08 to 0.06. This confirms that dividend yields predict returns


                                                       22
because, in part, prices are lower in recessions. This explains around 25% of the annual return

predictability from dividend yields. Recessions are also associated with a lower dividend-to-price

ratio next period, consistent with expected returns falling when the economy recovers. Controlling

for the business cycle makes dividend yields more persistent;  dp increases from 0.86 to 0.88.

Finally, recessions appear unrelated to next period annual dividend growth rates and coefficient

 dg in the dividend growth regression is unchanged at -0.10. Findings are similar for the sub-

period 1700-1945. For 1945-2015, conditioning on the business cycle only has a limited effect on

r .

       Next, we explore whether the inclusion of a recession dummy in the predictive regressions

changes the long-run coefficients on dividend yields. Following Cochrane (2011), we complete

the VAR system by estimating a predictive regression for recessions:

                         Recessiont 1   Rec   Rec dpt   Rec Recessiont   tRec
                                                                                   1 ,               (17)

and we calculate the long-run coefficients from Eqns. 14-17 as:

                  rlr  rlr    B                  r  r                   dp 
                 lr      lr 
                                       , where B             and  =  dp          .             (18)
                 dg  dg  ( I   )              dg  dg            Rec  Rec 

Long-run coefficients are linked approximately by  rlr   dglr  1 and  rlr   dglr  0. Results are in

Table 7.

        Despite the ability of recessions to predict annual returns, the associated long-run

coefficients  rlr and  dglr are small. In addition, the inclusion of a recession dummy only leads to

a small change in the long-run coefficients on the dividend-to-price ratio  rlr . This is largely due

to the combination of two facts. Recessions or expansions have little persistence. They are also not

a strong predictor of future dividend yields. Business cycles therefore mainly affect the short end


                                                      23
of discount rates’ term structure (Cochrane 2011). Dividend yields are much more persistent and

capture long-term variation in business conditions that goes beyond a simple classification of

contractions versus expansions (Fama and French, 1989).

5   Summary and Discussion

       The results in this paper indicate that return predictability from dividend yields has been a

robust characteristic of financial markets over the last four centuries. Our findings are robust to a

number of statistical tests proposed in the literature, including Monte Carlo simulations that take

the Stambaugh (1999) bias into account. The implied variation in expected returns lines up well

with the business cycle, with on average high returns following downturns. This is true for both

early and more recent data. Finally, we find that roughly until the mid-20th century the dividend-

to-price ratio also predicts dividend growth rates, especially at a shorter (annual) horizon.

       These results are supportive of modern asset pricing models that incorporate time-varying

expected returns. At the same time, the failure of the dividend-to-price ratio to predict dividend

growth rates in the recent period poses a puzzle (Cochrane, 2011). What changed after WWII so

that movements in dividend yields stopped reflecting expected dividends?

       We leave this for future research. A possible explanation lies in the observation that, as a

fraction of earnings, firms have substantially reduced their dividends in the recent period (Fama

and French, 2001). To illustrate this, Figure 4 tracks the development of the dividend-to-earnings

ratio for the Netherlands/U.K. period (1651-1812) and the U.S. period (1871-2015) for which the

data are available. We sum dividends and earnings over 20-year (trailing) periods and take the

ratio. During the 17th and 18th centuries, firms paid out close to a 100% of their earnings to

shareholders. In 1945, this number was still around 80%. By 1982, however, the dividend-to-

earnings ratio had fallen to approximately 45%. (The payout ratio fell even more after 1982, but


                                                 24
this is partly related to the increased use of repurchases.) This pattern is consistent with Figure 1

and Table 1 that show that the dividend-to-price ration has decreased in the recent period and that

returns to investors have increasingly come from capital appreciation in lieu of dividends.

           The growing disconnect between earnings and dividends can reduce the ability of dividend

yields to predict dividend growth rates in at least two ways. First, it enables firms to smooth

dividends more, and, as argued by Chen, Da and Priestley (2012), this can make changes in

dividend yields less informative about future growth rates. Figure 1, Panel B shows that dividends

were indeed least volatile in the recent U.S. period. Second, a lower dividend-to-earnings ratio

implies that firms push the eventual payouts to shareholders into the future. Given that expected

returns appear to be less persistent than expected dividend growth rates,5 postponing dividend

payments increases the relative sensitivity of dividend yields to shocks in expected returns and

reduces the ability of dividend yields to predict dividend growth rates.

Table 1: Summary statistics
          This table reports summary statistics for the annual variables in nominal (Panel A), and real terms (Panel B).
Column (1) reports the statistics for the 1629-1812 period based on the Netherlands/U.K. data. Annual dividend
growth rates and the dividend-to-price ratio before 1700 are based on 10-year trailing averages of nominal or real
dividends; column (1a) reports statistics for the 1700-1812 period separately. Column (2) reports the same statistics
for the U.K. period 1813-1870; column (3) and (4) present the statistics for the U.S. before and after 1945; column (5)
reports the statistics based on the full sample. DY/RET is the ratio of the dividend yield (Dt/Pt-1) to total returns. The
risk-free rate is the return on government securities before 1870, the average return on commercial paper and
government securities between 1871 and 1920, and the return on T-bills thereafter (details are in Appendix A). The
Sharpe ratio is calculated assuming zero variation in the risk-free rate. We calculate standard errors for the AR(1)
coefficients as 1/sqrt(T). We present augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests for the presence of a unit root. Three and
one asterisk(s) denote statistical significance of the ADF at the one and ten percent levels.

Table 2: Return and dividend growth predictability

         This table reports OLS estimates of regressing annual real returns and dividend growth rates on the lagged
dividend-to-price ratio. Lower case letters are logs of corresponding capital letters. All regressions include a constant
(not reported). Below the estimated coefficients (in parentheses) are Newey-West (1987) t-statistics with one lag. In
brackets are the t-statistics for the difference of the estimated coefficient from the rest of the sample (based on a full-
period regression with an interaction term).

Table 3: Return and dividend growth predictability: Additional tests

          This table reports OLS estimates of regressing annual real returns, dividend growth rates and the dividend-
to-price ratio on the lagged dividend-to-price ratio. All variables are in logs. We calculate ‘implied coefficients’ using
the identity  ret   dg   dp  1 and                           
                                                exp(  dp ) / 1  exp(  dp )       . The ‘correlation of errors’ is the
correlation between innovations in the dividend-to-price ratio and errors in the predictive regression for returns or
dividend growth rates. The p-values are based on Newey-West (1987) t-statistics with one lag ‘p-value (N-W)’ or
Monte Carlo simulations ‘p-value (Sim.)’; ‘Direct’ tests for the presence of return or dividend growth predictability;
‘Implied’ infers return (dividend growth rate) predictability from the lack of dividend growth (return) predictability.
The ‘long-run coefficient’ is implied from the short-run coefficient using  xlr   x / (1   dp ) . The p-values for
the long-run coefficient are based on the Delta method ‘p-value (Delta m.)’ and Monte Carlo simulations ‘p-value
(Sim., Direct)’. All regressions include a constant (not reported).

Table 5: Out-of-sample return predictability
          This table reports out-of-sample R-square ‘ROOS’ and Clark and West (2007) t-statistics for out-of-sample
predictions of 1-, 3-, and 5- year real returns. All variables are in logs. The p-values (Sim.) are from Monte Carlo
simulations. All predictions are based on an expanding window. In the left panel, the initial training period is 1629-
1700, and the rest of the sample period 1701-2015 is used for the calculation of the out-of-sample statistics. In the
right panel, we report average statistics across all the sample splits with at least 20% and at most 80% of observations
used in the estimation of initial parameters. The ‘unconstrained’ ROOS compares the forecast errors of the historical
mean against the forecasts from the dividend-to-price ratio predictive regression. ‘Positive coefficient’ imposes a
restriction that the coefficient on the dividend-to-price ratio is positive, or else the historical mean is used as a forecast.
‘Positive forecast’ requires that the forecast is positive, or else we use zero as a forecast.

Table 6: Business cycle variation: Summary statistics
         This table reports summary statistics for real returns, real dividend growth rates and the dividend-to-price
ratio over the business cycle. From 1870 through 2015, recession and expansion dates come from the NBER. From
1700 until 1870 these dates are based on secondary sources that use NBER criteria to determine business cycle peaks
and troughs in the U.K. (details are in Appendix A). In brackets are paired sample t-tests for the difference in mean.

Table 7: Business cycle variation: Predictability results
          This table reports OLS estimates of regressing annual real returns, dividend growth rates, the dividend-to-
price ratio and the recession dummy on the lagged dividend-to-price ratio and the lagged recession dummy. The main
variables are in logs. ‘Recession’ takes a value one for recessions, and zero otherwise. Below the estimated coefficients
(in parentheses) are Newey-West (1987) t-statistics with one lag. All regressions include a constant (not reported).
The long-run coefficients are implied from the short-run coefficients using B lr  B / ( I    dp ), where B is a

matrix of predictive coefficients from the return and dividend growth regressions, and  is a matrix of predictive
coefficients from the dividend-to-price ratio and the recession regressions.

Figure 2: Dividend-to-price ratio, recessions and in-sample predictive regressions
          In Panels A and C we plot the dividend-to-price ratio along with the 5-year ahead returns and dividend growth rates. Panels B and D track where the fit
of the (full sample) predictive regression improves or declines. We plot the difference in the cumulative sum of squared errors between a model with a constant
only and a model with a constant and the dividend-to-price ratio. The difference is normalized by the total sum of squared errors from the constant-only model, so
that the last observation corresponds to the in-sample R-square. Apart from 5-year returns, we also present this for 1- and 3-year returns. In particular, each line in

Appendix A: Data sources

       This Appendix provides details on all the data sources used in the paper. Sections A.1

through A.3 describe the main data for the different periods. Section A.4 provides details on the

dating of recessions.

A.1    Amsterdam and London 1629-1812

       The data for the period 1629-1812 cover all actively traded securities in Amsterdam and

London for which the necessary data are available. Our dataset covers (at most) nine securities,

two of which are Dutch, seven English. Table A.1 gives an overview of the securities we use and

the years they are in our dataset. Below we discuss the individual securities and the different

sources we use to construct the data. Index returns are value-weighted.

A.1.1 Amsterdam

       There were two widely traded Dutch stocks in the 17th and 18th centuries: the Dutch East

India (VOC) and West Indies (WIC) companies. Shares of both companies were freely tradable,

and shareholders enjoyed limited liability. The VOC was the world’s first publicly traded

corporation. It was founded in 1602, and its capital became permanent in 1613 (Gelderblom, De

Jong and Jonker, 2013). The company held the Dutch monopoly on trade with Asia, where it

operated an extensive trade network. The Dutch government nationalized the company in 1796.

The WIC was founded in 1675 and was involved in slave trade and the administration of colonies

in Africa and the Caribbean. The company was nationalized in 1791.

       From 1719 onwards, we obtain stock prices from the newspapers of the time. For 1719-

1722, we follow Frehen, Goetzmann and Rouwenhorst (2013) and use information from the Leydse

Courant. Starting in 1723, we rely on Van Dillen (1931) which reports price information from the




                                               44
Amsterdamsche Courant. Coverage continues until 1791 and 1795 when the WIC and VOC were

nationalized.

       Before 1719, newspapers did not publish Amsterdam stock prices. For the VOC there are

a number of alternative sources that we use to construct continuous end-of-year stock prices back

to 1629. We start with Amsterdam notary records that often contain information about share

transactions. Van Dillen (1931) and Petram (2011) provide two largely independent sets of share

prices extracted from these records. In addition, the Amsterdam City Archives provide an

(incomplete) index to the notary records that also contain price observations (City Archives

Amsterdam 30452).

       From 1629 to 1652 the end-of-year prices from the notary records are complete. Between

1653 and 1719 there are occasional gaps. We fill these gaps by reconstructing transaction prices

from the VOC’s dividend ledgers and the Bank of Amsterdam’s account books. In the 17th and

18th centuries, the title to a share was formalized by an entry in the Company’s dividend ledgers.

These books keep track of changes in ownership but do not report the associated transaction price.

We infer stock prices by comparing share transfers in the dividend books of the VOC chamber in

Amsterdam (Dutch National Archives, 1.04.02) with payments in the Bank of Amsterdam (City

Archives Amsterdam, 5077). During this time, all important economic agents had the equivalent

of a checking account at this institution (Quinn and Roberds, 2014). Most of the Bank’s ledgers

have survived, and we can reconstruct individuals’ bank transfers, including payments for shares.

       For the WIC we were not able to reconstruct a continuous annual price before 1719 (at

which point it accounted for 1.1% of total market capitalization). There are few notarized

transactions, and the WIC’s dividend ledgers have not survived.




                                               45
       Dividends are available for the entire period and come from two sources. For the VOC, we

rely on Klerk de Reus (1894) which provides information on the exact dates dividends were

payable to investors; for the WIC, we use Luzac (1780).

A.1.2 London

       We have information available for seven English securities. The first group of securities

includes the most important English companies of the time: the Bank of England (BoE), the

English East India Company (EIC), and the South Sea Company (SSC). The BoE was founded in

1694 to help finance the English government debt. It held an effective monopoly on the issuance

of banknotes and provided short-term credit to merchants and other financial intermediaries. It was

an important lender to the EIC as well. The EIC started in 1657 and held the English monopoly on

trade with Asia. Around 1700 the trade on Asia was opened up, and in 1708 the government

allowed the “old” EIC to merge with its main competitor, the “new” EIC, to restore its monopoly.

For the period before 1708 there is only information available for the old EIC. The SSC started in

1711 after receiving a monopoly on the trade with South America. These activities never

materialized, and the Company was mainly a vehicle to finance the English government debt. It

performed a number of debt-for-equity swaps; the final one resulted in the South Sea Bubble in

1720. In that year the company accounted for 61% of total market capitalization. After the bubble

burst, the company was largely liquidated; in 1733, it constituted only 6% of our index. Remaining

shares were largely backed by government debt.

       The second group of stocks includes the London Assurance Company (LA), the Million

Bank (MB), the Royal African Company (RAC), and the Royal Exchange Assurance Company

(REA). These companies were substantially smaller, and their coverage is mostly limited to the

first few decades of the 18th century. Both LA and the REA were set up as insurance companies in


                                                46
the run-up to the South Sea Bubble. They mainly dealt in marine insurance, but also set up ventures

in fire and life insurance. Similar to the SSC, the MB was a vehicle to help fund the government

debt. Finally, the RAC was set up as an English equivalent to the WIC and was mainly active in

the slave trade between Africa and the Caribbean (Scott, 1912).

       Data coverage for the first group of securities is relatively complete. Starting in 1698, Neal

(1990) provides detailed price data collected from the Course of the Exchange. For earlier years,

we rely on Thorold Rogers (1902) and Scott (1912) who report prices from a series of English

newspapers. For the BoE and SSC, available stock prices go back to their inception; 1696 and

1711, respectively. For the EIC, prices are only available from 1692 onwards. Between 1657 and

1692 price observations are too infrequent to construct an annual series (Scott 1912, II, p. 178-9).

We take prices for the old EIC until its merger with the new EIC in 1708, using prices for the

newly formed United EIC thereafter. For all three companies, stock prices are available up to 1812.

Information on dividends and stocks outstanding was kindly provided by Gary Shea (in

preparation).

       Data coverage is more limited for the second group of companies. In general, prices go

back to the initial issuance of each security, but coverage ends in 1734 when the Course of

Exchange stops reporting their prices (Neal 1990). Early prices come from Scott (1912);

information after 1698 is from Neal (1990), where necessary supplemented with information from

Frehen, Goetzmann and Rouwenhorst (2013). We collected information on dividends and stocks

outstanding from a host of sources. Table A.1 gives and overview. This information is complete

for all companies, with the exception of the REA, for which dividend information is only available

for 1718-1720 as the company’s financial records were almost entirely destroyed in a fire in 1838




                                                47
(Supple, 1970). For all four securities we have full data coverage in 1720, the year of the South

Sea Bubble when these securities appreciated substantially in value.

        The English companies have a complicated history of capital calls, rights issues,

repurchases, stock dividends and share splits (“capital events”). We use the sources listed in Table

A.1 to adjust stock prices where necessary. In particular, we define dividends as regular dividends

only. This approach closely follows Acheson et al. (2009), Cowles (1939) and S&P (the sources

that we use for the 19th and early 20th century). To ensure that total returns capture actual outcomes

to investors, price appreciation is adjusted for other payments such as rights issues, repurchases at

non-market values and capital calls. For example, if a company is trading at 100 and has a rights

issue at a price of 98 at a one-to-one basis, we add two percentage points to the capital appreciation

in that year.

A.1.3 Exchange rates

           For most of the period, the English securities were also traded in the Amsterdam market

(but not the other way around). We take the perspective of a Dutch investor and convert all price

and dividend data into Dutch guilders. Exchange rate information comes from Posthumus (1946),

where necessary supplemented with information from Frehen, Goetzmann and Rouwenhorst

(2013).

A.1.4 Risk-free rate

           Our estimates of the risk rate are based on returns on Dutch and English government bonds

that are available from 1650 onwards. Between 1650 and 1720 we use returns on Dutch

(redeemable) annuities. This was the most liquid form of Dutch government debt of the time. Data

come from Gelderblom and Jonker (2010). There is a gap in our data between 1720 and 1727.

Starting in 1727 we use returns on the English 3% Annuities reported in Neal (1990).

A.1.5 Earnings

        We are able to (partially) reconstruct earnings for the VOC, EIC and BoE. Data for the

VOC are available in De Korte (1984) and start in 1651. Information for the EIC comes from

Chaudhuri (1978) for 1710 – 1745 and Bowen (2006) for 1757 – 1812. For the BoE, we obtain

data from Clapham (1945) for 1721 – 1797 and Report on the Bank Charter (1832) for 1798 –

1812.

A.2     England 1813-1870

A.2.1 Stock market data

        Starting in 1825, we use the value-weighted return and dividend series from Acheson,

Hickson, Turner, and Ye (2009), hereafter AHTY. Their data are based on all frequently traded

domestic equities in London. Returns and dividends are constructed in the standard way with two

exceptions. First, they omit all securities that were traded for less than 12 months. There were

many new issuances in this period, and investors were allowed to spread IPO payments over an

extended period of time. This gave investors the option to withdraw if they thought the company

would not survive. Many firms failed to raise the required capital, and the 12 month cut-off is

meant to exclude such cases. Second, there were many capital calls, rights issues, and other capital

events. It is often unclear what the impact of these events was on investors’ returns. AHTY

therefore omit individual security returns for the months in which these events took place. AHTY

and Hickson, Turner and Ye (2011) have more details.

        AHTY try to correct their stock market index for survivorship bias arising from delistings.

They propose a number of alternatives. We use the index constructed using “definition 2 (upper

bound).” This series adjusts for survivorship bias in a simple way that we can easily replicate when

we extend the data back to 1813. In particular, AHTY set returns on securities that disappear to -


                                                50
100%, but only if they were listed for at least 36 months. The underlying assumption is that such

securities “were never fully established in the market.” “Upper bound” means that delisted

securities disappear from the sample afterwards, as opposed to the “lower bound” strategy where

delisted securities are retained in the index, setting subsequent returns to 0. In untabulated results

we find that using alternative series from AHTY that adjust for survivorship bias in slightly

different ways affects the level of the risk premium, but does not materially impact the

predictability results.

        We extend AHTY’s series back to 1813 using the same source material and methodology.

In particular, for each individual security, we construct monthly price and dividend payments using

information from Wetenhall’s Course of the Exchange (available on microfilm at the University

of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign) using the last available observation within each month. We then

follow the same approach as AHTY to construct annual returns and dividends.

A.2.2 Risk free rate

        For the risk free rate between 1813 and 1870, we use returns on 3% Consols from Homer

and Sylla (2005, Table 19). This was the most liquid form of government debt at the time

(Grossman 2002, AHTY).

A.3     U.S. 1871-2015

        To facilitate comparison with the existing literature, we rely on the U.S. stock market data

starting in 1871, using data from Amit Goyal’s website. For the period between 1871 and 1925,

these data come from Cowles (1939), covering between 50 (1871) and 258 (1925) securities. For

1926-2015, the data are based on the S&P 500 index provided by CRSP. Before 1957, this was

actually the S&P 90. Both Cowles (1939) and S&P only report ordinary dividends. Prices are




                                                 51
adjusted for non-regular payouts to investors. We also obtain aggregate earnings data from Amit

Goyal’s webpage.

A.3.2 Risk free rate

       Rates on U.S. Treasury bills are only available from 1920 onwards; for 1920-1945, we use

Homer and Sylla (2005, Table 49); for the 1945-2015 period, we rely on the dataset on Amit

Goyal’s website. Before 1920, there are two interest rates that we use to estimate the risk free rate:

the rate on so-called call loans and yields on long term government debt. Call loans were the most

important short term debt instruments of the time. They were collateralized with liquid securities

and could be called in by the lender at any point in time. For the period between 1920 and 1945,

the different interest rate series overlap, and we predict the T-bill rate with the call loan rate and

the government bond yield. We use the resulting coefficient estimates to construct a hypothetical

T-bill rate for 1871-1919. Call loan rates and yields on government securities come from Homer

and Sylla (2005), tables 44, and 49, and 42, 43, 46 and 48, respectively.

A.4    Recession dates

       As is standard, we classify a recession as the period between a peak and a trough in the

economic cycle. We collect peak and trough dates from the secondary literature. All sources use

the NBER definition that identifies a peak or trough when a large number of macro-economic

variables have a turning point in their time series (Diebold and Rudebusch, 1996). This approach

goes back to the seminal work of Burns and Mitchell (1946) who describe this approach as follows:

       “A [business] cycle consists of expansions occurring at about the same time in many

       economic activities, followed by similarly general recessions, contractions, and revivals

       which merge into the expansion phase of the next cycle.” (Burns and Mitchell 1946, p.3)




                                                 52
Which specific macro-variables to look at is at the discretion of the NBER’s committee members

and can vary over time. In the committee’s own words, “the committee does not have a fixed

definition of economic activity.”7

           For the period 1870-2015, we rely on information from the NBER website that lists the

months the U.S. economy was at a peak or trough.8 Before 1945, the data come from Burns and

Mitchell (1946); from 1946 onwards, the data come directly from the NBER. We classify a year

as a recession if at least six months in that year feature a contraction.

           For the period before 1870, we rely on recessions in the U.K. A number of publications

reconstruct British peak and trough dates using the same methodology as Burns and Mitchell. For

1700-1802 we rely on the work of Ashton (1959), and for 1803-1870 we use the dates from Rostow

(1972), who incorporates the earlier work by Gayer, Rostow and Schwartz (1953) for 1803-1850.

These dates are considered the best available estimates in the literature (Broadberry and Van

Leeuwen, 2010). The identification of peaks and troughs is primarily based on cyclical fluctuations

in exports, investment (particularly in buildings and ships) and textile production. All three

contributions use qualitative evidence from contemporary sources to help identify the exact timing

of the economy’s turning points (Gayer, Rostow and Schwartz, 1953, p. 342-53 and 532; Ashton

1959, p.138-40). The early data are annual. We let recessions start in the year following a peak

and end in the year of a trough. For the period before 1700, we are not aware of any data on peak

and trough dates.

                                       Online Appendix

        This Online Appendix reports supporting evidence for the results reported in the main
paper. We first report the sensitivity analysis of our main results based on annual real data from
Table 2. Table OA.1 uses nominal data. In Table OA.2, we extend the U.K. period until 1900, and
we use the broad-based CRSP index rather than the S&P 500 from 1925 onward. In Table OA.3,
we add lagged returns and dividend growth rates as additional predictors. In Table OA.4, we
smooth the dividend-to-price ratio by taking a trailing two-year rolling average. In Table OA.5,
we report the sensitivity of longer horizon predictability results from Table 6. Instead of predicting
simple sum of future returns and dividend growth rates, we weigh them by “rho.” Finally, in Figure
OA.1, we plot annual real dividends along with the smoothed dividends for the Netherlands/U.K.
period.




                                                 57
Nominal data (Table OA.1)
       Our main analysis is based on real data. Here, we repeat the analysis using nominal prices
and dividends. As reported in Table OA.1, results are qualitatively similar. The only important
difference is that returns are less predictable, and the dividend growth is more predictable in the
U.K period. The full sample results remain qualitatively the same.

Extended U.K. period and CRSP index (Table OA.2)
       In the main text, we switch from U.K. to U.S. data in 1871 (for better comparability with
recent studies). One can argue that it was not until the beginning of the 20th century that that the
U.S. became the world’s largest economy. Also, the Cowles (1939) data, which we use between
1871 and 1925, includes only 50 companies in 1871 (258 in 1925). Many more companies were
traded in the U.K. at the end of the 19th century. Moreover, after 1925 we use the S&P 500 in the
main analysis, which was effectively the S&P 90 till March 1957. Again, one may wonder if results
change by using an index with a broader coverage.
       Here, we present results where we switch from the U.K. to the U.S. market in 1900. The
U.K. data for the period 1870-1900 come from Grossman (2002). These data include 520
companies in 1870 and around 1,000 companies in 1900. We also use the CRSP value-weighted
index from 1925 onward rather than the S&P 500. The CRSP index includes 533 companies in
January 1926 (rather than 90) and 7,178 in December 2015 (rather than 500). As before, end-of-
year dividends are simple sums of within-year dividends.
       Results are reported in Table OA.2 and are qualitatively similar to the baseline results
reported in Table 2. There is some more evidence for dividend growth predictability in the
extended U.K. period as the estimated parameter is now significant. Results for the U.S. period,
however, are unchanged. The same is true for the full sample results.

Lagged returns and dividend growth rates as additional predictors (Table OA.3)
       In the main analysis, we predict returns and dividend growth rates using the lagged
dividend-to-price ratio only. Here, we add lagged returns and lagged dividend growth rates as
additional predictors. Lagged variables occasionally strengthen the overall evidence for return or
dividend growth predictability (for example, in the recent period dividend growth is persistent and
predicts itself), but they do not importantly affect the coefficients on the dividend-to-price ratio. If



                                                  58
anything, return predictability from dividend yields becomes somewhat stronger, especially in the
early U.S. period 1871-1945, although the coefficient remains insignificant.

Two-year trailing average of dividend-to-price ratio (Table OA.4)
       To address the concern that our results are influenced by measurement error, we redo Table
2 using a smoothed version of dividend-to-price ratio. That is, we predict returns and dividend
growth rates by the lagged two-year trailing average of dividend-to-price ratio. Under this
specification, the evidence for dividend growth predictability in the earliest period (1629-1812)
becomes weaker. Using the raw data, the predictive coefficient on the dividend-to-price ratio goes
down from -2.25 to -1.32 and becomes insignificant (t-statistic of -1.57). In log terms, it falls from
-0.12 to -0.08 and remains significant (t-statistic of -1.91). The evidence for the predictability of
returns is largely unchanged. The only exception is the early U.S. period (1871-1945), where the
evidence for dividend yields predicting returns becomes stronger and significant. Thus, using the
smoothed dividend-to-price ratio, annual returns are predictable in all the subperiods and in the
full period. Dividend growth remains predictable in the full sample.

Long-horizon predictability: Weighted returns and dividend growth rates (Table OA.5)
       In Table 4, we consider predicting 1-, 3-, and 5- year returns and dividend growth rates.
That is, we predict simple sum of log returns over subsequent years. Now, we consider weighting
future returns and dividend growth rates by the linearization constant  . This is motivated by the
present value model linking the dividend-to-price ratio to the discounted sum of future returns and
dividend growth rates (Eq. 8 in the main paper). Results are reported in Table OA. 5. Weighting
only has a marginal effect on our estimates, and all the main results are qualitatively similar to
Table 4.




                                                 59
Table OA.1: Nominal data

1, 3, or 5 years. Below the estimated coefficients (in parentheses) are Newey-West (1987) t-statistics with the number
of lags equal to the length of the horizon. In brackets are t-statistics based on non-overlapping observations, calculated
as the mean across alternative non-overlapping samples (e.g. in case of 5-year predictions, we report the mean across
five different non-overlapping samples starting in years 1 through 5). The p-values ‘(Sim., Direct)’ are based on Monte
Carlo simulations. The ‘implied coefficient’ for longer horizon predictions is based on the 1-year coefficient and
calculated using  x , h   x 1   h  dhp ,1  / (1    d p ,1 ) . All regressions include a constant (not reported).
