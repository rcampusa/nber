Futures Prices as Risk-adjusted Forecasts of Monetary Policy
Monika Piazzesi and Eric Swanson
NBER Working Paper No. 10547
June 2004
JEL No. G0, G1
                                          ABSTRACT

Many researchers have used federal funds futures rates as measures of financial markets'

expectations of future monetary policy. However, to the extent that federal funds futures reflect risk

premia, these measures require some adjustment to account for these premia. In this paper, we

document that excess returns on federal funds futures have been positive on average and strongly

countercyclical. In particular, excess returns are surprisingly well predicted by macroeconomic

indicators such as employment growth and financial business-cycle indicators such as Treasury yield

spreads and corporate bond spreads. Excess returns on eurodollar futures display similar patterns.

We document that simply ignoring these risk premia has important consequences for the expected

future path of monetary policy. We also show that risk premia matter for some futures-based

measures of monetary policy surprises used in the literature.

1    Introduction
A number of recent papers (e.g., Krueger and Kuttner 1996, Rudebusch 1998, Brunner
2000, Kuttner 2001, Gürkaynak, Sack, and Swanson 2002, 2003, Bernanke and Kuttner
2003, Faust, Swanson and Wright 2004) have used federal funds futures rates to measure
financial markets’ expectations about the future course of monetary policy. Guided
by studies that did not find any predictable variation in excess returns on fed funds
futures (e.g., Krueger and Kuttner 1996, Sack 2002, Durham 2003), these papers assume
the expectations hypothesis. This approach is also standard at central banks–see, for
example, the European Central Bank’s “Monthly Bulletin” (2004, p. 22) and Greenspan’s
“Monetary Policy Report to Congress” (2004, p. 20). However, there is by now a large
and well accepted body of evidence against the expectations hypothesis for Treasury
yields (e.g., Fama and Bliss 1987, Stambaugh 1988, Campbell and Shiller 1991, and
Cochrane and Piazzesi 2002b). Excess returns on Treasury securities over a very wide
range of sample periods and maturities have been positive on average and predictable
over time.
    In this paper, we show that the expectations hypothesis also fails for federal funds
futures. In particular, excess returns on fed funds futures contracts at even short horizons
have been positive on average, time-varying, and significantly predictable. The R2 s
depend on the holding period and range from 8% for a 2-month horizon, 15% for a 3-
month horizon, up to 35% for a 6-month horizon. We find that macroeconomic indicators
such as employment growth capture this predictability surprisingly well. We also find
that financial business-cycle indicators such as Treasury yield spreads and corporate bond
spreads do well in predicting excess returns. These patterns are robust both pre- and
post-1994, are evident in rolling regressions, and are also displayed by eurodollar futures.
Interestingly, we document that noncommercial (non-hedging) market participants tend
to go long in futures when expected excess returns are high, while they tend go short in
times when expected excess returns are low.
    We exploit the significant predictability of excess returns on futures to propose a risk
adjustment to forecasts of monetary policy. We find that not implementing our risk
adjustment can produce very misleading results. Specifically, forecasts based on the ex-
pectations hypothesis make large mean errors and large mean-squared errors. Moreover,
errors from unadjusted forecasts vary systematically over the business cycle; futures rates
tend to overpredict in recessions and underpredict in booms. Also, the forecasts tend to
lag behind around economic turning points, adapting too slowly to changes in the direc-
tion of monetary policy. For example, right before recessions, when the Fed has already
started easing, fed fund futures keep forecasting high funds rates. As a consequence,
forecast errors using unadjusted futures rates are more highly autocorrelated than are
forecast errors using our risk-adjusted futures rates.
    Our findings also suggest that monetary policy shocks may not be accurately measured
by the diﬀerence between the realized funds rate target and market expectations based on
fed funds futures. Indeed, we document that the amount by which we need to adjust these
shocks can be substantial, at least relative to the size of the shocks themselves. However,

                                             2
risk premia seem to change primarily at business-cycle frequencies, which suggests that
we may be able to “diﬀerence them out” by looking at one-day changes in near-dated
federal funds futures on the day of a monetary policy announcement. Indeed, our results
confirm that diﬀerencing improves these policy measures.
    Throughout this paper, we will often use the label “risk premia” to refer to “pre-
dictable returns in excess of the riskfree rate.” This use of language should not be inter-
preted as taking a particular stance on the structural interpretation of our results. The
existing literature has proposed several appealing explanations for why excess returns on
these contracts might be predictable. Some of these explanations are based on the util-
ity function of investors: for example, investors may exhibit risk aversion which varies
over the business cycle, or care about the slow-moving, cyclical consumption of items
like housing. Other explanations are based on beliefs that do not satisfy the rational
expectations assumption, for example because of learning or just incorrect beliefs. It is
not easy to make the case for just one of these explanations: beliefs and other preference
parameters can often not be identified separately. We therefore set aside these issues as
beyond the scope of the present paper.
    Our findings on fed funds futures complement those for Treasuries along several di-
mensions. First, we find that the most important predictive variable is a macroeconomic
variable: nonfarm payroll employment. Previous studies found significant results mainly
for financial variables (such as term spreads). Second, fed funds futures are actually
traded securities, while the zero-coupon yield data used in Fama and Bliss (1987) and
many other papers are data constructed by interpolation schemes. While the predictabil-
ity patterns in this artificial data may not lead to profitable trading rules based on actual
securities, investors can implement our results directly by trading in fed funds futures.
Third, the Treasury and federal funds futures markets are potentially very diﬀerent mar-
kets with very diﬀerent participants, and the fact that we find similar patterns of pre-
dictable excess returns across the two markets is interesting in itself.1 Finally, fed funds
futures contracts have maturities of just a few months and may therefore be less risky
than Treasury notes and bonds, which have maturities of several years; moreover, the
holding periods relevant for measuring excess returns on fed funds futures are less than
one year, while the results for Treasuries typically assume that the investor holds the
securities for an entire year.2 Given the short maturities and required holding periods to
realize excess returns in the fed funds futures market, one might think that risk premia
in this market would be very small or nonexistent. We find that this is not the case.
    The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 measures excess returns
in federal funds futures, and shows that these excess returns have varied over time and
   1
     The largest participants in the fed funds futures market (and eurodollar futures and swaps markets)
are financial institutions looking to “lock in” funding at prespecified rates (to hedge their own commercial
and industrial loan portfolio, for example). The portfolios and hedging demands of these institutions are
potentially very diﬀerent from those of the largest participants in the Treasury bond markets: foreign
governments, state and local governments, insurance companies, and the like. See Stigum (1990) for
additional details on the Treasury and money markets.

     There are a few exceptions. For example, Stambaugh (1988) considers risk premia on Treasury bills
rather than Treasury notes and bonds.

can be predicted using business cycle indicators such as employment growth or financial
indicators such as Treasury yields or corporate bond spreads. Section 3 shows that these
excess returns were predictable in real time as well as ex post. Section 4 shows that
failing to adjust futures rates for risk can lead to substantial errors in forecasting the
future course of monetary policy, so that the predictability of excess returns is economi-
cally as well as statistically significant. Section 5 investigates whether time-varying risk
premia matter for futures-based measures of monetary policy shocks, and finds that some
measures perform better than others. Section 6 concludes. The Appendix investigates
the approximation accuracy of our return definition for futures.


2       Excess Returns on Federal Funds Futures
Federal funds futures contracts have traded on the Chicago Board of Trade exchange
since October 1988 and settle based on the average federal funds rate that prevails over a
                              (n)
given calendar month.3 Let ft denote the federal funds futures contract rate for month
t + n as quoted at the end of month t. We will refer to n = 1 as the one-month-ahead
futures contract, n = 2 as the two-month-ahead contract, and so on. Let rt+n denote
the ex post realized value of the federal funds rate for month t + n, calculated as the
average of the daily federal funds rates in month t + n for comparability to the federal
funds futures contracts.
                                                                                           (n)
    The buyer of a fed funds futures contract locks in the contracted rate ft for the
contract month t + n on a $5 million deposit. The contracts are cash-settled a few days
after expiration (with expiration occurring at the end of the contract month). At that
                                                                   (n)
time, the buyer receives $5 million times the diﬀerence between ft and the realized funds
rate rt+n converted to a monthly rate.4 As is standard for many futures contracts, there is
no up-front cost to either party of entering into the contract; both parties simply commit
to the contract rate and each posts a relatively small amount of securities as margin
collateral. Note that there is essentially no “alternative use of funds” or “opportunity
cost” for the collateral, since margin requirements are typically posted with interest-
bearing U.S. Treasury securities.
   We can therefore define the ex post realized excess return to the buyer of the futures
contract as
                                    (n)     (n)
                                 rxt+n = ft − rt+n .                                  (1)
Since we will consider futures contracts with maturities n ranging from 1 to 6 months,
the excess returns in (1) will correspond to diﬀerent holding periods for diﬀerent values of
n. To make excess returns on these diﬀerent contracts more directly comparable, we also
    3
      The average federal funds rate is calculated as the simple mean of the daily averages published by
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the federal funds rate on a non-business day is defined to
be the rate that prevailed on the preceding business day.
    4
      This means that ftn − rt+n gets multiplied by (number of days in month/360), since the quoting
convention in the spot fed funds and fed funds futures markets use a 360-day year. See the CBOT web
site for additional details.


                                                   4
report statistics for annualized excess returns, which are computed by multiplying the
excess returns in (1) by 12/n. Also, we measure returns in basis points. These conventions
will apply throughout the paper.
    Equation (1) represents a slight simplification, because it neglects that futures con-
tracts are “marked to market” every day. The appendix shows that the diﬀerence between
definition (1) and actual excess returns on futures contracts is extremely small and does
not matter for any of our results below. For simplicity, we therefore use equation (1)
as the definition of excess returns. The advantage of this simplification is that excess
returns are easily linked to forecasting. Under the expectations hypothesis, futures are
                                 (n)
expected future short rates: ft = Et (rt+n ) . Thus, equation (1) not only represents
excess returns, but also minus the forecast error under the expectations hypothesis. This
coincidence makes it easy to see how we can adjust futures-based forecasts for risk premia.


2.1     Constant Risk Premia

To check whether the average excess returns are zero, we run the regression
                                            (n)              (n)
                                         rxt+n = α(n) + εt+n                                           (2)

for diﬀerent contract horizons n.
    Table 1 presents results from regression (2) for the forecast horizons n = 1, . . . , 6
months over the entire sample period for which we have federal funds futures data:
October 1988 through December 2003. This period will be the baseline for all of our
regressions below. We run the regression at monthly frequency, sampling the futures data
on the last day of each month t.5 We compute standard errors using the heteroskedasticity
and autocorrelation consistent procedure described in Hodrick (1992), allowing for n − 1
lags of excess returns to be serially correlated due to contract overlap. Specifically, we use
standard errors (1A) from Hodrick (1992), which generalizes the Hansen-Hodrick (1988)
procedure to heteroskedastic disturbances. Throughout this paper, we report HAC t-
statistics based on these standard errors. To facilitate comparison across contracts with
diﬀerent maturities, we report annualized average excess returns in the bottom row of
the table.
    As can be seen in Table 1, average excess returns on fed funds futures have been
significantly positive over our sample, ranging from about 3.5 to 6 basis points per month
(41 to 73bp per year). For example, buying the 6-month-ahead fed fund futures contract
   5
     We restrict attention to monthly data in order to avoid variations in the maturity of the contracts
that would arise over the course of each month: for example, with daily data, the one-month ahead
contract could have as few as 28 and as many as 61 days until maturity, which is a significant variation
in the holding period required to realize the excess return on the contract. These diﬀerences in maturities
and holding periods determine the size and time variation of risk premia, as we will show below. Also,
these variations would translate into diﬀerent forecasting horizons when we later use our results to
forecast the funds rate. Nonetheless, our results are all similar when we sample the data at daily rather
than monthly frequency.


                                                    5
and holding it to maturity is a strategy that generated a return of 73.4bp per year on
average.6 Longer-horizon contracts have had greater excess returns even on a per-month
or per-year basis. The averages for the post-1994 period are a little lower but still
significantly positive at 32.3, 35.0, 38.2, 43.6, 49.4, and 56.5bp per year.

       each month. The regression equation is (2). α(n) is measured in basis points. HAC
       t-statistics are reported in parentheses.


2.2     Time-varying Risk Premia

Previous work using federal funds futures has generally stopped at this point, and pro-
ceeded under the assumption that expected excess returns on federal funds futures are
constant. However, in studies of long- and short-term Treasury securities, it has been
well-documented (Fama and Bliss 1987, Cochrane and Piazzesi 2002b) that excess re-
turns in Treasury markets are significantly time-varying and predictable. In particular,
expected excess returns on Treasuries are correlated with the business cycle: they are
high in economic recessions and low in expansions.
                                                       (4)
    Figure 1 graphs the realized excess return rxt+4 on the 4-month-ahead federal funds
futures contract from October 1988 through December 2003. Certainly, the time-variation
in these realized excess returns has been large, ranging from −315 to 413bp at an annual-
ized rate. The graph also suggests that there have been several periods during which fed
funds futures generated particularly large excess returns: the years 1991—2, early 1995,
the fall of 1998, and the years 2001—2 (these are also the periods during which the Federal
Reserve lowered interest rates). Two of these periods, 1991—2 and 2001—2, coincided with
the two recessions in our sample. The other two periods were not recessions, but were
also periods with slower economic growth.
   As a first step to understanding the predictability of excess returns of fed fund futures,
we therefore regress these excess returns on a constant and a recession dummy Dt :
                                    (n)                          (n)
                                  rxt+n = α(n) + β (n) Dt + εt+n                                 (3)
   6
    Note that these are not percentage excess returns, because the cost of purchasing the contract is
zero, as discussed previously. In other words, the unannualized excess return on the six-month-ahead
contract is, on average, $5 million times .367% times (number of days in contract month/360). The
annualized excess return is just double this amount (multiplying by 12/6).

The step function represents the fitted values from a regression of rxt+4 on a constant
and a recession dummy.


Figure 1 shows the fitted values from this regression (as a step function) together with
the realized excess returns. Table 2 shows that the recession dummy is significant for
all contracts with maturities longer than just 1 month. The estimated coeﬃcient on the
recession dummy suggests that excess returns are about 3 to 5 times higher in recessions
than they are on average during other periods. (Note that annualizing the excess returns
is a normalization that does not aﬀect the t-statistics or R2 in any of our regressions.)
   Of course, recession dummies are only rough indicators of economic growth and,
moreover, are not useful as predictive variables. The reason is that recessions are not
known in real time, since the NBER’s business cycle dating committee declares recession
peaks and troughs as long as 2 years after they have actually occurred. In other words,
recession dummies do not represent information that investors can condition on when
deciding about their portfolios. Figure 1 suggests, however, that any business cycle
indicator may be a good candidate for forecasting excess returns. In what follows, we
consider several business cycle indicators, including employment, Treasury yield spreads
and the corporate bond spread.

2.3     Employment

To investigate which variables forecast excess returns on fed funds futures, we run pre-
dictive regressions of the form:
                                       (n)                            (n)
                                    rxt+n = α(n) + β (n) Xt + εt+n ,                                     (4)

where Xt is a vector of variables known to financial markets in month t. Since GDP data
are only available at quarterly frequency, they do not provide a very useful variable for
forecasting monthly excess returns. We therefore turn to a closely related measure of real
activity: employment.
    More precisely, we use the year-on-year change in log nonfarm payrolls. Two data
issues arise if we wish to run the predictive regressions (4) with data that were available
to financial market participants in real time.7 First, nonfarm payroll numbers for a given
month are not released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics until the first Friday of the
following month. Thus, to perform the predictive regressions (4) with data that were
available at the end of month t, we must lag the employment numbers by an entire
month. Second, nonfarm payroll numbers are revised twice after their initial release and
undergo an annual benchmark revision every June, so the final vintage numbers are not
available for forecasting in real time. We therefore collected the real-time nonfarm payroll
numbers, and use the first release of nonfarm payrolls for month t − 1 and the revised
value for nonfarm payrolls for month t − 13 to compute the year-on-year change.8
   7
     In earlier versions of this paper, we performed the analysis with the most recent revised vintage of the
data, and our results were very similar: in particular, we found that employment growth predicted excess
returns with R2 values of 1, 7, 14, 20, 28 and 37%. The results are also similar if we use contemporaneous
rather than lagged nonfarm payrolls growth as a regressor.
   8
     Even the revised value for month t − 13 is not quite equal to the final vintage of data for that month,
because of some subsequent data revisions.

                                                     8
    Table 3 reports the forecasting results based on these real-time nonfarm payroll num-
bers, which were available to market participants as of the last day of month t. The
regression also includes the futures rate itself on the right-hand side. The results show
that employment growth is a significant predictor of excess returns for contracts with two
months or more to maturity. As we would expect from our results using the recession
dummy, excess returns and employment growth are inversely related. The estimated
slope coeﬃcients in Table 3 increase with the maturity of the contract and lie between
−0.17 and −0.71 for annualized returns.

     each month. The regression equation is (4), where Xt contains ft and nonfarm
     payroll employment growth ∆NFPt−1 from t − 13 to t − 1, computed using real-
     time vintage of data. ∆NFPt−1 is measured in basis points. HAC t-statistics are
     reported in parentheses.


   To understand the magnitude of these coeﬃcients, note that employment growth is
measured in basis points, which means that a 1 percentage point drop in employment
growth increases expected excess returns by about 17 to 71 basis points per year. Over our
sample, the mean and standard deviation of employment growth were 135 and 132 basis
points, respectively, which means that a one-standard deviation shock to employment
makes us expect around 94 bp more in annualized excess returns on the 6-month-ahead
                                                  (n)
futures contract. The own futures contract rate ft is also a significant predictor of excess
returns for contracts with 3 months to maturity or more, and the positive coeﬃcient
implies that, all else equal, excess returns are lower when the level of interest rates is
lower.
    The R2 in Table 3 suggest that we can predict up to 35% of the variation in excess
returns on fed funds futures with employment growth and the futures rate itself. This
result is remarkable, since these R2 are comparable in size to those reported in Cochrane

                                               9
and Piazzesi (2002b), who study excess returns on Treasuries over much longer holding
periods (one year, as compared to just one to six months for our fed funds futures
regressions above).
    Figure 2 shows that employment growth forecasts high excess returns not only in the
two recessions, but also in 1989, 1995 and 1998, and forecasts low excess returns in 1994
and 1999. The fit in the most recent recession would perhaps be more remarkable if not
for the terrorist attacks in September 2001, which led to a surprise period of high excess
returns on these contracts that was not directly related to the business cycle.

2.4    Yield Spreads and Corporate Spreads

In studies of long- and short-term Treasury markets, it has been well-documented (Fama
and Bliss 1987, Cochrane and Piazzesi 2002b) that expected excess returns on Treasury
securities can be forecasted with the Treasury yield curve. For example, Cochrane and Pi-
azzesi show that a simple tent-shaped function of 1 through 5-year forward rates explains
excess returns on holding long Treasuries securities for 1 year with an R2 of 35—40%. Of

                                            10
course, these findings are related to the fact that yields have been used as business cycle
indicators. For example, the Stock and Watson (1989) leading index is mainly based on
term spreads. A natural question is therefore whether yields also forecast excess returns
on fed funds futures.
    Table 4 reports results from predictions based on a set of yield spreads. We select four
diﬀerent term spreads based on diﬀerences of the 6 month Treasury bill rate and the 1, 2,
5, and 10 year zero-coupon Treasury yields.9 As can be seen in Table 4, there is significant
evidence that excess returns on federal funds futures contracts have been significantly
predictable with yield spreads for contracts with 3 months to maturity or more: R2 values
range from 8—22% for the longer horizon contracts and many t-statistics are well above
2. Although generally not statistically significant at the 5% level for shorter horizons, we
consistently estimate the same pattern of coeﬃcients for the shorter-horizon contracts
as for the longer-horizon contracts, with the magnitudes of the coeﬃcients increasing
monotonically with the horizon of the contract n (except for the n = 6 loading on the
2—1 year spread). This pattern is not just due to diﬀerences in holding periods, as these
results are obtained with annualized returns.

    We also considered other Treasuries and the own federal funds futures contract rate, but none of
these entered significantly. We also performed the analysis using 1 through 5-year forward rates, as in
Cochrane and Piazzesi (2002b), and got R2 values very similar to those in Table 4.

up by 500 bp to more clearly present both in the same graph). The yield spreads seem to
be most successful at capturing the rise in excess returns in 2001 and the runups in 1990
through 1992, suggesting that the estimated linear combination of yields may indeed
capture the relationship between excess returns and the business cycle.
    We also investigate whether another financial indicator of the business cycle, the
spread between 10-year BBB-rated corporate bonds and 10-year Treasuries, also helps
predict excess returns on fed funds futures. Results are reported in Table 5, and corrobo-
rate the hypothesis that measures of business cycle risk in general may be useful predictors
of excess returns in the fed funds futures market. The estimated coeﬃcients on the corpo-
rate bond spread in these regressions are significant for fed funds futures contracts with
two months or more to maturity, with R2 of 11—16% for the longer-horizon contracts.
The fitted values from this regression for the four-month-ahead contract (shifted down
by 500bp) are also plotted in Figure 3.
   To sum up, we find substantial evidence for time variation in expected excess returns
on fed funds futures. Surprisingly, the strongest evidence comes from conditioning on
employment growth–a macroeconomic variable–instead of lagged financial data. How-

ever, our sample is short, just 15 years, and so we have to treat this result with the
appropriate degree of caution.

2.5       One-Month Holding Period Returns

Our sample period only spans 15 years, which results in as few as 30 independent windows
for our longest-horizon (6-month-ahead) fed funds futures contracts. A way to reduce
this problem and check on the robustness of our results is to consider the excess returns
an investor would realize from holding an n-month-ahead federal funds futures contract
for just one month–by purchasing the contract and then selling it back as an (n − 1)-
month-ahead contract in one month’s time–rather than holding the contract all the
way through to maturity. By considering one-month holding period returns on fed funds
futures, we reduce potential problems of serial correlation and sample size for the longer-
horizon contracts, and give ourselves 182 completely independent windows of data (under
the null hypothesis of no predictability of excess returns) for all contracts.
      We thus consider regressions of the form:
                                   (n)      (n−1)                         (n)
                                  ft     − ft+1     = α(n) + β (n) Xt + εt+1                            (5)
           (n)                                                                                        (n−1)
where ft denotes the n-month-ahead contract rate on the last day of month t, ft+1
denotes the (n − 1)-month-ahead contract rate on the last day of month t + 1, and
the diﬀerence between these two rates is the ex post realized one-month holding period
return on the n-month-ahead contract.10 Using specification (5), the residuals are serially
uncorrelated under the null hypothesis of no predictability of excess returns, because all

      The investor’s realized monetary return on this transaction is $5 million times the diﬀerence in rates

variables in equation (5) are in financial markets’ information set by the end of month
t + 1.
    Table 6 presents the results of our previous analysis applied to this alternative specifi-
cation, where the regressors are the own contract rate and employment growth. Although
the R2 values are uniformly lower, as is to be expected from quasi-first-diﬀerencing the
left-hand side variable, our previous results are robust to this alternative specification.
Results for term spreads and corporate bond spreads are similarly robust across specifi-
cations (not presented to preserve space).

2.6     Eurodollar Futures

We also check whether our predictability results hold for eurodollar futures. Some ad-
vantages of considering eurodollar futures in addition to federal funds futures are that
eurodollar futures contracts are more liquid (they are currently the most actively traded
futures contracts in the world), eurodollar futures are available over a slightly longer
sample period (our data begin in March 1985), and eurodollar futures have maturities
that extend out to several years, providing an intermediate horizon between fed funds
futures and longer-dated Treasury securities.
    Eurodollar futures have traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange since 1981 and

ft − ft+1 times (number of days in contract month/360). Since these contracts are “marked to
market” essentially every day, the investor realizes the full monetary return to this transaction in month
t + 1; in particular, the investor does not need to wait until the contracts mature at the end of month
t + n to realize the return. As before, the opportunity cost of engaging in this transaction is negligible,
so the realized return is also the realized excess return.

and the ex post realized excess return to holding the n-quarter-ahead contract for one

otherwise identical to equation (3) for federal funds futures.

     The spot three-month London Interbank Oﬀered Rate for three-month time deposits of U.S. dollars
in London is collected and published daily by the British Bankers’ Association. The spot eurodollar
market is a very active one, thus these rates match three-month time deposit rates in the U.S. very
closely. The March, June, September, and December eurodollar futures contracts are by far the most
actively traded, with expiration on these contracts near the middle of those months. Contracts are
cash-settled a few days after expiration with the purchaser receiving $1 million times the diﬀerence
eftn − ert+n times (91/360). See the CME web site for additional details.

returns on eurodollar futures have averaged between 57 and 106 basis points per year
over our sample, 1985Q2 through 2003Q4. Excess returns for eurodollar futures also
display the same patterns of predictability as fed funds futures: Panel B shows that
nonfarm payroll employment growth is statistically significant at all horizons, with R2
values ranging from 24 to 42%. (Note that in these regressions, ∆NFPt−1 refers to year-
on-year employment growth lagged one month rather than one quarter, as this data was
available to financial market participants in real time.)
    Results for Treasury yield spreads and corporate bond spreads (not reported) are also
significant and similar to those for fed funds futures, and all of these results are robust
to considering one-quarter holding periods for eurodollar futures rather than holding the
contracts all the way through to maturity.
   These results show that, if anything, risk premia are even more important for eu-
rodollar futures than what we have estimated for federal funds futures.


3     Predictability of Excess Returns in Real Time
We have documented that excess returns on federal funds futures were predictable by
business-cycle indicators such as employment growth, Treasury yield spreads, or corpo-
rate bond spreads. To what extent could an investor have predicted these returns in real
time? To answer this question, we perform a set of rolling “out-of-sample” regressions.
To see whether market participants may have based their investment strategies on sim-
ilar forecasts, we also provide some intriguing historical evidence on actual positions of
traders in the fed funds and eurodollar futures markets.


3.1    Rolling Endpoint Regressions

Figure 4 shows real-time forecasts together with full-sample forecasts from Table 2 based
on employment growth and the own futures contract rate. The real-time forecasts for
month t + 1 are constructed by estimating the slope coeﬃcients with data from October
1988 up through what was available at the end of the current month t. Figure 4 graphs
these forecasts starting in October 1990, when we have only 24 months of data to estimate
three parameters. The graph suggests that the real-time fitted values are quite close to the
full-sample fitted values over most of the sample–indeed, the two series are essentially
identical from the beginning of 1994 onward. The middle and lower panels in Figure
4 show the rolling estimates of the slope coeﬃcients together with their full sample
counterparts (the horizontal black line), and again suggest that the rolling point estimates
have largely converged to their full-sample values by 1994.

3.2    Data on Market Participants’ Long and Short Positions

The previous section shows that excess returns on fed funds and eurodollar futures were
potentially predictable to investors in real time using rolling regressions. In this section,
we present some evidence indicating that informed investors at the time actually did
correctly forecast the excess returns that were subsequently realized.
    The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) requires all individuals
or institutions with positions above a certain size to report their positions to the CFTC
each week, and the extent to which each position is hedged. In the eurodollar (fed funds)
futures markets, about 90% (95%) of open interest is held by individuals or institutions
that must report to the CFTC as a result of this requirement. The CFTC reports the
aggregates of these data with a three-day lag, broken down into hedging and non-hedging
categories and into long and short positions, in the weekly Commitments of Traders report
available on the CFTC’s web site.

Figure 5: The upper panel shows net positions in eurodollar futures. The lower panel
shows long and short positions separately.


    The lower panel in Figure 5 plots the percentage of long and short open interest in eu-
rodollar futures held by noncommercial market participants–those market participants
that are classified by the CFTC as not hedging oﬀsetting positions that arise out of their
normal (non-futures related) business operations.12 The number of open long positions
in these contracts held by noncommercial market participants (as a percentage of total
reportable open interest) is plotted in the bottom panel in black, and the number of open
short positions (as a percentage of reportable open interest) held by these participants
is plotted in gray (green in color). Analogous data are available for fed funds futures,
but we focus on eurodollar futures positions here as this market is thicker and contracts
run oﬀ less frequently–only once per quarter rather than every month–which reduces
some high-frequency variation in the percentage long and short series.13 The patterns
in federal funds futures noncommercial holdings look very similar, albeit noisier for the
reasons just cited. The upper panel of Figure 5 plots the diﬀerence between the non-
commercial percentage long and short series as the “net long position” of noncommercial
market participants.
  12
     The primary example of a commercial participant in the fed funds or eurodollar futures market
would be a financial institution seeking to hedge its commercial and industrial loan portfolio.
  13
     Open interest is almost always highest in the front-month or front-quarter contract, so the running
oﬀ of these contracts can create jumps.

                                                  18
    Just from eyeballing the figure, we can see that net positions forecast subsequent
excess returns in both the fed funds futures and eurodollar futures markets: noncom-
mercial market participants began taking on a huge net long position in late 2000, only
a few months before excess returns in these contracts began to soar. Noncommercial
market participants also took on substantial net long positions from mid-1990 through
mid-1991 and in late 1995, again correctly forecasting excess returns over these periods,
and noncommercial participants took on a very substantial net short position in late 1993
through mid-1994, correctly anticipating the strongly negative excess returns that were
realized when the Fed began tightening in 1994.
   Regression analysis (not reported) confirms that this variable is highly significant as
a predictor of excess returns in the fed funds futures market at horizons of 3 months or
more (and in the eurodollar futures markets at all horizons), with R2 values ranging from
7—21% (8—40% for eurodollar futures). Interestingly, the statistical significance of the net
long position variable disappears if we include any of employment growth, term spreads,
or corporate risk spreads in the regression, suggesting that the information content of
noncommercial market participants’ net long position is spanned by the business cycle
indicators we considered earlier.
    The obvious interpretation of these findings is that noncommercial market partici-
pants at the time were well aware of the upcoming excess returns on these contracts
and positioned themselves accordingly, at the expense of those engaged in hedging other
financial activities. The hedgers–commercial firms–essentially paid an insurance pre-
mium to noncommercial participants for providing hedging services. There are two main
explanations for why these premia were not “competed away.” First, the futures mar-
ket may not be perfectly competitive, with barriers to entry and noncommercial market
participants facing limits on the size of the positions that they may take; commercial
participants with hedging demand thus do not face a perfectly elastic supply curve for
either the long or short side of these futures contracts. Second, noncommercial market
participants may themselves be risk averse. For example, futures traders in these markets
may be most averse to taking on risky positions precisely when their own jobs are most in
jeopardy, around the times of depressed aggregate economic activity. The hypothesis that
excess returns in these markets would be competed away requires both an assumption of
perfectly competitive futures markets and of risk-neutral market participants–both of
these assumptions are suspect and may not apply.


4    Risk-Adjusted Monetary Policy Expectations
How misleading would it be to ignore risk premia on fed funds and eurodollar futures–or
to allow for constant risk premia but to ignore the time-variation in these premia–and
treat the unadjusted (or constant risk-adjusted) prices of these securities as measures
of monetary policy expectations? Using futures, the forecast errors are just minus the
excess returns on the fed funds futures contract:
                                           (n)        (n)
                                   rt+n − ft     = −rxt+n                               (6)

                                               19
To the extent that excess returns on fed funds and eurodollar futures are forecastable,
we are making systematic forecast errors when we use unadjusted futures forecasts.
   However, we can risk-adjust these forecasts using our previous results. To do that, we
take expectations of both sides of equation (4) and solve for the expected n-month-ahead
federal funds rate:                           ¡              ¢
                                          (n)
                            Et [rt+n ] = ft − α(n) + β (n) Xt .                       (7)
From Tables 1 and 7, we know that the expected excess return, α(n) +β (n) Xt , is on average
positive. This suggests that risk-adjusted forecasts lie on average below the futures rate.
Moreover, Tables 3 and 7 show that expected excess returns are countercyclical. This
suggests that risk-adjusted forecasts subtract a countercyclical term from the futures rate
or, equivalently, add a procyclical term to the futures rate: risk-adjusted forecasts will
tend to lie above the unadjusted futures rate in booms and below the futures rate in
recessions.
    These features of our risk-adjustment are illustrated in Figure 6, which plots forecasts
of the federal funds rate out to a horizon of 12 months on two diﬀerent dates: December
1993 and December 2000. We plot a number of alternative forecasts based on federal
funds and eurodollar futures rates:

   1. Unadjusted futures: α(n) = 0 and β (n) = 0.

   2. Constant-adjusted futures: rolling OLS estimate of α(n) , with β (n) = 0 imposed, as
      in Table 1 for fed funds futures and Table 7 for eurodollar futures.

   3. Rule-of-thumb-adjusted futures: a constant risk adjustment of 1 bp/month, which
      is a rule of thumb currently used by staﬀ at the Federal Reserve Board at the short
      end of the yield curve,14 so α(n) = n and β (n) = 0. For eurodollar futures, the rule
      of thumb is 13bp plus 3bp/quarter: α(n) = 3n + 13 and β (n) = 0.

   4. Risk-adjusted futures: rolling OLS estimates of α(n) and β (n) , where Xt includes
                             (n)
      the own futures rate ft and NFP growth ∆NFPt−1 , as in Table 3 for fed funds
      futures and Table 7 for eurodollar futures.

    Note that unadjusted futures forecasts will always be higher than forecasts adjusted by
a constant, because the estimated coeﬃcients α(n) from Tables 1 and 7 are positive. The
rule-of-thumb adjusted futures end up somewhere between these two forecasts, because
the estimated α(n) in Table 1 adjusts forecasts by roughly 5.4 bp per month, while the
rule-of-thumb forecast adjusts fed funds futures by only 1 bp/month (5.4 bp/month is
the coeﬃcient we get when we regress α(n) on the month n).
  14
     In private communication, Donald L. Kohn mentioned that staﬀ at the Federal Reserve Board came
up with this adjustment factor informed by their reading of the historical data on ex post errors in the
fed funds and eurodollar futures markets and in interest-rate surveys. Although this adjustment factor is
currently 1bp/month at the short end, it has not always been that and would change as events warrant.

Figure 6: Federal funds rate forecasts on two illustrative dates, and subsequent real-
ized funds rate. Funds rate forecasts are constructed from unadjusted and risk-adjusted
futures rates, and using three diﬀerent risk adjustments: an estimated constant adjust-
ment, a rule-of-thumb constant adjustment, and a time-varying risk adjustment based
on employment growth.


    The graphs suggest that in times when the funds rate is expected to rise–such as
December 1993–the higher, unadjusted futures do better than forecasts adjusted by
a constant. However, the lower, constant-adjusted futures do better in times when the
funds rate is expected to fall, such as December 2000. The rule-of-thumb-adjusted futures
do better on dates (not shown in the figure) when the direction of the interest rate
development is not as clear. But this is exactly the mechanism exploited by our time-
varying risk adjustment: in December 1993, our risk-adjusted futures forecast (the blue
x-line) is closer to the unadjusted futures forecast, while in December 2000, the blue
x-line is closer to the constant risk-adjusted futures forecast. In other periods, the risk
adjustment makes forecasts lie somewhere in between the two, similar to the rule-of-
thumb-adjusted futures forecast.
    Instead of varying the forecasting horizon for a given date, we can also fix the fore-

justed futures, rt+4 − ft , and with risk-adjusted futures. (To focus attention on the
systematic patterns in the figure rather than the high-frequency variation, we smooth
the errors with a 6-month moving average.) The 1991 and 2001 recessions are both char-
acterized by negative unadjusted forecast errors. The risk-adjustment improves upon
these forecasts by adjusting the raw futures rate downward in both episodes.
    Figures 6 and 7 suggest that unadjusted futures rates, or futures adjusted by a con-
stant, can be wrong over long periods of time. The forecast errors tend to be negative
during periods of falling rates and positive during periods of rate hikes. The forecast
errors are largest when the funds rate changes direction, and keep being large for sub-
stantial amounts of time. The reason is that unadjusted or constant-adjusted futures
rates only slowly adapt to changes in direction. As a result, these forecasts tend to lag
behind actual market expectations around economic turning points; they generate forecast
errors that are more autocorrelated than forecast errors from risk-adjusted futures.
    To see this point more clearly, Table 8 reports some summary statistics on forecast
errors. We compute forecast errors from futures-based forecasts and also from an AR(1)
as a benchmark.15 We compute forecasts for the n-month-ahead federal funds rate as it

      We also considered forecasts from a random walk. The resulting forecasts, however, were consistently

would have been made at time t, using real-time data and rolling endpoint regressions.
For example, when we compute forecasts for rt+n using the AR(1) benchmark, we estimate
the autoregressive parameters with data on the average funds rate up to time t and then
use the current rate rt as conditioning variable. Similarly, we use our rolling “out-of-
sample” forecasts for risk premia based on nonfarm payrolls to make our risk adjustments.
The forecast errors are computed over the October 1990 to December 2003 period, so
that we have two years of data to estimate the parameters for the October 1990 forecast.

      Note: n is the forecasting horizon, in months for fed funds futures and quarters
      for eurodollar futures. ME is the mean error (in basis points), SE is the root-mean-
      squared error (in bp), and ρn is the nth autocorrelation of the forecast error.


   Table 8 reports mean forecast errors (ME), root-mean-squared-errors (SE), and the
nth autocorrelation (ρn ) for the n-month-ahead forecast. (Note that even for eﬃcient n-
month-ahead forecasts, the forecast errors will have MA(n−1) autocorrelation because of
outperformed by the AR(1), so we did not include them in Table 8. Another alterative are Taylor-rule
forecasts. For forecasts up to 3 months ahead, Evans (1998) documents that they tend to be dominated
by forecasts based on (unadjusted) futures.


                                                  23
overlap; Table 8 therefore reports the nth autocorrelation which, ideally, should be zero.)
The last column of Table 8 shows that risk-adjusted futures still made autocorrelated
forecast errors over our sample, but the autocorrelation is much smaller than for any other
forecast in the table. This is especially true for longer forecasting horizons. Moreover,
risk-adjusted futures generate smaller average errors and lower squared errors.
    Interestingly, Panel A makes a strong case for fed funds futures in general, even on a
risk-unadjusted basis. The futures-based forecasts produce lower root-mean-squared er-
rors than an AR(1). However, unadjusted futures made large, negative errors on average
which range from −4 to −37 basis points. The rule-of-thumb-adjusted futures improve
upon this: average forecast errors are lower by exactly the amount of the adjustment, and
the adjustment also lowers squared errors. However, this adjustment only represents a
small improvement over unadjusted forecasts. The risk-adjusted forecasts we estimate in
this paper generate forecast errors that are always smaller on average and almost always
smaller in root-mean-square terms, especially for longer forecasting horizons. Panel B
confirms these findings for longer-horizon forecasts using eurodollar futures. Again, risk-
adjusted futures do much better than unadjusted futures or the rule-of-thumb-adjusted
futures.


5      Monetary Policy Shocks
Federal funds futures have been used by a number of recent authors to separate systematic
changes in monetary policy from monetary policy “shocks”.16 The idea is to use fed
funds futures market forecast errors as measures of exogenous, unforecastable changes in
the stance of monetary policy.17 The fed funds futures market expectation is measured
assuming the expectations hypothesis. Since we have shown in the previous section that
futures rates should be adjusted for time-varying risk premia, we now investigate whether
these risk premia also matter for the definition of monetary policy shocks.
    Computing the futures market’s forecast error of the next policy move is less straight-
forward than it may seem, because of some institutional features of the federal funds
market. For example, the futures contract settles based on the average funds rate during
the contract month, and not on the value of the funds rate on a particular date, such
as the day following an FOMC meeting. Moreover, the Fed sets a target for the funds
rate, but does not completely control the funds rate itself, and the diﬀerence between the
actual funds rate and the target can be nonnegligible, even for monthly averages. In the
  16
      We cite these in the Introduction. All of the studies treat the federal funds rate as the monetary
policy instrument, as in Bernanke and Blinder (1992), and attempt to improve upon the earlier, VAR-
based identification of monetary policy shocks surveyed in Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (1999).
   17
      Faust, Swanson, and Wright (2004) describe the procedure in detail and test many of the required
assumptions. Alternatively, Piazzesi (2004) and Cochrane and Piazzesi (2002a) measure market expecta-
tions from high-frequency data on short-term interest rates instead of fed funds futures. Piazzesi (2004)
computes Et [rt+1 ] from an arbitrage-free model of the term structure of interest rates. Cochrane and
Piazzesi (2002a) use the change in the 1-month eurodollar rate and unrestricted regressions of rt+1 on a
set of interest rates.


                                                   24
literature, these complications have led to alternative approaches on how policy shocks
are computed from futures rates.
    Here, we consider three approaches that have been used in the literature. First,
Rudebusch (1998) defines the monetary policy shock as the diﬀerence between the real-
ized federal funds rate target and the expected federal funds rate derived from fed funds
futures. While this might seem to be the most natural definition of the market’s forecast
error, it can suﬀer from the technical issues described above (that can cause the market
expectation of the future realized funds rate to diﬀer from the market expectation of
the future target rate). Moreover, the shocks will be contaminated by risk premia in
the futures contract even if those risk premia are constant. The second definition of
monetary policy shocks we consider, used by Kuttner (2001) and Faust, Swanson, and
Wright (2004), diﬀerences out both the technical factors in the federal funds market and
any constant risk premia by using the change in the current-month or one-month-ahead
federal funds futures contract rate on the day of an FOMC announcement. This approach
uses daily fed funds futures data to make the interval [t, t + 1] around the FOMC an-
nouncement small and assumes that risk premia do not change over this small interval.18
Finally, we consider a third definition of monetary policy shock proposed by Rigobon
and Sack (2002) that uses the change in the current-quarter eurodollar futures contract
on the day of the FOMC announcement rather than the change in the current-month
fed funds futures contract. This measure is identical in concept to our second monetary
policy shock measure, but uses the longer horizon of eurodollar futures contracts to try
to reduce the influence of “timing” surprises in the setting of monetary policy (monetary
policy actions that were only a surprise to the extent that they occurred at one FOMC
meeting rather than the next, say). Of course, a potential disadvantage of considering a
longer forecast horizon is that risk premia may be more of an issue.
    We compute these three measures of monetary policy shocks over the sample period
1994 to 2003, when the Federal Reserve was explicitly announcing changes in its target
for the federal funds rate. We include every FOMC meeting and every intermeeting
policy move by the FOMC over this sample. Table 9 reports summary statistics for all
three measures of policy shocks. From Panel A it is apparent that the first measure of
monetary policy shocks, labeled “actual−futures”, is larger and more volatile than the
other two: the mean, standard deviation, and extremes of the shocks are all the largest
of the three shock series. Our second measure of monetary policy shocks (based on the
change in fed funds futures) is the least volatile of the three, and our third measure, based
on eurodollar futures, lies somewhere in between. The three shocks series do generally
agree on the days of large monetary policy shocks, however–for example, the min and
max of the three series all occur on the same day.
    We perform a basic risk-adjustment of the three monetary policy shock series by
regressing them on a set of conditioning variables that were known to financial markets
right before the FOMC announcement–for this exercise, we pick Treasury yields as the
  18
     This assumption is at least loosely consistent with the finding by Evans and Marshall (1998) that
risk premia in Treasuries are not aﬀected much by monetary policy shocks, which tend to occur at FOMC
meetings.


                                                 25
regressors (as in Table 5), because we have high-frequency data on these yields.19 Under
the expectations hypothesis, each of the three monetary policy shock measures should
be unpredictable on the basis of these conditioning variables.

    Results for each of these three regressions are summarized in Panel B of Table 9,
which reports the t-statistics, regression R2 , and p-value for the exclusion F-test that all
of the coeﬃcients and the constant term in each regression are jointly equal to zero. As
can be seen from the exclusion tests, our first measure of monetary policy shocks (the
realized target rate minus the futures market expectation) is significantly predictable,
suggesting that risk premia may be a significant problem for that measure. By contrast,
our second and third policy shock measures (based on changes in futures rates) seem to
do much better, with the “change in FF futures” shocks being the cleanest of the three.
Although the R2 for the “actual−futures” shock regression is not much larger than for
the other two, this is probably due to the first shock measure also being substantially
more volatile than the other two (as noted in Panel A of the table).
   Panel A of Table 9 also reports basic statistics for our estimated risk adjustments to
each of the three monetary policy shock series. The risk adjustments for the “actual−
futures” shock has a standard deviation of 3.4bp, which seems substantial relative to the
  19
    We reestimate the regression coeﬃcients for the monetary policy shock series, because risk premia
depend on the maturity of the contract and FOMC meetings are typically not scheduled for the end of
the month. The current-month or 1-month ahead fed funds futures contract therefore has a diﬀerent
maturity on FOMC meeting dates than the same contract in Table 5. Moreover, the nature of the risk
associated with monetary policy shocks (and therefore the risk premia associated with these shocks)
may have changed after 1994, when the Fed started announcing its policy moves at FOMC meetings, as
argued in Piazzesi (2004).


                                                 26
standard deviation of the shock series itself of 11.9bp. The risk adjustment ranges from
−13.2 to 5bp over our sample, which again seems substantial compared to −44 to 17bp
for the shock series itself. By contrast, the estimated risk adjustments to our second
and third measures of monetary policy shocks seem to be smaller (as well as statistically
insignificant), with the risk adjustments to the “change in FF futures” shock measure
being the smallest of the three.
    While Table 9 suggests that risk adjustments to these series may be important, par-
ticularly for our first measure of policy shocks, our sample is too short to investigate
the importance of these diﬀerences for the impulse responses of macro variables. For
example, the reaction of employment to monetary policy shocks peaks after 2 years, and
we have only 10 years of data. The estimated impulse responses based on diﬀerent policy
shocks have confidence bounds that have a hard time staying away from zero, let alone
from each other. It will be interesting, however, to come back to this issue in the future,
when we have more data.


6    Conclusions
We document substantial and predictable time-variation in excess returns on federal funds
futures. We show that excess returns on these contracts are strongly countercyclical and
can be predicted with R2 of up to 35% using real-time business cycle indicators such
as employment growth, Treasury yield spreads, or corporate bond spreads. We also
present evidence that suggests that noncommercial market participants were net buyers
of these contracts in times of high expected excess returns, and net sellers in times of
low or negative expected excess returns. These time-varying premia have important
consequences for computing market expectations from fed funds futures. For example,
we find that ignoring these premia leads to larger forecast errors, both on average and in
the root-mean-squared sense. Moreover, unadjusted futures make forecast errors that are
more autocorrelated, because unadjusted futures-based forecasts lag behind risk-adjusted
forecasts around economic turning points. Finally, we show that measures of monetary
policy shocks based on the realized funds rate target minus the ex ante unadjusted fed
funds futures rate are significantly contaminated by risk premia. Instead, a measure of
monetary policy shocks based on the one-day change in fed funds futures around FOMC
announcements seems to be more robust, perhaps because it “diﬀerences out” risk premia
that are moving primarily at lower, business-cycle frequencies.

Appendix: Marking to Market
Actual excess returns on fed funds futures contracts are not exactly equal to (1), because
futures contracts are “marked to market” every day. This means that the two parties
to a fed funds futures contract must post (or may withdraw) collateral every day as the
contract is marked to the market price that day. The party that receives (pays) collateral
then receives (pays) interest on this collateral at the overnight interest rate all the way
through to contract settlement.

Figure 8: Each panel plots the actual annualized excess returns on the n-month ahead
federal funds futures contract as black line and our return definition (1) as gray line
(green in color).


   The definition of ex post realized excess returns on the n-month-ahead fed funds
futures contract, including the eﬀects of marking to market every day over the life of the
contract, is thus:
                                    (n)
                                             XT
                                                    (n)  T
                              rxmmt+n = −       ∆ft,d · Rt,d                           (8)
                                                d=1

where d indexes days from the last day of month t to the day T the contract expires (the
                                (n)
last day of month t + n), ∆ft,d is the one-day change in the contract rate on day d, and
       Q
  T
Rt,d ≡ Ti=d (1 + ort,i ), where ort,i is the risk-free overnight interest rate on day i after the
end of month t. For the risk-free overnight interest rate, we used the rate on overnight

                                               28
repurchase agreements for U.S. Treasury securities, which is less risky, less volatile and
less aﬀected by calendar days (such as settlement Wednesdays) than the overnight federal
funds rate.
    Figure 8 compares the more exact definition of excess returns (8) to our baseline
approximation (1). Throughout the figure, approximation (1) is plotted as the black line
and excess returns including the eﬀects of marking to market (8) is plotted as the gray
line. In fact, it is very diﬃcult to distinguish between the two lines for any of the contract
horizons that we consider, which shows that our approximation (1) to excess returns is
extremely good.
   As a final check, we re-estimate our main equations with actual returns. We can
see that the results in Panels A and B of Table A1 are almost identical to those in
Tables 1 and 3, respectively. This comparison confirms that the approximation (1) works
extremely well.

      Note: The sample is 1988:10-2003:12. The observations are from the last day of
      each month. The regression equations are those from Tables 1 and 3, but now
      returns are defined by equation (8). HAC t-statistics are reported in parentheses.
