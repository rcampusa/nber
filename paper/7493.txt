Identification through Heteroskedasticity: Measuring “Contagion” between
Argentinean and Mexican Sovereign Bonds
Roberto Rigobon
NBER Working Paper No. 7493
January 2000
JEL No.C30, F32, C10

                                              ABSTRACT

        In this paper, I develop a new identificationmethod to solve the problem of simultaneous equations,
based on heteroskedasticity of the structural shocks. I show that if the heteroskedasticity can be described
as a two-regime process, then the system is just identified under relatively weak conditions. Identification
is also discussed under more than two regimes, when the residuals exhibit ARCH behavior, and when there
are aggregate shocks.
        This methodology is applied to measure contagion across sovereign bonds between Argentina and
Mexico. The estimates of the simultaneous parameters are relatively to different definitions of the regimes.
