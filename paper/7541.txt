                                           ABSTRACT

       Malaria ranks among the foremost health issues facing tropical countries. In this paper, we
explore the determinants of cross-country differences in malaria morbidity, and examine the linkage
between malaria and economic growth.
       Using a classification rule analysis, we confirm the dominant role of climate in accounting
for cross-country differences in malaria morbidity. The data, however, do not suggest that tropical
location is destiny: controlling for climate, we find that access to rural healthcare and income
equality influence malaria morbidity.
       In a cross-section growth framework, we find a significant negative association between
higher malaria morbidity and the growth rate of GDP per capita which is robust to a number of
modifications, including controlling for reverse causation. The estimated absolute growth impact of
malaria differs sharply across countries; it exceeds a quarter percent per annum in a quarter of the
sample countries. Most of these are located in Sub-Saharan Africa (with an estimated average annual
growth reduction of 0.55 percent).

1. Introduction


        Malaria ranks among the major health and development challenges facing some
of the poorest economies.2 Endemic in ninety-one countries, accounting for forty percent
of the world’s population, malaria affects an estimated three hundred million people.
Though in most cases treatable, malaria is responsible for more than a million deaths per
year. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the most affected region, malaria related illnesses claim the
life of one out of every twenty children below age five. For adults, mortality rates are
lower but frequent debilitating attacks reduce the quality of life for chronic sufferers.


        The human and economic costs of malaria have been recognized for centuries.
The unraveling of the transmission mechanism in the late 19th century opened the way
towards systematic anti-malarial efforts. Initially, these efforts focussed on controlling
the population of anopheles mosquitoes transmitting the parasite. DDT based eradication
programs achieved notable successes in countries with relatively low malaria incidence in
the Mediterranean and in some Asian countries, but largely failed in high-incidence
regions, notably in Sub-Saharan Africa, and were largely abandoned in the late 1960s.
During the last decades, anti-malaria efforts have focussed primarily on reducing human
exposure for given anopheles populations, primarily through the use of bednets and
protective clothing, on reducing the health effects of malaria episodes, and more recently,
on developing an effective vaccine.



        The partial success of the eradication programs resulted in a sharp spatial
concentration of malaria in tropical areas. The same areas also suffer most from a set
other illnesses related to the economic development stage [Sachs (1997, 1999), Gallup



2
  The debate on the development effects of malaria reaches back to the early part of this century. Ross
(1911), Carter (1919), Sinton (1935/36) and Macdonald (1950) are among the classic studies. Recent
studies include Conley (1975), Aron and Davis (1993), Gomes (1993), Hammer (1993), Mills (1993),
Chima and Mills (1998), Gallup and Sachs (1998), Gallup, Sachs and Mellinger (1998) and Goodman,
Coleman and Mills (1998).



                                                                                                     3
and Sachs (1998a,b)], including intestinal diseases causes by contaminated water and
communicable diseases such as tuberculosis.


       Morbidity and mortality rates for this last group of diseases are strongly linked to
income per capita levels. The link is bi-directional: impaired public health restrains
economic development, while economic development, by increasing access to clean
water and sanitation and by improving housing conditions, reduces the morbidity rates
for these diseases [Gallup, Sachs and Mellinger (1998)].

       As a primarily rural parasitic disease transmitted by mosquito bites, malaria is less
immediately affected by improved urban sanitation and housing in the course of
economic development; indeed, after the failure of the eradication efforts, malaria has at
times been portrayed as a largely unavoidable side effect of tropical location. The
sizeable differences in malaria morbidity between countries with few geographic
differences suggest, however, that location is not entirely destiny.




                                                                                            4
         Economic development may influence malaria morbidity by providing households
with the means to invest in anti-malaria protection --- notably insecticide-impregnated
bednets and protective clothing ---- and in full medical treatment cycles. Furthermore,
governmental capacity to provide comprehensive access to rural healthcare and to engage
in local mosquito control arguably increases with economic development. To the degree
that these channels are operative, malaria is as closely intertwined with development as
the other tropical diseases most prevalent at early economic development stages.


         The core of this paper is devoted to the empirical analysis of these linkages. Our
paper builds on a sizeable prior literature examining the incidence and economic cost of
malaria, primarily with a household or site focus. The household/site-specific approach
provides an intuitive and attractive cost-assessment methodology based on high quality
local data. By construction, it is, however, less suited for exploring other relevant
questions, including the impact of macro policy variables on malaria morbidity across
countries, and the importance of indirect effects of malaria on total factor productivity.
These issues, more readily addressed in a cross-country comparative framework, are the
focus of the present paper.


         Based on morbidity data for a large group of countries in three five-year periods,
we examine two issues. We begin by exploring the cross country differences in malaria
morbidity rates to ask whether such differences are adequately explained by climate
differences (the “location as destiny” view), or whether economic variables such as
income distribution and health care availability provide important additional explanatory
power.


         We then turn to the effect of malaria on economic growth in a standard cross-
section growth framework. The cross-section methodology allows us to explore not only
the net effect of malaria on growth, but to also shed some light on the transmission
channels. Adding a malaria variable to a standard growth equation allows the
identification of any residual effect on productivity. Such effects may arise from a variety
of sources, including the effect of repeated worker absences on production patterns and



                                                                                          5
specialization, malaria-prevention motivated reductions in internal and external labor
mobility, and the potential loss of investment projects in tourism and infrastructure.3


         Our approach to the second question is most closely linked to a series of papers
exploring the link between geography, economic development and diseases by Bloom
and Sachs (1998), Gallup, Sachs and Mellinger (1998), and Gallup and Sachs (1998). The
papers employ a malaria exposure index, defined as the product of the land area subject
to malaria and the fraction of malaria cases attributable to the most serious malaria
variant, to explore the growth and income effect of malaria in a cross country regression
framework. Gallup, Sachs and Mellinger (1998) detect both a significant negative
correlation between the 1994 malaria exposure index and the 1995 (log) income per
capita level, and a significant positive association between declines in malaria exposure
between 19664 and 1994 and the 1965 to 1990 per capita growth rate. Gallup and Sachs
(1998) put the negative growth effect of malaria at more than one percentage point a
year.5


         We extend this research in three directions, elaborated below. First, we use a
panel data-set on malaria morbidity rather than exposure as our malaria measure. Second,
we formally explore whether, controlling for climate, other variables principally
susceptible to intervention are useful in determining differences in malaria morbidity
between countries sharing the same climate characteristics.6 Third, we explicitly
distinguish between the effects of malaria on total factor productivity and indirect effects



3
  Many of these effects involve hypothetical alternative histories; their empirical importance is very hard to
establish. Examples abound, though, ranging from the perceived need to combat malaria as a pre-requisite
for the construction of the Panama Canal to the positive effect of malaria eradication on Mediterranean
tourism.
4
  The fraction of falciporum cases in total cases is available only for 1990. Under the assumption that the
fraction is time invariant, malaria maps for 1966 and 1994 are digitized to derive the land share and create
exposure indices for 1966 and 1994.
5
  For the exposure index to fall to zero, it must either be the case that the population of parasite carrying
mosquitoes drops to zero, or that the fraction of the most serious parasite among all cases drops to zero.
Our estimates, reported below, instead define the counterfactual as zero malaria morbidity, regardless of the
malaria variety.

investment.


        The remainder of the paper divides into five sections. We continue with a brief
summary of the transmission mechanism and of the effects of malaria. We then describe
the data before turning to classification rule analysis to examine the relative incidence of
malaria across countries as a function of spatial, climatic and social factors. In section
five we examine the direct and indirect effect of malaria on growth. Section six
concludes.


2. Background7


        Malaria is a parasitic disease transmitted by anopheles mosquitoes. The human
malaria exposure rate determined by the fraction of the mosquito population carrying the
parasite8; the life-expectancy of the mosquito relative to the parasite’s incubation period,
the use of night-time protection, in particular bednets (most mosquito- bites occur
between sunset and sunrise); the location of human populations relative to mosquito
breeding grounds (the mosquito flight range is limited to about 2 miles) and temperature.9
The interplay of these factors results in significant cross-country differences in human
exposure rate: estimates suggest that the number of infective bites per person per year
ranges from zero in non-tropical areas to the low single digits in sub-tropic areas, and to
between forty and more than a hundred bites in some tropical areas. For a variety of
reasons, including climate and the spatial distribution of parasite and anopheles species,
Sub-Saharan Africa suffers the highest exposure rates, followed by parts of Asia and
Latin America.

  Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium vivax. Plasmodium
falciparum is associated with the most serious effects.

  At temperatures below 22 degrees Celsius, the ratio of the parasite’s incubation period relative to the
expected mosquito lifetime increases rapidly. At 18 degrees Celsius, the incubation period, at 55 days,
exceeds the lifespan of 99.7% of a mosquito cohort (Snow et al. (1999)).


                                                                                                       7
           Over time, the human immune system adjusts to combating the malaria parasite.
Adult mortality in endemic areas is hence fairly low, malaria mortality is concentrated
among children between the age of six months and five years (the age at which the
immunity inherited from the mother wanes and at the age at which children develop their
own immunity), among travelers and migrants from non-malarial into malarial regions,
among populations in previously non-malarial regions undergoing climatic change, and
among populations with repressed immune system, including pregnant women and
individuals suffering from HIV.


           A typical bout of malaria lasts from about ten to fourteen days10, with four to six
days of near complete incapacitation, and recuperation periods of four to eight days
characterized by fatigues and weakness. Mild malaria is characterized by one or two
episodes of malarial fever per year, coupled with headache, nausea, fatigue and diarrhea,
with relatively few side effects between episodes. Severe malaria, primarily in
Plasmodium falciporum infections most prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa, results in
impaired consciousness, weakness and jaundice, and accounts for most fatal cases.


           Anti-malaria efforts have been four-pronged, targeting the reduction of the
mosquito population, the minimization of the number of infective bites for a given
mosquito population, the development of anti-malarial drugs and the development of an
effective vaccine. The control of the anopheles populations dominated in the early
postwar period. Widespread use of DDT coupled with the coating and draining of
breeding grounds resulted in a substantial reduction in mosquito populations and malaria
morbidity in the sub-tropics, notably southern Europe (Spain, Greece) and parts of Asia
(Malaysia, Singapore) from 1940 to the late 1960s, in turn fueling optimism that malaria
could be rapidly eradicated: “For the first time it is economically feasible for nations,
however underdeveloped and whatever the climate, to banish malaria completely from
their borders.” [Russell (1955)]11

     Hempel and Najera (1998) and Snow (1998) provide detailed discussions.

           The optimism proved premature. While substantial inroads were achieved in the
sub-tropics, controlling malaria in the tropics proved far more challenging. The
combination of far higher human and mosquito parasite carrying rates, the prevalence of
anopheles species particularly suited to malaria transmission, a climate conducive to all-
year exposure and the gradual development of insecticide resistance reduced the
effectiveness of the eradication effort, while the evidence increasingly pointed to
significant adverse side effects of a pervasive use of insecticides. In consequence,
eradication plans were largely abandoned in the late 1960s. Malaria prevention efforts
have since shifted towards more easily implementable local protection methods,
focussing on partial controls of breeding grounds and in particular, on the use of
insecticide impregnated mosquito bednets to minimize infective bites for a given
mosquito population.

           Better medical treatment of infected individuals has been the second prong of the
attack on malaria. A range of anti-malarials [Gilles (1991)]12 are effective in eliminating
parasites in the blood (though not in the liver) within a short time period, at a cost of one
to five dollars per bout. Significant challenges remain, however, as selection pressures,
coupled with incomplete treatment and eradication cycles, tilt parasite and carrier
populations towards strains with greater resistance to commonly used anti-malarials and
insecticides. Longer term, vaccination is viewed as the next significant step forward in
reducing malaria morbidity and mortality.

         Over the course of the century, malaria mortality and, to a lesser extent, morbidity
has sharply declined outside Sub-Saharan Africa, though at a decelerating rate. Sub-
Saharan Africa, only partially involved in the global eradication efforts, has not witnessed
a commensurate decline in either mortality or morbidity; indeed, both absolute cases and
mortality rates have recently trended upward [Table 2].13 The sustainability of the decline
outside of Sub-Saharan Africa remains in question. While medical advances, notably the
expected advent of an effective vaccine, promise further reductions, natural climatic
changes14 coupled with the increasing mobility of the human hosts and, as a side effect,
mosquitoes15, raises the likelihood of more frequent malaria epidemics.16


3. Data


         The incidence of malaria, like most tropical diseases, is measured rather
imprecisely, placing particular value on consistency in cross-country data. We rely on a
recent dataset on malaria published by the World Health Organization (WHO) in its
Weekly Epidemiological Record, 8/13/99, www.who.int/wer. As malaria outside the 0-5 age
group primarily takes the form of repeated incapacitating but non-fatal episodes, we
focus on total population morbidity per 100,000 population. The incidence of malaria
varies sharply over time, depending on the particular climatic situation in a given year
and other factors. As a single year’s cross section may thus not be representative, we
employ five-year averages covering the years 1983-1987, 1988-1992 and 1993-1997. 17
Table 3 presents the joint frequency distribution of malaria morbidity per 100,000

13
   It is possible that the increase partly reflects an increase in the fraction of cases reported.
14
   Sharp increases in malaria in South America have been attributed to changes in mosquito habitats caused
by El Nino.
15
   “Airport malaria”, the infection of individuals living close to airports, is perhaps the best known instance
of the mobility effect, though the number of cases is very small relative to the world wide incidence.
Relatively little is known about the quantitative effect of the exposure of local non-infected mosquito
populations to infected human hosts. See also Singhanetra-Renard (1993) on the mobility-malaria link.

17
   The exposure index used by Gallup, Sachs and Mellinger (1998) and Gallup and Sachs (1998) is based
on two individual datapoints, multiplying the fraction of a country’s area which is exposed to malaria in
1994 with the fraction of falciparum cases in total cases in 1990. We do not distinguish between
Plasmodium varieties. The use of actual morbidity ratios rather than exposure has the advantage of
controlling for differing uses of protective measures (and thus for the possibility that actual morbidity ratios

rates at the bottom, and morbidity rates above ten percent (and for Sub-Saharan Africa
above twenty percent) for the top decile.

         We complement the malaria data by information on climate and location, on
public health expenditures, access to clean water and sanitation and a range of socio-
economic indicators taken primarily from World Bank and WHO sources. Some of these
data are only available at infrequent intervals. To match the malaria morbidity data and
reduce endogeneity problems, observations for the years 1983, 1988 and 1993 (the
starting years of the malaria five-year averages) were used where possible, else the
closest data-point within the five-year period was selected.18


4. Incidence


         Endemic malaria has been depicted as an unavoidable side effect of a tropical
location. A first look at the data supports this view, malaria, not surprisingly, is
concentrated in the tropics. Yet, a closer look within the tropics reveals substantial


differ sharply between countries with similar exposure), while the averaging over multiple years reduces
the importance of year to year fluctuations.
18
   The quality of the underlying data unavoidably differs across sources, as well as across countries for
given sources. To reduce sensitivity to extreme measurements, all data were plotted, and obvious outliers
removed, typically one or two per variable, with outliers often twenty to thirty times larger than the cluster
of observations.


                                                                                                           11
differences in malaria morbidity and mortality rates between countries sharing similar
locations and climates, suggesting the possibility of important additional determinants.
We hence begin the exploration of the malaria-growth nexus by asking whether
knowledge of climate is sufficient to explain the spatial pattern of malaria. If so, malaria
can be viewed as an exogenous variable in growth regressions. If, in contrast, other
variables, including some potentially influenced by economic development, play an
additional independent role, a simultaneity problem arises.


        Box 1: Classification Tree Methodology
         Classification trees consist of a sequence of rules for predicting the value of a binary
dependent variable based on a vector of independent variables. For the present purpose, the
binary variable is defined as high (1) and low (0) malaria morbidity. We convert the continuos
data into binary form by sorting the morbidity rates by size into three groups. The middle group is
dropped, and observations in the top and bottom group are coded respectively as “1” (high
morbidity) and “0” (low morbidity).

         The objective of classification tree analysis is to determine the set of rules (consisting of
a discriminant variable and a threshold) which permits the best sorting of the dependent variable
into its two constituent groups. At each branch of the tree, the sample is split based upon a
threshold value of one of the explanatory variables into two sub-branches. The splitting is
repeated along the various sub-branches until a terminal node is reached. Suppose, for example,
that in all countries falling into the “high” group, the average annual temperate is above 27°
Celsius, while in all countries falling into the “low” group, the average annual temperature is
below 27°. In this case, the rule average annual temperature is below 27° ! low morbidity
perfectly discriminates between the two groups, and the resulting decision tree would have a
single branching with two nodes. In practice, perfectly discriminating rules are rare, and rules
have associated type I and type II errors. In this case the algorithm selects the rule (consisting of
the variable and the associated threshold) which minimizes a weighted sum of type I and type II
errors. For the present purpose, equal weights are used. By construction, any additional sub-
branch reduces the overall error rate of the classification scheme. Akin to an adjusted R2 criterion,
the algorithm terminates at a node if the reduction in the overall error rate falls short of a penalty
on the number of branches.

         Binary classification trees possess a number of advantages for the problem at hand. First,
the algorithm establishes a priority ordering among the potential discriminants, discarding
secondary variables and thus reducing the need for subjective pre-parsing. Second, the procedure
permits subsamples to be described by different rules, thus allowing for context dependence.
Third, because the procedure will typically split on an interior threshold, it is quite robust to
outliers.




                                                                                                   12
         The linkages are likely to be subject to threshold effects, for example the
temperature-malaria link discussed above. In addition, the linkages may be subject to
context-dependence. In particular, even if a cold average temperature is sufficient to infer
low malaria morbidity, temperatures above this level may only be necessary but not
sufficient to infer high malaria morbidity. To allow for these non-linearities, we turn to
classification rule analysis to explore the determinants of different malaria morbidities.
As the methodology has been used infrequently in economics, Box 1 provides a brief
exposition.


         We use three groups of potential discriminants. The first covers spatial and
climate variables capturing the suitability of the country as an anopheles habitat. It
includes elevation, average annual temperature, average annual rainfall, the absolute
latitude (proportional to the distance from the equator) and a dummy for adjacency to an
ocean.19 The second group of variables, proxying for the quality and accessibility of the
public health system, includes the fraction of GDP spent on health care; the fraction of
the population with ready access to health care (in the aggregate and separately for rural
and urban areas); access to clean water and sanitation (in the aggregate and separately in
rural and urban areas) and, as an alternative measure of exposure to water born diseases,
mortality from intestinal infectious diseases. The third group --- aiming to capture any
remaining individual or societal effects --- comprises GDP per capita20, the percentage of
the population living below the poverty line21 and the Gini coefficient22 as measures of
household ability to invest in protective measures and medicine.


         The resulting classification rules are graphed in Table 4. The distance from the
equator, as measured by the absolute latitude, is the single best and clearly exogenous
discriminant between the high and low malaria morbidity group: seventy-three percent of

19
   As climatic conditions often vary strongly within a country, elevation, temperature, absolute latitude and
rainfall are averaged across the three largest cities for the ten largest countries. The other data are for the
capital city.

   To the extent that a high malaria incidence reduces growth prospects, the causality is of course two-
sided, a point to which we return below.

the countries close to the equator fall into the high malaria group, contrasted with only
fourteen percent of the countries located further away.


       Yet, while geography clearly matters [Gallup, Sachs and Mellinger (1998)], it is
not destiny: among the countries sharing a location close to the equator, income
distribution makes a small but noticeable difference: poverty ratios below eighteen
percent are associated with a lower probability of belonging to the high malaria group
(0.667 versus 0.745 for countries with larger poverty ratios). The interpretation of this
link is however impeded by potential simultaneity. For a given GDP per capita, lower
poverty ratios enable even poorer households to invest in anti-malaria measures,
generating a causal link from lower poverty ratios to reduced malaria morbidity. Yet
malaria itself reduces household incomes of those affected, and thus may increase
poverty ratios in the absence of comprehensive social security systems.

       Moving down two nodes reveals that among countries located in close proximity
to the equator, having high poverty ratios and relatively low access to rural healthcare, a
real GDP per capita above 2,370 US$ is associated with a sharply lower (indeed, zero)
probability of belonging to the high malaria group. The result is not surprising: the link
between GDP per capita and malaria is well documented [Gallup, Sachs and Mellinger
(1998)], indeed, it motivated much of the early work on malaria. Yet, again the
interpretation is ambiguous as higher income (notably if associated with greater
administrative capacity) enables improved anti-malaria efforts, while malaria itself
undermines productivity and thus reduces income per capita.

       The small set of classification rules correctly classifies 78 of the 94 high malaria
cases and 71 of the 94 low malaria cases. Overall, 149 out of 188 observations were
correctly identified (79%), compared to an expected 94 correct classifications (50%)
using a purely random allocation.


       The classification rule methodology can also be used to rank variables by their
overall power as a discriminant. The score for each variable is based on the difference in
discriminatory power between the best discriminant at a particular node, and the
discriminatory power of the variable in question, summed over all nodes. Good
alternative rules are thus credited relative to bad alternative rules. As the score is
computed over all nodes, it will in general not overlap with the ordering of splits in the
tree, nor is it even necessary for a variable to appear in any rule in order to be important
as a discriminant, provided it is a close competitor to the best rule at several nodes. Table
5 reports the resulting ranking of variables by their power as discriminants. The second
column provides a numerical measure of the power, scaled relative to the best
discriminant.

       GDP per capita emerges as the best overall discriminant (it appears as a strong
competitor at the first three nodes); followed by the poverty ratio and access to rural
healthcare, while the unambiguously exogenous discriminants --- latitude, temperature



                                                                                          16
and rainfall --- enter lower, at ranks four to six. While the methodology does not address
causality, and indeed GDP per capita itself may be partly endogenous to location [Gallup,
Sachs and Mellinger (1998)]; the negative link between malaria and more equal income
distribution and in particular access to rural health care is suggestive.


5. Growth Effects of Malaria


        Malaria potentially affects both the volume and the productivity of inputs. On the
most direct level, malaria incapacitates part of the labor force. This loss of labor input has
been the primary focus of the classic aggregate studies of malaria [Ross (1911), Sinton
(1935-36)], and has been refined in several careful case studies. The consensus estimates
suggest that attacks, depending on severity, typically entail a loss of four or more
working days, followed by additional days with reduced work capacity [Brohult et al.
(1981), Sheppard et al. (1991), Picard and Mills (1992), Hempel and Najera (1998)]. The
output effect of the lost work time depends both on the degree to which other family-
members can increase work effort and, in agricultural areas, on the overlap between
malaria episodes and harvest periods.25 A second effect operates longer term: malaria
attacks are a major cause of school absenteeism [McDonald (1950), Wernsdorfer and
Wernsdorfer (1988)] and appears to negatively impact long term learning capacity;
reducing the accumulation of human capital over time.


        These direct effects are augmented by more indirect links between malaria and
productivity. Frequent absenteeism reduces the efficiency of networks, requiring greater
redundancy and reducing the scope for specialization. Malaria motivated limits on
mobility (both intra- and inter-national) reduce the quality of skill matching. Malaria
induced changes in planting patterns to minimize the overlap between malaria episodes
and peak agricultural work times reduce agricultural productivity [Conly (1975)].




25
  Malaria fevers tend to overlap with planting season in spring, while malignant tertian in autumn overlaps
with the harvest season [Hempel and Najera (1996)].


                                                                                                        17
Endemic malaria also reduces the growth potential for some industries, notably tourism,
and sharply raises the cost of infrastructure projects and other collective enterprises.26

         These indirect costs --- education never received, tourism and infrastructure
projects never undertaken, specialization patterns never pursued --- are harder to estimate
directly. They can however be indirectly captured in the residual of growth regressions:
to the degree that malaria, controlling for other factors, exerts a significant adverse effect
on growth, one would expect to find a significant explanatory role for malaria in standard
growth regressions [Gallup and Sachs (1998), Gallup, Sachs and Mellinger (1998)].

   As mentioned above, early anti-malaria measures in Panama were partly motivated by the perceived
negative impact on the building of the canal. Malaria has also been cited as a major obstacle in the building
of the trans-amazonian highway, of major dams and of tourism projects [Hempel and Najera (1996)].


                                                                                                          18
also the lowest growth rates of output per capita, and levels of human and physical
capital.


           Table 7 reports a set of standard growth regression for the three periods (1983-88,
1988-93, and 1993-98). The dependent variable for the core regressions presented in this
table and for the robustness tests reported in table 8 is the average per capita growth rate
in the three five year periods. The top two rows denote sample and regression technique.
We report results both for pooled data and for seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR).
The sample either comprises all observations or is limited to Sub-Saharan Africa.


           The coefficient pattern of the standard determinants is familiar: investment enters
positive and is mostly significant. Primary and secondary education enter positive with
one exception, though only secondary education is significant in some cases. Initial
income per capita enters negatively, indicating conditional convergence; openness is
positive and significant, while higher government consumption ratios enter negatively –
and, for the full sample regressions, significant. Greater political freedom and stability,
measured by the standard set of proxies --- the number of revolutions and assassinations
and an index of political freedom27 --- are associated positively, and in most cases
significantly, with growth.


           Malaria enters negatively and significantly in all six regressions. The coefficient
is very similar for all six regressions, specifically; there is no sizeable difference between
the pooled regression and the SUR.


It might of course be the case that the malaria variable simply proxies for other growth
retardants common to the high malaria countries. To test for this possibility, we restrict
the sample to Sub-Saharan Africa, and add dummies for Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin
America to the full sample regression. Neither modification substantially alters the
coefficient on malaria morbidity.

        Table 8 reports a set of robustness tests. To allow for the possibility that results
are driven by outliers, columns two and four report the results obtained by replacing the
malaria morbidity rate by a dummy set equal to one for the one third of observations with
the highest morbidity rates. The dummy enters negatively, barely insignificant for the
pooled regression (the p-value is 0.11) and significant for the SUR.


        The results reported in the previous section suggest a possible two-sided causality
between malaria and economic growth, operating through the ability of the population to
invest in anti-malaria protection in addition to the adverse growth effects described
above. If so, the parameter estimates presented in Table 7 are subject to simultaneity bias.
To examine this possibility, the first column of Table 8 substitutes current with lagged
malaria. The substitution comes at the cost of losing the first sample period; the number
of observations hence drops from 187 to 128. The coefficient on malaria is slightly larger
in absolute terms and remains highly significant, consistent with a causal effect of
malaria on growth. The results of using SUR rather than pooled estimation (reported in
column 3) are similar. The two right-most columns report the results obtained for the
growth rate over the entire fifteen-year period for OLS (column 5) and for TSLS (column
6), using absolute latitude, average rainfall, temperature and an Africa dummy as
instruments.28 The fit of the first stage equation is fair, with an R2 of 0.40. With this
caveat, the coefficient on malaria remains negative and significant at the ten-percent
level. While larger in absolute terms, a Hausman test fails to reject the null hypothesis of
parameter equality for the OLS and TSLS regressions.


        Overall, the robustness tests do not suggest that either the potential endogeneity of
malaria morbidity or outliers drive the results. Beyond this direct effect, malaria might
also indirectly affect growth through some of the standard growth determinants, notably
physical and human capital accumulation.



28
   To reduce endogeneity issues for the standard determinants, notably the investment ratio, we use
beginning of period values. The set of instruments passes an over-identification test. The significance
values are based on White-robust standard errors.

        To examine these effects, we estimate SURs of investment and the enrollment
ratios29 on a constant, the log of GDP per capita and malaria (t-statistics in brackets):

Primary enrollment ratio        = -50.06 + 18.36 Log(GDPpc) - 0.00014 Malaria
                                  (-3.02)  (8.53)**           (0.90)

Secondary enrollment ratio = -100.21 + 17.87 Log(GDPpc) - 0.00021 Malaria
                             (-7.39) (10.19)**            (-1.56)

Investment ratio                =     -0.12 + 2.80 Log(GDPpc) -0.000033 Malaria
                                     (0.01) (2.90)**           (0.38)



        For all three variables, malaria enters with a negative coefficient, though only the
effect on secondary enrollment comes close to statistical significance at the ten- percent
level. The results thus provide only muted support for an indirect negative effect of
malaria on growth. The weak evidence may however reflect data problems, specifically;
the lack of quality adjusted human and physical investment data. A child suffering from
malaria, and consequently receiving a less effective education due to absences and
reduced learning capacity, would still be counted in enrollment figures; while shifts in the
composition of investment allowing for greater redundancy in endemic areas at the cost
of reduced overall investment productivity would not necessarily be captured in the
volume of investment. To the extent that these quantity/quality data problems are present,
the malaria dummy in the regressions reported in Tables 7 and 8 would also pick up the
indirect effect. A formal test of this possibility --- introducing interactive effects between
morbidity and the accumulation factors into the regression --- however does not yield a
significant effect for either human or physical capital accumulation.




29
  The enrollment ratios are only available for the years 1985, 1990 and 1995. The investment ratio is the
average of the five-year period.

       Pulling these findings together, how much lower is the growth rate in endemic
areas because of malaria? Under the very stringent assumption that the same growth
elasticity of malaria morbidity applies to all countries and at all malaria morbidity rates,
the product of the elasticity and the actual malaria morbidity in a country provides an
estimate of the negative growth effect. Table 9 reports the results of this exercise, using
the –0.000064 coefficient from the SUR regression for all countries reported in column
four of table 7. To provide a conservative estimate, we used the median morbidity
observation for countries with three observations, and the lower morbidity rate for
countries with only two observations. The year noted specifies the beginning of the five-
year period used. Thus, considering the first row, for Malawi the predicted growth effect
of reducing malaria to zero for the 1993 to 1998 period is 3.22 percent per annum.

        Taken at face value, the results suggest that for many countries the growth cost of
malaria is quite pronounced. Even disregarding the tails of the distribution, the estimated
growth reduction due to malaria exceeds a quarter of a percent per year for about a
quarter of the sample. The findings compares with earlier point GDP cost estimates for
all of sub-Saharan Africa of 0.6 percent (predicted to rise to one percent) by Shephard,
Ettling, Brinkman and Sauerborn (1991) and of 1.3 percent by Gallup and Sachs (1998)
and Gallup, Sachs and Mellinger (1998). As the elasticity of growth with respect to
malaria is unlikely to be invariant across countries, if only because the non-linear effects



                                                                                             25
examined above in studying the incidence of malaria may also affect its economic costs,
the point estimates should be viewed with a grain of caution.


       From a policy perspective, the economic and non-economic benefits of reducing
malaria must be weighted against the costs of anti-malaria measures and contrasted with
the cost-benefit calculus for other prevalent diseases. Detailed case studies suggest that
substantial reductions can be obtained by fairly simple, low cost measures (Table 10)
such as pre-packaging complete treatments, better education regarding the need to
complete treatment cycles, better availability of second and third line drugs in areas with
building resistance against currently used drugs and the widespread use of bednets.


6. Conclusions


       Malaria ranks among the major health problems facing many developing
countries, notably in Sub-Saharan Africa. Fighting malaria requires significant financial
and organizational resources, yet malaria itself restrains economic development,
threatening a vicious circle. We explored these linkages using a cross-country dataset on
malaria, growth and other country characteristics. The study yielded two main results.
First, while we confirmed prior research on the importance of climate as a determinant of
malaria morbidity, we found that geography is not entirely destiny: controlling for
climate, lower poverty ratios --- enabling even poorer households to invest in anti-malaria
protection --- are associated with lower malaria morbidity. Second, we found a quite
robust negative baseline growth effect of –0.000064 for malaria morbidity per 100,000
population, reducing annual per capita growth by a quarter percent for the most affected
countries.
