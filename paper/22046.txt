This paper develops a theoretical framework to study the interaction between globalization and
political structure. We show that political structure adapts to expanding trade opportunities in a
non-monotonic way. Borders hamper trade. In its early stages, the political response to
globalization consists of removing borders by increasing country size. In its later stages, however,
the political response to globalization is to remove borders by creating international unions, and
this leads to a reduction in country size. Moreover, negotiation replaces war as a tool to ensure
market access. These predictions are consistent with historical evidence on trade, territorial
expansion and war.

                                        1   Introduction

Since the Industrial Revolution, the cost of distance has been falling dramatically thanks to
a stream of major technological innovations, like the railroad, the steamship, the telegraph,
the jet engine, containerization and most recently the internet. Such technological progress
has fundamentally transformed worldwide economic geography and fuelled a continuous ex-
pansion in the size of markets. In 1820, international trade was very modest: about 2% of
world output. Over the following century, international trade grew more than four-fold to
8%. This …rst wave of globalization was cut short in the interwar period, which saw interna-
tional trade decline to about 5%. After World War II, a second wave of globalization started
and still continues today. By 2010, international trade had reached unprecedented levels,
surpassing 20% of world output.
   These two ages of globalization, however, saw political geography evolve in opposite
directions. In the nineteenth century, economic and political integration proceeded together.
Sovereign states grew larger and fewer, from 125 in 1820 to merely 54 at the eve of the Great
War. Conversely, in the postwar era economic integration has been accompanied by political
fragmentation, and the number of countries has risen to a record high of more than 190. At
the same time, there has been a proliferation of international treaties and institutions aimed
especially at fostering economic integration, such as the World Trade Organization and the
European Union.
   These trends are illustrated graphically in Figure 1, which shows the historical evolution
of the number of sovereign states in the world, average exports as a share of GDP and the
number of members of the GATT/WTO.1 The sharp reversal in the link between economic
and political integration presents an open puzzle and an obstacle for accounts of political
geography based on economic e¢ ciency. Does the evolution of the number and size of
countries require explanations grounded in purely political or military considerations?
   In this paper, we argue instead that the trends in Figure 1 are an e¢ cient response to the
falling cost of distance. Our starting point is that borders hamper trade and globalization
makes borders costlier. Thus, political structure adapts by removing borders or reducing
their cost. We show that this adaptation generates a non-monotonic evolution of e¢ cient
country size. In its early stages, the e¢ cient political response to globalization consists of
removing borders by creating large countries. In its later stages, the e¢ cient political re-

sponse to globalization is to remove the cost of borders by creating a new level of government,
namely, international unions. This induces a reduction in the size of countries.
   Naturally, our theory does not imply that political geography responds to economic
e¢ ciency alone. On the contrary, once we allow for ine¢ ciencies our model sheds light on
the patterns of interstate con‡ict too. When two-level governance is ine¢ cient, we show it
is appealing for the Great Powers to wage war to conquer markets. Empire-building enables
them to trade with their colonies while imposing extractive institutions that deny them
political autonomy. As e¢ cient market size keeps growing, however, we …nd that this strategy
reaches a breaking point. Con‡ict and imperialism are no longer advantageous for the Great
Powers. They prefer gaining access to world markets through peaceful diplomacy, by building
multilateral institutions that respect all members’ political autonomy. These theoretical
predictions are borne out by empirical evidence. During the …rst wave of globalization,
increasing trade led to country expansion accompanied by con‡ict. Both links were broken
during the second wave of globalization, which saw instead the peaceful rise of multi-level
governance.


                                               2
       To derive our results, in section 2 we set up our model of a world with a continuum of
basic geographical units or localities, each containing people that share common preferences.
Goods can be transported at a negligible cost within localities, but at a positive cost across
localities. Governments perform two tasks: (i) enforce contracts, protect property rights and
enact economic regulations that help markets work; and (ii) provide public services such as
education and welfare programs. We study how governments are organized geographically
to perform these tasks and, in particular, how this organization changes as the cost of
transporting goods across localities declines.
       We make two standard assumptions about the e¤ects of governments. The …rst is the
presence of border e¤ects. If two localities have di¤erent governments providing economic
regulation, they can trade only a limited range of goods. The second assumption is preference
heterogeneity over public services. If two localities have the same government, they receive
the same basket of public services.2
       Without costs of government, the optimal political structure would be a two-level gover-
nance structure. The …rst level would be a continuum of country governments, one for each
locality, providing each of them with its preferred basket of public services. The second level
would be a world government or international union that regulates markets and eliminates
all border e¤ects. Unfortunately, this political structure is too expensive.
       We make two standard assumptions about the costs of government. The …rst is the
presence of economies of scale. There are some costs of setting up and running a government
that are …xed or independent of the number of localities sharing this government. The
second assumption is the presence of economies of scope. Coordinating di¤erent levels of
government is costly and, as a result, the two-level governance structure is more expensive
than a single-level structure.
       Economies of scale and scope a¤ect the optimal political structure. Economies of scale
make it desirable to have a discrete number of country governments rather than a continuum
of them. Localities are willing to accept public services less than ideally tailored to their
preferences in order to bene…t from economies of scale. Economies of scope, if large enough,
make it desirable to have single-level governance rather than a two-level structure. Localities

   2
    We assume that local preferences di¤er with respect to public services but not economic regulation.
Market-enabling economic regulation aims primarily at increasing e¢ ciency, and this goal is widely shared by
people with di¤erent preferences (Coase 1960; Posner [1973] 2014). Accordingly, government functions such
as contract enforcement, monetary policy, or the policing of anti-competitive practices are often entrusted to
apolitical technocrats. Public services, however, are a focus of political tension because people have di¤erent
views on how children should be educated, on the proper size and scope of the welfare system, and so on.
Such preferences vary systematically across localities re‡ecting their distinctive history and culture.


                                                      3
may also be willing to accept higher trade costs to take advantage of economies of scope.
   Thus, the equilibrium political structure balances four classic forces: border e¤ects, pref-
erence heterogeneity, economies of scale and economies of scope. In this context, we study
how a reduction in transport costs a¤ects this balance.
   In Section 3, we assume that localities bargain e¢ ciently in a world ruled by law and
diplomacy. At early stages of globalization, the gains from trade are small and the bene…t
of creating an international union does not justify sacri…cing economies of scope. Thus,
a single-level governance structure is optimal. As globalization proceeds, the gains from
trade grow, providing incentives to remove borders. The number of countries declines and
the mismatch between each locality’s ideal and actual provision of public services grows.
Eventually, this mismatch is large enough to justify the move to a two-level governance
structure. The world political structure shifts from a few large countries to many small
countries within an international union. This two-level structure is more expensive, but it
is nonetheless desirable because it facilitates trade and improves preference-matching in the
provision of public services.
   In Section 4 we allow a set of core localities to wage war and build empires. War is
costly but it allows core localities to remove borders with the colonies while imposing their
preferences on them. Thus, we …nd that there is an intermediate stage of globalization in
which empires are formed. Eventually this stage ends, empires collapse, and international
unions are created to promote trade and peace. Core localities choose to avoid the cost of
war and to replace conquered colonies with free partners in an international union. The
cause of imperial collapse at a late stage of globalization is exactly the same as the cause for
the rise of empires at an early stage, namely, the desire to reap gains from trade in the most
cost-e¢ cient manner.
   In Section 5, we use historical data to test the two most distinctive implications of our
theory. The …rst is that increases in trade should predict territorial expansions before in-
ternational unions are created, but not afterwards. The second is that territorial changes
should be con‡ictual before international unions are created, but should be peaceful after-
wards. Using data from the Cross-National Time-Series Archive from 1870 to 2010, we …nd
indeed that increases in trade and proxies for military power predict subsequent territor-
ial expansion before World War II, when international unions did not play a major role,
but not after it. Moreover, we …nd that the incidence of con‡ict in border changes declines
dramatically after World War II.
   Section 6 concludes by using our theory to interpret a variety of historical experiences.


                                               4
Related Literature The motivating facts presented in Figure 1 were …rst noted by Kahler
and Lake (2004) and Lake and O’Mahony (2004). They highlight the puzzling reversal in
the link between economic and political integration. They stress that it poses an obstacle
for e¢ ciency-based explanations of political structure, which have so far failed to account
for it, as well as for the emergence of supranational institutions during the second but not
the …rst wave of globalization.
       Several economic theories can help explain why economic integration has been accompa-
nied by political fragmentation since World War II (Bolton and Roland 1996, 1997; Alesina,
Spolaore and Wacziarg 2000, 2005; Casella 2001; Casella and Feinstein 2002). All of them,
however, predict a monotonic e¤ect of globalization on political structure, and thus fail to
explain why the …rst wave of globalization was accompanied by a decline in the number of
countries. Nor can they explain the creation of international unions. Closest to our own
work, Alesina, Spolaore and Wacziarg (2000, 2005) add border e¤ects to Alesina and Spo-
laore’s (1997) seminal theory of country formation based on the trade-o¤ between preference
heterogeneity and economies of scale.3 They explain the increase in the number of countries
during the second wave of globalization by interpreting globalization as an exogenous weak-
ening of the border e¤ect. As borders become less costly, e¢ cient political structure reacts
by creating more borders.4
       Our model is the …rst to account for the non-monotonic impact of globalization on po-
litical structure, and to explain the appearance of multi-level governance during the second
wave of globalization. The reason is twofold. First, we recognize that economies of scope are
limited.5 As a consequence, a broader set of political structures can be e¢ cient, and we can
explain the shift from a single-level to a two-level governance structure. Second, we consider
a more primitive technological driver of globalization: the gradual decline of transportation
costs. This change in focus enables us to show that globalization makes borders more costly
rather than less. This creates incentives to remove borders rather than to create them. In
our theory, the weakening of the border e¤ect only occurs endogenously as political struc-
ture adapts to new trade opportunities. Both our innovations are crucial: without either,

   3
     Desmet et al. (2012) calibrate this trade-o¤ for European countries.
   4
     Bolton and Roland (1996, 1997) focus on income distribution and …nd that heterogeneous countries may
break up if their barriers to external trade decline. Casella (2001) and Casella and Feinstein (2002) study
how preferences for public goods can endogenously become more heterogeneous as market size expands and
enables greater specialization.

     Alesina and Spolaore (2003) o¤er an insightful discussion of economies of scope. Speci…cally, Chapter 2
analyzes an arbitrary system of overlapping jurisdictions, while Chapter 9 presents a system of overlapping
jurisdictions constrained to form a pyramidal hierarchy.

theories based on economic e¢ ciency would be unable to explain why economic and political
integration went together until World War II, and then took di¤erent directions.
   Our work is also related to the literature on trade and war. The idea that trade promotes
peace was formalized by Polachek (1980). It is based on the premise that con‡ict harms
trade and hence trade openness raises the opportunity cost of war (Alesina and Spolaore
2003; Rohner, Thoenig and Zilibotti 2013). The opposite idea that trade generates military
con‡ict is instead expressed in neo-Marxist theories of imperialism. Trade can also make
countries dependent on others and therefore vulnerable (Bonfatti and O’Rourke 2017).6 Our
paper suggests that these seemingly antithetical views capture two di¤erent stages of the
same model. We provide a uni…ed explanation for why territorial changes are more with
military con‡ict in the …rst wave of globalization than in the second, an empirical pattern
noted by Lake and O’Mahony (2006). Consistent with our result that international unions
remove the incentive to wage war, Martin, Mayer and Thoenig (2012) …nd evidence that
regional trade agreements promote peaceful relations.
   The e¤ect of war on country formation has been studied by Alesina and Spolaore (2003,
2005), Gri¢ ths (2014), Gennaioli and Voth (2015) and Alesina, Reich and Riboni (2017),
among others. These papers show that changes in military technology can explain country
size, investment in state capacity and the provision of public goods. However, they …nd a
monotonic e¤ect of military technology on political structure. Our theory also recognizes
con‡ict as one of the determinants of country formation and of the provision of public goods.
In our model, waging war is one reason why countries grow large. We show, however, that
changes in military technology alone are not a persuasive driving force for the reversal in the
link between economic and political integration. Instead, we …nd that falling transportation
costs can explain endogenously the switch from a world of aggression in which countries grow
large to one of diplomacy in which countries become smaller.
   Finally, our work is related more broadly to the economic analysis of federalism and of
the geographic structure of government. Our model embeds the key trade-o¤ that lies at the
heart of the classic theory of …scal federalism (Oates 1972). Centralization reaps economies
of scale and bene…ts from policy coordination, but it imposes a uniform policy on locali-
ties with di¤erent preferences.7 Models of political centralization and decentralization have

   6
     Martin, Mayer and Thoenig (2008) show that while bilateral trade lowers the probability of con‡ict,
multilateral trade openness decreases dependence on any given country and hence the cost of a bilateral
con‡ict.
   7
     Political-economy frictions micro-found these countervailing forces (Lockwood 2002; Besley and Coate
2003; Harstad 2007; Bo¤a, Piolatto and Ponzetto 2016). Multiple local governments fail to coordinate

been applied most often to the architecture of government at the sub-national level (Lock-
wood 2006; Treisman 2007). However, the same insights apply to the study of international
unions (Hooghe and Marks 2003; Alesina, Angeloni and Etro 2005; Alesina, Angeloni and
Schuknecht 2005; Ruta 2005). Prior research in this …eld has overwhelmingly focused on the
optimal size and composition of an exogenously given number of government tiers. Surpris-
ingly, the literature has devoted much less attention to the choice between a single-level and
a multi-level governance structure, which our analysis focuses on.


                            2    A Model of Political Structure

In this section, we develop a stylized model of the world that contains the basic ingredients
of our theory: geography, markets and preferences. The model mixes these ingredients
imposing a high degree of symmetry. This allows us to derive our basic results on the e¤ects
of globalization on political structure quickly and intuitively.
      The concept of locality is a key primitive in our theory. We model the world as a set
of places within which there are neither geographical nor cultural distances, and we label
them localities. Thus, localities consist of a group of people sharing common preferences and
inhabiting a particular territory. This approach, which is common in the literature, simpli…es
the study of how peoples with di¤erent preferences interact and organize themselves into
political entities. But it is silent about how these di¤erent preferences arose in the …rst place
and how they evolve over time. It also abstracts from domestic con‡ict.
      The concept of globalization is another important primitive in our theory. Geographical
distances introduce trade costs across localities. In particular, we use the usual assumption
of iceberg trade costs across localities. We interpret globalization as exogenous technological
change that gradually removes these trade costs.


2.1    Basic Setup

We consider a world with a continuum of atomistic localities, l 2 [0; 1]. Each locality contains
a positive measure of identical individuals. Wl denotes the welfare of the representative
individual of locality l. For short, we refer to this individual as “locality l.” Then, the

e¢ ciently even if they can bargain with one another. A single central government fails to match policies to
local preferences even if it can di¤erentiate policy across regions— in fact endogenous policy di¤erentiation
may prove more harmful than uniformity.




                                                     7
welfare of locality l is:
                                        Wl = WlM + WlG ,                                    (1)

where WlM is the utility derived from the consumption of market goods, and WlG is the
utility derived from public services.
   Governments provide public services and regulate markets, so government activity a¤ects
both welfare components. A political structure for this world consists of two partitions of
the set of localities [0; 1] into governments: a public-service partition P with typical element
Pn 2 P ; and an economic-regulation partition R with typical element Rn 2 R.
   If P = R, we say that the world has a single-level governance structure, and we refer
to the common elements of P and R as country governments or countries. Each of these
countries provides both public services and market regulation to its constituent localities.
   If P 6= R, we say that the world has a two-level governance structure. It will presently
become clear that governments have a pyramidal hierarchy: if the partitions P and R do
not coincide, the …ner partition P is always a re…nement of the coarser one R. Hence, we
refer to the (smaller) elements of P as country governments or countries, and the (larger)
elements of R as international unions or unions. Countries provide public services to their
constituent localities, while unions regulate the markets of their constituent countries.
   We develop a model of the partitions P and R, that is, a model of how localities organize
themselves into countries and how countries organize themselves into unions. We start from
assumptions about preferences, technology and the costs of government, and we determine
how welfare Wl depends on political structure (P; R).


   2.1.1 Markets and Trade

There is a continuum of industries, i 2 [0; 1]. Let cl (i) be the consumption of goods of
industry i by locality l. The utility function takes the following form:
                                               Z       1
                                     WlM   =               ln cl (i) di.                    (2)
                                                   0


The production of …nal consumption goods requires industry-speci…c di¤erentiated input
varieties, m 2 [0; 1]. De…ne cl (m; i) as the amount of inputs of the variety m for industry i
used by locality l in the production of …nal goods. Then:
                                               Z   1
                              cl (i) = exp                 ln cl (m; i) dm .                (3)
                                               0



                                                       8
These consumption preferences and production technology are symmetric across and within
industries, and we specify convenient Cobb-Douglas functional forms. As a result, each
locality spends an identical fraction of its income on each variety of each industry.
       To introduce gains from specialization and trade, we adopt a simple symmetric version
of the Ricardian model. Each locality is endowed with one unit of labor in each industry.
This unit can produce one unit of the variety with the same index as the locality (m = l);
or e      units of any other variety (m 6= l). Since           > 0, each locality has a technological
advantage in its “own”variety. The parameter               measures the extent to which technologies
di¤er across localities and, therefore, the potential gains from specialization and trade.
       There are technological barriers to trade. We assume uniform iceberg transportation
costs across localities so that only a fraction e          < 1 of the goods shipped from l to m 6= l
arrives to destination. To focus on the most interesting case in which trade costs are not
prohibitive and to ensure positive gains from trade, we assume that                >    > 0. Our measure
of globalization is the wedge                     , which captures the potential gains from trade
and increases as improvements in transportation technology reduce physical trade costs .
Globalization can thus range from             = 0 when trade costs are prohibitive ( = ) to a
maximum of        =    when trade costs are nil ( = 0).
       Policy-induced barriers to trade or border e¤ects arise when di¤erent governments reg-
ulate markets. In particular, we assume that exchanging goods in a fraction                      2 (0; 1) of
industries requires legal enforcement of contracts. In these industries, varieties cannot be
traded between localities that have di¤erent governments regulating their markets, i.e., that
belong to di¤erent elements Rn and Rn0 . The reason is that foreigners correctly anticipate
that domestic courts will discriminate against them ex post. In the remaining set of indus-
tries, contracts are self-enforcing and thus varieties can be traded without restrictions. This
formulation captures a simple and yet realistic micro-foundation for the well-known …nding
that borders obstruct trade.8
       A market equilibrium is a set of prices and quantities such that individuals maximize
utility and markets clear. Appendix A.2 shows that there exists a unique market equilibrium.
Traded industries specialize in each locality’s input variety, export essentially all of their
production and import the remaining input varieties. Thus, consumption in traded industries
is cl (m; i) = e . Nontraded industries are forced to produce locally all input varieties. Thus,

   8
    This microfoundation is consistent with Broner and Ventura (2011). There are other microfoundations,
though. For instance, tari¤s and non-tari¤ barriers are also policies that discriminate against foreigners and
limit the range of goods that can be traded.



                                                      9
consumption in nontraded industries is cl (m; i) = e . This implies the following utility from
consuming market goods:
                                                                            Z   1
                                 WlM     =         +           1        +            R
                                                                                    Il=m dm ,                  (4)
                                                                            0

       R
where Il=m is an indicator variable which takes value 1 if localities l and m belong to the
same Rn , and zero otherwise. Equation (4) shows the impact of border e¤ects. A decline
in transportation costs raises the gains from trade                             in every industry. However, border
e¤ects prevent a locality from reaping the gains from trade in a mass                            of industries that
require contract enforcement. As a consequence, the value of removing each border e¤ect is
proportional to           , where      measures the potential gains from trade in any single industry
and         the mass of industries subject to border e¤ects.


    2.1.2 Governments

Public services consist of a basket of di¤erentiated varieties, x 2 [0; 1]. The basket provided
to locality l is characterized by a density function gl (x) de…ned over these varieties, with
                R1
gl (x) 0 and 0 gl (x) dx = 1. The utility derived from these public services is:
                                                   Z   1
                                       WlG     =           l   (x) u (gl (x)) dx       K,                      (5)
                                                   0


where        l   (x)   0, u (gl (x)) =       1=gl (x) and K is a cost function to de de…ned shortly. We
refer to the …rst and second terms of Equation (5) as the bene…ts and costs of public services
respectively.
    We now introduce three assumptions about governments. The …rst assumption is about
preference heterogeneity. Each locality has a di¤erent ideal variety of public services. We
de…ne and order the basic varieties such that the ideal one for locality l is x = l. We assume
that    l   (x) =      if x = l; and     l   (x) = 0 otherwise.
    The second assumption is that there are economies of scale in the provision of public
services. Building and maintaining a government reduces the value or utility of public services
by a total or …xed amount                    > 0, and this cost is equally shared among the constituent
localities.
    Our third and …nal assumption is that there are economies of scope across government
functions. Membership of a union reduces the value or utility of public services by an



                                                                   10
amount       > 0. This captures the costs of oversight and coordination between a country and
the union.
   These three assumptions imply the following utility from public services:

                              WlG =             R1                          IlU ,                   (6)
                                       gl (l)     I P dm
                                                 0 l=m

               P
where    > 0; Il=m is an indicator variable that takes value 1 if if localities l and m belong to
the same Pn , and zero otherwise; and IlU is an indicator variable that takes value 1 if locality
l is a member of a union Rn 6= Pn , and zero otherwise. The …rst term in Equation (6) means
that the value of public services for locality l depends on the amount of its ideal variety that
is provided. The second term in Equation (6) means that each locality’s share of the …xed
cost of government declines with the size of the country. The parameter                   measures the
magnitude of these economies of scale. The third term of Equation (6) means that being a
member of a union is costly. The parameter           measures the magnitude of these economies
of scope.
   To complete the model we need to make assumptions on how localities interact. We
consider law and diplomacy in Section 3, and war and conquest in Section 4. In both cases,
the world’s political structure is determined by the interplay of the forces that follow from
our assumptions. Although these assumptions are standard in the literature, we provide
some additional discussion of them in Appendix A.3.


                                  3   Law and Diplomacy

E¢ cient bargaining among localities delivers Pareto e¢ cient outcomes and constitutes a
natural benchmark to study. In this case, the equilibrium political structure is obtained by
solving the following maximization problem:
                                                      Z    1
                                 (P; R) = arg max              ! l Wl dl,                           (7)
                                                       0

                                                                 R1
where f! l gl2[0;1] is a set of Pareto weights such that          0
                                                                      ! l dl = 1. Given the symmetry of
this world, it seems reasonable to focus on the case in which the bargaining process treats
all localities in the same way: ! l = 1 for all l 2 [0; 1]. Sometimes this political structure is
referred to as the utilitarian welfare optimum since it maximizes average world welfare. We
view it as the description of a world in which all localities have the right to choose their own


                                                11
political structure. This is a world ruled by law and diplomacy.
       An implication of the maximization problem (7) is that each country Pn provides a
uniform bundle that contains equal amounts of the ideal varieties of its constituent localities.9
That is, locality l receives the following bundle of public services:
                                           8
                                           >      1
                                           < R1          P
                                                     if Il=x =1
                                                 P
                                  gl (x) =      I dm
                                               0 l=m                                                              (8)
                                           >
                                           : 0           P
                                                     if Il=x = 0.

Thus, we can re-write Equation (6) as follows:
                                          Z       1
                              WlG   =                  P
                                                      Il=m dm   R1                     IlU .                      (9)
                                                                      P
                                              0                 0
                                                                     Il=m dm

The …rst term means that the value of public services for locality l declines with the size
of its country. As more localities join the country, the public services provided are farther
away from the ideal of each member locality. The parameter                             measures the importance of
this preference mismatch.
       Combining Equations (1), (4), and (9), we obtain:
                                         Z    1                  Z       1
                                                   R                          P
           Wl =      +      1       +             Il=m dm                    Il=m dm    R1               IlU .   (10)
                                                                                                P
                                          0                          0                    0
                                                                                               Il=m dm

Equation (10) shows how political structure determines welfare and reveals the key trade-o¤
that underlies our theory. A desirable political structure should facilitate trade, accommo-
date preference heterogeneity and take advantage of economies of scale and scope. But these
goals cannot be achieved simultaneously and something must give.10


3.1     Equilibrium Political Structure

Two preliminary results simplify the analysis of the maximization problem (7). The …rst is
that P and R contain equal-sized elements. Let S and U be the sizes of each element Pn 2 P

   9
     This is welfare-maximizing since localities have convex preferences.
  10
     Equation (10) includes all the features of Oates’s (1972) classic Decentralization Theorem: in the absence
of cost savings from the centralized provision of public services ( = 0) and of interjurisdictional externalities
(    = 0), welfare is at least as high if each locality can choose its own public services than if any uniform
bundle is imposed across all of them.




                                                           12
and Rn 2 R respectively.11 The second result is that, as anticipated, P is a re…nement of
R. If it is ever worth paying the costs of having a two-level governance structure, this
is because localities desire a lower-level government that provides public services adapted
to their speci…c preferences, and a higher-level government that reduces border e¤ects and
facilitates trade. Thus, we can write Wl as a function of S and U as follows:

                   Wl = W F (S; U ) =         + (1         + U)        S            IU ,               (11)
                                                                             S

where I U is an indicator variable that takes value 1 if S 6= U , and zero otherwise.
    Equation (11) implies that the equilibrium political structure features either P = R or
P 6= R = f[0; 1]g.12 In the …rst case, the world is organized in a single-level governance
structure with a set of countries that provide public services and regulate markets. In
the second case, the world is organized in a two-level governance structure with countries
providing public services and a world union regulating markets.
    We now …nd the equilibrium political structure in three steps. First, we compute the wel-
fare W F (S1 ; S1 ) generated by the single-level governance structure, where S1 is the optimal
country size without a world union. This political structure takes full advantage of economies
of scope, and country size trades o¤ preference heterogeneity against both economies of scale
and facilitating trade:                            s
                                            S1 =              .                                        (12)

The size of countries in the absence of unions is increasing with economies of scale ( ) and
the importance of trade (        ), and it is decreasing with preference heterogeneity ( ).13
    Second, we compute the welfare W F (S2 ; 1) generated by a world with a union, where S2
is the optimal country size with a world union. This political structure gives up economies of
scope in order to remove border e¤ects and facilitate trade. Country size trades o¤ preference

  11
     Throughout, we disregard the constraint that the number of countries and unions, 1=S and 1=U , must
be a natural number. Aside from this constraint, all localities prefer the same optimal country size so
that any equilibrium is symmetric. In Appendix A.4 we introduce this integer constraint and show that the
equilibrium political strcuture remains symmetric and qualitatively analogous to the tractable approximation
we use in the main text.
  12
     We know that, if P 6= R, there is only one world economic union because the marginal cost of adding
members is constant and the marginal bene…t is growing with the size of the union. Thus, having many
small unions is not optimal.
  13
     Equation (12) assumes that > + , so that there is enough preference heterogeneity to ensure that
countries are always smaller than the whole world.




                                                    13
heterogeneity and economies of scale:
                                                     r
                                              S2 =        .                                     (13)

The size of countries with a world union is increasing with economies of scale ( ) and it is
decreasing with preference heterogeneity ( ). Country size is always smaller with a world
union than without it. The reason is that the union removes one of the incentives for country
size, namely, facilitating trade.
      The third step is to determine the equilibrium political structure. If W F (S1 ; S1 ) >
W F (S2 ; 1), the world is partitioned into countries of size S1 . If W F (S1 ; S1 ) < W F (S2 ; 1),
the world is partitioned into countries of size S2 that belong to a world union. Naturally,
in the knife-edge case in which W F (S1 ; S1 ) = W F (S2 ; 1), both solutions are equilibrium
political structures. A little algebra shows that the world union is preferred if and only if:
                                         p                p
                                    +2       <       +2       (     ).                          (14)

That is, the world union is preferred for high values of ,          and ; and low values of      and
 . A world union is more useful if the border e¤ect and the gains from trade are large and
there is substantial preference heterogeneity. A world union is less useful if economies of
scale and scope are sizable.


3.2    Globalization and Political Structure

With these results at hand, we can now return to Figure 1 in the Introduction and ask
again: Why did the …rst wave of globalization reduce the number of countries but not
generate unions? Why did the second wave of globalization increase the number of countries
and lead to the creation of unions? To answer these questions, we interpret globalization as
a process by which     grows from 0 to , and we study how political structure changes as this
process unfolds.
      Figure 2 shows how equilibrium political structure depends on the two parameters that
measure economies of scope and globalization,             and . For a given , the world chooses a
single-level political structure if   is low. If   is not too large, as in the dashed line, the world

If economies of scope are nil, the smallest gain from trade leads to the formation of a world
union ( = 0 implies          U   = 0). If economies of scope are prohibitive, the world union is never

an equilibrium ( >               +2      (      ) 2       implies U > ). The comparative statics
of this threshold follow directly from our analysis of Equation (14). The larger the border
e¤ect ( ) and preference heterogeneity ( ), the smaller                               U.   The larger economies of scale

rium size of countries and unions as a function of . At low levels of globalization ( <                                 U ),

it is too expensive to create a world union, and increases in                                lead to an increase in country
size. The cost of reaping additional gains from trade is a growing preference mismatch.
Eventually, the preference mismatch has grown so large that it becomes cost-e¤ective to
create a world union. At high levels of globalization ( >                             U ),   the cost of reaping additional
gains from trade is the loss of economies of scope. The creation of a world union allows
countries to revert to a smaller size and reduce the preference mismatch. Further increases
in   have no e¤ect on political structure.

                                 4   War and Conquest

We explore next how war and conquest a¤ect the relationship between globalization and
political structure. To do this, we assume that the world is divided into core and periphery.
The core contains a measure     of localities with a superior military technology that can be
used to conquer other localities and form empires. The periphery contains the remaining
localities that do not have this military technology. We assign low indices to core localities:
C = [0; ]. We keep all assumptions regarding preferences, technology and the costs of
government. Thus, the model of the previous section applies as      ! 0.
   Empires are an alternative form of government that provides public services and regulates
the markets. An empire contains a metropolis and its colonies. The metropolis consists of
core localities that unite to conquer periphery localities that then become colonies. Empires




                                              16
provide the ideal public services of their metropolises:

       M
where Il=m is an indicator variable that takes value 1 if localities l and m belong to the
metropolis and zero otherwise. Empires provide none of the ideal public services of their
colonies.
   To build an empire of size E, core localities must wage war to conquer the colonies. War
is successful if and only if the size of the metropolis M is large enough relative to that of the
colonies:
                                                M         E,                                         (17)

where       2 (0; 1). This assumption captures the well-known argument that country size is
important for military success, and thus one of the reasons countries grow large is to prepare
for war. We assume throughout that               <      . This means that the combined size of all
empires is always smaller than the world, and empires do not need to …ght each other for
colonies.
   From the perspective of the metropolis, the upside of building an empire is that it fa-
cilitates trade and generates economies of scale with minimal preference mismatch. The
downside is that waging war and holding the empire together reduces the utility that the
metropolis derives from public services by an amount ! > 0. This cost captures the diversion
of government resources from providing public services in the metropolis to waging colonial
wars. Thus, the welfare of a member of the metropolis is:
                                     Z    1                    Z   1
                                               E                        M
            Wl =     +    1      +            Il=m dm                  Il=m dm   R1    E
                                                                                                !,   (18)
                                      0                        0                 0
                                                                                      Il=m dm

       E
where Il=m is an indicator variable that takes value 1 if localities l and m belong to the same
empire and zero otherwise.
   From the perspective of the conquered colonies, the gains from trade are dwarfed by
the costs of an imperial government that generates an unbounded preference mismatch.
This division of the surplus captures in our model the extractive nature of imperialism:
the metropolis enjoys the gains from trade, while the conquered localities su¤er under an
exploitative colonial administration.


                                                     17
4.1      Equilibrium Political Structure

With war and conquest, equilibrium political structure need no longer be globally e¢ cient.
Formally, equilibrium political structure is now determined in two stages:

   1. Core localities choose cooperatively whether to wage war and build empires.14 Locali-
         ties in the periphery may become their colonies or remain free.

   2. Localities that do not belong to an empire choose their political structure through
         e¢ cient bargaining, as in our baseline model.

       The world’s equilibrium political structure now consists of a set of empires that have a
combined size 1      F ; plus two partitions (P; R) of the free world which itself has a combined
size F . We solve for this equilibrium political structure in two steps. First, we determine
the political structure of the free world (P; R) for a given size F . Second, we determine the
number and size of empires and therefore the size of the free world F .


       4.1.1 The Free World

The analysis of the free world is essentially the same as in the previous section. The only
di¤erence is that now the combined size of the free world is F rather than 1. E¢ cient
bargaining ensures that free localities choose the optimal political structure. Equation (11)
still applies and, as a result, there are two cases to consider: S = U and S < U = F . The
optimal country sizes in these cases are still given by Equations (12) and (13), respectively.15
       The union of the free world is preferred now if and only if:
                                        p                  p
                                   +2             F +2         (        ).                             (19)

Condition (19) generalizes Condition (14) for the case of a free world of size F . The main
di¤erence is that empires reduce the size of the free world, and this reduces the welfare
associated with a union of free localities. This union still costs           to each member. But it is
now less e¢ cient at removing border e¤ects, F instead of .

  14
     Historically, great powers have in fact cooperated and agreed on explicit partitions of the world, from
the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494 to the Berlin Conference in 1884.
  15
     We now assume that > F 2 +            to ensure that countries are always smaller than the free world.




                                                    18
       4.1.2 Empires

Core localities must …rst decide whether to wage war to build an empire or to forego war
and enter the free world. We start the analysis with two observations. First, the equilibrium
political structure features symmetric empires. Let E denote the size of each of them. The
second observation is that constraint (17) is always binding. From the perspective of the
metropolis, there is no reason not to add additional colonies. This lowers the cost of govern-
ment and facilitates trade without creating any preference mismatch (for the metropolis) in
the provision of public services.
       These two observations imply that the welfare of a core locality that builds an empire is:

                      Wl = W E (E) =          + (1        + E)          E           !.                  (20)
                                                                              E

This welfare does not depend on what other core localities do. This follows from our as-
sumption that        < , which ensures that core localities can …nd their desired measure of
colonies without having to …ght each other. The size of the empire trades o¤ preference
heterogeneity against both economies of scale and facilitating trade:
                                                   s
                                            E =                 ,                                       (21)


where E is the optimal empire size (for the the core localities).16
       Comparing Equation (21) to Equations (12) and (13), we see immediately that empires
are larger than peaceful countries. The reason is that the metropolis does not internalize
the cost of the preference mismatch imposed on the colonies: hence,                    appears instead of
  in the denominator. The equilibrium size of empires is increasing with economies of scale
( ) and the importance of trade (         ), and it is decreasing with preference heterogeneity ( ).
These comparative statics are the same as for countries. We now have the additional result
that the smaller the size of the metropolis relative to that of the colonies ( ), the larger the
empire.
       When are empires formed? If core localities wage war and build empires, their welfare
is W E (E ). If core localities instead agree to refrain from waging war and choose to form
countries and unions by e¢ cient bargaining, their welfare is max W F (S1 ; S1 ) ; W F (S2 ; 1) .

  16                                           2
    Equation (21) assumes that        > ( = ) + , so that there is enough preference heterogeneity to
ensure that the metropolis is smaller than the whole core and a fortiori the empire is smaller than the whole
world.

                                                     19
If W E (E ) < max W F (S1 ; S1 ) ; W F (S2 ; 1) , there are no empires, diplomacy rules and the
size of the free world is F = 1. If instead W E (E ) > max W F (S1 ; S1 ) ; W F (S2 ; 1) , there
are = ( E ) empires of size E , and the size of the free world is reduced to F = 1                               = .17
Some algebra shows that empires are built if:
                             p                              n            p                        p    o
               !+       +2       (            )       min           +2           (       ); + 2            .      (22)

Unsurprisingly, empires are built in equilibrium if the military technology is good enough,
i.e., the cost of waging war (!) is low and the metropolis ( ) small relative to the empire.
       To sum up, Condition (22) determines whether empires are built or not, and thus the
size of the free world. Then, Condition (19) determines whether the free world is organized
in a single-level governance structure or a two-level one.


4.2     Globalization and Political Structure

Let us now return to the question of how globalization a¤ects political structure. Figure 4
shows again how equilibrium political structure depends on the two parameters that measure
economies of scope and globalization, i.e.                and . There is an age of empires if and only if
the following condition holds:
                                    p             p                 p
                                 !<2                            U                    U   .                        (23)

Otherwise, empires are never built and the world is ruled by law and diplomacy.
       The dashed line in Figure 4 shows a scenario in which initially the whole world is free
and there is no union. As globalization reaches a …rst threshold value                            L   > 0, empires are
formed. Eventually, as globalization reaches a a second threshold value                           H   < , empires are
abandoned and a world union is formed. This evolution is not generic, though. A necessary
and su¢ cient condition for          L   > 0 is that:
                                                      p            p
                                             !+2                 >2          .                                    (24)

  17
     We see here the role played by the assumption that core localities cooperate. If core locali-
ties choose empires noncooperatively, there might be equilibria in which empires are formed when
max W F (S1 ; S1 ) ; W F (S2 ; 1) > W E (E ) > max W F (S1 ; S1 ) ; W F (S2 ; 1        = ) . If core localities
expect other core localities to build empires, their best response is to build an empire themselves. Once this
happens, there is no incentive to deviate. This equilibrium is a coordination failure since it lowers the welfare
of all the localities in the world. One can also construct equilibria with mixed strategies in which some core
localities build empires and others do not. We ignore theses complications to simplify our analysis.

Figure 4: Globalization, Con‡ict and Political Structure. The …gure shows how equilibrium
political structure depends on economies of scope ( ) and globalization ( ).

If this condition holds, core localities do not conquer colonies just to share the …xed cost of
government. Thus, core localities choose to forego warfare in autarky. It is only after the
gains from trade have grown enough that empires become cost-e¤ective from the point of
view of the metropolis.
       Also, a necessary and su¢ cient condition for                    H   <    is that:
                                            p                                           p
                                 !+2            (              )>               +2          .                 (25)

If this condition holds, there is a level of globalization at which the preference mismatch
has grown large enough within the metropolis to justify a move to the two-level governance
structure. Paradoxically, the cause of imperial collapse at a late stage of globalization is
exactly the same as the cause for the rise of empires at an early stage. Namely, the desire
to remove border e¤ects and reap the gains from trade. It is just that, at some point, it
becomes more cost-e¢ cient to replace conquered colonies with free partners in a union.18

  18
     To simplify the analysis, we have ruled out by assumption the possibility that empires form economic
unions. Yet, under mild assumptions, this can be obtained as a result. For example, suppose that core
localities can impose their preferred political
                                         p       structure, including economic unions, onto the rest of the

prefer diplomacy than war both in autarky and when the world union is in place. Hence, economic unions

Figure 5: Countries, Empires and Unions. The …gure shows how the world political structure
changes with globalization ( ). The black line is the size of peaceful countries, the red line
is the size of empires, the green line is the world union.

         Figure 5 depicts this three-stage evolution of the world political structure by plotting
the equilibrium size of empires, free countries, and unions. At low levels of globalization
(        <   L ),   the world contains only free countries. There are no empires or unions. As
globalization proceeds, the size of countries grows. When globalization crosses the …rst
threshold (          L     <   <   H ),   core localities prefer to build empires. Empires are larger than
countries and keep growing as globalization proceeds. Eventually, globalization crosses the
second threshold ( >               H ).   Empires collapse and countries revert to a smaller size. A world
union is created. After this, there are no further changes in political structure.19
         Up to this point, we have focused exclusively on the e¤ects of globalization ( ). But our
model has other interesting parameters that capture preference heterogeneity ( ), the costs

    19
    Figure 5 depicts the case in which, during the age of empires, the free world always adopts a single-
level governance structure and the shift to the two-level governance structure coincides with the collapse of
empires. This need not be the case. If the size of the free world is large enough, an economic union of free
countries co-exists with empires.

of government ( ; ; ) and military technology (!; ; ). Could changes in any of these
parameters generate the three-stage evolution in political structure shown in Figure 5? It is
not di¢ cult to show that there is no change in any single parameter that would do so. For
example, Figure 6 shows how equilibrium political structure depends on the cost of war and
globalization, i.e. ! and . Changes in the cost of war, i.e. vertical movements for given ,
can explain the rise of empires or the switch to peaceful countries or unions. But they cannot
explain a three-stage evolution, from countries to empires and from empires to unions.


4.3    Gradualism and Regionalism

War and conquest do not overturn our main result that globalization generates a shift in
the world political structure from single-level governance to a two-level structure. Moreover,
they explain why the creation and expansion of empires causes con‡ict and aggression during
the …rst wave of globalization. Our model also explains why the formation of unions during
the second wave of globalization promotes peace.
      Perhaps the most unrealistic aspects of our model are its lack of regionalism and its
lack of gradualism. If core localities join a union, it is a world union. If a world union is
created, country size is reduced at once to its autarky level. However, these predictions are
not robust to a slightly richer treatment of geography. Assume that, in addition to having

a superior military technology, core localities are near each other. Transportation costs for
core-core trade are                  (with    > 0), so that the gains from core-core trade are now                         + .
Transportation costs for core-periphery and periphery-periphery trade remain , so the gains
from these types of trade are still . The rest of our assumptions remain the same.20
       With this additional assumption, a mixed political structure with two-level governance
in the core and single-level governance in the periphery becomes possible. Figure 7, which
assumes a large enough value for , shows a scenario in which globalization triggers a four-fold
evolution. The …rst stage is peaceful single-level governance. The second is the creation of
colonial empires through which the core conquers and rules distant localities in the periphery.
As globalization proceeds further, empires become overstretched and collapse, and a peaceful
union replaces them. The novelty of this third stage is that, unlike in Figure 4, this is now

  20
    Appendix A.5 provides a full analysis of this model. Here we just state the new results it generates.
Technically, the key implication of this new assumption is that Equation (4) must be replaced by:
                                                   Z    1                                            Z

core trade, ( + ), than for either core-periphery or periphery-periphery trade,          . Other things equal,
core localities prefer sharing economic regulation with other core localities. Periphery localities, instead, are
indi¤erent about which localities they share regulation with and care only about their total number.



                                                                  24
a core union. Only as globalization progresses further a fourth and …nal stage is reached in
which the whole world forms a union.
      The model can be further extended in fruitful ways. One extension is a world with two,
three or N peripheries that are located progressively farther away. In this world, there is
a union that starts at the core and grows outwardly with globalization. When the …rst
periphery joins the union, the size of its countries declines. When the second periphery joins
the union, the size of its countries also declines, and so on. The union gradually advances
outward and it keeps breaking up countries. The end point is the same as in our baseline
model, but the world approaches it gradually.
      Another extension is a world with two or more core-periphery structures, which we can
think of as continents or regions. In this world, within each region there is one union
that advances outward, breaking up countries. Across regions, however, there is no union
initially. Eventually, globalization may go so far that a world union becomes cost-e¤ective,
and the regional unions merge. The world approaches the same end point again, but it now
approaches it both gradually and regionally.


           5   Historical Evidence on Trade, Conflict and Country Size

Our theory provides a new perspective on the connection between trade, con‡ict, country
size and the emergence of international unions. Our motivation for developing this theory
was to improve our understanding of global trends, as presented in Figure 1. But the
mechanisms that connect trade and country size over time should also be at work when
we compare the trajectories of di¤erent countries. Thus, we now examine cross-country
historical data in search for evidence on their empirical relevance. The results, though
far from being conclusive, suggest that the mechanisms our theory highlights are indeed
empirically relevant.


5.1    Trade and Country Size

The most fundamental implication of our theory is that changes in country size should be
driven, at least in part, by changes in the volume of trade. In particular, the most novel
result of our model is that increases in the volume of trade should predict increases in
country size until the formation of international unions, and possibly decreases in country

size afterwards.21 This reversal in the connection between changes in trade and changes
country size is what di¤erentiates our theory from others. Since international unions start to
play an important role after World War II, we expect to …nd a positive correlation between
trade and country size before World War II, which however becomes smaller, or even turns
negative, after 1945.
       To test this prediction, we use the Cross-National Time-Series (CNTS) Data Archive.
This dataset contains land area and information on the volume of trade, measured as the
sum of imports and export per capita, for an unbalanced panel of countries with obser-
vations from 1870 to 2010.22 Using this dataset, Figure 8 shows the average land area of
“internationally recognized”countries and of thirteen major empires since 1830. The size of
both countries and empires increases until the appearance of international unions and falls
thereafter. Empires, besides being larger than countries, start reducing their size somewhat

  21
      In our model, trade eventually triggers the formation of international unions, and at that point country
size falls discontinuously. Yet, given that countries join unions gradually, more trade may still raise the size
of countries that are not part of unions.
   22
      Before 1870, trade data is missing for the majority of countries.

later than countries. This picture is consistent with the data on the number of countries
shown in Figure 1. Despite the di¤erent data sources, both …gures tell a remarkably sim-
ilar story.23 During the nineteenth century there was a phase of political concentration in
which countries and empires expanded their territories. But this trend reversed during the
twentieth century, and especially after World War II.
       Table 1 contains descriptive statistics for the main variables of interest. For each decade,
it reports the number of countries with non-missing observations, their average land area, the
share of countries that expanded their territories, the average change in the volume of trade
and its standard deviation. Given that all years corresponding to the two world wars have
no observations in the dataset, the decades around 1940 are missing. A quick look at Table
1 con…rms the basic trends already discussed. Average land area increases in the …rst part of
the sample, but this trend is clearly reversed after 1950. Accordingly, the share of countries
expanding their territories falls dramatically after 1950. Average trade grows throughout

    Figure 8 is based on the “International System”(Singer and Small 1966), which includes countries with
international recognition and reliable data. See Appendix A.1 for more details. This classi…cation however
underestimates the number of independent political entities in the nineteenth-century developing world.
Figure 1 is instead based on Butcher and Gri¢ ths (2013), who provide a more comprehensive record.

the entire period, but at di¤erent speeds both over the decades and across countries.
       Given that land area changes slowly and discontinuously, we focus on decades and build a
dummy variable that takes value 1 if a country or empire has grown in size over the previous
ten years. We interpret this variable as the “probability” of a change in country size or
territorial expansion. To study how this probability depends on the change in the volume
of trade, we run a series of binomial regressions. To alleviate simultaneity, we compute
the change in the volume of trade over the previous decade. Furthermore, to test if the
correlation between trade and territorial expansion changes after World War II, we include
an interaction term between changes in the volume of trade and a post-1950 dummy.
       We use territorial expansions rather than territorial contractions because of data quality.
Almost by de…nition, for any territorial expansion there are one or more corresponding
territorial contractions.24 But most territorial expansions occur in core countries, for which
data are abundant and reliable. Instead, most territorial contractions occur in periphery
countries, for which data are scarce and unreliable.25
       The main results are reported in Table 2. Standard errors are corrected for clustering
by country, so as to accommodate autocorrelated shocks at the country level. In columns 1
to 4, we start by excluding the interwar years and estimate a logit model. Initially, we only
include as regressors the lagged change in the volume of trade and its interaction with the
post-1950 dummy. Consistent with our theory, the coe¢ cient for the lagged change in trade
is positive, the interaction term is negative, and both are highly signi…cant. Next, we also
include the post-1950 dummy. The inclusion of the constant and the post-1950 dummy mean
that the identifying variation is deviations from the global trends visible in Figures 1 and
8. Nevertheless, the two coe¢ cients of interest remain signi…cant. We then add sequentially
the level of population and urbanization at the beginning of each decade. The …rst variable
controls for the e¤ect of size while the second is a proxy for economic development, and both
are likely to be correlated with the military strength of a country.26 Both coe¢ cients are
positive and signi…cant, but their inclusion does not a¤ect the trade variables.
       In column 5 we maximize sample size by adding all available decades and a time dummy
for the interwar period. Although the coe¢ cient for trade falls in size, it remains signi…cantly
di¤erent from zero. In columns 6 we add time dummies. While time dummies control for

  24
     Basically all of the relevant territories were already claimed by some country in 1870. Therefore, for
each country that expands, there must be one or more countries that contract (or even disappear).
  25
     We performed all the regressions that follow also for territorial contractions. Unsurprisingly given the
low quality of the data, none of the variables was signi…cative in any of the regressions.

     More direct measures, such as GDP, are not available for the entire period of analysis.

shocks a¤ecting all countries, including to some extent globalization, they do not a¤ect our
main results. In fact, the coe¢ cients for the trade variables become even more signi…cant.
In column 7 we add country …xed e¤ects. This speci…cation is exceedingly demanding: all
countries with no changes in size are dropped and the coe¢ cients are identi…ed only from
within-country deviations from country-speci…c trends. Nonetheless, trade and its interac-
tion with the post-1950 dummy are the only two coe¢ cients that remain highly signi…cant.
    Interpreting the magnitude of the coe¢ cients in a logit model is di¢ cult. Moreover, esti-
mating a …xed-e¤ect model for non-linear regressions can be problematic. For these reasons,
and as an additional robustness check, in columns 8-9 we re-estimate the speci…cations in 6-7

nitude implies that a doubling in the volume of trade during the previous decades increases
the probability of a territorial expansion in a decade before 1950 by around 8%.


5.2   Conflict and Country Size

Another distinctive implication of our analysis is that territorial changes should be associated
with con‡ict before international unions are created, but should be peaceful afterwards. Our
model does not merely account for the switch from a pre-war age of expanding countries and
con‡ict to a post-war era of shrinking countries and peace. The more novel element that
di¤erentiates our theory from others is that in the age of international unions even increases
in country size should no longer re‡ect con‡ict and military might.

       We start exploring the empirical support for this prediction by testing if our proxies for
military strength, population and urbanization, have a di¤erent e¤ect in the two sample
periods. To this end, in Table 3 we split the sample and re-estimate the speci…cations with
and without time e¤ects (corresponding to columns 5 and 6 in Table 2) separately for the
decades before 1940 (columns 1-2) and after 1950 (columns 5-6). To use a more direct proxy
of military strength, in columns 3-4 and 7-8 we also replace population with the size of a
country’s armed forces.27 Consistent with our theory, all these proxies for military strength
have much larger and more signi…cant coe¢ cients in the pre-1940 period. The results in
Table 3 also allow a direct comparison of the net e¤ect of trade on territorial expansion in
the two sub-periods. Not only we …nd that the growth in trade predicts subsequent territorial
expansions in the per 1940 period, but also that the coe¢ cient turns negative, and sometimes
statistically signi…cant, after 1950.
       Finally, we complement this statistical analysis with more descriptive evidence. Figure 9

    This is the military variable with the highest coverage in the dataset. Its correlation with population

displays the share of territorial changes that involved military con‡ict among all territorial
changes recorded over a period of ten years before and after each date, from the Correlates
of War project. Consistent with our theory, the …gure clearly shows that the end of World
War II marks a structural break: before 1950, more than one third of all territorial disputes
were decided by war, while after that date diplomacy prevailed in almost 90% of cases.


                                       6   Narratives

We have shown that the expansion of trade opportunities can help explain two salient aspects
of the evolution of political structure over the last couple of centuries: (i) the rise and
subsequent fall in the size of countries observed during the nineteenth and twentieth century,
and (ii) the seemingly contradictory trends towards more political integration across countries
and more political fragmentation within countries in the second half of the twentieth century.
We have also provided some historical evidence in support of this claim.
   We conclude the paper, on a more speculative vein, by showing how our theory can help
interpret historical events.

European History Since the late Middle Ages, European sovereign states on average grew
in size until the end of the nineteenth century, when this trend was dramatically reversed.
For example, Kitamura and Lagerlöf (2016) show that borders declined monotonically from
1500 to 1900, and then started to increase. Medieval Europe was fragmented into hundreds
of small states at a time when trade was costly, insecure and limited to few commodities.
The early modern period saw important changes in both the economic and the political
organization of the continent. With the Commercial Revolution, trade began to ‡ourish and
the feudal system started to be replaced by a smaller number of countries of growing size.
While in 1600 there were 112 sovereign states in Europe and the Near East, at the beginning
of 1800 the number had fallen to 79.
   The Industrial Revolution gave trade an even more prominent role and triggered ma-
jor changes in socioeconomic conditions that ultimately made the rise of the nation state
possible. Trade expansion was enabled by the introduction of canals, improved roads and
railways. At the same time, the high degree of political fragmentation at the time of the
Congress of Vienna (1815) was followed by the uni…cation of Germany and Italy (1871) and
the further consolidation of other nation states. The economic rationale of building large
internal markets was especially evident in the case of German uni…cation, which started

                                               32
with the formation of a customs union (Zollverein). This process of political centralization
culminated at the beginning of the twentieth century, when Europe was dominated by just
28 independent states.
   Yet, the twentieth century marks a turning point. Europe entered a stage of political
fragmentation, with the number of independent states growing to 58 in 2000. Simultaneously,
the process of creating the European Union (EU) started. The core-periphery model shows
that international unions start from countries that have closer economic ties and expands
outward as globalization increases the value of trade with more remote locations as well.
This prediction is consistent with the history of the EU. In 1957, Belgium, France, Italy,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany signed the Treaty of Rome establishing the
European Economic Community (EEC) as a customs union. The EEC gradually expanded
to include nearby countries: Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom in 1973, Greece in
1981, Portugal and Spain in 1986. In 1992, the Maastricht Treaty converted the EEC into
the EU and, in 1995, Austria, Finland, and Sweden joined. In 2002, the Euro was launched
and since then the EU has grown to include 28 member states in 2013. Over this period,
the union has grown in size and scope.
   In June 2016, however, the United Kingdom voted in a referendum to leave the union and
there is a concern that other countries might follow in the future. While rising nationalism
might have played a role, it is instructive to look at these events from the lens of our model.
Three lessons can be learned. First, the value of union membership is proportional to the
economic ties between countries. These are stronger for countries located in the core of
continental Europe. For instance, while almost 80% of Belgium’s total exports are delivered
to other EU partners, the same …gure is around 50% for the United Kingdom. Second,
our model provides a rationale for trade-promoting unions. As more power is shifted to
the union in other areas such as migration, tension may arise, especially in countries with
a strong national identity. These two observations may explain why some UK politicians
have advanced the idea of replacing the EU market with a Commonwealth free-trade zone.
Third, the model suggests that the value of joining the union is proportional to its size. As
a country exits, the economic foundations of the union become more fragile.

The Rise and Fall of Colonial Empires The pattern of an initial decline and subsequent
increase in the number of countries is not con…ned to Europe only. For instance, the number
of African countries fell from 36 in 1816 to 4 in 1914, to rise again to 51 in 2000. Similarly,
in South-East Asia, these numbers changed from 37 to 4 and then 20 in the years 1816,


                                              33
1914 and 2000, respectively.28 However, to better interpret the political evolutions in these
regions, it is important to bring con‡ict into the picture.
       In our model of war and conquest, empires are built to extract trade surplus from the
colonies and disappear when the union is formed to foster free markets. According to his-
torians and in line with this view, one of the key driving forces behind colonial expansion
was the desire to secure trade and access to scarce resources in an era of revived commerce,
but when mercantilist practices where common. In fact, for much of the second millennium,
states deployed force to create markets (Findlay and O’Rourke, 2007). Due to the scarcity
of land and the desire to avoid powerful rivals, European great powers expanded by con-
quering territories overseas. The role of colonial powers in enforcing trade within the empire
but not outside was very clear in the case of maritime commerce. On the one hand, large
naval forces were built to control and protect trading routes; on the other hand, privateers
were often authorized to capture merchant ships belonging to enemy nations. Despite some
notable setbacks, colonialism continued to grow prior to World War I and …nally collapsed
after World War II.
       The sharp decline of empires started after the creation of international agreements aimed
at promoting economic cooperation. This is no coincidence. In the words of Rosecrance
(1986) and Spruyt (2005), empires dissolved, often peacefully, because the gains through
commerce displaced gains through territorial acquisition.29 There is also evidence that in-
ternational organizations played a direct role in the process of decolonization. For example,
in 1960 the UN General Assembly voted the Declaration on the Granting of Independence
to Colonial Countries and Peoples. Interestingly, our model of regional unions is consistent
with the very di¤erent patterns of geographic expansions of empires and unions. As long as
war is the dominant means of territorial expansion, the European Great Powers try to avoid
con‡ict with each other by conquering far-away colonies and building global empires. Yet,
once trade is enforced by peaceful international unions, countries seek economic integration
with proximate partners, with whom the gains from trade are higher. The switch from global
empires to regional unions is also consistent with the increased regionalization of world trade
patterns observed in the data (e.g., Fouquin and Hugot 2016).

  28
    The number of countries is taken from Butcher and Gri¢ ths (2013).
  29
    Bonfatti (2012) also attributes the fall of empires to the growing importance of trade between industrial
countries relative to trade with colonies.

The United States Improvements in transportation technology and the desire to create
a large internal market were important factors in its westward expansion. The abundance
of land made it possible to create one of the largest countries in the world, without the
need to seek far-away colonies. Despite its size, the United States avoided the phase of
collapse and political fragmentation by choosing an institutional system with multiple levels
of government. In this light, the experience of the United States follows the main pattern
predicted by our theory: the creation and expansion of the federal government, which can be
interpreted as a regional union, coincided with the fragmentation and loss of political power
of individual states.
   After the Declaration of Independence, the borders of the original thirteen states extended
up to the Mississippi river, while the remaining land was occupied by French and Spanish
colonies (later on part of Mexico) and by many tribes of native Americans living essentially
in autarky. As the federal government acquired land and built roads westward, its territory
was gradually fragmented into the …fty states. This process followed a common pattern.
First, new land was annexed as large “territories;” subsequently this land was broken into
new states. Federal expansion was followed not just by the creation of new states, but also
by the break-up of existing ones. For example, Georgia, Massachusetts, North Carolina and
Virginia all lost land to form new states. So did the former Republic of Texas (an independent
country until 1846), which encompassed large parts of current Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado,
Wyoming and New Mexico. This pattern is consistent with our core-periphery model, in
which the outward expansion of the core union breaks up countries in the periphery.

A.1   Data Sources

The trade share reported in Figure 1 is merchandise exports as percent of GDP in 1990
prices, from Maddison (2001). Maddison provides trade data for selected countries in the
years 1820, 1870, 1913, 1929, 1950, 1973 and 1998. To avoid compositional e¤ects, we report
the value of merchandise export as a share of GDP for the set of countries with data for all
the years (Austria, Belgium, France, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the
United States). The trade share computed using the data for all available countries in every
year is very similar to the one displayed in Figure 1.
   The number of countries is reported for the same years. Data on the number of countries
in the twentieth century is not very controversial. For the nineteenth century, however,
some leading conventions grossly underestimate the number of countries. For example, the
“International System,”developed by Singer and Small (1966) and adopted in the Correlates
of War project or in the Cross-National Time-Series Data Archive, only includes countries
with international recognition. In particular, prior to 1920, the criteria to be recognized
as an independent country were to have population greater than 500,000 and to have had
diplomatic missions at or above the rank of chargé d’a¤aires with Britain and France. Clearly,
this de…nition is too strict for our purposes, which require the identi…cation of even relatively
small political units living in economic and political autarky. We follow Butcher and Gri¢ ths
(2013), who recognize the problem and o¤er alternative criteria to identify the number of
countries between 1816 and 2011.
   The number of WTO members is from the WTO website.
   The size of countries and empires displayed in Figure 8 is from the Cross-National Time-
Series Data Archive (CNTS). It provides data on contiguous territorial area in thousand
square miles for all countries existing in a given year according to the International State
System. In a few instances, missing data have been imputed cross-checking major territorial
changes from other sources (China and Persia before 1860). Area of empire is provided for
a consistent sample of 13 countries: Austria (formerly Austria-Hungary), Belgium, France,
Germany (formerly Prussia), Italy (formerly Sardinia), Japan, Netherlands, Portugal, Rus-
sia, Spain, Turkey (formerly the Ottoman Empire), United Kingdom, and United States.
For these countries, empire area includes “overseas” territories (i.e., colonies). Data for the
two World War periods, 1914-1918 and 1940-1945 (1938-1954 for Empires) are missing.
   For the analysis in Section 5, the volume of trade is computed as the value of imports


                                               40
plus exports per capita. Population is in millions. Urbanization is aggregate population in
cities of 100,000 and over divided by total population. For empires, trade, population and
urbanization refer to the metropolis only. Land area includes oversea territories.
   The number of independent states in Europe and Near East reported in Section 5 is taken
from Euratlas-Nüssli (http://www.euratlas.com).

                         0       0


where ql (m; i) and pl (m; i) are the production and price of input m of industry i in locality
l. The productions ql (m; i) must be consistent with available technology as described in
the text. Since individuals are atomistic, they take prices as given in their maximization
problems.
   We claim now that equilibrium prices are given as follows:
                                     8
                                     >
                                     >          if l = m
                                     < 1
                   pl (m; i) =                                    R                            (A3)
                                       e        if i 2 [0; ] and Il=m =0
                                     >
                                     >
                                     : e                          R
                                                if i 2 ( ; 1] or Il=m = 1 but l 6= m.

To prove this claim, normalize world income to unity (Y = 1). Note …rst that each locality
has unit density of expenditure on each input in each industry. We next examine production.
Consider …rst industries that require contract enforcement, i 2 [0; ]. Locality l employs unit
                                                               R
density of labor to produce each non-traded input m for which Il=m = 0. Thus, output of
each non-traded input has density e , so the value of output has unit density given price e .
                    R1 R
The remaining mass 0 Il=m  dm of industry-i labor is employed to produce an identical mass
of output. Unit density of it is sold domestically at a unit price. The remainder is shipped
                                               R
in identical amounts to other localities with Il=m = 1, each of which receives a density e
of imports, hence import value of unit density given price e . In industries that do not


                                                                   41
require contract enforcement, i 2 ( ; 1], the whole unit mass of industry-i labor is employed
to produce the locality’s own input variety, which is sold in identical amounts to all other
localities in the world. Thus, the value of sales in each locality of each input in each industry
has unit density, just like expenditure. This proves our claim.30
    With these prices at hand, we can compute the equilibrium productions and consumptions
described in the text.


A.3    Discussion of Assumptions

The starting point of our analysis is the idea that improvements in transportation technology
are a major driver of globalization, which we model as a fall in trade costs between localities.
This view is uncontroversial: there is overwhelming evidence that the secular rise in trade
volumes was made possible by better transportation technologies. For instance, some of the
major drivers of the …rst wave of globalization are the adoption of the steamship (Pascali
2017), the telegraph (Steinwender 2018) and the spread of railroads (Donaldson 2018). Like-
wise, the main drivers of the second wave of globalization include the use of containerization
in ocean shipping (Levinson 2006), the development of jet aircraft engines (Hummels 2007)
and more recently the ICT revolution. All these innovations promoted trade both between
and within countries.
    We also assume that borders obstruct trade. The large negative e¤ect of political borders
on trade volumes is well know at least since the work of McCallum (1995), who showed that,
controlling for distance and income, trade between two Canadian provinces is 20 times larger
than trade between a Canadian province and a U.S. state. While the exact magnitude of the
border e¤ect is still subject to debate, all existing studies coincide in …nding large e¤ects.
For instance, in a recent survey of the voluminous empirical literature on gravity equations,
Head and Mayer (2014) report that countries are typically found to trade 5 to 7 times more
with themselves than with any other country.
    There is equally strong evidence that sharing economic regulations and signing economic
agreements promote trade and reduce the border e¤ect. For instance, Head and Mayer
(2014) also report that sharing a common currency or being part of a free trade area are
associated on average with a doubling of the volume of trade; similarly, Helpman et al.

  30
     It is straightforward to show that this equilibrium is unique. First, rule out variation in the prices of
traded inputs since this would generate excess demand (supply) of cheap (expensive) varieties. Second, rule
out that the relative prices of traded and nontraded varieties be above (below) = since this would lead to
an excess demand (supply) of nontraded inputs.


                                                     42
(2008) …nd that having a similar legal system increases the bilateral volume of trade by
more than 60 percent. Using a simple model, Anderson and van Wincoop (2004) attempt a
rough decomposition of the border e¤ect. They argue that the compounded cost of borders is
equivalent to an ad valorem tax of 44 percent, which can be broken down into an 8 percent of
policy related barriers (including non-tari¤ barriers), 7 percent language barriers, 14 percent
currency barriers, 6 percent information cost barriers, and 3 percent security barriers.
       Our modeling assumption that technological barriers reduce trade along the intensive
margin while policy-induced barriers a¤ect the extensive margin is also grounded in empirical
evidence. There is a wide consensus that transportation costs a¤ect signi…cantly the intensive
margin of trade; on the other hand, Helpman et al. (2008) and Dutt et al. (2013) …nd that
free-trade agreements and WTO membership predominantly a¤ect the extensive margin.
       Turning next to governments, our model follows the standard assumptions that under-
pin the literature on federalism and the architecture of government since Oates (1972).31
Having separate local governments enables better preference matching, but sharing a com-
mon government enables bene…cial policy coordination and reaps economies of scale. While
these assumptions originated as simple observations of real-world patterns, models of po-
litical economy have provided them with rigorous micro-foundations. Majority rule makes
centralization costly when localities have di¤erent preferences (Lockwood 2002; Besley and
Coate 2003). Frictions in bargaining between political leaders (Harstad 2007) and in their
agency relationship to their constituents (Bo¤a, Piolatto and Ponzetto 2016) explain both
why multiple local government cannot fully coordinate their policies and why a single central
government cannot fully tailor public services to local preferences. Accordingly, Strumpf and
Oberholzer-Gee (2002) …nd empirically that U.S. states with more heterogeneous preferences
are more likely to decentralize policy-making, while Lassen and Serritzlew (2011) show that
municipal amalgamations cause citizens to experience a worse …t between what they want and
what they get from local government. Evidence from sub-national governments also con…rms
the existence of economies of scale in government administration, albeit— consistent with our
model— not in the provision of public goods more broadly (Reingewertz 2012; Blom-Hansen,
Houlberg, Serritzlew 2014; Blom-Hansen et al. 2016; Blesse and Baskaran 2016).
       Our assumption of economies of scope in government is equally classic (Musgrave 1971;

  31
    The same forces that operate in our model at the national and supra-national level should also apply
at the sub-national level. We could explore this issue further by introducing a third set of government
functions that would justify a three-level governance structure. We conjecture that, in this setting, increasing
globalization would explain simultaneously the creation of international unions and the trend towards greater
federalism within countries.

Dahl and Tufte 1973; Alesina and Spolaore 2003). Marks and Hooghe (2004, p. 18) “em-
phasize the costs of decomposing authority” as a paramount concern in the analysis of
multi-level governance, especially in the international arena with its prevalence of intersect-
ing task-speci…c jurisdictions. Empirical evidence shows that multiplying administrative
tiers reduces their e¢ ciency, and is particularly associated with lower labor productivity and
excess government employment (Le Galès and John 1997; Andrews and Boyne 2009). This
cost is particularly pronounced for special-purpose governments in charge of a single task
(Berry 2009). These e¢ ciency losses re‡ect both the costs of administrative duplication and
economies of scope in political accountability. Bo¤a, Piolatto and Ponzetto (2016) show the-
oretically that dividing policy-making responsibilities across multiple levels of government
increases overall rent extraction by government o¢ cials. Fan, Lin and Treisman (2009) re-
port that across countries corruption increases with the number of administrative tiers: as
they rise from two to six, the probability of a …rm reporting that it is never expected to pay
bribes falls by 32 percentage points.32


A.4      Dealing with Integer Constraints

A world without unions consists of N 2 N countries. Country n consists of measure Sn > 0
                        P                                                 PN
of localities, such that N
                         n=1 Sn = 1 and utilitarian social welfare is W =
                                                                                   F
                                                                           n=1 Sn W (Sn ; Sn ).
       The welfare function

                          W F (Sn ; Sn ) =      + (1          + Sn )         Sn                           (A4)
                                                                                   Sn

is concave in Sn and increasing at Sn = 0. Whenever                 >    +        it has a unique maximum
at Sn = S1 .
       Pareto e¢ ciency then requires that either Sn           S1 for all n = 1; 2; :::; N or Sn        S1 for
all n. Otherwise some localities could leave a country with excessive size Sn > S1 and join
another with insu¢ cient size Sn < S1 , raising the welfare of every locality in both countries.
       Utilitarian welfare maximization requires all countries to have the same size. If there are
two countries m and n such that Sm > Sn > S1 , then transferring the marginal locality from
m to n not only raises its welfare, but it also raises the welfare of Sm localities by more than

  32
    Admittedly, the evidence about the importance of economies of scope has been gathered mostly at the
sub-national level. Casual observation suggests, however, that economies of scope also apply at the supra-
national level. A notorious example is the European Central Bank, which is aimed at reducing the border
e¤ect by eliminating currency barriers. Its creation does not seem to have reduced the size or costs of national
central banks, but instead it seems to have just added to these costs.


                                                      44
it lowers the welfare of Sn < Sm localities. Likewise if Sm < Sn < S1 .
   Therefore, once integer constraints are taken into account, the utilitarian welfare optimum
without unions is a partition of the world into a number


                        N1 = arg max              +       1      +                         N                          (A5)
                                     N 2N                            N            N

of identical countries. The objective function W has strictly decreasing di¤erences in (N; )
because for any     H   >   L   and and NH > NL ,

                                            H      L                                                    H       L
  W (NH ;   H)      W (NH ;     L)   =                 < W (NL ;     H)      W (NL ;       L)   =                   . (A6)
                                            NH                                                           NL

Thus, the welfare-maximizing number of countries N1 is decreasing in                                    in the sense of
monotone comparative statics. It is likewise decreasing in , and increasing in                                and .
   By the same reasoning, the utilitarian welfare optimum with unions is a world union
composed of a number
                                         N2 = arg max                    N                                            (A7)
                                                   N 2N         N
of identical countries.


A.5   Equilibrium Conditions for the General Model

The general model used in this paper is discussed in Section 4.3 when we assume that                                     0
and       0. The model of war and conquest of Section 4 applies in the limit as                                      ! 0,
while the model of diplomacy in Section 3 applies in the limit as                          ! 0 and           ! 0. In this
Appendix, we discuss the di¤erent possible equilibria of the general model.


   A.5.1 Law and Diplomacy

Assume …rst that the core decides to forego warfare and join the free world, so F = 1. Then
we can de…ne the welfare of core localities as:

 W C (SC ; UC ) =       +( +         ) (1        ) + ( UC + min fUC ; g)                       SC               ICU (A8)
                                                                                                        SC

and the welfare of periphery localities as:

                    W P (SP ; UP ) =            + (1          + UP )         SP                 IPU ,                 (A9)
                                                                                      SP


                                                        45
where ICU and IPU are indicator functions that take value 1 if SC = UC and SP = UP ,
respectively, and zero otherwise. Utilitarian social welfare for the entire world equals:

                     W (SC ; SP ; UC ; UP ) = W C (SC ; UC ) + (1                 ) W P (SP ; UP ) .              (A10)

       There are three possible equilibrium political structures. The …rst is a single-level gover-
nance structure with countries of optimal sizes
                                          s                                   s
                                S1C =                            and S1P =                 ,                      (A11)
                                                     ( + )

and without any unions.33 Utilitarian world welfare under this …rst structure is:


  W1        W (S1C ; S1P ; S1C ; S1P )
                                                    n p                                        p            o
                                2
          =      +     +             (1     )   2            [        ( + )] + (1          )       (        ) . (A12)

       The second potential equilibrium is a two-level governance structure with countries of
optimal size                                                          r
                                                    S2C = S2P =                                                   (A13)

and with a world union: UC = UP = 1. Utilitarian world welfare under this second structure
is:
                                                                                     p
                       W2           W (S2C ; S2P ; 1; 1) =        +       +   2
                                                                                    2              .              (A14)

       The third potential equilibrium features a two-level governance structure for the core
with countries of size S3C = S2C and a core union UC = , but a single-level governance
structure for the periphery with countries of size S3P = S1P and no union (UP = S3P ).
Utilitarian world welfare under this third structure is:


  W2        W (S2C ; S2P ; 1; 1)
                                                                 h p                   p                i
                       2                              2
      =    +     +         (1          )+( + )               2            + (1     )           (       )        . (A15)

       The equilibrium political structure under diplomacy is the one that delivers the highest

  33                                       2
    Equation (A11) assumes that >            + ( + ), so that there is enough preference heterogeneity to
ensure that the optimal core country size is always smaller than the entire core.

   A.5.2 War and Conquest

If there are empires, the analysis is as essentially as it was in Section 4 for                          = 0. The welfare
of core localities that form an imperial metropolis is given by:

         Wl = W E (E) =             +( +       ) (1            )+( +         ) E             E              !.     (A23)
                                                                                                    E

The optimal size of empires is larger because so are gains from trade within the metropolis:
                                                    s
                                         E =                                     .                                 (A24)
                                                                    ( +      )

Thus, if core localities build empires their welfare is given by:
                                                                      p
                W E (E ) =           +( +           ) (1        )    2  [                ( +        )]   !.        (A25)

The free world contains a measure F < 1                         of localities in the periphery. In this case, all
the analysis in Section 4 applies and, in particular, Condition (19) still determines whether
the free world has a single or two-level governance structure.
   When are empires formed? In the absence of empires, the welfare of core localities in the
welfare-maximizing political structure is given by:

                                   < W (S1C ; S1C ) if W > max fW ; W g
                        WCF =        W C (S2 ; )               if W 2 > max fW 1 ; W 3 g                           (A26)
                                   >
                                   >

                                           2


If W E (E ) < WCF , there are no empires, diplomacy prevails and the size of the free world is
F = 1. If instead W E (E )             WCF , there are = E empires of size E , and the size of the
free world is reduced to F = 1               = .
   Core localities prefer empires to peaceful countries (W E (E ) > W C (S1C ; S1C )) if:
