Does Medicaid Coverage for Pregnant Women Affect Prenatal Health Behaviors?

                                             ABSTRACT

Despite plausible mechanisms, little research has evaluated potential changes in health behaviors as
a result of the Medicaid expansions of the 1980s and 1990s for pregnant women. Accordingly, we
provide the first national study of the effects of Medicaid on health behaviors for pregnant women.
We exploit exogenous variation from the Medicaid income eligibility expansions for pregnant women
and children during late-1980s through mid-1990s to examine effects on several prenatal health behaviors
and health outcomes using U.S. vital statistics data. We find that increases in Medicaid eligibility
were associated with increases in smoking and decreases in weight gain during pregnancy. Raising
Medicaid eligibility by 12 percentage-points increased rates of any prenatal smoking and smokingmore
than five cigarettes daily by 0.7-0.8 percentage point. Medicaid expansions were associated witha
reduction in pregnancy weight-gain by about 0.6%. These effects diminish at higher levels of eligibility,
which is consistent with crowd-out from private to public insurance. Importantly, our evidence is
consistent with ex-ante moral hazard although income effects are also at play. The worsening of health
behaviors may partly explain why Medicaid expansions have not been associated with substantial
improvement in infant health.

I.     Introduction

       Between 1990 and 2010, the share of births in the U.S. covered by Medicaid increased

from 28% to 44% (Curtin et al, 2013). Much of this increase is due to the expansion of Medicaid

income eligibility thresholds for pregnant women that started in the late 1980s and continued

through the early part of the 1990s. The purpose of expanding Medicaid coverage was to

reduce the rate of uninsured pregnant women, increase use of timely medical care (e.g.,

prenatal care), and improve infant health and narrow socioeconomic disparities in infant health

(National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality 1988). While the logic of the argument

underlying the expansion of Medicaid coverage for pregnant women is intuitive, the evidence

to support its validity is not as strong. Generally, there is evidence that expanded Medicaid

coverage increased the use of prenatal care, but evidence that Medicaid has improved infant

health is less robust (Currie and Gruber 1996; Howell 2001; Centers for Disease Control and

Prevention 2002; Hadley 2003; Levy and Meltzer 2004).

       One possible explanation for this somewhat counterintuitive finding is that health

insurance creates incentives to change health behaviors along with lowering the price of

medical care. Insurance lowers the price of treating an illness, for example, an adverse medical

outcome for either the mother or child, which may cause a reduction in maternal efforts to

prevent the occurrence of such events (ex-ante moral hazard). In addition, Medicaid coverage

entails an income effect from the saved out-of-pocket expenditures and from spending on

health insurance premiums (in the case of substitution of private for public insurance). This

income effect may be used to purchase goods that improve infant health, but also goods that

may harm infant health (e.g., cigarettes).


                                                                                                   3
       Relatively little research has examined potential consequences of expanded Medicaid

coverage on health behaviors of pregnant eligible women. Understanding these effects is of

paramount importance given the large number of births covered under Medicaid and the long-

term consequences of prenatal inputs for child health (Almond and Currie 2011). In this study,

we examine the impact of Medicaid eligibility expansions on the prenatal behaviors and health

indicators of pregnant women. The Medicaid income eligibility expansions for pregnant women

and for children that occurred during the late 1980s through the mid-1990s provide plausibly

exogenous variation in insurance coverage. We assess whether the expansion of Medicaid

eligibility and its associated increase in Medicaid coverage changed pregnant women’s health

behaviors such as smoking and nutrition, as approximated by weight gain during pregnancy. We

also examine other pregnancy-related health indicators that may reflect behavioral

mechanisms such as gestational diabetes and anemia that are related to weight gain, diet and

exercise.

       Understanding whether the expansion of Medicaid affected health behaviors of

pregnant women is particularly important given the documented links between prenatal (in

utero) health and adult outcomes (Almond and Currie, 2011; Currie, 2009). The focus on

Medicaid is especially salient because of relative disadvantage in terms of socioeconomic status

and health of the Medicaid population. For instance, in the sample of women we study, the

prevalence of prenatal smoking among low-educated unmarried mothers was 33% compared

to 3% among higher-educated married mothers.

       Our research also adds to the sparse literature on ex ante moral hazard and extends the

analysis of the effects of Medicaid coverage on health behaviors. While ex ante moral hazard is


                                                                                                 4
nearly always mentioned as a theoretical consequence of health insurance (Cutler and

Zeckhauser 2000; Kenkel 2000), relatively few empirical studies have assessed its importance

and these few studies have not produced a consensus finding. Similarly, while there have been

many studies of the effects of the Medicaid expansions on insurance coverage, health care use

and health, there are only two studies that we are aware of that assess whether the expansions

adversely affected health behaviors: the Oregon Medicaid Experiment (Baicker et al. 2013) and

Bhattacharya et al (2011). Neither of these studies included pregnant women and neither

addressed the potential problems in identifying the ex ante moral hazard effect from an income

effect, or accounted for the indirect effect of health insurance on behaviors that works through

greater contact with health care providers who provide health information and counseling. We

provide the first national study of the effects of Medicaid on health behaviors, and the first

such study for pregnant women.

       Estimates from this study indicate that expansions in Medicaid eligibility were

significantly associated with increases in smoking and decreases in weight gain during

pregnancy. We also find some suggestive evidence of an increase in gestational diabetes,

which may partly reflect behavioral pathways. Effects are stronger with eligibility expansions at

lower income levels, consistent with the crowd-out effects from private to public coverage at

higher income levels. Our effect sizes are relatively large, but are plausible given the size of the

potential income and moral hazard effects that are likely mechanisms. However, income effects

are not large enough to explain the entire effect and thus it is likely that there were insurance

induced changes in behavior (i.e., ex ante moral hazard). Finally, we find no evidence that

increased contact with health care providers affected health behaviors.


                                                                                                       5
2.      Relevant Literature

        While the theory underlying ex ante moral hazard is well developed, the empirical

literature is relatively thin, particularly with respect to health insurance, as there is a somewhat

more developed literatures for other types of insurance. 1 There are no studies that we are

aware of that address the issue of ex ante moral hazard in the context of pregnant women.

        Courbage and Coulon (2004) examined the effect of having private health insurance

coverage on smoking and exercise among British Households using both classical and

instrumental variables regression approaches. The authors reported that there were no

differences in health behaviors between the privately insured and those without such

insurance. Card et al. (2008) used a regression discontinuity research approach to study the

effects of obtaining Medicare at age 65 on various health behaviors and preventive healthcare

utilization. They found no significant effects of Medicare on smoking, exercise, or obesity, nor

did they find strong effects on preventive services such as a mammogram. In contrast, Klick

and Stratmann (2007) evaluated whether state mandated private health insurance coverage for

the treatment of diabetes was associated with body mass index among diabetics. Results from

this state-level difference-in-differences study indicated that state mandates, which

presumably lower the price of treating diabetes, was associated with higher body mass index.

        Kelly and Markowitz (2009) and Bhattacharya et al. (2011) assessed whether health

insurance coverage among working adults was associated with body weight. The two studies

reached different conclusions: Kelly and Markowitz (2009) reported a small, positive, but not

statistically significant effect of insurance on body mass index (BMI) and the probability of being

(Ruser 1985, 1991; Kaestner and Carroll 1997; Fortin and Lanoie 2000).

                                                                                                         6
overweight whereas Bhattacharya et al. (2011) reported relatively large effects of insurance on

bodyweight and obesity. Both of these studies used an instrumental variables (IV) approach to

address the non-random selection into insurance coverage.2 Stanciole (2008) also studied the

association between insurance and behaviors and reported that insurance was significantly

associated with greater smoking, less exercise, and more obesity.

        Randomized experiments have also failed to find conclusive evidence. Findings from the

Rand Health Insurance Experiment (RHIE), for instance, indicated that less generous health

insurance did not have any significant or practical effect on health behaviors such as smoking,

drinking, and exercise (Newhouse 1993). Less generous insurance was, however, associated

with decreased use of preventive medical services (secondary prevention). While this latter

finding contradicts the simple intuition that less insurance should cause an increase in

prevention (Lilliard et al. 1986), it is consistent with less generous coverage (i.e., more cost-

sharing) leading to a higher price of preventive medical care relative to primary prevention and

self-protection.

        The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment (Baicker et al. 2013), which enrolled a group of

uninsured low-income adults into Oregon’s Medicaid program by lottery, found increased used

of many preventive medical services, which likely reflects the lower cost of these services as a

result of insurance. However, the study finds no statistically significant impacts on measures of

primary prevention including the probability of being a current smoker and of being obese. The

magnitude of the smoking effect is relatively large (6 percentage points, 13%), positive and

  Kelly and Markowitz (2011) utilize firm size as IVs and also supplement their identification strategy with
internal heteroscedasticity-dependent IVs. Bhattacharya et al. (2011) use firm size, supplemented with
state expansions in the Medicaid eligibility between 1989 and 2004, as IVs.

                                                                                                               7
suggestive of an increase in smoking prevalence subsequent to Medicaid coverage. The p-value

is relatively close to being marginally significant (p=0.18).3

        Dave and Kaestner (2009) is the only study we are aware of that has tried to separate

out the direct ex ante moral hazard effect of insurance from the indirect effects of health

insurance on health behaviors operating through increased contact with healthcare

professionals and shifts in health information and knowledge. Dave and Kaestner (2009) study

the elderly and exploit the age eligibility of Medicare. The authors reported that after

accounting for the effects of greater physician contact, obtaining Medicare was associated with

a worsening of health behaviors, as measured by lower rates of smoking cessation, reduced

physical activity and increased alcohol use.

        In this study, we add to the sparse literature on ex ante moral hazard, and extend the

analysis of the effect of health insurance on health behaviors by examining the impact of

Medicaid on the prenatal behaviors of pregnant women. In particular, we assess effects of

Medicaid on maternal smoking and weight gain during pregnancy, in addition to behavior-

related health indicators during pregnancy such as gestational diabetes, pregnancy-associated

hypertension, and anemia. This represents the first national study of Medicaid effects on

health behaviors among pregnant women.

        We exploit the plausibly exogenous variation over time and between states in the

Medicaid expansions in income-based eligibility for pregnant women and for children that

occurred during the late 1980s through the mid 1990s. Moreover, we account for the effect of

insurance on health behaviors that works through greater contact with health care providers,

and we assess heuristically whether an income effect can account for our findings.

3.      Conceptual Framework

        The model we use to examine the effect of Medicaid on health behaviors is based on

the choices of a mother who cares about consumption, leisure, and child health. There are two

periods that span the pre- to post-birth period.4 In this model, child health in the post-birth

period is uncertain. With probability (π), the child may experience an adverse health shock (z)

that lowers child health and can be offset (repaired) with medical care (m1). Medical care in the

first period can also be used to alter the probability of an adverse health event in period two.5

First-period maternal consumption, for example, nutrition and smoking, may also affect the

probability of an adverse health shock in period two. Health insurance is particularly important

because it is used to buy medical care after the birth in the case of an adverse outcome..

        A woman’s expected utility is a function of consumption, leisure and child health:

(1)     E(U )  u0 ( x0 , l0 )  {[1   (m0 , x0 )][u1( x1, l1, c)]   (m0 , x0 )[u1( x1, l1, c  z(m1))]}

Equation (1) reflects the fact that there are two periods: prior to birth (t=0) and after birth

(t=1). Utility is a function of consumption (x), leisure (l) and child health (c) in each period,




4
  We assume that Medicaid has no effect on the pregnancy decision, which is consistent with some
previous literature. DeLeire et al. (2011) find no discernible effects on fertility from Medicaid expansions
using Natality data from 1985-1996. Zavodny and Bitler (2010) find little evidence that the expansions
had any effect on abortion or pregnancy rates examining state-level birth and abortion rates between
1982-1996. In contrast, Joyce et al. (1998), using pooled cross-sections of states, find that expansions in
the income thresholds for Medicaid eligibility between 1987-1991 are associated with a 5% increase in
the birthrate among white women but not among black women.
5
  We do not treat medical care in the first period, for example maternal prenatal care, as uncertain and
affected by insurance because such care is preventive and its effects are assumed known—i.e., there is
no uncertainty. Including Medicaid coverage for maternal care prior to birth would not change any of the
predictions described below.

                                                                                                                9
although in period 0 the child is not born and so child health does not enter the utility function.

The discount rate is denoted by (β).

           The woman’s budget constraint is given by:

                 x          p ( )m1   f 1                       w( )(1  l1 )
(2) x0  pm m0  1   (m0 ) m                w( )(1  l0 )                 W
                1 r          1 r      1 r                       1 r

Lifetime income is spent on: consumption (x) in periods 0 and 1; medical care (m) in periods 0

and 1 with price of medical care denoted by pm; and the quantity of health insurance (α) in

period one. The interest rate is denoted by (r). Health insurance reduces the price of medical

care and is financed out of earnings (w). The cost of health insurance also includes a loading

charge (f/α) where f is a fixed cost of administering health insurance.

           The constrained choice problem is given by:

      L  u0 ( x0 , l0 )   {[1   (m0 , x0 )][u1 ( x1, l1, c)]   (m0 , x0 )[u1 ( x1, l1, c  z (m1 ))]}
(3)                              x1           p ( )m1 f 1                    w( )(1  l1 )
          [ x0  pm m0              (m0 ) m               w(1  l0 ) 
                                1 r            1 r     1 r                   1 r

The first order condition for consumption in first period is given by:

      L            ~                 p m ( )m1
           U0       (u1  u1 )  [               ]0
      x0          x0                 x0 1  r
(4)
                 ~                 p m ( )m1
      U0          (u1  u1 )  [               ]
                x0                 x0 1  r

Equation (4) is the usual equilibrium condition. The left hand side is the benefit of first period

consumption and the right hand side is the cost, which includes the higher probability of lower

second period utility because of an adverse health shock to child caused by first period

consumption and the greater spending on second period medical care due to a higher

probability of an adverse health shock (u~1 denotes period 1 utility if sick).



                                                                                                               10
         Equation (4) also illustrates the problem of ex ante moral hazard. Health insurance (α)

lowers the price of medical care, and a lower price of medical care reduces the cost of first

period consumption that works through the probability of a child health shock. With insurance,

a mother has to incur less cost to treat an adverse event (for her or her child) associated with a

birth. Therefore, health insurance may influence first period consumption that may adversely

affect child health. Importantly, for Medicaid, there is no cost of insurance so the ex ante moral

hazard problem is not eliminated through changes in insurance premiums. Of course, there is

also an income effect associated with the lower price of health insurance and Medicaid that

may increase consumption.

         The first order conditions for medical care are given by:

       L       ~                             pm ( )m1
                  (u1  u1 )  [ pm ( )                ]0
      m0     m0                             m0 1  r
          ~                           pm ( )m1
           (u1  u1 )  [ pm ( )                ]
        m0                           m0 1  r
(5)
       L       u z        p ( )
             1       m       0
      m1       c m1        1 r
          u z        p ( )
        1        m
           c m1       1 r

First-period medical care is valued because it reduces the probability of an adverse event and

raises expected utility in the second period (u~1 denotes period 1 utility if sick). A lower

probability of an adverse event also reduces second-period medical expenditures. Both of these

marginal benefits are equated to the price of medical care. Second-period medical care raises

utility by improving child health and this marginal benefit is equated to the price of medical

care.



                                                                                                   11
       Dave and Kaestner (2009) raise another issue that is relevant, but not explicit in

equation (4), and that is the possibility that the greater use of medical care that comes with

insurance may affect the information available about the effect of consumption on the

probability of an adverse health shock to child. For example, Medicaid may be associated with

greater prenatal care, and during these visits the physician may discuss health behaviors and

the value of prevention that causes a mother to change behaviors.

       Finally, we assume an insurance market that allows a woman to choose an optimal

amount of insurance:

According to (6), a woman chooses insurance to equate the expected medical expenditures to

the cost of insurance, which is the wage offset plus loading cost. Again, the expansion of

Medicaid makes insurance free and there is an income effect associated with this change.6

Additionally, there are no changes in premiums to reflect the behavioral responses of Medicaid

beneficiaries to the price change of medical care.

       The upshot of this theoretical discussion is that the net effect of Medicaid coverage for

pregnant women and their children on prenatal preventive activities is a priori ambiguous.

Gaining insurance is associated with: 1) the pure ex ante moral hazard effect, which will tend to

worsen health behaviors; 2) an income effect that is likely to increase behaviors that are a form

of consumption including unhealthy behaviors such as smoking; and 3) an “informational”
6
  The income effect may also be driven by Medicaid-induced shifts in labor supply. Dave et al.
(forthcoming) find that Medicaid expansions for pregnant women led to a decrease in their employment
and labor force participation.

                                                                                                       12
effect that comes from the greater contact with the medical system induced by the lower price

of medical care.

4.     Research Design

       Our analysis is motivated by the incentives described above for pregnant women to

potentially change their primary prevention activities in response to Medicaid coverage. To

address this issue empirically, we exploit plausibly exogenous variation from the Medicaid

income eligibility expansions for pregnant women during the late-1980s through mid-1990s

taking advantage of the differences in expansions over time between states as a quasi-

experiment. We use data from the vital statistics natality files for births occurring from 1989

through 1997, the period that spanned the largest expansions in Medicaid eligibility for

pregnant women and children.

       The research design is a difference-in-differences approach focusing on the intention-to-

treat parameter associated with expanded Medicaid eligibility. For each type of health

behavior, we estimate the following regression specification:

(7)

In equation (7), H denotes a specific health behavior (smoking or weight gain) or outcome

(gestational diabetes, hypertension, and anemia) for pregnant woman i in state j and year t.

ELIG is the fraction of women in group k, which is defined by race and age (18-24, 25-29, 30-34,

35-39), in state j and year t that are eligible for Medicaid. The vector X represents individual

characteristics of the pregnant woman such as age, education, marital status, race/ethnicity,

and interactions between race and education; and Z represents a vector of time-varying state-

level confounding factors including the unemployment rate (contemporaneous and the one-


                                                                                                   13
year lag and lead) to capture economic conditions., state excise tax on cigarettes (in models for

smoking), and the fraction of single males with incomes below 200% of the federal poverty line

(FPL) with private insurance in state j and year t to capture trends in private insurance among

the low-income population.7

           All specifications control for state (α) and year (θ) fixed effects to capture unobserved

time-invariant area heterogeneity and national trends, and we allow these trends to vary by the

race and age categories used to define the fraction of eligible women (ELIG). In order to control

for other time-varying state-level unobservable variables, we also include in all models the

prevalence (or mean) of the specific health behavior in question for college-educated married

(denoted by the subscript m) pregnant women between the ages of 25-39 (Gm), who are

generally not Medicaid eligible and thus would not be impacted by the policy shift, for state j

and year t.8 Standard errors are adjusted for arbitrary correlation within state cells. The

parameter of interest is δ, which captures the reduced-form, marginal effect of the expansions

in Medicaid eligibility on prenatal behaviors, operating through the three channels described

earlier.

           The use of the fraction of women eligible for Medicaid in each state and year to

measure Medicaid eligibility follows the innovation of Currie and Gruber (1996) and Cutler and

Gruber (1996). The key to this measure is that it records the fraction of a fixed sample of

7
  The fraction of single males with income below 200% of the FPL who are privately insured in each
state/year is computed from the March Current Population Surveys (CPS).
8
  Note that this does not amount to using college-educated married pregnant women as a direct
comparison group since we are not constraining the coefficient to be one, that is we are not assuming (as
would be the case in a difference-in-differences context) that for every one-percentage point change in
the outcome among higher-educated married pregnant women there would be, in the absence of any
changes in Medicaid eligibility, an equal change in the outcome for low-educated unmarried pregnant
women. Our models confirm that this assumption of one-to-one proportional trends is not justified as the
coefficient on the group mean for college-educated married pregnant women is significantly less than one
in all specifications.

                                                                                                       14
women who would be eligible for Medicaid if they were pregnant and lived in each state in

each year and avoids the endogenous relationship between Medicaid eligibility of an individual

mother and her health and health behaviors. To form the measure, we selected a national

sample of women aged 18 to 39 from the 1989 to 1997 March Current Population Surveys (CPS)

(covering data from 1988-1996). We adjusted all financial variables for price changes such that

incomes are deflated (inflated) from the actual year (e.g., 1988,..,1996) to the policy year (e.g.,

1991) for which eligibility will be calculated. Using the “inflation-adjusted” sample and the

Medicaid eligibility rules in a state in a specific year, we assigned eligibility to the fixed national

sample so that eligibility is calculated using the same sample of women in each year for a given

state. We then calculated the proportion of women aged 18 to 39 within a race-age-state-year

cell that would be eligible for Medicaid if they became pregnant.9

        The variation in both of these measures comes from program rules alone -- after

adjusting for inflation and state fixed effects, the only way the percent eligible in this fixed

sample changes is due to changes in the state eligibility rules. As documented in Currie and

Gruber (1996), federal mandates during the late 1980s and early 1990s resulted in substantial

increases for all states in the fraction of pregnant women and their children who would be

eligible for Medicaid, though the magnitude of the increase varied widely according to initial



9
  We chose to define the group cells for Medicaid eligibility by race and age (in addition to state and year)
because of the large racial and age-related differences that exist in insurance coverage and health
behaviors. Furthermore, the race- and age-specific samples exploit differences in the income distribution
across these factors. If there is a different distribution of income by race, then that variation helps identify
the association between Medicaid eligibility and outcomes and results in more precise estimates. For
instance, a given shift in federal poverty line (FPL)-based eligibility in a specific state may lead to
differential shifts for different races due to differences in race-specific and age-specific income
distributions. Thus, Medicaid eligibility constructed for race- and age-specific samples provides a measure
of the policy instrument with greater and more accurate variation when matched to individual records,
which raises the precision of estimates.

                                                                                                             15
eligibility limits and state options regarding whether to offer coverage beyond the federally

mandated minimum eligibility increases.

       We modify the basic empirical model described above in several ways to address

specific issues. First, in supplementary models we include state-specific time trends to adjust

for the potentially less than perfect nature of the natural experiment. Inclusion of state-specific

time trends (set of state fixed effects that are interacted with a linear measure for time in

years) adjusts for the potential endogeneity of the Medicaid expansions if states with greater

expansions have correlated linear time trends in health behaviors for other reasons. Note that

these trends are in addition to other time-varying, state-specific controls in the model including

the unemployment rate and health behaviors of college-educated married women. As we show

later, adding state-specific trends has virtually no effect on estimates bolstering the plausibility

of our research design.

       Second, we limit the main analyses low-educated single mothers since this subgroup of

the population is relatively more likely to be affected by the Medicaid eligibility expansions.

Low-educated, single mothers have far higher Medicaid take-up rates and experienced larger

shifts in insurance coverage relative to those with more education or those who are married

(Dave et al. 2011, 2014).10 In the same spirit, and as a placebo test, we estimate the model

using a sample of higher-educated married pregnant women since they are far less likely to be

affected by the expansions in Medicaid eligibility. Here too results suggest a valid research

design, as almost all estimates for this group are not statistically significant and small.



10
   Medicaid participation among less-than-high-school educated pregnant women is 2.4 times greater
relative to higher educated pregnant women, and 6.1 times greater among unmarried pregnant women
relative to those who are married, based on the CPS.

                                                                                                     16
       Third, we allow the eligibility measure to have non-linear effects, which may be likely

given that higher levels of eligibility are affecting women and children at increasingly higher

income levels and with increasingly higher rates of private insurance and lower rates of being

uninsured. At higher levels of eligibility, part of the increase in public coverage reflects a

crowd-out of private coverage (see Dubay and Kenney 1997; Gruber and Simon 2008; Dave et

al. 2011). In this instance, we expect progressively smaller effects on health behaviors because

at higher levels of Medicaid eligibility, Medicaid take-up is associated greater shifts from private

to public insurance, in which case there should be minimal changes in individual incentives, and

smaller shifts from no insurance to insurance.

       Fourth, we supplement the analyses and explicitly control for prenatal care visits and

the adequacy of prenatal care in order to disentangle the direct ex ante moral hazard effect,

which implies a reduction in healthy behaviors, from greater insurance-induced contact with

the medical care community, which implies an increase in healthy behaviors, as shown in the

theoretical framework above. In models that do not control for prenatal care, the estimated

effect would conflate both of these counteracting effects.

5.     Data

       Our main analyses are based on individual birth records from the Vital Statistics Natality

Files (NF). Detailed information on all individual births occurring in the 50 states and D.C. are

submitted by hospitals to state vital registration offices, which is then reported to the National

Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Information on each birth includes date and place of birth

along with the demographic characteristics of the mother such as age, race, education, marital

status, and parity. We employ NF data for the years 1989 through 1997, covering pregnancies


                                                                                                    17
which started from 1988 through 1996, as this period enveloped some of the major Medicaid

income eligibility expansions that took place and because earlier years did not contain

information on certain prenatal behaviors. The primary sample is limited to women, with a

high-school degree or less, between the ages of 18 to 39. This yields up to 18.6 million births

for the main analytical sample. We employ additional checks in a sample of higher-educated

married women contributing up to 6.3 million births.

        We specifically measure two sets of health behaviors: 1) two measures of prenatal

smoking (prenatal smoking participation, smoking more than 5 cigarettes daily on average); and

2) weight gain during pregnancy. The latter outcome captures decisions related to nutrition,

caloric intake, and physical activity. Between 1970 and 1990, guidelines recommended a

weight-gain of 20-25 pounds during pregnancy, for normal-weight mothers, to ensure adequate

caloric intake and a healthy normal-weight infant (Institute of Medicine 2009). Revised

guidelines in 1990 called for even greater weight-gain for some groups (25-35 pounds for

pregnant women with normal pre-pregnancy body mass index, for instance).11 Since we cannot

observe pre-pregnancy weight in the natality data over our sample period, we also employ the

two thresholds of weight gain that no one should fall outside regardless of their weight gain,

which would be 15-40 pounds.

        We also study three maternal health indicators during pregnancy that are related to

health behaviors such as nutrition and physical activity. These are gestational diabetes 12,


11
   These guidelines were revised in 2009, in reflection of the obesity epidemic, for pre-pregnancy obese
women, recommending their pregnancy-related weight gain to be limited to 11-20 pounds. They were in
recognition of the fact that heavier women could gain less weight and still deliver a normal-weight infant.
12
   Prior to states using revised birth certificates starting in 2003, the data did not differentiate between
pre-pregnancy and gestational diabetes. However, based on disaggregated data, almost 90% of these
diabetes cases represent gestational diabetes.

                                                                                                           18
anemia, and hypertension. While gestational diabetes is not explained by behaviors in many

cases, its risk increases with being overweight/obese and with poor management of pre-

pregnancy and prenatal blood sugar levels (at prediabetic-levels), which are linked to diet and

physical activity. Furthermore, management of gestational diabetes involves modification of

diet (e.g. meal spacing), reduced sugar intake, monitoring blood sugar before meals, exercise,

and weight gain monitoring and control. Similarly, hypertension risk during pregnancy is

increased by unhealthy diets (e.g. consumption of salty/fatty foods and caffeine),

overweight/obesity, low/no exercise, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Anemia can be

prevented or treated by consuming iron and folate containing supplements and by eating iron

and folate rich foods such as spinach and meat.

       We utilize two measures of prenatal care to account for insurance effects on health

information through doctor contacts. The first captures the total number of prenatal care visits

over the pregnancy period. The second is a measure of the adequacy of prenatal care based on

the Kotelchuck adequacy criteria, which combines the timing of prenatal care initiation with the

recommended number of visits adjusted for gestation. Specifically, a woman is considered to

receive adequate prenatal care if she initiated care by the end of the 4th month of her

pregnancy and received at least 80% of the recommended number of visits during the time

between initiation and delivery (Kotelchuck 1994).

       Using the birth records from 1989-1997, we impute the year of pregnancy inception

based on birth year and gestation, thus yielding pregnancies which were started between 1988-

1996. We match Medicaid eligibility to the birth records by state, age group, race, and year of




                                                                                                 19
pregnancy.13 All other time-varying state variables are matched based on state and year of

pregnancy.

        Table 1 presents means for all years and for the baseline period (1989), for all births and

for subgroups based on maternal marital status and education. The prevalence of prenatal

smoking is 33.2% among low-educated (below high school) unmarried mothers, compared to

2.9% among college-educated married mothers. On average, weight gain among higher-

educated married mothers is about two pounds higher (31.1 pounds) compared with the lower-

educated sample (29.2 pounds), supporting our premise that a decline in weight gain on

average in response to Medicaid expansions would represent an adverse outcome. Higher-

educated married mothers are also more likely to receive adequate prenatal care (88.8% versus

47%) and to have 3 more prenatal visits (average of 12.4 versus 9.3 visits) relative to lower-

educated unmarried mothers. All of these differences are statistically significant. On average,

28.3% of pregnant women were eligible for Medicaid coverage over 1988-1996; this eligibility

increased from 20% in 1988 to over 32% by 1996 (see Figure 1). We exploit these expansions

across states and over time to assess how public insurance coverage may impact low-educated

pregnant women’s prenatal behaviors.

6.      Results

6.1     Estimates for among Low-educated Mothers



13
   We match Medicaid eligibility based on year of pregnancy, rather than year of birth, for those records
where gestation straddles adjacent years since prenatal smoking is most responsive during the first
trimester (Colman, Grossman, and Joyce 2003; Colman and Joyce 2003). That is, if a woman continues
to smoke beyond the first trimester upon learning that she is pregnant, then it is highly unlikely that her
smoking status during later stages of her pregnancy would respond to Medicaid. Given that gestation in
the birth records is likely measured with error, we also alternately imputed pregnancy year based on birth
year and a standard gestation of 38 weeks for all births. Results are not sensitive to using this alternate
measure.

                                                                                                         20
        Table 2 presents estimates of the reduced-form effect of expanding Medicaid eligibility

for pregnant women on the prenatal smoking measures, pregnancy weight gain, and behavior-

related health indicators of low-educated (high school graduate or less) pregnant women. For

each health behavior, we estimate models without and with state-specific linear trends.

Results are virtually the same, so we present only those without state-specific trends in the text

(panel A) and include estimates with state-specific trends in the Appendix. It is reassuring that

the direction and magnitudes of the estimates are not at all sensitive to these controls and

evidence of a valid research design.14

        Models in columns 1-2 suggest that Medicaid eligibility is positively and significantly

associated with smoking. Specifically, estimates indicate that a 12 percentage-points increase

in Medicaid eligibility, which is the approximate change that occurred over 1988-1996, is

associated with a 0.8 percentage-point increase in the probability of prenatal smoking and a 0.7

percentage-point increase in the probability of smoking more than 5 cigarettes daily.15 These

effects are statistically significant, and the magnitudes represent approximately a 3% increase

relative to the baseline mean smoking rates.16 All models for smoking control for the state




14
   Estimates are also robust to controlling for state-specific quadratic trends (results available upon
request).
15
   This effect includes both the intensive and extensive margins. With respect to the average number of
cigarettes smoked daily (not reported), estimates suggest a significant increase of 0.8 cigarettes per day
(associated with a 100% increase in Medicaid eligibility), with almost all of this effect being realized at the
extensive margin.
16
   In theory, the increase in prenatal smoking can reflect a decrease in the likelihood of cessation among
women who smoked prior to pregnancy as well as any increase in initiation. However, it is very unlikely
that the results are driven by initiation. The majority of low-educated female smokers initiate daily
smoking prior to age 18, and virtually all initiate prior to age 21. Our results are robust to excluding
pregnant women ages 18-20 from the analyses. Furthermore, very few women start smoking during
pregnancy. Hence, the increase in prenatal smoking should be interpreted symmetrically as a decrease in
the likelihood of quitting smoking during pregnancy among women who were smokers prior to their
pregnancy.

                                                                                                            21
excise tax on cigarettes, and show significant negative effects of taxes associated with prenatal

smoking consistent with the literature (Colman, Grossman, and Joyce 2003).17

       Columns 3-5 present results for weight gain during pregnancy. These estimates suggest

a decrease in weight gain of about 1.12 pounds (associated with a 100% increase in Medicaid

eligibility) or approximately a 0.14 pound statistically significant decrease in weight gain

associated with a 12 percentage-points increase in Medicaid eligibility for pregnant women; this

translates to a 0.5% decline relative to the baseline mean for low-educated mothers. The

expansions also appear to be associated with a leftward shift of the weight-gain distribution, as

evidenced by the increase in the prevalence of women who are gaining below the minimum

recommended threshold (15 pounds) and a decrease in the prevalence of women gaining

above the maximum recommended threshold (40 pounds).

       Estimates in columns 6-8 suggest an increase in behavior-related adverse gestational

health indicators, though only the effect on diabetes is statistically significant. The effect

magnitudes, for models with and without state trends, suggest a 3% increase in the prevalence

of gestational diabetes associated with a 12 percentage-points increase in Medicaid eligibility.

       Panel B of Table 2 assesses whether there are non-linear effects of Medicaid eligibility.

Given that higher levels of eligibility are affecting individuals with increasingly higher income

and rates of private insurance and lower rates of no insurance, Medicaid take up at these rates

is likely to capture a shift in type of coverage rather than individuals becoming newly insured.

Thus the incentives underlying ex ante moral hazard and changes in the information set due to

physician contact should be much less affected if the individual is simply substituting public for

17
  The tax elasticity for prenatal smoking among pregnant women with a high education or below is
estimated at -0.05.

                                                                                                    22
private coverage.18 We therefore expect effects on behaviors to diminish with expansions in

eligibility. Estimates in panel B indicate significant non-linear effects and generally confirm this

prediction, as evidenced by the negative coefficient of the quadratic eligibility terms.

        Estimates in panel B, for instance, suggest that the marginal increase in the likelihood of

prenatal smoking is 0.45 percentage point when eligibility is 0.20 but declines to 0.14 when

eligibility is 0.30. Thus, the adverse effects of expanded coverage on health behaviors are

stronger at lower levels of eligibility, which is consistent with the fact that more individuals are

shifting from being uninsured to being insured at these levels (Dubay and Kenney 1997; Dave et

al. 2011). The non-linear effects on the other smoking measures, weight gain, and gestational

hypertension are also significant, and the inflection points for all of these effects generally

occur at eligibility levels greater than 0.30, suggesting that, at least for the range of the

expansions observed over the sample period, Medicaid is associated with adverse effects with

respect to these outcomes. With respect to diabetes, the non-linearity is similarly suggestive of

diminishing effects at higher levels of Medicaid eligibility, though these estimates are not

statistically significant.

6.2     Estimates for Less-than-High School Educated Single Mothers

        The above analyses pertain to all pregnant women with at most a high school education.

Among this group, it was predominantly the lowest-educated single mothers who experienced

the highest Medicaid take-up rates and the largest changes in insurance coverage, and are

relatively more likely to be affected by the Medicaid eligibility expansions. The models in Table

18
  There may still be some shifts in incentives due to differences in cost-sharing, provider access, and
other components between private insurance and Medicaid. The potential effects of these differences in
program components are mixed. On the one hand, Medicaid coverage is much more generous than
private insurance and typically involves no cost-sharing. However, provider networks for Medicaid may
be more limited than private insurer networks due to lower reimbursement.

                                                                                                     23
3 therefore restrict the sample to less-than-high school educated single mothers. Assuming a

similar behavioral response, we expect the intention-to-treat estimates in Table 3 to be larger

than those in Table 2 because of the larger “first stage” effect on coverage.

       Comparing estimates in Table 3 with those in Table 2, we indeed find that the

expansions increased smoking more among the lowest-educated single mothers relative to low-

educated mothers in general and implicitly low-educated married mothers, who are less likely

to be Medicaid eligible. Specifically, a 12 percentage-points increase in eligibility raises prenatal

smoking by 1.2 percentage-points among less-than-high school educated single mothers; this

compares to a corresponding 0.8 percentage points increase among mothers with a high-school

degree or less. Similarly, the estimates for average weight gain (1.5 pounds increase associated

with a 100% increase in Medicaid eligibility, corresponding to 0.2 pound or 0.6% increase

associated with a 12 pct. points increase in eligibility) and gaining above/below the

recommended thresholds are noticeably larger for this sub-population.

       As the linear specification of eligibility may mask considerable heterogeneity over the

observed range of the Medicaid expansions, Panel B in Table 3 presents the non-linear effects

for the lower-educated single mothers. Specifically, we find that at an eligibility level of 0.20

(which roughly corresponds to the level in effect at the beginning of the sample period), the

marginal increase is 0.6 for prenatal smoking, 0.4 for smoking more than 5 cigarettes daily, and

3.1 cigarettes for daily smoking consumption. All of these marginal effects are expectedly

higher for this group of lower-educated single mothers relative to those reported in Table 3.

6.3    Adjusting for Prenatal Care




                                                                                                    24
        Estimates presented so far capture the reduced-form effect of the eligibility expansions

for pregnant women on their health behaviors, which operates through both a potential ex

ante moral hazard channel, an income effect and through counteracting shifts in the patient’s

perceptions regarding their illness probability and the productivity of self-protection due to

insurance-induced contact with physicians. Models in Table 4 for low-educated mothers

attempt to account for this latter pathway by directly controlling for the adequacy of prenatal

care and the number of prenatal care visits over the pregnancy. These estimates, both linear

and non-linear specifications of eligibility, are virtually unchanged from those in Table 2, which

do not control for the measures of prenatal care. The implication is that the adverse effects of

Medicaid on healthy behaviors are not offset by insurance-induced prenatal care and contact

with healthcare professionals. Similar results are found when limiting the sample to single

mothers who have not graduated from high school.19

        While controlling for potential confounding factors (in this case, prenatal care) is a

standard practice, Angrist and Pischke (2009) note that including such “mediators” in the

specification is problematic because these mediators are themselves endogenous, and hence

would lead to biased estimates. Thus, as an alternate to controlling for prenatal care, we also

directly estimated the effect of the eligibility expansions on the joint probability between the
19
   This contrasts with the study by Dave and Kaestner (2009), who find that insurance improves health
behaviors through greater physician contact. Part of the reason why there may not be strong
counteracting effects in our case relates to the difference in study populations. Dave and Kaestner
(2009) investigate the effects of Medicare and their population of interest is the elderly upon receiving
public insurance at age 65, whereas we study the Medicaid-eligible population of low-educated single
mothers ages 18-39. For instance, Dave et al. (2008) study the direct effects of these expansions on

0.06 additional prenatal visit, about half a percentage point increase (also statistically insignificant) in the
                                                                                                      rd
probability of receiving adequate care, and a significant 0.3 percentage point decrease in late (3
trimester) prenatal care initiation, among low-educated mothers. Hence, it does not appear that the
expansions resulted in significantly higher contact between pregnant women and the medical care
community, at least for the average mother, which may explain why the results are not sensitive to
controlling for prenatal care.

                                                                                                              25
various health behaviors and measures of prenatal care adequacy, via multinomial logit models

(MNL). The marginal changes in these joint probabilities allow us to pick up potential

interactions between these behaviors and contact with the medical profession, and assess both

unconditional and conditional (on prenatal care) effects of the eligibility expansions on prenatal

behaviors. These results (not presented) are qualitatively and quantitatively consistent (nearly

the same) with those presented above.20 Hence, our results do not indicate that prenatal care

had any meaningful effects on smoking

6.5 Placebo tests

        We estimated models for college-educated married mothers between the ages of 18-39,

for whom the expansions in Medicaid eligibility should have minimal to null effects. Estimates

are presented in Table 5. Notably, we do not find any economically meaningful or statistically

significant effects of the expansions on their prenatal smoking or weight gain behaviors. This

adds to other evidence (e.g., the absence of state-trends to matter) supporting the research

design and bolsters the plausibility of our approach.

7.      Discussion



20
   Specifically, we assessed movement of the probability density across four categories comprising
                                                                       st                                     st
combinations of adequate prenatal care and prenatal smoking (1: 1 trimester care + No smoking; 2: 1
                                      st                                     st
trimester care + Smoking; 3: No 1 trimester care + No smoking; 4: No 1 trimester care + Smoking), and
similar combinations of adequate prenatal care and weigh gain thresholds. With respect to smoking, the
marginal effect suggest an increase in the joint probability of prenatal care and smoking (category 2) and
the probability of prenatal care and no smoking (category 1) relative to the other two categories – thus an
increase in early initiation, conditional on smoking. A 12 percentage-points increase in eligibility would
move about 1.5% late initiators into early care, based on the MNL estimates. We also find that the
expansions are associated with an increase in the probability of prenatal care and smoking (category 2)
and the probability of no prenatal care and smoking (category 4) relative to the other two categories; thus
Medicaid is associated with an overall increase in prenatal smoking (and, of more than 5 cigarettes daily),
and it is validating that these effect magnitudes are highly similar to the OLS estimates (0.07 and 0.1) in
Tables 2 and 3 for the two sub-populations. Turning to the MNL models that assess non-linear effects of
eligibility, we find as before that the patterns and effect magnitudes diminish at higher levels of eligibility.
MNL estimates are not reported, and results are available from the authors upon request.

                                                                                                             26
       Assessing the effects of the Medicaid program on health behaviors is important since

state and federal governments have dramatically expanded Medicaid over the past two

decades to provide insurance for an increasingly large proportion of poor and near-poor

persons. The rationale for these expansions is to decrease the population that is uninsured,

and consequently to increase the use of healthcare services and improve population health.

However, besides anticipated effects on health services use, insurance coverage expansions

may also result in meaningful unintended changes in health behavior, some of which reflect a

worsening in primary prevention effort and an increase in risky behaviors. No previous

research has directly evaluated the effect of Medicaid on behaviors among pregnant women.

We provide the first such evaluation based on quasi-experimental variation in Medicaid

expansions between states and over time in the late 1980s through mid 1990s.

       Economic theory suggests three main effects of gaining health insurance coverage on

health behaviors. One effect is a reduction in primary prevention activities because insurance

reduces the price of curative medical care and therefore lowers the financial costs of illness (ex

ante moral hazard). Another effect is from income gain through reduced out-of-pocket

expenditures. Finally, insurance could alter health behaviors through greater contact with

health providers.

       We find robust evidence that Medicaid expansions were associated with an increase in

prenatal smoking and a reduction in pregnancy weight gain for low-educated mothers. These

effects are found whether we account for increases in prenatal care services or not suggesting

no/little indirect effect of insurance on health behaviors because of increased contact with

prenatal care providers. Specifically, an increase in Medicaid eligibility of 12 percentage points


                                                                                                27
for pregnant women (approximately the magnitude of the expansion over the sample period)

raised the likelihood of smoking during pregnancy by approximately 0.8 percentage point or 3%

relative to the baseline mean. This is an average effect that masks considerable heterogeneity

over the eligibility distribution. The marginal increase is larger (3 percentage points) at an

eligibility level of 0.2, which is approximately the level that was in effect at the beginning of the

sample period.

       We note that these effects are intent-to-treat (ITT) effects since Medicaid take-up rates

are typically far less than 100%. For instance, if we assume a Medicaid take-up rate of 50%

(25%), then the above ITT estimate (for a 12 percentage point change in eligibility) needs to be

scaled upwards by a factor of 16 (32) in order to derive the structural treatment-on-the-treated

(TOT) effect of gaining Medicaid coverage. Doing so implies that actual Medicaid coverage for a

low-educated mother who was previously uninsured raised the likelihood of prenatal smoking

by about 12 (24) percentage points, or approximately 36% (67%) of the 1989 baseline

prevalence among low-educated mothers. Implicit TOT effects rescaled in this manner should

be interpreted with caution because small changes in the denominator (in this case the

Medicaid take-up rate) and the underlying estimates can lead to large differences.

Nevertheless, our finding is consistent with Baicker et al. (2013), who find that randomly-

assigned Medicaid eligibility in Oregon is associated with an increase in smoking of about 6

percentage points with a confidence interval (-2.5 to 13.7 percentage points) that includes our

back-of-the-envelope imputed treatment-on-the-treated estimate.

       We also find consistent evidence that the expansions were associated with a decrease in

pregnancy-related weight gain. The implications of this finding for maternal and infant health


                                                                                                   28
are a priori mixed because guidelines recommend a weight gain of 25 to 35 pounds for a

woman who is normal weight pre-pregnancy, but at the same time gaining too much weight

during pregnancy, especially for pre-pregnant overweight or obese women, may be risky for the

mother and the infant. The average female in 1990 was overweight with a mean BMI of

approximately 27, and current guidelines recommend pregnancy weight gain of 15-25 pounds

for such women. Based again on a Medicaid take-up rate of 50% (25%), our estimates suggest

that Medicaid coverage for a previously uninsured low-educated pregnant woman could lead to

a decrease in weight gain by about 2 (4) pounds. Given that the average pregnant woman in our

sample experienced a weight gain of about 30 pounds at baseline, this reduction may still place

the pregnancy weight gain within or above recommended guidelines.

       The adverse effects that we observe result from both ex ante moral hazard and income

effects (as there is no evidence for an effect due to greater care). Reductions in out-of-pocket

spending on healthcare as a result of Medicaid coverage will increase consumption of both risky

and healthy behaviors. Gruber and Yelowitz (1999) find that expanding Medicaid eligibility for

pregnant women and all children between 1984-1993 raised overall consumption expenditures,

and Leininger et al. (2010) find similar increases in consumption spending due to the reduction

in the family’s out-of-pocket medical spending associated with expansions in the State

Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP).

       On average, reduction in out-of-pocket spending with switching from uninsured to

Medicaid coverage is $700, 21 which represents a 9% increase in income.22 Kenkel et al. (2014)


21
   These estimates are based on average out-of-pocket spending for non-Medicare Medicaid/publicly
insured families with a health problem of $250, compared to about $1100-1200 with employer/other
private coverage, and $550 without coverage (Tables 6 & 8 of
http://www.commonwealthfund.org/~/media/files/publications/fund-report/2002/jun/family-out-of-pocket-

                                                                                                        29
estimate an income elasticity of smoking at the extensive margin of 3.6 among low-income

adults. While this is clearly a large estimate, we use it to assess the maximum amount of the

smoking effect that may be due to income. Combining these estimates suggests that the

potential income effect associated with the Medicaid expansion would lead to an increase in

smoking by as much as 8.7 percentage points (or 26% of baseline mean in this group). This

compares to the imputed TOT of 12 percentage points. So part of the increase in smoking,

perhaps a large part of it, may be due to an income effect, but there remains an ex ante moral

hazard effect too. Moreover, the potentially large income effect bolsters the plausibility of our

estimate, which at first appears quite large. In fact, it is reasonable given the change in income

and possible ex ante moral hazard effects.

       The results from this study suggest that the Medicaid eligibility expansions may have

reduced prevention efforts of low-educated pregnant women and increased their participation

in unhealthy behaviors. These results highlight the importance of providing incentives to

maintain prevention efforts, for instance by encouraging visits to the doctor, removing cost-

sharing for preventive care, or capitalizing on the patient-physician contact to probe and

encourage healthy behaviors, when designing public insurance program expansions in order to

reduce unintended adverse behavioral effects. Most importantly, our results may explain why

Medicaid expansions have not been associated with substantial improvement in infant health.

Notes: All models control for maternal age, education, race, indicators for education* race, ethnicity, state unemployment rate (contemporaneous,
lag, lead), state private insurance rate among low-income (<200% FPL) single males, outcome mean among college-educated married pregnant
women between the ages of 25-39, and state*race, state*age category (18-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39), year*race, and year*age category effects.
Models for weight gain also control for indicators for gestation in weeks. Standard errors are clustered within state cells and reported in parentheses.
Asterisks denote statistical significance as follows: ***p-value ≤ 0.01; **0.01 < p-value ≤ 0.05; *0.05 < p-value ≤ 0.10.
