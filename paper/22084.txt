Detecting Potential Overbilling in Medicare Reimbursement via Hours Worked
Hanming Fang and Qing Gong
NBER Working Paper No. 22084
March 2016
JEL No. H51,I13,I18

                                          ABSTRACT

Medicare overbilling refers to the phenomenon that providers report more and/or higher-intensity
service codes than actually delivered to receive higher Medicare reimbursement. We propose a
novel and easy-to-implement approach to detect potential overbilling based on the hours worked
implied by the service codes physicians submit to Medicare. Using the Medicare Part B Fee-for-
Service (FFS) Physician Utilization and Payment Data in 2012 and 2013 released by the Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), we first construct estimates for physicians' hours
spent on Medicare Part B FFS beneficiaries. Despite our deliberately conservative estimation
procedure, we find that about 2,300 physicians, or 3% of those with a significant fraction of
Medicare Part B FFS services, have billed Medicare over 100 hours per week. We consider this
implausibly long hours. As a benchmark, the maximum hours spent on Medicare patients by
physicians in National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data are 50 hours in a week.
Interestingly, we also find suggestive evidence that the coding patterns of the flagged physicians
seem to be responsive to financial incentives: within code clusters with different levels of service
intensity, they tend to submit more higher intensity service codes than unflagged physicians;
moreover, they are more likely to do so if the marginal revenue gain from submitting mid- or
high-intensity codes is relatively high.

1     Introduction

    Medicare benefit payments in 2014 totaled $597 billion, accounting for 14% of the United States
federal budget (see Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation (2015)); and Congressional Budget Office
(2014) forecasts, as more baby boomers retire, government health care program expenditures will
further increase and will account for 14% of U.S. GDP by 2039. From a public policy perspective,
mitigating the inefficiencies in the Medicare system to ensure that every Medicare dollar is put
to the best use is of first order importance. This paper is about a particular form of inefficiency
that is broadly referred to as overbilling, where providers file improper claims in order to increase
the reimbursement from Medicare or other insurance companies. The U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services Office of Inspector General loosely defines two common types of overbilling
(formally referred to as “improper claims”): upcoding refers to billing codes reflecting a more severe
illness than actually existed or a more expensive treatment than was provided; overcharging refers
to charging for more units of a service than was provided, or charging for services not provided at all
(see Department of Health and Human Services (2015)).1 Lorence and Spink (2002) estimated that
overbilling costs the Federal government about $12 billion annually in the 1990s; and researchers
continued to find evidence of overbilling ever since (e.g., Brunt (2011)).
    Efficient and cost-effective detection of overbilling, preferably at the individual provider level,
is crucial to reduce overbilling. However, this remains a challenging task. Most papers in the
literature measure “overbilling” by the differential probability that higher-level codes are billed
relative to lower level codes, or by the percentile of a provider’s total reimbursement received in the
distribution. But such measures could be confounded by factors such as selection on patient and
provider characteristics. Medicare claims data, available in more recent years, enabled researchers
to control for some, but not all, patient and provider heterogeneities. Rosenberg et al. (2000)
developed a Bayesian model to adaptively detect questionable claims using previous hospital claims
that insurers already selected for audit. However, new costly audits are required to apply the
methods to any new claims data. The Comprehensive Error Rate Testing (CERT) program by the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) faces a similar challenge, because the program
needs to hire experts to review a large sample of claims every year (see Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (2015)). Geruso and Layton (2015) identified upcoding at the market level using
risk scores and variations in financial incentives of physicians.
    In this paper, we propose a novel approach to efficiently detect, or at least flag, potential
    1
      There is a third type of improper claims that bill for services that lack medical necessity, sometimes known as
utilization abuse. Detecting utilization abuse could be much harder and potentially controversial, so the approach we
propose in this paper only targets detecting upcoding and overcharging.

Medicare overbilling using conservative estimates of the hours worked implied by service codes
providers submit to Medicare for reimbursement. Our idea is very simple. Every provider has
a fixed number of hours in any given period; and most of the service codes that are submitted
for reimbursement require that the provider spends certain amount of time with the patient. If
the hours worked implied from the service codes a provider submits to CMS are implausibly long,
the provider is suspicious for overbilling. Our approach to flag potential Medicare overbilling has
several key advantages. First, the existing physician-level billing data are sufficient to implement
this approach, with no additional data collection needed. Second, by focusing on the implied hours
worked within a given time period, our approach separates confounding factors such as selection on
patient conditions. Third, our approach is flexible in the sense that it can be automated, and can
be easily extended to a more general setting with augmented data, for example, by including other
components of Medicare and/or more physician billing information such as billings for beneficiaries
of other insurance programs. We should also note that our calculation of implied physician hours
worked is deliberately conservative for the moment, and it is certainly not fail-proof especially
given some well-noted data limitations (see, for example, O’Gara (2014); Jones et al. (2015)).
Nonetheless, we believe it can serve as a useful first step for effective and more targeted auditing
to reduce Medicare overbilling.
   We apply our approach to detect potential Medicare overbilling using two waves of Medicare
Part B Fee-for-Service (FFS) physician payment data. We construct conservative estimates for
physicians’ implied hours worked treating Medicare Part B FFS beneficiaries in 2012 and 2013.2,                3

We find that about 2,300 physicians in our sample billed for more than 100 hours per week for
Medicare Part B FFS patients alone. We consider such long hours of work highly implausible
and refer to these physicians as “flagged physicians.” A comparison with the unflagged physicians
shows that flagged physicians are more likely to work in smaller group practices, more likely to
be a specialist rather than a primary care physician, and provide both more and higher-intensity
services. Results from simple regression analysis also suggest that the coding patterns of the
flagged physicians are sensitive to variations in the marginal revenue of choosing a higher intensity
code. Interestingly, the revenues from these higher-intensity services are not enough to offset the
“longer” hours needed to furnish them, resulting in substantially lower reported hourly revenues
than the unflagged physicians. Moreover, this large gap in hourly revenues is hard to reconcile
using observable physician characteristics and geographical variations.
   Our research is related to the literature on the prevalence and consequences of overbilling.
   2
       CMS released the data to the public in April 2014.

   Details on how we construct the estimates for physicians’ hours worked based on the service codes submitted to
Medicare are described in Section 3.


                                                            2
Lorence and Spink (2002) surveyed organizational providers and found significant “coding opti-
mization,” despite serious penalties if the fraudulent billing practices were found out. Angeles and
Park (2009) showed that upcoding imposed unnecessary cost to the already expensive Medicare
program, was especially serious for Medicare Advantage, and this problem may become worse as
the 76 million baby boomers age. The Department of Health and Human Services, alarmed at
the rapid increase in Medicare spending from 2001 to 2010, conducted an in-depth study on the
coding trends of evaluation and management (E/M) services in 2012, and found some physicians
consistently billed higher-level codes. It is also related to the literature on possible determinants
of overbilling. Adams et al. (2002) noted that the long documented difficulty of billing may lead
to more erroneous coding, and provide room for fraudulent coding at the same time. Other factors
examined include pressure from the management teams (Lorence and Spink (2002); Dafny and
Dranove (2009)), hospital ownership (Silverman and Skinner (2004)), anti-fraud enforcement effort
(Becker et al. (2005); Bastani et al. (2015)), fee differentials across codes (Brunt (2011); Bowblis and
Brunt (2014)), and information technology such as electronic health records (EHR) (Adler-Milstein
and Jha (2014)).
    Finally, our paper is related to the recent growing list of papers that used the newly released
CMS Physician Utilization and Payment data. Most studies that use this dataset look at utilization
and/or payment patterns of a particular specialty or procedure (Bergman et al. (2014); Harewood
et al. (2014); Clair and Goyal (2015); Dusetzina et al. (2015); Ip et al. (2015); Ko et al. (2015);
Lapps et al. (2016); Menger et al. (2015); Schmajuk et al. (2014); Sutphin et al. (2014); Skolarus
et al. (2015); Skolasky and Riley III (2015)). For example, Bergman et al. (2014) studied physician
payments in general and found that high physician earnings were mainly driven by more services
furnished per patient instead of a larger number of patients.
    The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we describe the data and
the construction of our sample. In Section 3, we discuss our approach to estimate physician hours
worked. In Section 4, we present our empirical results. In Section 5, we corroborate some of our
conclusions using two external datasets, the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the
CMS Comprehensive Error Rate Testing (CERT) results. Finally, in Section 6, we conclude.


2     Data and Sample Construction

    Our main data source is the Medicare Part B FFS Physician Utilization and Payment data
released annually to the public by the CMS since April 2014. The two waves of data available now




                                                   3
are derived from all Medicare Part B FFS claims made in 2012 and 2013, respectively.4 Each wave of
data has about 9 million records at the provider-place-service level. Providers are uniquely identified
by their National Provider Identifier (NPI) and characterized by a limited set of basic information
(e.g. address, individual or organization indicator, gender and specialty). Places are categorized
into office settings and facility (such as hospitals) settings, and reflect where the provider furnished a
service. Services are identified by a 5-digit alpha-numeric code specified in the Healthcare Common
Procedure Coding System (HCPCS). Hence each observation is a summary of a provider’s rendition
of a service at a place within the calendar year, as well as the payment the provider received for
these services.
   We supplement the Physician Utilization and Payment dataset with three other publicly avail-
able datasets. First we use the CMS Physician Compare database to get more detailed physician
characteristics such as education background and group practice affiliations. Both datasets identify
physicians by their NPI, and we are able to match 91 percent of the records. Then we use the
National Physician Fee Schedule to get the Relative Value Units (RVUs) that quantify the amount
of work required to furnish each service, which we will use to estimate the time needed for the
services. Finally, we use a CMS on-site survey (Zuckerman et al. (2014)) that objectively measured
the time needed for a subset of services to corroborate our estimates of physician hours worked.
   Next, we construct our sample by including only providers that are individuals (“physicians”)
instead of organizations, who work in the continental U.S., completed professional medical training
between 1946 and 2011, and have valid basic information (practice location, gender, and specialty).
The first selection criterion discards about 5 percent of observations and the rest lead to negligible
reduction of the sample size.5,       6   We further restrict our sample to include only HCPCS codes that
are actually services; exclude codes that are drugs, equipment or medical supplies, are only for
quality administration purposes and not paid for, or are temporary codes for new services.7,                   8

   Finally, we aggregate the physician-place-service level data to the physician-service level. For
each physician-service combination, we observe the physician’s characteristics, workload to furnish
the service (RVU and/or time needed), volume of the service billed each year (the number of
times that service is furnished and the number of Medicare Part B FFS beneficiaries receiving that
   4
     For every physician, the HCPCS codes claimed for fewer than 10 times in a calendar year are excluded from the
datasets to protect patient privacy. Claims for durable medical equipments are also excluded.
   5
   For expositional simplicity, we will refer to all individual providers as “physicians” even if a small fraction of
them are nurses or physician assistants.
   6
     We exclude those graduated in or after 2012 because they are likely to be residents, who are known for extremely
long working hours. We discuss this in greater detail in the Online Appendix and show that our results are not
affected when more possible residents are excluded from the sample.
   7
       Drug codes are excluded when we estimate total physician hours worked but not when calculating total revenues.
   8
       Temporary codes have no RVU information that we can use to reliably estimate the time needed to furnish them.


                                                           4
service), and total Medicare payments for these services. In the final sample we have 7.9 million
observations on 623,959 physicians and 4,480 HCPCS service codes.


3     Measuring Physician Hours Worked

    We define physician hours worked to be the total time a physician spent with patients to furnish
the service codes submitted to Medicare for reimbursement. The time needed per service is readily
available for some codes (referred to below as the “timed codes”). We use these time codes to
estimate the time needed for other service codes that do not have a time requirement based on
their Work Relative Value Units (Work RVUs) which are measures of workloads that CMS assigns
to all services.


3.1    Timed Codes

    The timed codes, which are the cornerstone of our estimation of physician hours worked, fall
into two categories. The first category of timed codes have a suggested or required amount of time
in their definition. These are mostly from the “evaluation and management” (E/M) code group,
which include office or home visits. An important feature of these services is that there are usually
multiple codes with different levels of intensity or complexity to furnish even for a narrowly-defined
service, and the physician has discretion over which one to file. The American Medical Association
(AMA) publishes guidelines on choosing the most appropriate code, and usually includes typical
time needed for E/M codes (Gabbert et al. (2012)). As an example, Table 1 shows a typical cluster
of E/M codes where multiple codes are available for the same service but have varying workload
requirement and fees. All five HCPCS codes, 99201 through 99205, are for “office or other outpatient
visit for new patients.” But the lowest intensity code, 99201, only needs 10 minutes to furnish per
the AMA guidelines, and generates $31.09 of revenue, whereas the highest intensity code, 99205,
needs 60 minutes and generates $145.81.9 Note that, incentive issues aside, if a physician were to
overstate the service intensity by one level, revenue would increase by at least $20.
    The second category of timed codes are those selected in a 2014 CMS survey that directly
measures the time needed for certain services (Zuckerman et al. (2014)). The survey targets 112
HCPCS codes that are judged to be growing fast, frequently billed, or often billed together. These
codes make up 18 percent of total Medicare physician fee schedule expenditures. Survey staff are
sent on site to document the time used to furnish the interested services at several participating
  9
    These fees are the baseline reimbursement amounts in the 2012 Physician Fee Schedule. Actual Medicare pay-
ments will vary slightly across geographic regions and specific settings in which the services are furnished.

institutions with large volumes of these service.
   Our idea is to use the time requirement for timed codes described above to estimate the time
requirement for all other codes. In order to do this, we construct the expected time needed for each
code based on the “typical time needed” suggested by the AMA guideline.10 This is important
because the actual time to furnish a service code may vary both across and within physicians.
We construct the “expected time needed” from the “typical time needed” as in AMA guideline as
follows. Assuming the time needed follows a uniform distribution, we take the simple average of
the minimum and maximum time allowed for each code to get the expected time. Specifically, some
codes may have an explicit range of time needed, such as “5-10 minutes of medical discussion.”
For such codes, the expected time needed is simply the average of the lower and upper bounds.
For codes that do not have such a range, physicians are supposed to file the code whose typical
time needed is closest to the actual time spent. For example, between codes 99202 and 99203 as
described in Table 1, a physician who spent 23 minutes should file the code 99202 instead of 99203.
Following this logic, the expected time needed we will assign to HCPCS codes 99201 through 99205
are 7.5, 20, 31.25, 45, and 60 minutes, respectively. To see this, consider HCPCS code 99201 for
example. Note that physicians who spends 0 to 15 minutes with a new patient is supposed to
file HCPCS code 99201 if they follow the AMA guideline. Thus, under the plausible assumption
that the actual time spent with patients follows a uniform distribution, the simple average of the
minimum (0 minute) and maximum (15 minutes) time allowed for filing 99201 is 7.5 minutes. For
the highest intensity codes within a cluster of codes, e.g. code 99205 in Table 1, we set the expected
time to be the same as the typical time as there is no upper bound specified in the AMA guideline.
In order to err on the conservative side, we moreover choose the smaller of the typical time for a
service code and expected time we construct for the timed codes whenever the two differ. Finally,
  10
    An exception is when the AMA guideline requires the physician to spend a certain amount of time when furnishing
a service. For example, code 99360 is for “physician standby service, requiring prolonged physician attendance, each
30 minutes (eg, operation standby, standby for frozen section, for cesarean/high risk delivery, for monitoring EEG),”
and explicitly prohibits filing this code for services less than 30 minutes.




                                                         6
we also exclude timed codes that do not require direct contact of the physician with the patient,
such as intravenous drug infusions and phototherapies, again to be conservative in our estimate of
the physicians’ hours worked.


3.2      Work RVUs and Time Needed for Untimed Codes

   Next we estimate the time needed for all other codes for which AMA guideline does not specify
typical or required time. Our estimation is based on the Relative Value Units (RVUs) of the service
codes. RVUs reflect the value of each HCPCS code along three dimensions. AMA appoints a special
committee of experts from various specialties to assign and regularly update the RVUs; and the
CMS uses them to determine Medicare reimbursements to physicians. The Physician Fee Schedule
specifies the following formula for the baseline payment amount for a given HCPCS code:
                                                                       
                                             (Work RVU) × (Work GPCI)
                                                                       
                           Payment =         +(PE RVU) × (PE GPCI)      × CF,
                                                                       
                                             +(MP RVU) × (MP GPCI)

where Work RVU captures the amount of work, primarily time, needed to furnish the service;
PE RVU captures the practice expense (PE) of the service; MP RVU captures the malpractice
insurance cost of the service; the Geographic Practice Cost Indices (GPCI) adjust for the geographic
differences in the costs of practicing medicine, and vary slightly around 1 across 90 GPCI regions
in the U.S.; and finally, the conversion factor (CF) translates the RVUs into dollar amounts, which
is $24.6712 per RVU in 2012, and $34.023 per RVU in 2013 (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services (2013)).
   We use Work RVUs to estimate the time needed for untimed codes. Though Work RVUs
are imperfect measures of service time, time still plays the central role when Work RVUs are
determined, making Work RVUs the best tool available for our purposes.11 Our estimation takes
two steps. First, we take the timed codes, for which we know the time needed and the Work RVUs,
and estimate the time needed per work RVU. We use both the simple averages and regressions for
robustness, and control for 15 service code groups to account for the difference in practice patterns
across specialties. Second, we use the Work RVU of each code, whether it is a timed code or an
untimed code, and the estimated time needed per Work RVU from the first step to calculate its
time needed.
   Thus, for every timed code, we will have three measures of time needed: its expected time
needed per AMA guideline, and two estimated time needed using the two estimation methods in
 11
      See Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (2014).


                                                         7
the first step; and for every untimed code, we will have the latter two measures of time needed.
Again to err on the conservative side, we pick the minimum of the measures of the time needed
for each service code. In the end, we get positive estimates of time needed for 75% of the HCPCS
codes. Codes that do not have such estimates, which we will refer to as “zero-time codes,” are
drugs or supplies that do not require direct contact with the physician, or those that have negative
time needed estimates according to our procedure.
    Given the time needed estimates of the HCPCS codes, we calculate physician i’s total hours
worked in year t based on services i billed CMS for in calendar year t:

                             X
        (Hours worked)it =         [Time needed per service j × (Number of service j billed)it ] ,   (1)
                             j∈J


where j is a HCPCS code in the set of codes, J, for which we have obtained positive time needed
using the procedure described above.


3.3    Discussion of Estimated Physician Hours Worked

    Our estimates of physician hours worked are likely to be a conservative lower bound of the
actual hours, provided that the service codes truthfully reflect both the volume and the intensity of
services the physicians actually furnished. First, as we described above we make every decision in
the construction of the hours worked to err on the conservative side. Second, the Medicare Part B
FFS Physician Utilization and Payment data that we use in our estimation only include Medicare
Part B FFS claims, which on average account for less than 31% of a physician’s services (see The
Physicians Foundation (2012)). Third, as we mentioned in Footnote 4, for each physician the
dataset excludes the HCPCS codes claimed for fewer than 10 times in a calendar year. Fourth, we
only include the time needed for 75 percent of HCPCS codes that represent services requiring direct
contact of the physician and the patient, have non-zero work RVUs, and end up with positive time
estimates. Finally, some physicians bill under the NPI of organizational providers (e.g. a hospital
or a group practice), which we exclude from our sample because it is impossible to identify an
individual physician’s contribution to the organizations’ billing records.


4     Describing Physician Hours Worked

    We convert the total hours worked in year t to hours worked per week in year t for easier
interpretation in the analysis that follows, assuming physicians work 51 weeks (i.e., take only 9
days off each year). By doing so we essentially characterize physician hours worked averaged over


                                                     8
the entire year. Hence we are allowing the physicians to be possibly smoothing hours of work
intertemporally during the year, which of course is another conservative choice that is likely to lead
to under-detection of overbilling. This choice is necessitated by the data limitation that utilization
and payment records are aggregated to the calendar year level, and not at a higher time frequency.
However, if we are able to detect implausibly long hours worked per week under the lenient criterion
permitting cross-week smoothing, it would serve as a stronger signal for potentially inappropriate
coding.
   Figure 1 graphs the distribution of average reported hours worked per week across all the physi-
cians. Despite the conservative methods we used to estimate the physicians’ hours worked, about
2,300 physicians submitted claims for service codes that would translate into over 100 hours per
week on services for Medicare Part B FFS beneficiaries. Moreover, about 600 physicians submitted
claims for service codes that would imply over 168 hours per week (that is, 24 hours a day, 7
days per week!). To put these numbers into perspective, the Accreditation Council for Graduate
Medical Education (ACGME) restricts residency working hours to 80 hours per week since 2003 in
light of the much studied sleep deprivation and performance deterioration of health care providers
(Wolman et al. (2009)). Furthermore, as we will discuss in Section 5, the maximum hours spent
on Medicare patients by physicians in National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data are below
50 hours in a week.
   In Table 2 we take a closer look at physicians who billed Medicare for long hours. We use
different weekly hours as flagging thresholds, 80, 100, 112 (16 hours per day for 7 days), and 168
(24 hours per day for 7 days) respectively, and present the statistics by year. We will refer to
physicians whose estimated weekly hours worked above the threshold as flagged physicians and
those below as unflagged physicians. For example, under the 100 weekly hours threshold, we flag
2,292 physicians in 2012 and 2,120 physicians in 2013 as having submitted claims with implied
hours worked exceeding that threshold. They account for 2.71% and 2.55% of all physicians in our
data that have submitted claims implying at least 20 hours of service per week in at least one year,
and 0.367% and 0.340% among all physicians in 2012 and 2013, respectively.
   Physicians with very few implied hours worked in our sample could have few Medicare patients,
or could have just as many Medicare patients but they specialize in the 25 percent zero-time service
codes where information on time needed is unavailable. If it is the latter, one might be concerned
that our results overlook physicians who are only overbilling on the zero-time codes. Table 2 indeed
shows that, for example, the number of distinct zero-time HCPCS codes as a fraction of all 4,480
distinct HCPCS codes filed by flagged physicians ranges from about 9% using the 80-hour threshold
to about 4% using the 168-hour threshold, while the corresponding fraction for unflagged physicians

     Notes: The table reports the number and fraction of flagged physicians in calendar years 2012 and 2013. “Hours threshold” shows the cutoff number of hours
     billed per week above which a provider is flagged. “% in physicians working 20+ hr/week” shows the fraction of flagged physicians among physicians who billed
     at least 20 hours per week in the same calendar year. “% in all physicians” shows the fraction among all physicians in our sample, which covers the vast majority
     of physicians. “Zero-time codes” are codes for which time needed estimates are not available and account for 25% of all HCPCS codes. wRVU is the physician
     work RVUs that are specific to each HCPCS code and reflect the amount of work (primarily time) required to furnish each service. ∗ Unless otherwise specified,
     “unflagged” refers to unflagged physicians whose estimated weekly hours worked are above 20 in 2012 or 2013 or both.

Table 3: Flag patterns across time
Notes: The table the flagged pattern across time from calendar year 2012 to 2013. “Hours threshold” shows the
cutoff number of hours billed per week above which a provider is flagged. “Count” columns report the number of
physicians flagged (in 2012 only, in both years, or in 2013 only). “Share (%)” columns show the fraction of physicians
who are only flagged in 2012 (2013) among all physicians flagged in that year.


is over 13% using any threshold. However, when weighted by Work RVUs of the service codes, the
differences are much smaller. This is consistent with the fact that many of the zero-time codes have
low Work RVUs. Similarly, the differences between flagged and unflagged physicians are big when
we compare the unweighted number of claims for zero-timed codes, but shrink significantly once
weighted by revenues. These suggest that specialization in different types of services is unlikely to
result in large under-flagging of physicians, though having differential fractions of Medicare patients
still is.12
   Table 3 decomposes the flagged physicians into those flagged in 2012 only, in 2013 only, and in
both years. For example, 1,135 physicians are only flagged in 2012 using the 80-hour threshold,
making up 27.52% of all 4,125 physicians flagged in 2012.


4.1       Who Reported Implausibly Long Hours?

   In Tables 2-3, we used four different weekly hours thresholds to flag physicians. From now
on, we focus on physicians flagged using the 100-hour threshold, although all results hold under
alternative flagging criteria.13 In addition, we only focus on the subsample of 96,033 physicians
with more than 20 hours worked per week treating Medicare Part B FFS patients, as we believe
this is the more relevant group to be compared with the flagged physicians for reasons discussed
earlier.
   In Table 4 we compare the characteristics of physicians across the following groups, according
to the column headings: (1) all physicians, (2) never flagged, (3) flagged in any year, (4) flagged
in 2012, (5) flagged in 2013, (6) flagged only in 2012, (7) flagged in both 2012 and 2013, and (8)
flagged only in 2013. Table 4 shows that flagged physicians are slightly more likely to be male, non-
MD, more experienced, and provide fewer E/M services. Importantly, they work in substantially
  12
    We can not address this issue given the fact that our data only contains Medicare claims. However, our method can
be easily extended to a more general setting with augmented data from physician billing information for beneficiaries
of other insurance programs.

       We present the results under the 112 and 168 weekly hours flagging thresholds in the Online Appendix.

Table 4: Characteristics of flagged physicians vs unflagged physicians
Notes: The table compares the means of physician characteristics across subgroups (standard errors of the mean
estimator are reported in parentheses). We restrict the sample to physicians billing at least 20 hours per week in
at least one year. “All” refers to all physicians in this sample. “Never” refers to physicians never flagged in any
year. “Ever” refers to those flagged in at least one year. “2012” and “2013” refer to those flagged in 2012 and
2013, respectively. “2012 (2013) only” refers to those only flagged in 2012 (2013) but not the other year. “Both”
refers to those flagged in both years. Physician experience is imputed from the year of graduation. # providers in
group refers to the number of providers in the group practice where the billing physician works at. It is 1 if the
billing physician does not work in a group practice. The number of hospital affiliations are top coded at 5 in the
data. 1(in Medicare) is an indicator that the physician accepts Medicare approved payment amount. 1(in ERX)
is an indicator for participation in the Medicare Electronic Prescribing (eRx) Incentive Program, which encourages
eRx. 1(in PQRS) is an indicator for participation in the Medicare Physician Quality Reporting System Incentive
Program, which provides financial incentives to physicians who report quality measures. 1(in EHR) is an indicator
for participation in the Medicare Electronic Health Record (EHR) Incentive Program, which uses financial incentives
to reward the adoption of certified EHR technology.

Table 5: Characteristics of flagged physicians vs. unflagged physicians, conditional on Hospital
Referral Region (HRR)
Notes: The table summarizes the difference in physician characteristics between flagged subgroups and the never-
flagged subgroup (means reported in the last column) conditional on HRR. We restrict the sample to physicians
billing at least 20 hours per week in at least one year. The number in each cell is the estimated coefficient from an
OLS regression on the subset of physicians who are either never flagged, or have the flag status indicated by the
column heading. We use the physician characteristic in the corresponding row as the dependent variable, and the flag
status dummy as the explanatory variable together with HRR fixed effects. Standard errors clustered at the HRR
level are in brackets. * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01. Definition of the physician characteristics variables are
the same as specified in the notes of Table 4.


smaller group practices (if at all), and have fewer hospital affiliations.14 These characteristics are
similar to what Cutler et al. (2013) found about physicians who “consistently and unambiguously
recommended intensive care beyond those indicated by current clinical guidelines.”
   To account for the heterogeneity in physicians’ exposure to local Medicare markets, we compare
the same characteristics controlling for Hospital Referral Region (HRR) fixed effects in Table 5.
The 306 HRRs represent local health care markets and are commonly used as the unit of analysis
for regional variations of health care in the U.S. (Wennberg and Cooper (1996)). The number in
each cell in Table 5 is the estimated coefficient from an OLS regression on the subset of physicians
  14
    The CMS Physician Compare data, from which we obtain the physicians’ characteristics does not report their
race and age.

who are either never flagged, or have the flag status indicated by the column heading. We use the
physician characteristic in the corresponding row as the dependent variable, and the flag status
dummy as the explanatory variable together with HRR fixed effects. For example, physicians
ever flagged are 3.2 percentage points more likely to be male, 17.8 percentage points less likely to
have a MD, and tend to practice in groups with 52.3 fewer providers, etc. As it is clear from the
comparisons of Tables 4 and 5, the differences between flagged and unflagged physicians remain
qualitatively unchanged even after taking into account the HRR fixed effects.


4.2      What are the Specialties of Flagged Physicians?

   In addition to the individual characteristics of flagged physicians, we are also interested in
whether some specialties are more likely to be associated with flagged physicians. For this purpose,
we follow Fryer and Levitt (2004)’s approach toward quantifying the “blackness” of first names,
and construct the Specialty Flag Index (SFI) for specialty s:

                                                     100 × Pr (s|flagged)
                                    SFIs =                                                        (2)
                                              Pr (s|flagged) + Pr (s|unflagged)

where the conditional probability Pr (s|flagged) is defined as the fraction of flagged physicians in
specialty s among all flagged physicians, and Pr (s|unflagged) is the fraction of unflagged physicians
in specialty s among all unflagged physicians.15 The index ranges from 0 to 100. If all physicians
in specialty s are flagged, then SFIs takes on a value of 100. If only unflagged physicians are
specialty s, then SFIs is 0. If flagged and unflagged physicians are equally likely to be in specialty
s, then SFIs is 50. If flagged physicians are four times as likely to be in specialty s than unflagged
physicians, then SFIs = 100 × 4/(4 + 1) = 80. This measure is invariant to the fraction of the
flagged physicians among all physicians, and to the overall popularity of the specialty among all
physicians.
   The SFI is a convenient summary of how a given specialty is represented among the flagged
relative to its share in the entire physician population. A SFI of 50 indicates that specialty is
“fairly represented” among the flagged, i.e. Pr (s|flagged) and Pr (s|unflagged) are both equal to
the fraction of specialty s among all physicians. A SFI above 50 indicates that the specialty is
over-represented among the flagged physicians.
   Table 6 ranks the top specialties with at least 50 flagged physicians by their SFIs. For example,
optometry is considerably over-represented among the flagged physicians, accounting for more
than 20% of flagged physicians but less than 2% of all physicians, leading to SFIs over 90 in
 15
      We use the self-reported primary specialty when a physician is in multiple specialties.

Table 6: Physician specialties and flag status
Notes: The table shows seven specialties with the highest SFI, defined in Equation (2), among the specialties with
at least 50 flagged physicians. “% in all” shows the fraction of physicians in a specialty among all physicians in our
sample (restricted to physicians billing at least 20 hours per week in at least one year). The last row labeled “All
physicians” shows the number of flagged and unflagged physicians by year in our sample.


both years. On the contrary, internal medicine physicians are much under-represented among the
flagged physicians, with SFIs around 25. Moreover, note how the SFI as defined in (2) differs from
the simple probability that physicians of a given specialty are flagged, namely Pr(flagged|s). For
example, 386 (a mere 5%) of the 7,664 ophthalmologists are flagged in 2012, yet ophthalmology
still gets a high SFI of 68.5 because it only makes up 7.96% of all physicians in our sample but
contributes 16.8% to the 2,292 flagged physicians.


4.3    What Codes Do Flagged Physicians Tend to Bill?

   Similarly to how we constructed specialty flag index, we can also construct the Code Flag Index
(CFI) for each HCPCS code j as follows:

                                                   100 × Pr (j|flagged)
                                  CFIj =                                      ,                                   (3)
                                            Pr (j|flagged) + Pr (j|unflagged)

where the conditional probability Pr (j|flagged) is defined as the number of claims for HCPCS
code j filed by flagged physicians as a fraction of the total number of claims for all service codes
filed by flagged physicians; and Pr (j|unflagged) is the number of claims for HCPCS code j filed
by unflagged physicians as a fraction of the total number of claims for all service codes filed by
unflagged physicians. Like SFI, the CFI takes on values between 0 and 100; if a code is filed only
by flagged physicians, then its CFI will be 100; and if a code is filed only by unflagged physicians,
then its CFI is equal to 0. A code with a CFI of 50 indicates that it is filed by flagged and unflagged
physicians at equal rates.
   In Figure 2, we show that there is a nonlinear relationship between a code’s CFI and the
probability that it is filed by flagged physicians. For example, a HCPCS code with a 20% probability

Figure 2: The Relationship between HCPCS Code Flag Index and its Probability of Being Filed
by Flagged Physicians
Notes: The horizontal axis shows the probability of the HCPCS code being filed by a flagged physician (in %). The
vertical axis shows the Code Flag Index (CFI). We restrict the sample to HCPCS codes filed by physicians billing at
least 20 hours per week in at least one year. Each circle represents a HCPCS code, with the radius proportional to
total revenue. The dashed line is the “45-degree” line.

of being filed by flagged physicians can have a CFI over 75 if unflagged physicians file the code at
a much lower rate than flagged physicians.
   In Figure 3 we plot the distribution of CFIs among all HCPCS codes in our data.16 Panel
(a) is the unweighted distribution, which is roughly uniform. Panel (b) weighs the codes by their
corresponding service volume, i.e., the total number of times they are filed. Panel (c) weighs the
codes by their total Medicare reimbursement. A comparison between Panels (b) and (c) shows
that HCPCS codes with high CFIs do not necessarily have a lot of volume, but they do have
disproportionate costs to Medicare relative to their volume.
   In Figure 4 we compare the distributions of CFIs among flagged physicians and that of unflagged
physicians, weighted by volume of service. By construction, flagged physicians do tend to report
more high-CFI codes.


4.4    Decomposing the Long Hours and Quantifying Potential Overbilling

   The long hours worked as implied by the flagged physicians’ claims to Medicare can result from
high volumes of services with a given distribution of service intensity (the “extensive margin”)
and/or a larger fraction of higher-intensity services (the “intensive margin”). In Table 7, we
examine the composition of hours billed by flagged and unflagged physicians.
   Table 7 shows some rather interesting differences between flagged and unflagged physicians.
On average, flagged physicians submit more than twice as many service claims to Medicare in
a year as unflagged physicians, have about twice as many distinct Medicare patients in total,
treat about twice as many Medicare patients per day, and provide significantly more services per
patient. However, flagged physicians tend to file service claims with longer time requirement,
resulting in fewer services furnished per hour than unflagged physicians. Interestingly, the implied
Medicare payment per reported hour worked for flagged physicians is significantly lower than that
for unflagged physicians. Taking 2012 for example, flagged physicians on average furnish 176% more
services per year than unflagged physicians (12,549 versus 4,540); they have 110% more Medicare
Part B FFS patients (5,126 versus 2,430); they provide 72% more services on each patient (4.17
versus 2.43). They also tend to provide higher intensity services, which take longer to furnish (1.65
versus 2.88 services per hour, or 36 versus 21 minutes per service) and generate more revenue from
Medicare payment ($80.21 versus $74.81). However, since the higher revenue services require longer
time to furnish, the Medicare payment per hour for flagged physicians are substantially lower than
their unflagged peers ($118.54 versus $162.01).

    Of the 4,480 HCPCS codes, about 1,800 have a CFI of 0 in either year, and about 220 have a CFI of 100. These
codes are excluded from the figures so as not to distort the scales.

Table 7: Volumes of services supplied: flagged vs. unflagged physicians
Notes: The table compares the volumes of services furnished by physicians with different flag statuses. Standard
errors of the mean estimator are reported in parentheses. We restrict the sample to physicians billing at least 20
hours per week in at least one year. “Num. of patients” is an overestimation of the actual number of distinct patients
due to data limitation, because it is the physician-level sum of the number of distinct patients for each code the
physician billed. Hence a patient receiving more than one type of service will be counted multiple times. “Num. of
patients per day” is the average number of patients per day assuming 366 (365) working days in year 2012 (2013).
“Per hour” statistics are calculated using the estimated total hours worked of each physician.

Table 8: Volume of services supplied conditional on Hospital Referral Regions: flagged vs. un-
flagged physicians
Notes: The table compares the volume of services furnished by physicians of different subgroups. We restrict the
sample to physicians billing at least 20 hours per week in at least one year. The first two columns report the esti-
mation results from OLS regressions using the volume measure in that row as the dependent variable, and the flag
dummy as the explanatory variable, together with HRR fixed effects. Standard errors clustered at the HRR level
are in brackets. ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01. The last two columns report the means of the two unflagged groups as
references. “Num. of patients” is an overestimation of the actual number of distinct patients due to data limitation,
because it is the physician-level sum of the number of distinct patients for each code the physician billed. Hence a
patient receiving more than one type of service will be counted multiple times. “Num. of patients per day” is the
average number of patients per day assuming 366 (365) working days in year 2012 (2013). “Per hour” statistics are
calculated using the estimated total hours worked of each physician.


   In Table 8 we show that the results persist when we control for the Hospital Referral Region
fixed effects .
   The sizable difference in Medicare payment per hour between flagged and unflagged physicians
motivates our construction of the Overbilling Potential Factor (OPF), which quantifies the extent
to which there may be overbilling. We provide two alternative ways to construct the OPF.
   Our first measure of overbilling potential is:

                               Total revenuei              Total revenuei
                   OPF1i ≡                    =                                       ,                          (4)
                               Fair revenuei    (Fair hourly revenue)i × (Fair hours)

where “Total revenue” is the observed annual Medicare Part B FFS payments of physician i;
“Fair hourly revenue” is the predicted hourly revenue for physician i based on an OLS regression
of the hourly revenues of unflagged physicians on observables, which include physician gender,
credential, years of experience, and a full set of specialty, HRR, and year fixed effects; and “Fair

Table 9: Hourly revenues and Overbilling Potential Factors (OPFs)
Notes: The table compares the hourly revenues and OPFs (defined in Equations (4) and (5)) between flagged
and unflagged physicians. We restrict the sample to physicians billing at least 20 hours per week in at least one
year. Reported hourly revenues are total revenues divided by total hours reported in one calendar year. Predicted
hourly revenues are obtained by first regressing reported hourly revenues on observables (gender, credential, years
of experience, a full set of specialty, HRR, and year fixed effects) using the unflagged sample, and then predicting a
“fair” hourly revenues for all physicians based on the regression estimates. Standard errors of the mean estimator
are reported in parentheses.


hours” is set to be 8 hours per day times 365 days. An OPF1 above 1 captures the excess revenue
relative to the predicted “fair” amount that is not explained by observed physician and local market
characteristics.
   Our second measure of overbilling potential is to compare the reported hours and the likely true
hours, where the latter is the unknown number of hours physicians actually worked. Under the
assumption that the goal of overbilling is to achieve the same revenue with fewer actual hours, we
have, for each flagged physician i:


   Likely True Hoursi × Fair hourly revenuei = Reported hoursi × Reported hourly revenuei .

where, as in (4), “Fair hourly revenue” is the predicted hourly revenue for physician i based on
an OLS regression of the hourly revenues of unflagged physicians on observables, which include
physician gender, credential, years of experience, and a full set of specialty, HRR, and year fixed
effects; and “Reported hourly revenue” is simply the total revenue received by physician i divided
by the total hours reported by i, which we estimated based on i’s claims.
   Table 9 summarizes the reported and predicted hourly revenues and the two OPFs. For flagged
physicians, the reported hourly revenues is $22, or 19%, less than the predicted revenue; but
for unflagged physicians, reported and predicted hourly revenues are almost identical. Flagged
physicians have an average OPF1 of 1.907, meaning that the total revenue from Medicare Part B



                                                         23
FFS beneficiaries is almost twice as high as that of an unflagged peer with identical observable
characteristics, assuming their actual hours worked are identical (8 hours per day times 365 days).
Similarly, the average OPF2 for flagged physicians is 5.978, suggesting that the reported hours
could be six times as much as the likely true hours worked.
   Panels (a) and (c) in Figure 5 plot the distribution of OPF1 and OPF2, respectively, among the
flagged and unflagged physicians. Note that, despite the heterogeneity within flagged and unflagged
physicians, the distributions under both OPFs for the flagged physicians represent a substantial
rightward shift of those for the unflagged physicians. In Panel (b) we present the scatter plots
of the predicted hourly revenue and the reported hourly revenue. It is clear that the majority of
flagged physicians have lower reported hourly revenue than the predicted hourly revenue, whereas
the opposite is true for unflagged physicians.


4.5   Coding Decisions and Fee Differentials

   We now test whether coding decisions respond to financial incentives provided by different
levels of service codes, and examine how they differ between flagged and unflagged physicians. In
particular, we are interested in physicians’ choice of code intensities conditional on filing a code
from a given cluster. Using the code cluster presented in Table 1 as an example, we would like to
know why a physician bills code 99203 more often than 99202 when a service in this code cluster -
office or other outpatient visit for new patients - is furnished.
   For this purpose, we analyze the physicians’ coding decisions by K, the number of intensity
levels in a code cluster, for K = 3, 4 or 5. For each K ∈ {3, 4, 5} , we use the following baseline
regression specification:


      Yijt = β0 + β1 Flaggedit + β22 1{Intensity = 2}j + · · · + β2K 1{Intensity = K}j

                +β32 Flaggedit × 1{Intensity = 2}j + · · · + β3K Flaggedit × 1{Intensity = K}j

                +αHRR + ηJ + φt + εijt                                                             (6)


where Yijt is the number of times physician i filed code j in year t; Flaggedit is an indicator for
whether physician i is flagged in year t; 1{Intensity = 2}j is an indicator for code j having intensity
2 in its cluster; 1{Intensity = K}j is defined likewise, with K, the highest intensity level, being 3,
4, or 5 depending on the cluster; αHRR is the HRR fixed effect; ηJ is the code cluster fixed effect,
where J is the cluster that j belongs to; φt is the year fixed effect; and εijt is the error which will
be clustered at the physician level.
   Our primary interest is on coefficients (β32 , . . . , β3K ), which capture the excess tendency of

Table 10: Billing patterns and code intensity level
Notes: The table reports OLS estimates of the partial effects of code intensity on the number of times the code
is filed. We restrict the sample in all specifications to physicians billing at least 20 hours per week in at least one
year. Furthermore, Columns (1) to (3) are only using the subsamples of code clusters with 3, 4, and 5 levels of
intensities, respectively. Columns (4) pool codes in all clusters together, and re-classify intensities to low, middle,
and high as specified in Table 11. Columns (5) and (6) use the subsample of codes with below- and above-average
marginal increase in work RVUs between two adjacent intensity levels, respectively. Physician characteristics, HRR
fixed effects, code cluster fixed effects, year fixed effects, and a constant term are included in all specifications but
not reported. Standard errors clustered at the physician level are in brackets. ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.

flagged physicians to file codes at varying intensity levels relative to their unflagged peers. A
positive β3K , for example, indicates that flagged physicians bill more highest-intensity codes than
unflagged physicians. And because higher code intensity translates into more work RVU and thus
greater Medicare reimbursement, this is consistent with flagged physicians responding to financial
incentives when choosing which code within a cluster to bill. Columns (1) to (3) in Table 10 report
the estimation results on the subsample of codes in clusters with K = 3, 4, 5, respectively. Taking
K = 3 clusters for example, a flagged physician files 369 more codes with intensity level 2, and 128
codes with intensity level 3 than an unflagged physician with identical observables. The same is
true for other code clusters, although the estimates are much noisier for those in K = 4 clusters
due to a small sample size. These results show that codes chosen by flagged physicians strongly tilt
toward higher intensities to an extent that is hard to explain by service specialization or exposure
to different markets.
   In Column (4) of Table 10, we pool codes from all clusters and re-classify the intensities to three
levels, low, middle, and high as specified in Table 11. The regression results show that flagged
physicians tend to file more mid-intensity codes than their unflagged peers, but not so much for
high-intensity codes. This seems to contradict the hypothesis that financial incentives affect the
coding decisions of flagged physicians. However, we find very different patterns when we run the
baseline regression separately on the two subsamples where the marginal increase in Work RVU
between two adjacent levels is below average (Column (5)) and above average (Column (6)). For
example, suppose that Work RVUs increase by 100% per intensity level on average, then codes
99201 through 99205 enter the regression in Column (5) instead of (6) because the Work RVU
increase between any two adjacent intensities in that code cluster is less than 100%. We find that
flagged physicians do not tend to file more higher-intensity codes with below average Work RVU
increments; but they do so for codes with above average Work RVU increments. This shows that
flagged physicians do not simply over-file all codes with higher intensities. Instead, data suggest that
the coding patterns are consistent with a hypothesis that flagged physicians respond to financial
incentives – recall that work RVUs are closely related to Medicare reimbursements. In particular,
for codes where the marginal gain in revenue from “upcoding” is relatively low, flagged physicians
actually file fewer mid- and high-intensity codes than their peers; but they do file more mid- and
high-intensity codes when the marginal gain in revenue from “upcoding” is relatively high.
   Note that the regression analysis above focuses on upcoding within service clusters. There could
potentially be other ways of overbilling that are not captured in these results. Physicians could bill
for more of a given service code than it was actually provided, regardless of its intensity; or could
upcode across code clusters by misreporting the type of service provided (e.g., office visits of new

patients, which are paid more vs. office visits of established patients, which are paid less). There is
no shortage of such overbilling practices according to Department of Health and Human Services
(2015). For this reason, the regression results above are likely to be lower-bound estimates of the
extent to which flagged physician are potentially overbilling.


5         Supplemental Results from External Data

     Before concluding this paper, we corroborate our findings using two external datasets. Doing so
both serves as a sanity check for our approach toward detecting potential Medicare overbilling, and
at the same time points to possible directions in which our approach may improve existing ones.


5.1         Physician Working Patterns in the National Ambulatory Medical Care Sur-
            vey (NAMCS) Data

     The NAMCS by the National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, provides a nationally representative sample of office-based physicians. Each sampled
physician is randomly assigned a week for which detailed visit-level data are collected. Given that
the CMS Medicare Part B FFS sample covers the vast majority of physicians in the U.S., the two
should be fairly comparable.17
     We first examine the self-reported fraction of Medicare services by physicians sampled in NAMCS.
In Table 12, “Medicare patients” are those whose primary payer is Medicare. “% Medicare pa-
tients” is the weighted average of the fractions of such patients among all the sampled patients of
the reporting physicians. “% Medicare services” and “% time spent with Medicare patients” are
defined similarly using the number of services and recorded time physicians spent with Medicare
patients. “% revenue from Medicare” is imputed from a categorical variable describing the fraction
of the reporting physician’s revenue from Medicare payments, with the categories being 0-25, 26-50,
51-75, and 76-100 percents. The figure reported in this table is calculated under the assumption
    17
         We discuss the comparability of the two samples in more detail in the Appendix.

                                                                        (0.006)

                               % revenue from Medicare                   0.297

   Next we look into physician hours worked. Ideally, we would like to use NAMCS to calculate the
self-reported total hours worked in the sampled week for each surveyed physician, who are asked to
document the time they spent on patients during each visit. However, NAMCS does not sample all
the visits within the chosen week, and the sampling rate varies from 100% for very small practices
and 10% for very large practices. Because we don’t have information on practice sizes (except for
whether the physicians work in a solo or group practice), we cannot infer the total number of visits
from the NAMCS sample. That said, the maximum sampled number of hours spent on Medicare
patients per week is 15.17 for physicians working in a solo practice (all of whose visits are sampled),
and 49.82 for those working in group practices (the size of which is unknown).
   The above comparison shows that Medicare services typically account for about one-third of
a physician’s entire workload, and take far fewer hours than the 100-hour threshold we used to
flag potential overbilling (at least for physicians working in solo practices). This again supports
our view that the approach we develop to flag physicians for potential overbilling is likely to be
conservative.


5.2    Comparison with the Comprehensive Error Rate Testing (CERT) Program

   Finally, we relate the HCPCS code CFIs that we constructed in Section 4.3 with the findings
from the CMS CERT program. CERT draws a “statistically valid random sample of claims”
(about 50,000) every year, requests documentation from the filing providers, and hires medical re-
view professionals to determine whether payments to these claims are proper or not based on their
documentation. The reviewers can disapprove improper payments to claims that have insufficient
documentation, questionable medical necessity, incorrect coding, or for other reasons. The disap-
proval rate for Medicare Part B claims, calculated as the percentage disapproved in all sampled
Part B claims, is 18.93% in 2012, and CMS reports Part B improper payment rate - the percentage

                                                      29
of Medicare dollars paid incorrectly - for 2012 to be 12.1% (see Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services (2015)).18
   Applying the same idea as the Code Flag Index described in Section 4.3, we can use the preva-
lence of a code j among the disapproved claims and its prevalence among the approved claims to
construct a Code Disapproval Index (CDI) for the 1,621 HCPCS codes reviewed by CERT:

                                          100 × Pr (j|disapproved claims)
                       CDIj =                                                      ,                          (7)
                                Pr (j|disapproved claims) + Pr (j|approved claims)

where Pr (j|disapproved claims) is the fraction of claims for HCPCS code j among all disapproved
claims; and Pr (j|approved claims) is the faction of claims for HCPCS code j among all approved
claims. The CDI also ranges from 0 to 100. If HCPCS code j appears only among disapproved
claims, then its CDI takes on a value of 100. If a code only appears among approved claims, then
its CDI is equal to 0.
   We should note that the CDI as calculated from the pools of approved and disapproved claims
in CERT data is not directly comparable to the CFI we calculated in Section 4.3. CDI is based
on the prevalence of a code j among the disapproved claims relative to its prevalence among the
approved claims, while CFI is based on the prevalence of a code j among the flagged physicians
relative to its prevalence among the unflagged physicians. Note that we flag physicians based on
whether the hours worked implied by their claims are implausibly long, but we do not take a
stand on whether or not any particular claim is suspicious. On the other hand, CERT program is
examining whether particular claims are legitimate, but does not take into account of the overall
billings of the physicians. Thus we believe that the CFI we construct and CDI calculated from the
CERT data are complementary.
   In Figure 6 we compare CDIs and CFIs for the 1,621 HCPCS codes that appear in the CERT
data, where each HCPCS code is represented by a circle, with the radius proportional to its total
Medicare reimbursement in our CMS sample.19 Codes falling into the southwest quarter of the
plane have both CFIs and CDIs below 50. On the other hand, codes in the northeast quarter
are those with both indices above 50, and are thus more frequently associated with (potentially)
inappropriate billing practice. These two quarters are cases where our flagging approach and CERT
review results agree. On the other hand, codes in the southeast quarter are those with high CDIs
from CERT but low CFIs in our sample. Similarly, codes in the northwest quarter are those with

0.2 percentage points to the 12.1% improper payment rate as reported by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(2015).

       The HCPCS codes not reviewed by CERT make up 6.2% of total reimbursement in our CMS sample.

Figure 6: HCPCS Code Flag Index (CFI) and CERT Code Disapproval Index
Notes: The horizontal axis shows the CERT Code Disapproval Index, defined in Equation (7). The vertical axis
shows the CFI, defined in Equation (3). We restrict the sample to HCPCS codes filed by physicians billing at least 20
hours per week in at least one year and sampled in CERT. The graph has 1621 codes in total. Each circle represents
a code, with the radius proportional to total Medicare reimbursement. The dashed line represents cases where the
two indices are equal (i.e. a “45-degree” line). The solid horizontal and vertical lines show indices of 50.


    The comparison between CDI and CFI suggests that our approach to construct Code Flag
Index based on flagged and unflagged physicians could potentially contribute to existing auditing
methods. Re-formulating sampling strategies to focus more on HCPCS codes with high CFIs,
especially those where CFI and CERT CDI differ substantially, may help better detect and deter
inappropriate billing with limited regulatory resources. The CFI we construct can help to screen
codes that are more likely to be associated with potential overbilling and overbilling.


6     Conclusion

    In this paper, we propose and implement a novel approach to detect potential overbilling in
Medicare reimbursement based on the simple idea that all physicians have a fixed time budget in
a given period (a calendar year for example) and the services claimed for reimbursement require
time to complete. We construct the implied hours worked at the individual physician level based on

                                                          31
service codes submitted to Medicare. We flag physicians as potentially overbilling based on whether
the implied hours worked are implausibly long. Our method for detecting potential overbilling
has at least three advantages relative to the existing methods. First, it imposes minimal data
requirements, and is easy to implement, automate, and update over time. Second, it mitigates
the impact of confounding factors in the detection of overbilling such as selection and physician
heterogeneity, because all physicians face the same time constraint regardless of their patient pool
or practice patterns. Finally, it allows users to freely choose the level of stringency when flagging
potential overbilling. For example, one could use a different threshold of weekly hours worked
or, if higher frequency data are available, flag physicians based on claims filed in a quarter, a
month, or even a week, in which case there is less intertemporal smoothing than is permitted in
our sample. Interestingly, we also find suggestive evidence that the coding patterns of the flagged
physicians seem to be responsive to financial incentives: within code clusters with different levels of
service intensity, they tend to submit more higher-intensity service codes than unflagged physicians;
moreover, they are more likely to do so if the marginal gain revenue from submitting mid- or high-
intensity codes is relatively high.
   Our approach provides a quick and easy tool for detecting potential overbilling, but we would
like to emphasize that it does not provide definite evidence for fraudulent coding, nor does it
substitute existing methods based on auditing. Rather, we view our approach as a useful screening
tool to identify individual physicians, specialties, or HCPCS codes whose billing patterns are highly
consistent with overbilling and are hard to reconcile using observables. For example, the HCPCS
code CFIs suggest that certain codes are disproportionately associated with flagged physicians, and
thus may need more auditing attention. This can help improve the efficiency in the allocation of
limited regulatory resources.

A      Multiple Physicians Billing Under the Same NPI

    In our analysis, it is important that all claims under the same NPI are services furnished by
the same individual. This should be the case per the request of NPI-related regulations. NPI
was introduced in 2005 to improve the administration of Medicare, Medicaid, and other health
programs, especially to facilitate electronic data transmission. According to the NPI Final Rule by
the Department of Health and Human Services, NPIs are only assigned to “individuals and entities
that are licensed and do furnish health care,” and stay unchanged in most cases.20 NPIs with
“entity type code” of 1 are individual human beings (“individuals”), and those with “entity type
code” of 2 are organizational providers (“organizations”), such as hospitals, clinics, and nursing
homes. Individual providers who are members of an organization and the organization they are
affiliated with need to have separate NPI numbers (Department of Health and Human Services
(2004)). In addition, the NPI Final Rule also requires that “[providers], according to Federal
statute and regulations, must be issued their own identification numbers in order to bill and receive
payments from Medicare.” Hence the providers have to bill for their own, or have a billing agency
do it on their behalf, but cannot bill under other providers’ NPIs. Because of its many advantages,
NPIs are commonly used in scholarly articles to track physician activity (Gustafson et al. (2011);
Welch et al. (2014)). One paper using the unique physician identification numbers (UPINs), which
were established before NPIs, acknowledged that “in some cases, different physicians and loosely
affiliated practices bill under the same identifier,” and that the new NPIs would have avoided this
problem (Pham et al. (2007)).
    We are confident that in the vast majority of cases the claims filed under the same NPI are
from the same provider. However there may be exceptions to the above rules. In cases where an
auxiliary personnel furnished an “incident to” service following CMS guidelines,21 the auxiliary
personnel may bill under the NPI of the physician who sets the plan of care (POC). However,
these exceptions have minimal influence. This is because (a) CMS guidelines for “incident to”
services require that they must be furnished “under the [billing] physician’s direct supervision,”
which means the billing physician must be in the same designated office area, and immediately
available to provide assistance and direction. This indicates that the physician is spending almost

     An NPI is “a permanent identifier, assigned for life, unless circumstances justify deactivation, such as
a health care provider who finds that his or her NPI has been used fraudulently by another entity” (see
Department of Health and Human Services (2004)).
  21
     CMS defines “incident to” services as “those services that are furnished incident to physician professional
services in the physician’s office (whether located in a separate office suite or within an institution) or in a
patient’s home” (see Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (2002)).

these “incident to” services are restricted to non-facilities, which only account for part of our data.


B    Comparability of the Main Sample and the NAMCS Sample

    Table A1 shows the balancing test results between the NAMCS 2012 data and our main sample
constructed from the CMS Medicare Part B FFS Physician Utilization and Payment Data. A
few things are done to ensure the comparison between the two are sensible. NAMCS restricts its
sample to Doctors of Medicine (MD) and Doctors of Osteopathy (DO). The CMS sample is thus
also restricted to include only those with a MD or DO. A tiny fraction of physicians are both MD
and DO (59 in total) and they are counted as DOs for calculations in this table. “Solo practice” in
NAMCS questionnaires is not explicitly defined. Thus 1(solo practice) in the CMS sample is defined
as having no more than 5 providers (including nurses and physician assistants, etc.). NAMCS only
asks the sampled physician whether the (group) practice they belong to has applied for CMS
incentive programs encouraging effective use of health IT. Thus 1(in IT incentive program) in CMS
is defined accordingly as a dummy variable for participation in any of the incentive programs.

    Detecting Potential Overbilling in Medicare Reimbursement via
                                         Hours Worked

    In Section A of this online appendix, we show that our results are not driven by residents who
may be working long hours. In Section B we show that all of our results are robust to using 112 or
168 weekly hours as the flagging thresholds.


A       Are We Flagging Mostly Residents?

    Residents are known to working long and continuous hours; and most regulations in recent years
restrict resident working hours to no more than 80 hours per week averaged over four weeks (see
Wolman et al. (2009)). Therefore extra caution must be exercised when “flagging” residents, for
whom it can be perfectly normal (unfortunately) to have extremely long hours. For this reason,
we only include in our main sample physicians at least one year out of medical school (i.e. those
graduated in or before 2011). However, residency can range from one to seven years depending on
the specialty, so it is still possible that some of the physicians graduated in more recent years are
residents.
    In order to check that we are not flagging mostly residents, we first identify possible residents
in our sample, and see how many of them are flagged. We mark physician i of specialty s as a
possible resident if i graduated in or after the year (2012 − TsR ), where TsR is one year plus the
typical length of residency for specialty s. For example, the typical residency for family practice
is 3 years, therefore we mark family practice physicians as possible residents if they graduated

in or after 2008. We are adding one year in order identify all possible residents - there could
be variations in residency lengths, and some institutions require an extra year after residency to
focus on research. Moreover, we use 2012 in the formula for finding possible residents so that the
remainder of physicians are not residents in any year in our sample, which covers both 2012 and
2013.
    Table A1 summarizes the number of possible residents flagged in 2012 and 2013 under varying
thresholds. Only a handful of flagged physicians are possible residents, ranging from 16 under the
80-hour threshold to only 2 or 3 under the 168-hour threshold. These possible residents make up
less than 0.6% of all flagged physicians. This shows that it is not the residents with long hours that
are driving our results.


B       Robustness of Results to Alternative Flagging Thresholds

    In this section we show the robustness of our main results to the choice of flagging thresholds.
One might be concerned, despite our deliberately conservative estimates of hours worked, that
the 100-hour-per-week threshold might have caught physicians whose billing truthfully reflects the
services they provide. Now we use the two higher thresholds, 112 and 168 hours per week, and
show that the main results persist under these thresholds.


B.1     Who Reported Implausibly Long Hours?

    Tables B2 and B3 are counterparts to Table 5 of in our paper, except that they use the two
alternative thresholds, respectively. The flagged physicians are still more likely to be males, less
likely to have a MD, slightly more experienced, work in much smaller group practices and have
fewer hospital affiliations. These results are highly similar to those obtained using the 100-hour
threshold in terms of sign, magnitude, and the level of statistical significance.

Table B2: Characteristics of flagged physicians (threshold being 112 hours/week) vs. unflagged
physicians, conditional on Hospital Referral Region (HRR)
Notes: The table summarizes the difference in physician characteristics between flagged subgroups and the never-
flagged subgroup (means reported in the last column) conditional on HRR. We restrict the sample to physicians
billing at least 20 hours per week in at least one year. The number in each cell is the estimated coefficient from an
OLS regression using the physician characteristic in the corresponding row as the dependent variable, and the flag
status dummy (defined by the heading of the column) as the explanatory variable together with HRR fixed effects.
Standard errors clustered at the HRR level are in brackets. * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01. “All” refers to all
physicians in this sample. “Never” refers to physicians never flagged in any year. “Ever” refers to those flagged in
at least one year. “2012” and “2013” refer to those flagged in 2012 and 2013, respectively. “2012 (2013) only” refers
to those only flagged in 2012 (2013) but not the other year. “Both” refers to those flagged in both years. Physician
experience is imputed from the year of graduation. # providers in group refers to the number of providers in the
group practice where the billing physician works at. It is 1 if the billing physician does not work in a group practice.
The number of hospital affiliations are top coded at 5 in the data. 1(in Medicare) is an indicator that the physician
accepts Medicare approved payment amount. 1(in ERX) is an indicator for participation in the Medicare Electronic
Prescribing (eRx) Incentive Program, which encourages eRx. 1(in PQRS) is an indicator for participation in the
Medicare Physician Quality Reporting System Incentive Program, which provides financial incentives to physicians
who report quality measures. 1(in EHR) is an indicator for participation in the Medicare Electronic Health Record
(EHR) Incentive Program, which uses financial incentives to reward the adoption of certified EHR technology.

B.2     What are the Specialties of Flagged Physicians?

   Tables B4 and B5 show that SFIs for the 7 specialties in Table 6 of our paper remain qualitatively
unchanged. The 4 specialties that are over-represented among the flagged physicians, optometry,
dermatology, ophthalmology and pathology, still have SFIs above 50; the 3 specialties that are
under-represented, nephrology, cardiology and internal medicine, still have SFIs below 50, although
with slight changes in their rankings. In fact, the discrepancies in SFIs become larger when we use a
higher flagging threshold – over-represented specialties get even larger SFIs, and under-represented
specialties get even smaller SFIs.

B.3     What Codes Do Flagged Physicians Tend to Bill?

   Figures B1 and B2 plot the relationship between HCPCS Code Flag Indices (CFIs) and the
probability a code is filed by a flagged physician. Not surprisingly, the non-linearity is preserved
under alternative flagging thresholds, and becomes stronger when the threshold is higher.

The Relationship between HCPCS Code Flag Index and its Probability of Being Filed by Flagged
Physicians
Notes: The horizontal axis shows the probability of the HCPCS code being filed by a flagged physician (in %). The
vertical axis shows the Code Flag Index (CFI). We restrict the sample to HCPCS codes filed by physicians billing at
least 20 hours per week in at least one year. Each circle represents a HCPCS code, with the radius proportional to
total revenue. The dashed line is the “45-degree” line.


         Figure B3 and B4 plot the distribution of CFIs under the two alternative thresholds. We still see
that high-SFI codes have disproportionately high shares of reimbursement relative to their volumes.
         Figures B5 and B6 plot the CFI distributions for codes filed by flagged physicians (solid lines)
and by unflagged physicians (dashed lines). Again by construction, flagged physicians file more
high-CFI codes. The difference between flagged and unflagged physicians is more dramatic when
the higher flagging threshold, 168 hours per week, is used.


B.4                    Decomposing the Long Hours and Quantifying Potential Overbilling

         Tables B6 and B7 show how the decomposition of services provided by flagged physicians differs
from that of unflagged physicians. Just as Table 8 in our paper shows, flagged physicians provide
more services and treat more Medicare Part B FFS patients in total; they also provide more services
per patient, and tend to choose services of higher intensity; with average per-service revenues only
slightly higher than those of unflagged physicians, they end up with substantially lower imputed
hourly revenues. Again, the differences are larger under the 168-hour threshold.
         Tables B8 and B9 compare the hourly revenues and Overbilling Potential Factors (OPFs) be-
tween flagged and unflagged physicians. The results are still highly similar to those in our paper
using the 100-hour threshold, both qualitatively and quantitatively. In particular, flagged physi-
cians have very large discrepancies between their reported and predicted hourly revenues; their

Table B6: Volume of services supplied conditional on Hospital Referral Regions: flagged vs.
unflagged physicians (threshold being 112 hours/week)
Notes: The table compares the volume of services furnished by physicians of different subgroups. We restrict the
sample to physicians billing at least 20 hours per week in at least one year. The first two columns report the estimation
results from OLS regressions using the volume measure in that row as the dependent variable, and the flag dummy as
the explanatory variable, together with HRR fixed effects. Standard errors clustered at the HRR level are in brackets.
** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01. The last two columns report the means of the two unflagged groups as references. “Num.
of patients” is an overestimation of the actual number of distinct patients due to data limitation, because it is the
physician-level sum of the number of distinct patients for each code the physician billed. Hence a patient receiving
more than one type of service will be counted multiple times. “Num. of patients per day” is the average number of
patients per day assuming 366 (365) working days in year 2012 (2013). “Per hour” statistics are calculated using the
estimated total hours worked of each physician.

OPF1, which captures the excess revenue they get relative to their unflagged peers (assuming iden-
tical hours worked), is still around 2; and their OPF2, which describes the extent to which they
could be over-reporting hours worked (assuming the goal of overbilling is to achieve the same rev-
enue with fewer hours), ranges between 6.178 and 9.805. The results for unflagged physicians also
barely change from those reported in the paper.

Table B8:   Hourly revenues and Overbilling Potential Factors (OPFs) (threshold being 112
hours/week)
Notes: The table compares the hourly revenues and OPFs between flagged and unflagged physicians. We restrict
the sample to physicians billing at least 20 hours per week in at least one year. Reported hourly revenues are total
revenues divided by total hours reported in one calendar year. Predicted hourly revenues are obtained by first re-
gressing reported hourly revenues on observables (gender, credential, years of experience, a full set of specialty, HRR,
and year fixed effects) using the unflagged sample, and then predicting a “fair” hourly revenues for all physicians
based on the regression estimates. Standard errors of the mean estimator are reported in parentheses.

Table B9:   Hourly revenues and Overbilling Potential Factors (OPFs) (threshold being 168
hours/week)
Notes: See notes to Table B8.


   Figures B7 and B8 plot the OPFs for both flagged and unflagged physicians using the 112-
hour and the 168-hour thresholds, respectively. The distributions of flagged physicians’ OPF1 and
OPF2 are still shifted rightward relative to the distributions of unflagged physicians. Moreover,
Panel (b)’s of both figures also show that many flagged physicians’ reported revenues fall below
their predicted “fair” hourly revenues, whereas the reverse is true for unflagged physicians.

Overbilling Potential Factors (OPFs)
Notes: The two figures on the top show the distribution of OPF1 for flagged (left) and unflagged (right) physicians.
The two scatter plots in the middle are showing predicted hourly revenues (on the vertical axis, based on OLS
regression conditional on physician gender, credential (MD dummy), years of experience, as well as a full set of
specialty, HRR, and year fixed effect) against reported hourly revenues (on the horizontal axis). The thick solid line
is the “45-degree” line. The two figures on the bottom show the distribution of OPF2 for flagged (left) and unflagged
(right) physicians. The bin widths in all four histograms are 0.2.

B.5                    Coding Decisions and Fee Differentials

         Tables B10 and B11, counterparts to Table 10 of our paper, present the regression results
obtained under the two alternative flagging thresholds. All key findings are robust to the choice
of thresholds, except that estimates for flag-related variables tend to have larger standard errors.
This is because the thresholds used here lead to a much smaller group of flagged physicians, making
estimates noisier.


B.6                    Comparison with the Comprehensive Error Rate Testing (CERT) Program

         Figures B9 and B10 plot the comparison between HCPCS Code Flag Indices (CFIs) that we
constructed using the CMS data and Code Disapproval Indices (CDIs) we calculated using CERT
auditing results. Under the higher thresholds (112-hour and 168-hour), CFIs become more extreme,
which adds to the incomparability of CFIs and CDIs (see discussion in the paper). This naturally
reduces the correlation between the two indices.

HCPCS Code Flag Index (CFI) and CERT Code Disapproval Index
Notes: The horizontal axis shows the CERT Code Disapproval Index. The vertical axis shows the CFI. We restrict
the sample to HCPCS codes filed by physicians billing at least 20 hours per week in at least one year and sampled
in CERT. The graph has 1621 codes in total. Each circle represents a code, with the radius proportional to total
Medicare reimbursement. The dashed line represents cases where the two indices are equal (i.e. a “45-degree” line).
The solid horizontal and vertical lines show indices of 50.

Table B10: Billing patterns and code intensity level (threshold being 112 hours/week)
Notes: The table reports OLS estimates of the partial effects of code intensity on the number of times the code
is filed. We restrict the sample in all specifications to physicians billing at least 20 hours per week in at least one
year. Furthermore, Columns (1) to (3) are only using the subsamples of code clusters with 3, 4, and 5 levels of
intensities, respectively. Columns (4) pool codes in all clusters together, and re-classify intensities to low, middle,
and high as specified in our paper. Columns (5) and (6) use the subsample of codes with below- and above-average
marginal increase in work RVUs between two adjacent intensity levels, respectively. Physician characteristics, HRR
fixed effects, code cluster fixed effects, year fixed effects, and a constant term are included in all specifications but
not reported. Standard errors clustered at the physician level are in brackets. * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.
