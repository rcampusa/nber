                                           ABSTRACT

The participation of interest groups in public policy making is unavoidable. Its unavoidable nature
is only matched by the universal suspicion with which it has been seen by both policy makers and
the public. Recently, however, there has been a growing literature that examines the participation
of interest groups in public policy making from a New Institutional Economics perspective. The
distinguishing feature of the New Institutional Economics Approach is its emphasis in opening up
the black box of decision-making, whether in understanding the rules of the game, or the play of the
game. In this paper we do not attempt to fairly describe the vast literature on interest group's
behavior. Instead, the purpose of this essay for the New Institutional Economics Guide Book is to
review recent papers that follow the NIE mantra. That is, they attempt to explicate the
micro-analytic features of the way interest groups actually interact with policy-makers, rather than
providing an abstract high-level representation. We emphasize the role of the institutional
environment in understanding interest groups' strategies.

I.       Introduction

The participation of interest groups in public policy making is unavoidable. No society

can be so repressive nor individual power be so extreme that decisions are undertaken by

a narrow clique of individuals without consideration to others. Its unavoidable nature is

only matched by the universal suspicion with which it has been seen by both policy

makers and the public. Recently, however, there has been a growing literature that

examines the participation of interest groups in public policy making from a New

Institutional Economics perspective. The distinguishing feature of the New Institutional

Economics Approach, as it is understood today, is its emphasis in opening up the black

box of decision-making, whether in understanding the rules of the game, or the play of

the game. Indeed, as Oliver Williamson says,

         “The NIE has progressed not by advancing an overarching theory but by

         uncovering and explicating the microanalytic features [of institutions] to

         which Arrow refers and by piling block upon block until the cumulative

         value added cannot be denied.”1

Thus, in this paper we do not attempt to fairly describe the vast literature on interest

group’s behavior. Instead, we mostly review recent papers that follow Williamson’s NIE

mantra. That is, they attempt to explicate the micro-analytic features of the way interest

groups actually interact with policy-makers, rather than providing an abstract high-level

representation.2

         We start this survey by emphasizing that to understand the role of interest groups

in the modern administrative state, it is fundamental to recognize that while legislatures

enact statutes, and often supervise their implementation, it is bureaucracies that, via the

administrative process, make and implement the bulk of policies. Consider, for example,

telecommunications in the United States. For more than 60 years the main body of

telecommunications legislation in the United States was the Federal Communications Act

(FCA) of 1934.3 This piece of legislation specifically directed the newly created Federal

Communications Commission to regulate interstate communications so as to provide

telecommunications services at “just, fair and reasonable prices.” Nowhere in the Act

were there specific instructions about how to obtain that general goal. Furthermore, the

Act presumed the existence of a monopoly supplier of long distance services. The

fostering of competition was not one of the stated goals of the Act. Even though the FCA

was silent about competition, from the late 1950s until the Telecommunications Act of

1996, the FCC was engaged in a process of partially deregulating the long distance and

the customer provided equipment segments of the industry, which culminated with the

passing of the 1996 Telecommunications Act. This process was partially triggered by

various interest group actions, which included introduction of multiple pieces of

legislation, continuous lobbying of congress and the agency, and, naturally, suing for

policy changes in courts.4




groups, led to a large literature on the formation and organization of interest groups. See, for example,
Moe (1980) and references therein.

  47 U.S.C. 151 (1934).

telecommunications market in the US, see Spiller (1996b).

                  Buy, Lobby, or Sue: Interest Group Participation in Policy Making – A Survey



         Indeed, the potentially large distributional effects of legislation provide the

affected groups strong incentives to attempt to control what policies are made and how

they are enforced. Thus, much of interest group action in the modern administrative state

is geared toward influencing the implementation of, often vague, policies.

      In this paper we first discuss the role of interest groups in the policy making process,

and then explore how it is affected by the nature of the institutional environments in

which interest groups operate.


II.      Buy, Lobby or Sue

The literature normally relates to the activities of interest groups generically as

“lobbying,” where by this it refers to actions such as transferring resources to policy

makers (whether in the form of a campaign contribution, or bribes) or transferring

information. These two, however, are drastically different actions, and in this survey we

will not follow the usual definition of lobbying as the quintessential interest group

activity. Instead we look at three main ways by which interest groups may sway policy

outcomes their preferred way: buying influence, lobbying for influence, and suing.

Buying influence reflects the actions, often legal and sometimes illegal, by which interest

groups may attempt to get decision makers (whether politicians or bureaucrats) to listen

to their needs, and, hopefully, act accordingly. Lobbying for influence consists of the

various actions, also often legal, and sometimes illegal, by which interest groups attempt

to transfer information to politicians and bureaucrats about issues (such as voters’

preferences, impact of particular agency or legislative proposals, etc) that may affect

decision makers’ political and bureaucratic calculus. Suing is the art of using the judicial

process to change the arena where the game is played, away from the legislative and

administrative process, towards the court. Judicial action may be pursued against a

particular policy or its implementation, depending, naturally, of the nature of the case, but

also of the more general environment in which the interest group operates.5


II.1 Direct and Indirect Influence

Buying, lobbying and suing can also be direct or indirect. Interest groups pursue a direct

action (say lobbying) when the target is intended to act directly on the matter. For

example, an interest group may lobby a legislator with the specific intent of changing her

vote on a particular bill; or may lobby the legislator with the intent that the legislator use

the information to exert their authority to influence the way a particular agency

implements a statute. The same direct/indirect dichotomy applies to the other two

strategic choices.6


II.2 Buying

Legislator-buying is the most publicized form of interest group influence, and the one

that has attracted the most attention by scholars and pundits alike. 7




5
  Some countries do not provide for a blanket declaration of lack of constitutionality of a statute, requiring
instead its prior application (i.e., an agency decision) to a particular case.
6
  The analogy to “buying” is straightforward. The analogy to suing requires a bit more explanation. The
purpose of suing is to shift the arena of the game away from the legislative/bureaucratic arena, towards the
judicial arena, where the interest group expects to get via litigation what it was unable to obtain via the
other strategies. The purpose of litigation, at the same time, may be direct – such as reversing an adverse
bureaucratic outcome, or indirect, such as putting the regulatory agency on notice that pursuing this
particular policy line would be extremely expensive. One can understand in this way the strategy of those
entrants, such as MCI and others, who fought the FCC to open the telecommunications market. Indeed,
Temin (1987) points to MCI’s multiple law suits against the FCC as the triggering factor that increased the
hostility of the Justice Department against AT&T, and helped motivate it to pursue AT&T’s eventual
break-up.
7
  Even US President Theodore Roosevelt saw the need in 1906 to coin the term “muckrakers” to refer to
those journalists who questioned the influence of business in policy making. See The Columbia
Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition, 2001-05, available at http://www.bartleby.com/65/mu/muckrake.html.

II.2.1 Buying Direct Influence

The classical interest group literature focuses on direct vote buying. Scholars model this

interaction as a game where interest groups compete with each other to capture legislators

by making contributions (to campaigns, or illegally, for profit) in return for politicians’

votes.8 Empirical evidence on the pay-for-vote interaction between interest groups and

legislators is at best inconclusive. Stramann (1998) studies time pattern in PAC

contributions and finds that changes in PAC contributions are correlated with the voting

schedule on relevant policies, independent of the electoral cycle. The extent to which

direct vote buying by interest groups actually takes place, however, is unclear. Indeed,

more than thirty years ago, Gordon Tullock asked the fundamental question of why there

is so little money going to US policy makers (1972). Ansolabehere, DeFigueiredo and

Snyder (2003), investigating the size and makeup of political contributions, and their

effect on politicians’ behavior, find that, conditioned on the effect of policies on interest

groups’ welfare, these groups give far less than they should, and furthermore, that

contributions have little effect on politicians’ behavior.9 Alternatively, contributions

could be made as a source of ideological consumption,10 or simply tickets to obtain

access. Indeed, Ansolabehere, Snyder and Tripathi (1995) find a strong connection

between buying (campaign contributions) and lobbying, suggesting that campaign

contributions may indeed be used to gain and maintain access. Bronas and Lott, Jr.




8
  Among the classical buying legislators’ papers, see Denzau and Munger (1986); Snyder (1990), (1991);
Baron (1994).
9
  One could argue that legislators (and the president) buy each others’ votes via pork-barrel legislation.
Although the practice is well studied (for a recent application to Brazil, see Alston and Mueller 2006), I
will not deal with this issue here.
10
   Since the probability that a small contribution will impact on the probability of the legislator’s reelection
is small, the net gains from the contribution could well be negative.

April 18, 2006                                                                                                 7
                  Buy, Lobby, or Sue: Interest Group Participation in Policy Making – A Survey



(1997) reach a similar conclusion. They find that politicians in their last term do not alter

their voting behavior significantly compared to their preceding term, indicating that

interest groups contribute to politicians who are more aligned with their political views,

rather than buying votes, a view consistent with campaign contributions being more a

consumption than an investment activity.11


II.2.2 Buying Indirect Influence

Following the direct implications of the Congressional Dominance Hypothesis,12 or of the

Separation of Powers Hypothesis on judicial decision-making,13 interest groups can also

attempt to control policy outcomes through buying legislators’ influence on bureaucrats

or courts. The Congressional Dominance Hypothesis, which presents in a different form

the “fire alarm” framework of McCubbins and Schwartz (1984), suggests that

independent agencies are not truly independent, as they are subject to continual -

although not necessarily active - congressional oversight. Active congressional reversal,

though, is not necessary, all that is needed is the credible threat of legislative action.

Spiller (1992) shows that the discretion of independent administrative agencies in a

system of division of powers depends, among other things, on the composition of the

legislature and the executive (determining the threat of congressional reversal).14 In a

system of division of powers, however, full Congressional Dominance is a corner


11
   One could always spin a reciprocity theory whereby interest groups may compensate legislators with post
legislative employment, increasing thus the potential for interest alignment even on legislators’ last terms.
For a recent survey of theories of capture by interest groups, see Dal Bó (2006).
12
   See, for example, Weingast and Moran (1983), McCubbins and Schwartz (1984), and references therein.
The evidence on legislators’ influence on agency actions is large. I focus here on the incentives for buying
legislators so as to achieve such influence.
13
   See, for example, Gely and Spiller (1990), Spiller and Gely (1992), Ferejohn and Shipan (1990). For a
critique and response see Segal (1998) and Bergara, Richman and Spiller (2003).
14
   The organization and budget of the judiciary (determining the threat of judicial reversal) is also of
relevance (Spiller 1992).

April 18, 2006                                                                                             8
                  Buy, Lobby, or Sue: Interest Group Participation in Policy Making – A Survey



solution and requires a particular type of political composition between the legislature

and the executive.15 Thus, in political environments with divided governments, agencies

do not always, nor fully, respond to Congressional desires. As a result, buying indirect

influence is not always an efficient or effective strategy for interest groups.

       There is some recent evidence of buying indirect influence. De Figueiredo and

Edwards (2004) find that state regulatory commissions’ decisions on telecommunications

policy (in particular, interconnection charges) are closely aligned with campaign

contributions to key legislators by both incumbents and new entrants. Indirect buying

provides then, a third explanation to the scant evidence concerning the link between

campaign contributions and observable policy outcomes.


II.3 Lobbying

An alternative way for interest groups to exert influence is to provide legislators with

valuable information. The purpose of this information is to potentially alter legislators’

support for a particular policy.16 We call the transfer of information lobbying.17 Interest

groups may transfer information to legislators and other decision makers in various ways.

Interest groups may, for example, participate in hearings, may directly provide

background documentation, or organize protests. To be of value, these costly actions

must transfer relevant information to decision makers, whether legislators, bureaucrats or

judges. The information may concern the value, cost and distributional implication of a


15
   Spiller (1990) shows that Congressional budgetary decisions for agencies reflect an internal rather than a
corner solution.
16
   Support may depend on the legislator’s perception of his/her constituency’s preferences over the policy,
or of his/her own believes about the public good.
17
   In principle, conditional campaign or in general monetary contributions may also change legislators’
perspectives about particular policies. I focus here, though, on information concerning states of the world,
rather than on interest group actions.

April 18, 2006                                                                                              9
                  Buy, Lobby, or Sue: Interest Group Participation in Policy Making – A Survey



particular policy to the legislators’ constituents, the saliency of the issue to the interest

group’s constituency, or the implication of alternative technologies or policy

implementation. 18 The information transfer can be done following formal (and legal)

procedures,19 or via informal (and often illegal) ways.20 All these transfer information to

the relevant actor. As influence buying, lobbying for influence may be direct or indirect.


II.3.1 Lobbying for Direct Influence

An interest group providing information about the consequences of a particular bill is

attempting to get legislators to take that information into account when voting for a

particular bill. Scholars in recent years have given much attention to the informal and

formal rules by which interest groups engage in information lobbying. The formal

literature in general does not discriminate between direct and indirect lobbying. A key

issue in lobbying, though, is the inherent bias in the information transmission process.

Interest groups will only provide information when it is in their advantage to do so.

Calvert (1985) shows,21 however, that even biased information may be preferred to no

information. Furthermore, because politicians cannot eliminate informational bias if

information arises from a single interested group,22 legislators will benefit from

facilitating access to multiple interests, even from those whose desired policy outcomes

are not aligned with their own (Austen Smith and Wright 1992, Epstein and O’Halloran

1995, DeFigueiredo, Spiller and Urbiztondo 1999).                            DeFigueiredo, Spiller and




18
   The March 2006 students’ demonstrations in France represent one excellent example of transferring
information to politicians about voters’ preferences concerning flexible labor policies.
19
   Such as participating in congressional hearings, directly lobbying agency staff, etc.
20
   Violent demonstrations is one example of informal illegal lobbying.

                   Buy, Lobby, or Sue: Interest Group Participation in Policy Making – A Survey



Urbiztondo (1999), for example, show that under some conditions, open participation by

multiple interest groups cancels out whatever information advantage each interest group

may have vis-à-vis the politicians.


II.3.2 Lobbying for Indirect Influence

As it concerns lobbying for indirect influence, the information to be transmitted may be

about constituents’ interests or about agencies or courts’ potential decisions. The interest

group transmits the information with the expectation that the agency or court, knowing

that such lobbying is taking place, and that it will affect legislators’ reaction to the

proposed decision, will adjust the proposed decision accordingly.

         Indeed, apart from the direct monetary advantages that legislators may obtain

from interest groups participation,23 legislators may value interest groups participation in

the administrative process because of their informational advantage.                              Since policy

outcomes can also affect re-election probabilities, or more generally, a politician’s career

advancement, legislators have incentives to provide interest groups with access both to

the regulatory process, and to themselves. This is the essence of the “fire alarm” theory

of congressional oversight (McCubbins and Schwartz 1984), whereby congressional

supervision is triggered by interest groups detection of bureaucratic “misbehavior.”24

Indeed, given that agency delegation is the natural consequence of increased policy

complexity, legislators’ need to supervise the bureaucracy may be undertaken by



23
   It can be argued that by allowing interest group participation in the administrative process, legislators
may have increased their usefulness to interest groups, thus, increasing the amount interest groups will pay
for access. See also Spiller (1990) for a revolving door theory of interest group influence where politicians
benefit from interest group influence on bureaucratic decision making.
24
   McCubbins, Noll and Weingast (1987) view administrative procedures in that fashion. In their view,
administrative procedures guide bureaucracies to make decisions consistent with the preferences of the
enacting coalition.

April 18, 2006                                                                                              11
                  Buy, Lobby, or Sue: Interest Group Participation in Policy Making – A Survey



increasing the bureaucratic hierarchy.25              Interest groups, though, have an important

advantage over bureaucracies in gathering information (DeFigueiredo, Spiller and

Urbiztondo, 1999). Since interest groups’ constituents are directly impacted by policies,

they are highly motivated to garner policy relevant information. While supervising

bureaucracies require budgets and have to be motivated to undertake the extra effort,

interest groups’ research and monitoring activity is done for their own purpose, and does

not require congressional funding, releasing congressional budgets for other purposes.

This is the essence of the “fire alarm” strategy. On the other hand, as mentioned above,

interest groups are biased, while supervising bureaucracies may be less so. As with direct

lobbying, promoting multiple interest groups participation, including those in opposition

to the politician, makes politicians strictly better off, as competing interest groups provide

the greatest amount of information at the lowest cost to the elected official.

DeFigueiredo, Spiller and Urbiztondo (1999) use this insight to explain the enactment of

the Administrative Procedure Act by the US Congress in 1946.26

         The Administrative Procedure Act, 27 as well as most of the enabling legislation of

regulatory agencies, set procedural requirements that provide for ample participation of

interest groups in the regulatory process. These procedural requirements stipulate that

regulatory agencies must provide notice, must inform the public about proposed rule

makings, must make their decisions taking into account the submissions of interested


25
   The creation of a specific organ of the legislature whose purpose is to supervise the actions of the
bureaucracy (such as the US General Accounting Office) is one such strategy. The problem remains,
though, of who monitors the monitor. For a discussion of hierarchy as an organizational response to
information problems, see Garicano (2000).
26
   McCubbins, Noll and Weingast (1987) present a slightly different view. They see the organization of
administrative procedures, in general and as applied to particular agencies, as ways to hard-wire and protect
the interests of the enacting coalitions, while DeFigueiredo, Spiller and Urbiztondo (1999) focus more on
the generic informational benefit to incumbent legislators.

provide two important roles: first, they provide information to the regulatory agency

about the state of the world, and second, they provide information to legislators’ about

their constituents’ preferences.           Both are important for the agency and its political

masters. On the one hand, agencies are resource constrained and hence information about

the state of the world is always beneficial. On the other hand, information about interest

groups' preferences is important as it allows the agency to forecast potential political

problems they may encounter at the legislature. The procedural restrictions on decision

making also provide the opportunity for interest groups to attempt to block agency

decision making through lobbying their politicians - McCubbins and Schwartz’ (1984)

“fire alarm” insight.        Interest group participation allows legislators to supervise the

agency without having to be actively involved in the regulatory process, and hence limits

the time that legislators have to expend in regulating regulators.28                              However, the

information revealed through individual interest group’s lobbying activities, even if

truthful, is naturally biased. Interest groups will not reveal information that will bring

about a regulatory outcome that makes them worse off. Thus, the APA’s widespread

facilitation of interest group participation ameliorates the bias in information provided by

each interest group.

         Transferring information about constituents’ interests also provides an indirect

link between lobbying and policy decisions, whether by agencies or courts. Under the

Separation of Powers Hypothesis to judicial decision making, courts, understanding the


28
  McCubbins, Noll and Weingast (1989) describe agency operations as an “autopilot” process. By
including interest group participation in agencies’ procedure and structure, agencies will change
automatically in response to changes in the enfranchised interest groups’ preferences, freeing the legislators
from the need to intervene.

April 18, 2006                                                                                              13

play of the game following a judicial decision that can be overruled by legislative

action,29 would select policies only among those that are immune to legislative reversal.

By changing legislators’ perceptions of their constituencies’ preferences, lobbying may

change the set of judicial policies that are immune to legislative override. Indeed,

Iaryczower, Spiller and Tommasi (2006) find that interest groups lobby more when the

courts are more constrained by the legislature.

         In sum, the reason why the literature looking for a connection between lobbying or

campaign contributions and policy outcomes have failed to provide a direct connection

between lobbying and campaign contributions and policy outcomes is that they may have

essentially been looking at the wrong place. As Iaryczower, Spiller and Tommasi (2006)

emphasize, “the empirical work on the impact of lobbying has been looking at the wrong

policy dimension.” Rather than considering the impact on the nature of legislation,

empirical research should focus on the way the administered state operates, that is, via

bureaucracies and the courts. In this sense, buying or lobbying for indirect influence

ought to imply a stronger correlation between campaign contributions and lobbying to

legislators and bureaucratic or judicial outcomes.


II.4 Suing

When buying and lobbying fail, the judicial process may still provide satisfaction.

Litigation, however, can be used as a complement to buying and lobbying. Indeed,

because litigation is expensive, complex and time consuming, interest groups may use

litigation as a threat to obtain policies advocated through their lobbying process. The



29
     For evidence on congressional override, see Eskridge (1991).

April 18, 2006                                                                                      14
                  Buy, Lobby, or Sue: Interest Group Participation in Policy Making – A Survey



extent to which litigation threats can alter bureaucratic behavior, though, depends on the

probability that the interest group is likely to win.                    Thus, the composition of the

legislature and that of the courts, impacts the credibility of litigation threats.                De

Figueiredo (2005) finds, for example, that interest groups are most likely to challenge a

Federal Communications Commission when the courts are more likely to rule against the

administration.


III.     Strategic Choice of Instruments

Given the multiplicity of instruments of influence available to interest groups, we now

analyze how interest groups may strategically select their choice. Before a policy is

implemented, interest groups face the choice of buying and/or lobbying. Buying and

lobbying are not equally efficient and effective for all groups. Indeed, Hillman and Hitt

(1999) propose that the current stage of an issue’s life cycle, the firm’s monetary and

informational resources, and the corporate environment that the firm operates in

determines the firm’s political strategies.               For example, Ansolabehere, Snyder and

Tripathi (2002) find that unions and single-issue groups, whose objectives are more clear

and partisan than other interest groups, tend to contribute rather than lobby.                   Such

patterns are consistent with theories of strategic interest group behavior.                      More

specifically, groups with large memberships can gain attention by their sheer number, and

hence do not need to spend large amount of money buying legislators; groups with

extreme ideological preferences may not reflect a large spectrum of legislative

constituencies’ preferences, and may be better off engaging in direct or indirect buying

(Ansolabehere, Snyder, and Tripathi 2002).



April 18, 2006                                                                                     15
                  Buy, Lobby, or Sue: Interest Group Participation in Policy Making – A Survey



         Once a policy has been implemented, litigation may be the only strategy left to

the losing interest group.30 The optimality of litigation will depend on the relative

ideological position of courts, policymakers and the interest group. Indeed, DeFigueiredo

and DeFigueiredo (2002) show that lobbying falls with the probability that the court will

reverse the agency. De Figueiredo (2002) also finds that interest groups take the FCC

more to courts when courts are ideologically far from the administration.

                                                                31
III.1 A Model and Empirical Implications

         To highlight the strategic use of instruments, we develop here a simple model of

separation of powers based on the model of indirect lobbying of Iaryczower, Spiller and

Tommasi (2006).32 There are two individual players, the court and the interest group,33

and a legislature populated by a continuum of legislators with total size one. The policy

space is X = [0,1], and given ideal policy zi, player i has preferences over policies x∈X

represented by a utility function ui ( x, zi ) = − 1 ( x − zi )2 . Without loss of generality, we
                                                         2

assume that the interest group’s ideal policy is at the right extreme of the policy space,

zu= 1, and refer to policy x’ as being pro-interest group with respect to x’’ whenever x’ >

x’’.




30
   Interest groups may intensify their lobby and buying activities with the purpose of reversing the policy
by direct legislative override. For this strategy to be “optimal”, though, the policy implementation must
have reflected the erroneous strategic choice by the interest group.
31
   Much of this section is taken liberally from Iaryczower, Spiller and Tommasi (2006).
32
   DeFigueiredo and DeFigueiredo (2002) develop a similar vote buying rather than indirect lobbying
model. However, in their model there is no uncertainty, a fundamental issue to trigger informative
lobbying.
33
   This model can also be applied to a game between the administration and the legislature. Throughout
this section, the word “court” can be replaced by the word “agency” to generate a model of indirect
lobbying of the bureaucracy.

April 18, 2006                                                                                                16
                 Buy, Lobby, or Sue: Interest Group Participation in Policy Making – A Survey



         Legislators and the court differ in their responsiveness to voters. In particular, we

assume that the court is completely unresponsive to the position of voters in the policy

space, and denote its preferred policy by zc∈ X. We assume, though, that legislators are

at least partially responsive to voters’ stance on the issue. Assuming for simplicity that

the distribution of voters in the policy space can be characterized by a single parameter θ

∈ X, we let the ideal policy of legislator j be given by zLj(θ;βj)≡βj+θ, where for all j, βj

>0 and βj < 1. The degree of conflict in the legislature is captured by the distribution of

points βj among its members, which we describe by the cumulative distribution G(.); i.e.,

for any point β, G(β) denotes the proportion of legislators for which βj ≤β.

         Given the extent of interest group activity, policy outcomes result from the

interaction of the court and the legislature. While the precise form of this interaction

depends on specific institutional details, in most polities the elective body can ultimately

impose its will under some sufficiently demanding procedure. We represent this idea by

assuming that the court chooses a ruling xc∈X, which the legislature can reverse with the

votes of a majority m ∈ [1/2,1] of legislators. We say that a court’s ruling is “stable” in

the legislature – and therefore final – if there exists no alternative policy that a majority m

of legislators would prefer to it in a binary choice, and denote the set of stable rulings

given the majority rule m by Sm.

         Legislators and the court are uninformed about the realization of θ, and have

common prior beliefs represented by the cumulative distribution function F(⋅) with

density f(⋅). In contrast, the interest group is perfectly informed about the realization of θ,

and can potentially credibly transmit this information through costly actions - lobbying

(participating in legislative or regulatory hearings, writing white papers, and even

April 18, 2006                                                                                  17
                   Buy, Lobby, or Sue: Interest Group Participation in Policy Making – A Survey



organizing strikes and public demonstrations). In particular, given a realization θ’, the

interest group can organize an observable level a of actions bearing a cost C(a,θ’). For

simplicity we assume that C(a,θ)=a(k -θ), k>1, that is, the marginal cost of lobbying is

decreasing in the pro-interest group stance of the population.

         The timing of the game can thus be described as follows: (i) θ is realized and

privately observed by the interest group; (ii) the interest group decides a publicly

observable level of lobbying intensity a; and (iii) the court chooses a ruling xc in the set

of stable policies in the legislature Sm.34

         An equilibrium is a triplet Γ={γ(⋅),xc(⋅),F(⋅|a)} consisting of (i) a strategy for the

interest group, γ : X→R+, mapping “types” θ to levels a of lobbying intensity a, (ii) a

strategy for the court, xc : R+→ Sm, mapping observations of lobbying levels a to stable

rulings xc∈Sm, and (iii) beliefs F( |a) by the court and the legislators such that:

         (a) γ (θ ) ∈ arg max u u ( x c (a )) − C (a, θ ) ∀θ∈X;
                       a∈R+



         (b) xc (a ) ∈ arg max{uc ( x) : x ∈ S (m | a )} ∀a∈R+, and
                         x∈ X



         (c) whenever a∈ γ(X), F(⋅|a) is determined from F(⋅) and γ(⋅) using Bayes’ rule.


III.1.1 The Symmetric Information Benchmark

We first characterize, as a benchmark, the symmetric information equilibrium. Note that

in this case legislators are perfectly informed about the value of θ, and the interest group

derives no benefit from lobbying, irrespective of the preferences of the electorate. Hence,



34
  For completeness, there is a fourth stage in which the legislature reviews the court’s decision,
but given that courts would only make policy choices that are stable, we can without any loss,
discard this last stage.

April 18, 2006                                                                                       18
                 Buy, Lobby, or Sue: Interest Group Participation in Policy Making – A Survey



there will be no lobbying in equilibrium. The relationship between preferences of the

electorate and policy outcomes in the symmetric information environment, however, is

the key element determining the amount and effectiveness of lobbying in the incomplete

information environment.

         We start by characterizing the set of stable policies in the legislature given

majority rule m. Letting β Lm ≡ G-1(1-m) and β Hm ≡ G-1(m), it is easy to see that

Sm(θ)=[zL(θ; β Lm ), zL(θ; β Hm )]. That is, β Lm is the critical legislator for a pro-interest group

coalition, in the sense that any policy x to the left of her preferred policy would be

replaced by a more pro-interest group policy. Similarly, β Hm is the critical legislator for

an anti-interest group coalition, in that any policy to the right of her preferred policy will

be replaced by a more anti-interest group policy. Note that βL(m) ≤ βH(m), and βL(m) =

βH(m) only with simple majority rule (m=1/2), in which case Sm(θ) collapses to the

preferred policy of the median voter in the legislature, and the court has no policy making

power. It follows that for m > 1/2, the set of possible court’s ideal policies that would be

stable given θ has positive measure.

         The court will then select its ideal policy unless it is constrained either for being

“extremely” pro-interest group or anti-interest group in relation to the relevant players in

the legislature. In particular, since the preferred policy of every legislator is strictly

increasing in θ, a higher value of θ results in a pro-interest group shift of the entire set of

stable policies. A court with a fixed policy preference zc may then become a “pro-interest

group” court for a legislature observing a low realization θ’ (zc > zL(θ’;βH ) ), or an ”anti-

interest group” court for a legislature observing a high realization θ’’(zc < zL(θ’’;βL )).



April 18, 2006                                                                                    19

Figure 1 depicts in bold the resulting court’s equilibrium rulings as a function of the state

of nature, θ.


                  Figure I           Court’s Best Response to Information




The two parallel lines in the figure represent the preferences of the critical legislators as a

function of the state of nature, zL(θ ; βL )=βL+θ and zL(θ ; βH )= βH+θ . For each θ, the

set of stable policies S(θ) is the segment between these lines, the interval [βL+θ, βH+θ] in

the vertical axis. If, for some θ , the court’s ideal point zc is in S(θ), the court will be able

to rule according to its preferred policy, facing no effective legislative constraints. In the

example depicted in the figure, this occurs for all states between the (interior) points θ0

and θ1. In this region, then, the flat portion of the bold line represents the court’s



April 18, 2006                                                                                  20
                    Buy, Lobby, or Sue: Interest Group Participation in Policy Making – A Survey



equilibrium ruling. For θ < θ0, however, S(θ) is entirely below zc. Thus, if it were

common knowledge among legislators that public sentiment is strongly anti-interest

group, the ideal point of the court would not survive the challenge of a more anti-interest

group legislation. The best choice for the court in such states is, therefore, to enact the

most pro-interest group stable ruling; i.e., βH+θ.                       For θ<θ0, then, the bold line

representing the court’s equilibrium rulings coincides with βH+θ. Similarly, for θ>θ1,

S(θ) is entirely above zc. In this subset of states the legislature is too pro-interest group

compared to the court, and thus the best choice for the court in such states is to enact the

most “anti-interest group” stable ruling; i.e., βL+θ. Proposition 1 below summarizes the

preceding discussion.

           The legislature thus effectively constrains the court for some realizations of public

opinion when the set K = {θ : θ ≤ θ 0 ∨ θ ≥ θ1} is non-empty. In other words, the court will

be able to rule its preferred policy independently of public opinion only if this policy is

both (i) pro-interest group relative to the preferences of the critical legislator for a pro-

interest group coalition before a pro-interest group electorate (zc > zL(1;βL )= βL+1) and

(ii) anti-interest group relative to the preferences of the critical legislator for an anti-

interest group coalition before an anti-interest group electorate (zc < zL(0 ;βH )= βH ).

Note that, as in Gely and Spiller (1990), this condition is more likely to be satisfied when

there is significant dissent in the legislature (the critical legislators for a pro and anti-

interest group coalitions are far apart, βL<<βH).35




35
     See Proposition 1 in Iaryczower, Spiller and Tommasi (2006).

April 18, 2006                                                                                      21
                    Buy, Lobby, or Sue: Interest Group Participation in Policy Making – A Survey



           Moreover, in general, the size of K increases with βL and decreases with βH. Thus,

the set of realizations of public opinion for which the court is effectively constrained is

always smaller the higher dissent in the legislature is. Hence, the overall effect of

legislators’ responsiveness to public opinion on judicial independence depends on the

relative position of the court in the policy space.


III.1.2 Informative Indirect Lobbying

The previous analysis showed that when the court is constrained for some (publicly

known) preferences of the electorate, an increase in θ induces a more pro-interest group

ruling, and thus, a more pro-interest group policy outcome in equilibrium. Iaryczower,

Spiller and Tommasi (2006) show that when policy-makers are uncertain about the

realization of θ, lobbying by the interest group restores the complete information

mapping between the preferences of the electorate and policy outcomes. In particular,

they show that equilibrium lobbying increases with the realization of θ when, given θ, the

court is constrained by the legislature (i.e., θ∈K), and does not change when the court is

unconstrained (θ∈ [θ0,θ1]).36

           That is, in equilibrium the level of lobbying will reflect the preferences of the

electorate up to the extent that this information can influence a binding constraint for the

court (and thus policy outcomes). In other words, lobbying is effectively fully

informative. As long as (informed) policy is responsive to the electorate’s preferences,

interest group types facing different pro-interest group dispositions of the electorate will




36
     See Proposition 2 and Lemma 1 in Iaryczower, Spiller and Tommasi (2006).

April 18, 2006                                                                                     22
                 Buy, Lobby, or Sue: Interest Group Participation in Policy Making – A Survey



always choose different levels of lobbying, allowing the reproduction of the complete

information link between policies and the preferences of the electorate.

         This does not imply, however, that the equilibrium will necessarily involve

transmission of information. In fact, lobbying will be completely unresponsive to the

preferences of the electorate if (and only if) the court is unconstrained for every possible

realization of θ. Conversely, there will be a complete separating equilibrium if (and only

if) the court is constrained for every realization of public preferences. That is, only if the

court’s ideal policy is “extremely anti-interest group” (i.e., zc < βL), or “extremely pro-

interest group” (i.e., zc > βH+1), interest groups will choose different lobbying level for

different observed values of θ. This result allows us to develop the response of the

expected level of lobbying and pro-interest group rulings to changes in the composition

of the legislature. Note that for our purposes changes in the composition of the legislature

are relevant only to the extent that they affect the boundaries of the stable set of policies

in the legislature, zL(θ;βL )=βL+θ            and zL(θ;βH)=βH+θ.             Moreover, recall from the

analysis of the symmetric information benchmark that the set of realizations of public

opinion for which the court is effectively constrained decreases with the degree of dissent

in the legislature. That is, in general, the size of K increases with βL and decreases with

βH.

         Since the level of interest group lobbying is decreasing in the size of the

constrained court ruling space, it is straightforward to see that a pro-interest group shift in

the preferred policy of the critical legislator for a pro-interest group coalition βL (anti-

interest group coalition, βH) increases the expected pro-interest group tendency of the




April 18, 2006                                                                                      23
                  Buy, Lobby, or Sue: Interest Group Participation in Policy Making – A Survey



court’ rulings level Eθ [xc], and increases (reduces) the expected level of lobbying, Eθ

[γ].37

         This result has direct implications to the response of equilibrium outcomes to

changes in court’s preferences. First, the expected level of pro-interest group rulings will

increase following a pro-interest group change in the court’s preferences unless the court

is constrained for every realization of θ both preceding and following this change. The

change in the expected level of lobbying is, however, ambiguous.38 Similarly, we know

from the analysis of the symmetric information benchmark that the effect of legislators’

responsiveness to public opinion on judicial decisions depends on the relative position of

the court in the policy space. This implies that the relation between lobbying and the

responsiveness of legislators to public opinion will also necessarily depend on the relative

position of the court in the policy space.


III.1.3 Empirical Implications

         This model has direct and empirically refutable implications for understanding

interest groups’ lobbying strategies, as well as implications concerning the relation

between policy outcomes and interest group activity. First, policy outcomes in the form

of judicial decisions become more “pro-interest group” the higher the level of the interest

group’s political activity. In other words, in this model, lobbying influences policies

indirectly, via judicial adaptation. Second, the expected level of lobbying decreases the

more effective the separation of powers between the court and the legislature is (i.e., the



37
  See Proposition 3 in Iaryczower, Spiller and Tommasi (2006).
38
   This should come as no surprise, however, since for this purpose, increasing xc with βL and βH given is
qualitatively similar as simultaneously reducing both βL and βH taking xc as given, and from the prior
discussion we know that βL and βH have opposite effects on the expected level of lobbying.

April 18, 2006                                                                                               24
                   Buy, Lobby, or Sue: Interest Group Participation in Policy Making – A Survey



more divided the legislature is on the relevant issues). Specifically, the level of lobbying

is decreasing in the magnitude of the set of stable policies in the legislature.39

         This model also has strategic lobbying implications . Consider Figure 1. In the

figure, for a given set of preferences zc, βH, βL, we can partition the set of realizations of

the state of the world, θ, in three areas. In regimes S1 and S3 (where the court is

constrained either by a pro-interest group or anti-interest group legislature), informative

lobbying takes place, while it does not in S2. Regimes S1 and S3, however, differ in the

individuals over which lobbying effort is being exercised. While in S1,40 the interest

group lobbies a friendly legislator (i.e., that legislator with a higher pro-interest group

tendency), in S2, the interest group is trying to mollify the preferences of the relatively

anti interest group legislator. In other words, lobbying becomes counter-active. In

relatively bad states of the world, lobbying is focused on friendly legislators, while in

relatively good states of the world, lobbying is focused on unfriendly ones.

         Finally, although in regime S2 lobbying becomes ineffective, suing is effective as

legislators cannot agree in moving the administration policy in any direction. Thus, we

should observe litigation the more divided the legislature is on the interest group’s issue,

and the stronger the division of powers in the polity, a result consistent with

DeFigueiredo (2000) study of telecommunications litigation.




39
   This model also has standard separation of powers empirical implications. As in most separation of
powers models, the equilibrium level of “pro-interest group” judicial decisions depends on the political
composition of the legislature. In equilibrium, a more “pro-interest group” legislature will trigger more
“pro-interest group” decisions provided that the court is effectively constrained by the legislature.
40
   Recall S1 reflects cases when the state of the world is relatively anti interest group, as θ is relatively low,
given the preferences of the polity.

IV.      Interest Group Participation in Party Centered

     Systems41

The framework presented in the previous sections was based on an institutional

environment resembling the separation of powers of the United States. In the United

States, members of the US Congress exhibit remarkable longevity; they also tend to

specialize in committees and to play an active role in policymaking42 and in overseeing

the public bureaucracy.43 Outside of the United States, though, legislatures most often do

not resemble the US Congress in terms of many or all of these above-mentioned features.

This is particularly the case in the party-centered systems (Shugart and Haggard 2001)

that dominate the world’s democracies,44 yet are also the least studied.45                         The US

Congress is thus a rare outlier in the population of national legislatures.                            As a

consequence, theoretical models of interest group participation in the US, while very

helpful in generating general theory, are also limited due to their status as case studies of

an atypical case. In this section we focus our analysis of interest group participation in

party-centered systems that exist in a large majority of the world’s parliamentary and

presidential democracies.46 Legislatures, and policy making in general, in these countries

differ considerably from the US counterparts. In party centered systems, legislators may

not stay for long in the legislature. As a consequence, they may have little incentives to

invest in specialized legislative skills, or to control the bureaucracy. Similarly, in party-

centered systems, the focus of policy making tends to be away from the legislature – with

the cabinet (as in the case of unified governments) or the government party taking a more

fundamental policy making role. In these instances, interest group participation in policy

making drastically changes its nature. We explore these issues here.

         In the previous sections we discussed how legislators benefited from interest

group participation, and thus, how legislators have the incentive to mold the institutional

framework in which they participate so as to extract as much information from it as

possible. We explore this incentive in alternative institutional environments here.

         The key question for comparative work is whether the assumptions that drive the

US case are appropriate in understanding how electoral rules shape legislative incentives

elsewhere. In principle, non-US politicians are as strategic in their actions as their US

counterparts. However, the political institutions that shape legislators’ incentives do vary

across countries; career structure, electoral laws, and party rules can be very different.

The question narrows, then, to the incentives these politicians face in different contexts.47

         For example, if party nomination is inconsequential for electoral success, as is the

case for incumbents in the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies (Ames 2001), party

renomination will play no substantial role in shaping legislators’ behavior. Thus, the US-




adapting their political strategies to the emergence of powerful cross-national regulatory agencies, see Coen
(1998).

   For a study of the impact of a country’s institutional features on legislators’ behavior, see Crisp et. al.
(2004).

April 18, 2006                                                                                             27
                  Buy, Lobby, or Sue: Interest Group Participation in Policy Making – A Survey



centered analytical framework may suffice.48 In contrast, there are situations, as in

closed-list PR systems, where nomination at the top of a major party list can virtually

guarantee electoral success. In this latter case, legislators’ behavior will be constrained

by the renomination rules but essentially unconstrained by the electoral process (Strøm

1997).

         In federal countries with a closed-list PR electoral system, the process by which

the provincial (district) party lists are formed largely affects which candidates run on

each party list, what order they occupy, and, consequently, their chances of winning a

seat in Congress. Hence, depending on the role that electoral rules give local party

leaders in the creation of the district-party list, local party leaders may or not be key in

the determination of legislators’ futures.

         In many countries, where local and national party bosses dominate the

construction of the local party list, legislators’ ability to independently pursue a

legislative career is substantially curtailed. Indeed, from legislators’ perspectives, in

order to pursue their desired career paths, they must maintain a good relationship with

their local party bosses, not a good rapport with their constituencies.                          In some

circumstances, such a good rapport may hinder their political progression. Party bosses

have a complex political objective. They want to maximize the performance of their

party in their province and or nation, but at the same time want to safeguard their position

within the provincial or national party structure. The threat of challenge by popular

legislators provides local and national party bosses with a strong incentive to reduce the

national and provincial visibility of their underlings by rotating them among the various

jobs the party can offer.49 Voters in these PR-based systems, tend to vote for the party

list, not for the individuals on the list.

           Within this institutional context, legislators have little incentive to work hard to

improve their visibility in the eyes of the voters, and no incentive to develop legislative

policy expertise. A legislator may be marginally aided in his/her career progression by

obtaining public visibility. However, policy expertise is unrelated to visibility, nor is it

relevant for the candidate nomination and general election process. The institutional

barriers to reelection, therefore, generate widespread “shirking,” providing sub-optimal

levels of effort both from an “informational” (Krehbiel 1991) and “institutional” (Fearon

1999; Ferejohn 1999) perspective.

           Electoral incentives not only impact a legislature’s organization (Weingast and

Marshall 1988), but also the design of bureaucratic decision making processes (Bambaci,

Spiller and Tommasi 2002). In party centered systems where electoral incentives are

centralized around parties, information will follow the same extent of centralization.

Baron (2000), for example, shows how interest group participation is less transparent –

but not less active- in Japan than in the United States. Although there are fewer access

points, interest groups are able to provide information (lobby) in a systematic, albeit

informal and centralized fashion. In party centered systems, administrative procedures as

the US APA have little purpose.                    There is no need to inform legislators of the

bureaucracy actions. On the one hand, legislators in party-centered systems are not that

interested in pursuing bureaucratic supervision. On the other hand, in party centered

systems with unified governments – such as those in Japan or the UK – the bureaucracy

is under substantial control from the cabinet, with the cabinet having little incentive in

providing the legislature with substantial powers to supervise its own actions.

         The incentives for campaign contributions also change accordingly. There is little

incentive in widely distributing campaign contributions in party centered systems, as

distributions to legislators may have little impact on their reelection, and their post-

reelection behavior will be highly impacted by the incentives of the political party bosses.

Thus, as with lobbying efforts, campaign contributions will be highly centralized in key

party decision makers.

         Finally, litigation in party centered systems may provide less satisfaction than in

systems with stronger separation of powers. Because party centered systems tend to

narrow the separation between legislative and executive powers, courts face a

substantially narrower set of discretion. The courts are in a situation where overturning

the bureaucracy may imply alienating the cabinet, which may, in turn, trigger retribution.

Indeed, evidence from Japan and the UK suggest that progression within the judiciary is

dependent on proper behavior vis-à-vis the government of the day.50                             Similarly,

Iaryczower, Spiller and Tommasi (2002) show that in Argentina, strongly unified

governments tend to control the judiciary.51

V.       Conclusion

In this survey we try to provide a framework to understand interest group participation in

public policy decision-making.             We show that polities where legislatures have an

important policy making role will tend to develop more transparent and direct interest

group activity.      Polities where policy making is centralized in the cabinet or the

government party, though, will tend to reserve interest group access to key decision

making politicians.         The trade-off between campaign contributions, lobbying and

litigation is also affected by the nature of the institutional environment. Litigation loses

its power in unified systems, limiting successful interest group activities to direct

lobbying and buying. In decentralized polities, the full extent of complementarities

between direct and indirect lobbying, buying and suing become apparent.
