We construct a new measure of the changing generosity of deposit insurance for many countries,
empirically model the international influences on the adoption and generosity of deposit
insurance, and show that the expansion of deposit insurance generosity increased asset risk in
banking systems. We consider three asset risk measures: higher loans-to-assets, a higher
proportion of lending to households, and a higher proportion of mortgage lending. None of the
observed increases in these indicators is offset by declines in banking system leverage. We show
that increased asset risk explains at least part of the positive association between deposit
insurance and the likelihood and severity of systemic banking crises.

1. Introduction


Over the past three decades, a vast literature has developed on the adoption and expansion of

deposit insurance, and its role in increasing the systemic insolvency risk of banking systems.

That literature has shown that the installation of deposit insurance or an expansion of its

generosity, tend to be associated with higher asset risk, higher leverage, and a greater probability

of a banking crisis, suggesting that the rise of deposit insurance may be one of the contributors to

the pandemic of unprecedentedly frequent and severe banking crises around the world.2


         There are also several studies that examine the origins of deposit insurance, the extent of

its coverage, and other design features of deposit insurance systems. Interestingly, however,

contributions to the two literatures—on the causes and consequences of deposit insurance,

respectively—have occurred largely independently from one another. For example, Demirgüc-

Kunt and Detragiache (2002) show how cross-country differences in deposit insurance coverage

predict differences in banking system crisis risk, while Demirgüc-Kunt, Kane and Laeven

(2008a, 2008b) identify key political characteristics of countries that tend to predict the timing

and generosity of deposit insurance implementation.


         In this study, we show that it is useful to address the questions of causes and

consequences jointly within a common empirical model, which uses the identification of the

causal influences on asset risk of deposit insurance adoption and expansion to improve the

measurement of its consequences, especially consequences for systemic bank insolvency crises.


2
 For a review of the evidence on the bank risk increases that are associated with the expansion of coverage in
historical and recent insurance systems, see Calomiris and Jaremski (2016), which surveys evidence for two
centuries and many countries. With respect specifically to the increased probability of a banking crisis associated
with the greater generosity of deposit insurance, see Demirguc-Kunt and Detragiache (2002), and Anginer,
Demirguc-Kunt and Zhu (2014). For a crisis database and an analysis of its severity in historical perspective, see
Laeven and Valencia (2013) and Calomiris and Haber (2014).
                                                                                                                      1
In doing so, we also seek to avoid endogeneity bias that can confound identification of the

impact of deposit insurance on risk. Studies of the consequences of deposit insurance for

increased crisis risk have relied on risk comparisons that fail to rule out endogeneity bias related

to omitted variables and reverse causality. It is conceivable that some of the observed

relationship between deposit insurance and risk taking could be driven by influences that

exogenously raise risk and which also raise (or initiate) deposit insurance coverage as a response

to increased risk.


       To address that problem, we note that many of the drivers of deposit insurance adoption

and generosity identified by Laeven (2004), Demirgüç-Kunt, Kane and Laeven (2008a, 2008b)

and others are international influences that can plausibly serve as instruments with respect to

measuring the risk-increasing consequences of deposit insurance. That is, these international

influences should not reflect local economic changes that could cause local risks to rise.


       Theory suggests that deposit insurance can either increase or decrease banking system

risk. On the one hand, credible deposit insurance can make the banking system more stable by

reducing liquidity risk by removing the incentive of depositors to withdraw funds from banks

when bank risk increases. On the other hand, deposit insurance may be a source of “moral

hazard”—it may increase the risk appetite of banks because their ability to attract deposits no

longer reflects the risk of their portfolios. Deposit insurance can also cause “adverse selection”,

including as the result of unwitting increases in risk when the absence of market discipline

permits poor risk managers to operate banks. If the capital position and asset risk of banks are

not regulated and supervised carefully, the insurance-induced risk taking may increase

insolvency risk and undermine financial stability in the long run, despite the liquidity risk

reductions that deposit insurance creates.
                                                                                                       2
       To estimate risk-taking induced by deposit insurance and its consequences for systemic

insolvency risk, we construct a three-step model of the origins of deposit insurance, its changing

generosity over time, and the risk-taking consequences of deposit insurance, which treats all

three aspects as endogenous variables. In the first two steps of the model, international influences

predict the origins and generosity of deposit insurance coverage. We develop a new measure of

the generosity of deposit insurance coverage, which we use as the dependent variable in the

second step of the model. In the third step of the model, instrumented values of the predicted

generosity of deposit insurance are used to explain different measures of risk-taking that affect

the solvency of banking systems.


       From the perspective of a theory of insolvency risk (such as the Black-Scholes-Merton

model), the likelihood of failure is increasing in leverage and asset risk, and asset risk is

increasing in the proportion of risky assets relative to cash assets, and in the riskiness of risky

assets (i.e., the riskiness of loans). We consider three complementary measures of bank

insolvency risk: the loans-to-assets ratio of a country’s banks in a given year, the extent of

household lending (or mortgage lending) of a country’s banks in a given year (measured by the

proportion of bank loans to households, or the proportion of bank loans that are mortgage loans),

and the debt-to-assets ratio of a country’s banks in a given year. The first is an assets-side

measure that captures risk increases resulting from a smaller proportion of low-risk, cash assets.


       The second measure (mortgage lending or household lending) captures systemic loan

portfolio risk increases due to mortgage lending exposure. Data on household loans primarily

reflect mortgage lending and are available for a broader sample than narrowly defined mortgage

lending. Although mortgages may not be high-risk loans for individual banks during normal

times, there is substantial evidence that they are high-risk assets from the standpoint of systemic
                                                                                                      3
insolvency risk. When real estate prices decline, such declines can have widespread and severe

implications for mortgage portfolios. For that reason, mortgage lending may entail greater

systemic risk to the banking system. Several recent studies point to the importance of mortgage

lending in promoting systemic risk, and our findings of a positive connection between mortgage

lending and crisis risk also corroborate that view.


        Jorda, Schularick and Taylor (2015a, 2015b) show that mortgage lending has been a

major contributor to systemic risk in the banking sector for a wide range of countries. Mortgage

lending exposes the banking system to increased systemic risk because the value of real estate is

highly correlated with the business cycle, and because real estate is hard for lenders to liquidate

in a downturn. The recognition of these facts led government regulation historically to

discourage heavy commercial bank involvement in real estate finance, but those limits became

increasingly relaxed in many countries during the last several decades. In recent decades,

governments have promoted bank involvement in mortgage lending through various means,

including favorable (low) risk-based asset weights for mortgages adopted by the Basel

Committee, and various government credit subsidies promoting mortgage lending (e.g., Federal

Home Loan Bank loans in the U.S.). Cournede and Denk (2015) show that the rising proportion

of household borrowing (which is largely mortgages) has tended to crowd out the financing of

other more productive types of investment, and therefore, is associated with adverse growth

consequences.3 Jorda, Schularick and Taylor (2015a, 2015b) and Mian, Sufi and Verner (2016)

show that real estate lending has grown dramatically as a proportion of total lending in their

sample of developed countries since 1970, and real estate risk has been central to banking crises

around the world during that period, as well.

3
 Chen, Hanson and Stein (2017) also note the decline in bank lending to small businesses in the U.S., and its
consequences for labor markets, which may also be related to this crowding out from greater mortgage lending.
                                                                                                                4
       Including the extent of household and mortgage lending in our analysis is useful for two

reasons. First, if a banking system’s debt-to-assets and loans-to-assets both rose, but the riskiness

of loans fell sufficiently, bank failure risk could remain unchanged. Thus, it is important to

consider loan risk alongside leverage and the loans-to-assets ratio when gauging changes in

banking system risk. Second, mortgage loans are not only systemically risky, they also are a

politically important category of lending. By tracking how mortgage loans respond to changes in

deposit insurance, we are able to consider the possibility that the politics of deposit insurance and

the politics of subsidizing mortgage credit interact. It is commonly recognized as standard

economic theory to consider deposit insurance, in the absence of sufficiently strong prudential

regulation, as providing a put option subsidy to banks, as originally modeled by Merton (1977).

The rents from that subsidy can be used to fund other subsidies that banks may be encouraged to

provide to borrowers. We hypothesize that the rise of deposit insurance (which, in the absence of

prudential safeguards, provides a subsidy for risk that accrues to banks) makes it easier for

governments to use banking systems as a means of subsidizing politically influential household

mortgage borrowers (because the government can pressure banks to share the deposit insurance

protection subsidy with a politically favored class of borrowers). By including the proportion of

household and mortgage lending in our model, we are able to test the hypothesis that rising

deposit insurance promotes increases in asset risk through multiple channels: (1) the rise in

loans-to-assets, and (2) the increased lending risk associated with the lack of loan diversification

and reduced loan liquidity associated with a greater focus on real estate lending. Our paper, we

believe, is the first to study the real estate lending channel of deposit insurance.


       The third measure of systemic risk we examine is a liabilities-side measure that captures

bank risk increases that result from rising leverage in the banking system. In theory, of course, a

                                                                                                      5
rise in any one of these measures may not increase bank insolvency risk if that rise is offset by a

sufficient decline in other measures. As we will show, however, the observed increases in

systemic insolvency risk measured by one or more indicators is not offset by declines in any

other risk measures.


         We also considered controlling for cross-country differences in prudential regulation or

banking supervision that might affect the systemic risk-increasing consequences of deposit

insurance. Doing so may not be advisable, given that prudential regulation and banking

supervision are themselves endogenous variables that may respond to changes in deposit

insurance. Furthermore, existing data on prudential regulation or banking supervision are limited

in both time and country dimensions for our purpose. We found that it was not possible to

construct a usable cross-country measure of the strictness of minimum capital ratio requirements

across countries and over time. In general, expansions of deposit insurance protection likely have

been accompanied by stricter prudential regulation, intended to limit the moral-hazard and

adverse-selection costs of deposit insurance. If that is the case, then our estimates should be

regarded as conservative ceteris paribus measures of the impact of deposit insurance, because the

risk-increasing impact of insurance should be partly offset by stricter prudential regulation. Our

results show that endogenous strengthening of prudential regulation has not fully eliminated the

moral-hazard and adverse-selection consequences of deposit insurance.


         Our analysis employs the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) International Financial

Statistics (IFS) database on aggregate banking system balance sheets, which covers many

countries and stretches back into the 1970s.4 We also use data for household loans and mortgage


4
 Consistent with the IFS definition, the term "country" does not in all cases refer to a territorial entity that is a state
as understood by international law and practice. The term also covers some territorial entities that are not states.
                                                                                                                              6
loans from Cerutti, Dagher, and Dell’Ariccia (2017), which cover a smaller set of countries. We

analyze countries as a panel of country years, combining data from advanced and emerging

countries. In our robustness analysis we also divide countries into two categories (advanced and

emerging) to explore possible differences in their responses.


        Our findings can be summarized as follows. First, we find that (consistent with

Demirguc-Kunt et al. 2008a, 2008b) international influences on the expansion of deposit

insurance protection (captured by interactions among the proportion of countries that has adopted

deposit insurance, and measures that account for endorsement or mandate from the IMF, World

Bank, and the European Union) robustly predict the creation and expansion of deposit insurance

coverage. That is true both for advanced and emerging economies. We also find that it is

important to take into account other variables (which serve as controls in the three-step

regression model) that influence the propensity to enact or expand deposit insurance. In

particular, deposit insurance is more likely to be enacted or to expand during recessions and in

the wake of a major banking crisis.


        Second, we find that instrumented increases in deposit insurance coverage predict

increases in the loans-to-assets ratio. When advanced and emerging economies are pooled, that

effect is positive and statistically significant.


        Third, with respect to the effects of exogenous increases of deposit insurance on

mortgage lending, we find that exogenous increases in deposit insurance result in a higher

proportion of household loans or mortgage loans, and this is true both for advanced and

emerging or developing economies. This suggests that deposit insurance not only expands the

asset risk of banking systems, but that it does so in a way that favors risky household and

                                                                                                   7
mortgage lending. Once deposit insurance frees banks from the constraints of market discipline,

governments may be more able to use the regulation of the banking system as a means of

targeting credit subsidies to household borrowers.


        Fourth, we find that the asset risk-increases caused by deposit insurance expansion are

not offset by reductions in leverage. On the contrary, instrumented increases in deposit

insurance coverage tend to raise leverage ratios.


       Having identified endogenous asset risk increases in response to increased deposit

insurance coverage, we then consider the macroeconomic significance of those increases, and

link them to the likelihood of crises. First, we find that exogenous increases in the generosity of

deposit insurance not only predict higher riskiness of bank assets, but also greater bank asset risk

as a proportion of GDP (measured either as loans-to-GDP, or household-loans-to-GDP, or

mortgage-loans-to-GDP). Second, consistent with prior literature, we find that (after controlling

for other factors), exogenously more generous deposit insurance tends to result in a significantly

greater likelihood and severity of crises. Third, we find that exogenous increases in asset risk

(measured as loans-to-GDP, household-loans-to-GDP, or mortgage-loans-to-GDP) produced by

greater international influences promoting deposit insurance also are associated with the greater

likelihood and severity of crises.


       Given that our instruments rely in part on common global factors that vary over time

(which are reflected in the influence of the IMF, the EU, the World Bank, and the emulation of

other countries’ deposit insurance practices) we also consider whether our results are robust to

adding alternative time-varying factors to our model. We consider two alternative measures of

stock market volatility, or variables that capture the globalization of interbank borrowing or

                                                                                                      8
global capital flows, or measures of financial liberalization. We find that these variables have

little effect on the estimated consequences of deposit insurance generosity for increases in bank

asset risk, or the likelihood or severity of banking crises.


        Our results on asset risk should be interpreted as identifying a risk-taking effect on bank

assets that raises insolvency risk and crisis risk in response to increases in the generosity of

explicit deposit insurance.5 To the extent that our instrumentation strategy is valid, our

estimations capture the causal effect of increased deposit insurance generosity. Nevertheless, our

results are silent on whether the generosity of deposit insurance affects the liquidity risk of

banking systems.


        Our results are generally robust to dividing the sample of countries into advanced and

emerging sub-groups, but statistical significance is reduced in some regressions, especially for

the effect of deposit insurance generosity on loans-to-assets. Nevertheless, the connections for

both sub-groups between exogenous variation in deposit insurance generosity and the increase in

systemic risk—which is reflected in various measures of asset risk, as well as the likelihood and

severity of systemic banking crises—lead us to conclude that the responses of the two sub-

groups of countries are broadly similar. To increase sample size, which affects the precision of

estimates, therefore, we emphasize our pooled regression results.


        Our study is related to a large literature on deposit insurance (reviewed in Calomiris and

Jaresmki 2016). As we discussed earlier, deposit insurance has an ambiguous effect on banking

system risk from a theoretical perspective. The overall effect depends on the size of the moral-

hazard and adverse-selection risk-enhance effect compared to the liquidity risk-reducing effect.

5
 Importantly, they should not be interpreted as comparing banking system risks between countries with and without
deposit insurance (the latter including possible cases of greater implicit government guarantees).
                                                                                                                9
Calomiris and Jaremski (2016) conclude that the empirical literature on the overall consequences

of deposit insurance for bank risk consistently finds substantial net risk increases associated with

deposit insurance, implying that the moral-hazard and adverse-selection disadvantages of deposit

insurance tend to outweigh its liquidity risk-reducing advantages.


          Our study makes several new contributions to the empirical literature. We believe we are

the first to link exogenous variation in the expansion of deposit insurance coverage with changes

in bank asset risk, and we are also the first to consider how deposit insurance coverage affects

banking systems’ propensity to provide mortgages. With respect to data contributions, we

construct a new measure to capture the changing generosity of deposit insurance over time.


          Section 2 describes our data base. Section 3 presents our empirical methodology and our

regression models. Section 4 reports our empirical findings for the influence of exogenous

increases in deposit insurance coverage on bank risk. Section 5 explores the links among deposit

insurance generosity, asset risk and the probability and severity of crises. Section 6 concludes.




2. Data

2.1 Deposit insurance data

          Our primary sources for deposit insurance coverage are Demirgüç-Kunt, Kane and

Laeven (2005) and Demirgüç-Kunt, Kane and Laeven (2014). This is a comprehensive, global

database of deposit insurance as of 2013. The original data have information on coverage and

coinsurance for all years since adoption until 2003, as well as data for 2010 and 2013. We

checked the existing data using national data sources, made some corrections, and extended the



                                                                                                    10
data to cover all years through 2013. Figure 1 shows the timing of different countries’ adoption

of deposit insurance.


         We measure the consequences of the changing generosity of deposit insurance. There are

two design features that affect the generosity of coverage—the breadth of deposit coverage and

the extent of coinsurance of the risk of loss—and this complicates the measurement of the

generosity of a deposit insurance scheme. Explicit deposit insurance schemes typically insure

deposits up to a statutory coverage limit. In some cases, government guarantees are offered on

top of statutory limits. With a full government guarantee in place, depositors essentially receive

“unlimited” coverage on their deposits. Some deposit insurance schemes also include

coinsurance, which insures depositors for a pre-specified portion of their deposits. Coverage and

coinsurance together determine how much depositors would receive from the deposit insurer. For

example, in a country with a statutory coverage limit of $10,000 and 20 percent coinsurance,

depositors with up to $10,000 deposits could receive 80 percent of their deposit amount.6 We

define deposit insurance score (DI score) as an index for the generosity of a deposit insurance

scheme. To calculate the DI score, we first convert all coverage amounts to US dollars using

market exchange rates and compute the ratio of coverage to GDP per capita. We then define

coverage score as an index between 0 and 1 based on the ratio of coverage to GDP per capita.7

This approach to scaling the measurement of coverage avoids distributions with extreme outliers.

We acknowledge that the coverage limit should also take into account other country specific

factors, such as the distribution of deposit size. But such granular data are not available for a

large set of countries. Finally, we define DI score as the coverage score if coinsurance is 0, as 0.5

6
  Many countries used coinsurance in the earlier part of our sample period but it has become less popular over time.
7
  Coverage score equals 0.2 if coverage to GDP per capita ratio ranges from 0 to 1, equals 0.4 if the ratio ranges
from 1 to 2; equals 0.6 if the ratio ranges from 2 to 6; equals 0.8 if the ratio ranges from 6 to 20; and equals 1 if the
ratio is greater than 20, or with full government guarantees (i.e. “unlimited” coverage).
                                                                                                                       11
times the coverage score if coinsurance is greater than 0 but smaller than 25 percent, and as 0 if

coinsurance is greater or equal to 25 percent, or if there is no deposit insurance.8



2.2. Bank balance sheet and macroeconomic data

        We assemble a comprehensive database of aggregate bank balance sheet and

macroeconomic variables for the 1970-2013 period.9 Our main data source is the IMF’s IFS data.

We focus on two aggregate balance sheet variables: loans-to-assets ratio and debt-to-assets

ratio, both of which are expressed in logs (see Table 1 and Appendix A for details). The

macroeconomic variables we consider are CPI inflation and real GDP growth.

        Using the IFS data to construct bank balance sheet variables has two advantages. First,

the data employ standardized formats and adjust for variations in accounting and auditing

conventions so they are reasonably comparable across countries. Second, the IFS has a wide

coverage of countries over our sample period, including advanced and emerging countries. The

weakness of the IFS data is that it does not provide disaggregated (bank-level) information.

Unfortunately, datasets with disaggregated information have more limited country and time

coverage.

        Our primary source for household loans and mortgage loans is Cerutti, Dagher, and

Dell’Ariccia (2017), extended to 2013 when available. We define household loans-to-total-loans

ratio as the proportion of private sector loans to the household sector. We define mortgage-

loans-to-total-loans ratio as the proportion of private sector loans as mortgage loans. Both are

8
  Some deposit insurance schemes apply different coinsurances to different deposit amounts. For example, during
2002-2008, Albania had no coinsurance for deposits up to 350,000 Albanian Lek and 15 percent coinsurance for
deposits from 350,000 to 700,000 Albanian Lek. In these cases, we use the highest coinsurance percentage to
calculation the DI score.
9
  We start our sample period in 1970 because this is the year when the IFS data become available for the majority of
our sample countries. Our results are robust to including data starting from 1960. Using an earlier year would not
affect our results because only one country (the United States) adopted deposit insurance prior to 1960.
                                                                                                                 12
expressed as log ratios. Our household loans and mortgage loans data have the same country

coverage, although the former generally goes further back than the latter.10 The two are highly

correlated in our sample, with a correlation of 0.8. Although household loans are broader than

mortgage loans (including non-mortgage consumer credit), mortgage loans accounts for a large

proportion of household loans in our sample: 57 percent in all countries, 62 percent in advanced

economies and 39 percent in emerging economies. The higher percentage in advance economies

is not surprising because the mortgage markets in advanced economies are more developed.

Overall, we view household-loans-to-total-loans ratio as a good proxy for mortgage lending.

        We discard all observations in which the balance sheet identity is not satisfied (see

Appendix A for details). To remove the effect of outliers, we winsorize all macroeconomic

variables and balance sheet ratios at the 1 and 99 percent. We end up with a final sample of

1,426 observations in 69 countries for our balance sheet ratios analysis, of which 32 countries

and 734 observations are in advanced economies, and 37 countries and 692 observations are in

emerging economies. For the analysis with household and mortgage loans, we have a sample of

774 and 575 observations, respectively. They cover 47 countries, 31 of which are advanced

economies and 16 of which are emerging economies (see Table 2 for details). Table 3 reports

summary statistics.



2.3. Crisis data

        Our definition of banking crises follows Laeven and Valencia (2013).11 When we employ

a crisis dummy as a control in our regressions, we define Post crisis as a dummy variable for the


10
   The few exceptions are Canada (2009-2011), Philippines (2000), and Switzerland (2005-2006), which has data for
mortgage loans but not household loans.
11
   We could supplement the Laeven and Valencia (2013) data with other crisis datasets that go back to the beginning
of our sample period such as Reinhart and Rogoff (2011). But this would make little difference in our analysis
                                                                                                                13
three years following the start of a banking crisis. When we define the occurrence of a crisis as a

dependent variable, we date the crisis using the first year of a systemic banking crisis. To avoid

double counting crisis events, when the occurrence of a crisis is our dependent variable, we drop

the next two years of data or until the end of a crisis, whichever is greater. We follow Laeven

and Valencia (2013) and measure the severity of a crisis by output loss, defined as the three-year

cumulative loss in GDP relative to a pre-crisis trend.



3. Empirical Methodology

3.1. Asset risk and deposit insurance

        To examine bank risk responses to deposit insurance we employ an instrumental variable

(IV) methodology adapted for sample selection that estimates the effect of deposit insurance

generosity on risk. We consider two types of asset risk measures. First, we measure asset risk in

the aggregate balance sheet of banks, captured by the loans-to-assets ratio and the share of

household loans, or mortgage loans, in total loans. Because these measures capture loan risk

relative to the assets of the banking system, we call them “micro” measures of asset risk.

        Second, we measure asset risk to the macroeconomy, captured by the credit-to-GDP

ratio, the household loans-to-GDP ratio, and the mortgages-to-GDP ratio. As we discussed in

Section 1, these latter two measures are motivated by the literature on the role of real estate

credit and real estate sector price fluctuations in propagating macroeconomic shocks in normal

times and crises. Because measures of credit risk relative to GDP capture the banking system

credit risk relative to the aggregate economy, we call them “macro” measures of asset risk. We

additionally examine the effect of deposit insurance on banking system leverage. Although


because only one banking crisis is identified in Reinhart and Rogoff (2011) between 1960 and 1969—Brazil in
1963—and Brazil did not adopt deposit insurance until 1995.
                                                                                                              14
liability-side risk is not the focus of this study, it is useful to include leverage in our analysis to

examine whether asset-side risk increases are offset by reductions in liability-side risk.

        The estimation consists of three steps. In the first step we estimate the probability of

enacting deposit insurance using the model specified in equation (1):

                    DI ct  I     Controlsct    Instrumentsct   ct  0 ,               (1)

where DI is a binary variable that takes a value of 1 if country c has deposit insurance in year t

and 0 otherwise. Controls are variables that we assume affect both the deposit insurance decision

and balance sheet variables, such as inflation and real GDP growth. We find that the influence of

inflation was different in emerging economies, and therefore, we include an interaction between

inflation and emerging country type to capture that difference. We also find that it is important to

control for the effects of the timing and severity of banking crises on deposit insurance design,

and so we include two controls for that purpose, one measuring the timing of crises and the offer

the loss severity of the crisis. Instruments are a set of variables that capture international

influence on the adoption or design of deposit insurance, which we will discuss in more detail.

I . is the indicator function and  ct is a normally distributed error term. The fitted probabilities

from the first step are then used to estimate the inverse Mills ratio, which we denote as ct in the

IV estimation.

        The second and third steps proceed as a standard IV model with the inverse Mills ratio as

an additional control: Different measures of banking system risks are regressed on the

instrumented generosity of deposit insurance coverage. In other words, in the second step of the

model, the dependent variable is deposit insurance generosity; the independent variables are the

same set of exogenous instruments used to estimate equation (1). In the third step of the model,

predicted values of deposit insurance generosity are used to explain banking system risk.
                                                                                                          15
         More specifically, we estimate:

                          yct      DIscorect    Controlsct    ct  ct ,                         (2)

where yct is loans-to-assets ratio, the household-loans-to-total-loans ratio, or the mortgage-

loans-to-total-loans ratio; DI score is the deposit insurance score that measures the generosity of

deposit insurance; and  ct is an error term. An important element in (2) is the inverse Mills ratio

estimated from step one of the model. Because we only observe the generosity of deposit

protection after a country adopts deposit insurance, our approach ensures that countries’

endogenous selection into deposit insurance is accounted for in steps two and three of the model.

We also include country fixed effects in (2) to control for persistent heterogeneity in the

aggregate banking system.12

         Our estimation procedure follows Wooldridge (2002).13 We use the same set of

exogenous variables in (1) to predict DI score and the predicted values are used to estimate (2).

As noted by Wooldridge (2002), it is appropriate to include all instruments in both (1) and (2).

Note that a standard assumption (i.e., the rank condition) of sample selection models requires

that some instruments only affect the selection equation (1) but not the outcome equation (2).

This is true in our model, too, as we assume that the creation and expansion of deposit insurance

are influenced by exogenous instruments that are not included as direct influences on risk

measures; they only influence risk through their effect on deposit insurance. In our model,

adoption and expansion of deposit insurance are treated separately in the estimation, but as

Wooldridge (2002) points out, it is desirable to have the same set of instruments included in both




12
   We do not include country fixed effects in the probit model (1) because once countries adopted deposit insurance,
they do not revoke it. Our results are robust to excluding country fixed effects from (2).

                                                                                                                   16
the adoption and expansion specifications; doing otherwise is “dangerous and unnecessary.”14

We do not expect, however, that each of the international influences will have identical effects

on adoption and expansion of deposit insurance. For example, the IMF recommended in 1999

that countries adopt explicit deposit insurance but did not advocate a certain level of coverage.15

         We use a set of instruments that capture international influences on deposit insurance, as

found in Demirgüç-Kunt, Kane and Laeven (2008a, 2008b). Our instruments include IMF best

practice, Emulation, an interaction term of IMF best practice and Emulation, World Bank loan,

EU candidacy, and EU directive. IMF best practice is a dummy variable that takes a value of one

for the years 1999 and onwards. The year 1999 is when the IMF published a best-practice paper

on the design of deposit insurance and recommended explicit deposit insurance for developing

countries (Garcia, 1999). Emulation is the proportion of countries with explicit deposit insurance

in a given year. We interpret this value as a proxy for the extent to which deposit insurance is

considered to be best practice around the world. World Bank loan is a dummy variable that takes

a value of one during and following the year that the World Bank started an adjustment lending

program with a country that entailed the adoption of deposit insurance. The European Union

(EU) also mandated deposit insurance. The year 1994 was when the EU Directive on Deposit

Insurance came into force. EU directive is a dummy variable that takes a value of one for the

years 1994 and onwards for EU member (EU-15) countries. EU candidacy is a dummy variable

that takes a value of one for years 1994 and onwards for EU candidate countries. Figure 2 plots

the timing of these various measures of international influence and their importance over time.

14
   This is because dropping some exogenous variables in either equation imposes exclusion restrictions on a
reduced-form equation (Wooldridge, 2002, pg. 569).
15
   For example, the IMF suggested that “(m)ost effective schemes are ... limited to protecting small depositors and
do not cover large depositors and other creditors, including other banks, so as to create incentives for market
discipline to exert pressure on banks” (Folkerts-Landau and Lindgren, 1998, pg. 10). IMF staff suggested that
countries consider factors such as per capital income and the distribution of deposits when setting the coverage limit
(Garcia, 1999).
                                                                                                                    17
       Our identification assumption is that these instruments only matter for the balance sheet

variables through their effect on deposit insurance adoption or design. Because IMF best practice

is defined based on a year (i.e., 1999), our assumption requires that it did not coincide with other

changes (e.g., actions from the IMF, or shocks to banking systems) that had a significant effect

on banking system risks of all countries independent of deposit insurance. That assumption

seems reasonable in light of the smooth growth and calm financial markets that characterized the

global economy in 1999 and 2000. A similar assumption must hold for EU member and

candidate countries in the year 1994. That seems reasonable, given that European growth and

financial markets were stable during this time.

       The assumption that World Bank loan is unrelated to other economic changes in the local

economy is harder to defend; World Bank lending programs that entailed the adoption of deposit

insurance might have coincided with other significant economic shocks and may have reflected

other policy objectives, including those directly targeting the risk of the banking system,

independent of the effects of deposit insurance. To alleviate the concern that this may be the

case, we treat World Bank loan as a control variable in our robustness check.



4. Results

4.1 “Micro” Bank Risk

       Before turning to our regression analysis, Figure 3 and plots the growth of loans-to-assets

and debt-to-assets, and Figure 4 plots household loans-to-total loans, and mortgages-to-total

loans. Figure 3 shows that loans-to-assets growth tends to be more positive later in the sample

period, although the same is not as apparent for debt-to-assets Figure 4 shows relatively rapid

growth in the fractions of loans to households or the fraction of mortgage loans. Thus, on


                                                                                                   18
average, increases in systemic risk have coincided with increases in the spread of deposit

insurance and its generosity over time.


         Table 4 reports the first step analysis of our model: probit model estimates of deposit

insurance adoption.16 Appendix Table B1-B4 reports the second step analysis of our model: the

prediction of the generosity of deposit insurance with exogenous instruments (with sample

selection correction, using the probit model results from Table 4). The instruments generally do

well in forecasting both the adoption of deposit insurance and its generosity. This is also true for

subsample splits of advanced and emerging economies, which are not reported here.


         Tables 5 to 8 report the third step analysis of our model, which uses predicted deposit

insurance generosity from Table 4 to forecast banking system risk.17 Control variables (which we

will not discuss in detail) are often statistically significant. In Table 5, we report estimates for the

effect of instrumented deposit insurance generosity on banking system loans-to-assets ratio.

Estimates are positive and statistically significant. They are also large. A standard deviation

increase (0.25) in DI score results in a 0.50 increase in ln of loans-to-assets, which is roughly

1.25 of a standard deviation increase in loans-to-assets.




16
   We estimate an unbalanced panel of country years, and report robust standard errors. The number of years per
country, and the number of countries per year are too small to reliably cluster errors either by country or by year. For
example, the median number of years per country in the mortgage sample is 9, and the median number of countries
per year in the mortgage sample is 5. Furthermore, we cannot reliably cluster standard errors by year in the presence
of country fixed effects: There is no guidance from the literature on what is the appropriate way to adjust the degrees
of freedom with fixed effects. In results not reported here, our findings regarding statistical significance are
generally robust to clustering errors by country, but results on mortgages are not robust to clustering by country.
17
   Our results are estimated using a Limited-Information Maximum Likelihood (LIML) estimator. We use the LIML
instead of the two-stage least squares (TSLS) estimator because we have many instruments (six) and the set of
instruments are somewhat weak in some specifications. For example, in models with loans-to-assets ratio as
dependent variable, the F statistics is 9.2 in the simplest specification, even though they are much stronger in models
with other dependent variables (the F statistics is above 20 in the above specification). LIML is a good alternative to
2SLS with weak instruments or many instruments because it is median-unbiased and consistent under many-
instrument asymptotics (Stock, Wright, and Yogo, 2002).
                                                                                                                     19
        Table 6 reports results for the household-loans-to-total-loans ratio. We find that the

effect of instrumented deposit insurance generosity is positive and highly statistically significant

in predicting the household-loans-to-total-loans ratio. Table 7 reports similar findings for the

mortgage-loans-to-total-loans ratio. In both cases, the magnitudes of the effects are large. A

standard deviation increase in DI score raises the log of household-loans-to-total-loans ratio by

1.5 of its standard deviation, and raises the log of mortgage-loans-to-total-loans ratio by about

76 percent of its standard deviation.


       Table 8 reports results for banking system debt relative to assets. Instrumented deposit

insurance generosity positively affects debt-to-assets. The effect is not highly statistically

significant. We are able to conclude, however, that leverage does not decline (e.g., due to

tightening prudential regulation) in reaction to expanded deposit insurance generosity. Leverage,

if anything rises with asset risk as insurance coverage expands, and does not offset the effects of

rising asset risk on the riskiness of the banking system. The magnitude of the estimated effect is

large. A standard deviation increase in DI score raises debt-to-assets by 41 percent of its

standard deviation.


       In Tables 5-8 we also report tests of the instruments, including the Kleibergen-Paap

(2006) rk statistic for under-identification, the Cragg-Donald Wald (non-robust) and Kleibergen-

Paap Wald (heteroskedasticity-robust) statistics for weak instruments. In all specifications, the

Kleibergen-Paap LM test rejects the null hypothesis that the equation is under-identified. The

weak instrument statistics also exceed the Stock and Yogo (2005) tabulation, suggesting that

weak instruments are not a concern.




                                                                                                    20
        As a robustness check, we treat World Bank loan as a control variable instead of an

exogenous instrument. As we discussed in Section 3, the purpose of this robustness check is to

alleviate the concern that World Bank loan may have a direct effect on bank risk independent of

deposit insurance. Appendix Tables B5-B9 report the results.18 Our results remain largely the

same.




4.2 “Macro” Bank Risk: The Asset Risk Channel of Banking Crises


        Our findings in Tables 5-8 show that the increasing generosity of deposit insurance

promoted increased asset risk in banking systems, which is not offset by lower leverage. A

natural question to ask is to what extent the increased asset risk contributes to the positive

association between deposit insurance and the likelihood of banking crises, which was found in

prior studies? First, we examine whether increases in deposit insurance generosity affected credit

risk relative to GDP (which captures the macroeconomic significance of the effects). Second, we

estimate the impact of deposit insurance-induced increases in asset risk on the likelihood of

banking crises.


        Tables 9-11 report results for instrumented regressions, identical in structure to those in

Tables 5-7, but which divide each of the three macro credit measures (loans, household loans and

mortgage loans) by GDP. DI score is positive and statistically significant in influencing all three

measures. In all three cases, the economic magnitudes of the effects are large. A one standard

deviation increase in DI score results in more than a standard deviation increase in each of the

macro credit measures.

18
  Robustness tables for the mortgage-loans-to-total-loans ratio and mortgage-loans-to-GDP ratio are omitted
because they are identical to the baseline tables.
                                                                                                              21
        Next, we examine the impact of external influence on deposit insurance generosity, and

how this response affects the likelihood of crises and crisis severity. For the likelihood of crises,

we follow Wooldridge (2002, p. 623) in using linear estimation of the final-stage crisis risk

rather than a probit in the third stage of the model. When estimating these effects it is necessary

to decide how to treat the observations in the data base for the years of crises after the first year.

Including the second, third, fourth or fifth years of a crisis identified by Laeven and Valencia is

problematic: in the years of crisis after the first one, deposit insurance cannot contribute to the

risk that a crisis will occur. For this reason, as noted before, we delete the observations for

country years of crisis after the first year of crisis.


        In Table 12, DI score is instrumented by the external influence variables. In Table 13, the

three macro asset risk measures (expressed relative to GDP) are instrumented by the external

influences on deposit insurance generosity. In Table 12, we show that exogenous increases in the

generosity of deposit insurance produce an increase in crisis risk and crisis severity. In Table 13,

we find that the exogenous influences that produce an increased risk of crisis through increases

in deposit insurance coverage also produce an increase in crisis risk and crisis severity through

their effects on all three of the macro asset risk measures. The magnitudes of the effects in

Tables 12 and 13 are large. In Table 12, a one standard deviation increase in DI score results in

an increase of roughly 40% of a standard deviation of crisis risk and crisis severity. In Table 13,

the magnitudes of the effects are also substantial. For loans-to GDP, a standard deviation

increase results in 24% of a standard deviation increase in crisis risk and 37% of a standard

deviation increase in crisis severity. For household-loans-to-GDP, the effect is 32% of a standard

deviation of crisis risk and 26% of a standard deviation of crisis severity, and for mortgage-

loans-to-GDP, the effect is 50% of a standard deviation of crisis risk and 43% of a standard

                                                                                                      22
deviation of crisis severity. We conclude that exogenous increases in deposit insurance

generosity produce increases in crisis risk and crisis severity at least partly through their effects

on bank asset risk.




4.3 Robustness


        In Table 14, we summarize the robustness of our result for separately estimating the two

subsamples for countries: advanced economies and emerging markets. We report results only for

the full model, which includes all controls. Many results remain statistically significant for both

subsamples when estimated separately, but there are exceptions. Given the smaller sample size it

is hard to determine whether the loss of statistical significance for some subsample estimates

reflect true differences between the two groups of countries or reduced precision of estimation

because of smaller sample sizes.


        In the models with instrumented DI score as an explanatory variable for loans-to-assets,

loans-to-GDP, and household-loans-to-GDP, the results are not statistically significant for

advanced economies. For both advanced and emerging economies, the statistical significance of

DI score on debt-to-assets disappears when the sample is split. However, for both subsamples,

DI score is statistically significant in predicting household loans-to-total loans, mortgage loans-

to-total loans, and mortgage-loans-to-GDP. Furthermore, in emerging economies, exogenous

changes in external influence are not statistically significant for forecasting crisis risk, either

through their effects on DI score (as in Table 12) or through their effects on all three asset risk

measures relative to GDP (as in Table 13). Overall, despite the possibility of some differences

across types of countries, given the broad consistency across the two subsamples, we believe that

                                                                                                      23
reduced precision from subsample splits rather than structural differences are the most likely

explanation for subsample differences in statistical significance. We believe treating all countries

together in our regression analysis is likely to result in more reliable estimation.


         One potential concern about our instruments is that they may be capturing other global

factors that coincide with the international influences on deposit insurance. Potential global

factors that may affect bank risk during our sample period include: increased stock market

volatility, increased capital flows or globalization of interbank borrowing, and increased

financial liberalization.19 We consider the robustness of our results when controlling for these

factors in our model. We control for stock market volatility measured by the CBOE volatility

index (i.e. VIX) and the S&P 500 realized volatility. The former is available since 1986 and the

latter is available throughout our sample period (Figure 5). We control for global capital flows by

including changes in total external liabilities from Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2018). We control

for the globalization of interbank borrowing by including changes in the external liabilities of

“other investment” as a percentage of world GDP (Lane and Milesi-Ferretti, 2018) (Figure 6).20




19
  We also considered including a linear time trend as an exogenous control. We decided that doing so is not
appropriate, given that there is no obvious reason to expect that other omitted exogenous influences (unrelated to
any observable exogenous influence, such as deposit insurance generosity, global asset risk, capital flows, or
financial liberalization) should follow a common linear global trend of increased bank risk. When we include a
linear time trend as a control, the DI score coefficients remain positive and significant for all the “micro” and
“macro” asset risk measures, and for predicting banking crisis severity. But instrumented explanatory variables for
the likelihood of crises are no longer statistically significant. Given that our instruments capture common global
factors that have grown over time (most obviously, emulation), it is not surprising that some of our results diminish
in significance when a time trend is added. The effect of including a time trend highlights the fact that the power of
our instruments for forecasting banking crises depends to some extent on their correlation with common, time-
varying global factors.
20
   We use data on “other investment” as a proxy for global interbank borrowing because it is where bank loans
figure prominently. Changes in “other investment” is also closely related to cross-border activities of large
international banks (Lane and Milesi-Ferretti, 2018).
                                                                                                                    24
We control for financial liberalization using the financial liberalization index for advanced and

emerging countries by Kaminsky and Schmukler (2008) (Figure 7).21


         We summarize the robustness of our results in Table 15. When we control for VIX, stock

market volatility, or capital flow, all our results in Table 5-13 still hold. Results are similar when

we control for financial liberalization except in three cases (the loss of statistical significance for

the DI score coefficients in the loans-to-assets and debt-to-assets regression, and the household-

loans-to-GDP coefficient in the crisis severity regression, although the coefficients are still

positive in all cases).




5. Conclusion


         We model the origins and generosity of deposit insurance and show that international

influences on the expansions of deposit insurance promoted increased asset risk in banking

systems, which also increased the likelihood and severity of banking crises. We construct a new

measure of the generosity of deposit insurance over time for a large sample of countries and link

exogenous changes in the generosity of deposit insurance to changes in bank insolvency risk.

         We consider three forms of bank insolvency risk: loans-to-assets, the proportion of

lending in mortgages (also proxied by greater household lending), and bank debt-to-assets.

Loans-to-assets, household loans-to-total-loans, and mortgage loans-to-total loans all respond

positively to the increase in the generosity of deposit insurance. The response of debt-to-assets to

a rise in the generosity of deposit insurance is positive and marginally statistically significant.

21
   Kaminsky and Schmukler (2008) find that the amplitude of stock market booms substantially increases in the
aftermath of liberalization (defined as a 4-year window, and robust for 3- and 6-year windows). But markets
stabilize in the long run if liberalization persists. Therefore, to capture the risk enhance effect of liberalization, we
control for the average liberalization index in the 4 years prior.
                                                                                                                            25
More generally, none of the observed increases in risk measured by one or more indicators is

offset by significant declines in the other risk measures.

       We also explore the connections between increased asset risk and the risk of banking

crises. Increased deposit insurance generosity results in increases in loans-to-GDP, and increases

in household-loans-to-GDP and mortgage loans-to-GDP. Exogenous increases in the generosity

of deposit insurance produce an increased likelihood of a banking crisis and greater crisis

severity, and the same exogenous external influences that produce an increased risk of crisis

through increases in deposit insurance coverage also produce an increase in crisis risk through

their effects on all three of the macro asset risk measures. In particular, these findings confirm

the view increases in mortgage lending promote greater systemic risk. We conclude that

exogenous increases in deposit insurance generosity produce increases in crisis risk at least

partly through their effects on bank asset risk.

       While our data do not permit us to explore alternative explanations for why deposit

insurance should produce a robust increase in risky mortgage lending, we note two obvious

candidate explanations. First, it may be that high rates of mortgage lending entail liquidity risks

(and perhaps other risks) that would not be feasible for banks to bear without safety net

protection. Another way to think about the relationship between rising deposit insurance

generosity and the greater emphasis on mortgage lending by banks is that the two phenomena are

part of a political rent sharing arrangement. If rising deposit insurance generosity creates greater

rents for banks from enhanced protection, then political forces may respond through regulation

or other political influences to encourage banks to share those rents with mortgage borrowers.

using a probit model. The second and third steps proceed as a standard IV model with the inverse Mills ratio estimated from the
first step as an additional control. The independent variable is the dummy variable which takes a value of 1 if a country has
adopted deposit insurance (see Table 1 for variable definitions). Robust standard errors are shown in brackets. ***, **, and *
represent statistical significance at the 1 percent, 5 percent, and 10 percent, respectively.

Notes: This table shows step 3 results of a three-step model. The first step estimates the probability of enacting deposit insurance.
The second and third steps proceed as a standard IV model with the inverse Mills ratio (lambda) estimated from the first step as
an additional control. The independent variable is the natural logarithm of the loans-to-assets ratio. Deposit insurance (DI) score
is treated as an endogenous variable. The set of exogenous instruments include IMF best practice, emulation, an interaction term
of IMF best practice and emulation, World Bank loan, EU candidacy, and EU directive (see Table 1 for variable definitions). All

Notes: This table shows step 3 results of a three-step model. The first step estimates the probability of enacting deposit insurance.
The second and third steps proceed as a standard IV model with the inverse Mills ratio (lambda) estimated from the first step as
an additional control. The independent variable is the natural logarithm of the household-loans-to-total-loans ratio. Deposit
insurance (DI) score is treated as an endogenous variable. The set of instruments include IMF best practice, emulation, an
interaction term of IMF best practice and emulation, World Bank loan, EU candidacy, and EU directive (see Table 1 for variable
definitions). All variables except for the exogenous instruments are winsorized at the 1 and 99 percent. Robust standard errors are
shown in brackets. ***, **, and * represent statistical significance at the 1 percent, 5 percent, and 10 percent, respectively.

Notes: This table shows step 3 results of a three-step model. The first step estimates the probability of enacting deposit insurance.
The second and third steps proceed as a standard IV model with the inverse Mills ratio (lambda) estimated from the first step as
an additional control. The independent variable is the natural logarithm of the loans-to-GDP ratio. Deposit insurance (DI) score is
treated as an endogenous variable. The set of instruments include IMF best practice, emulation, an interaction term of IMF best
practice and emulation, World Bank loan, EU candidacy, and EU directive (see Table 1 for variable definitions). All variables
except for the exogenous instruments are winsorized at the 1 and 99 percent. Robust standard errors are shown in brackets. ***,
**, and * represent statistical significance at the 1 percent, 5 percent, and 10 percent, respectively.

Notes: This table shows step 3 results of a three-step model. The first step estimates the probability of enacting deposit insurance.
The second and third steps proceed as a standard IV model with the inverse Mills ratio (lambda) estimated from the first step as
an additional control. The first dependent variable is a dummy variable which takes a value of 1 in the first year of a system
banking crisis, and 0 in other years except for years immediately after the start of a banking crisis (the next two years or until the
end of a crisis, whichever is greater), which are treated as missing. Crisis severity is measured as GDP loss associated with
banking crisis years. Deposit insurance (DI) score is treated as an endogenous variable. The set of instruments include IMF best
practice, emulation, an interaction term of IMF best practice and emulation, World Bank loan, EU candidacy, and EU directive
(see Table 1 for variable definitions). All variables except for the exogenous instruments are winsorized at the 1 and 99 percent.

Notes: This table shows step 2 of a standard IV model. The dependent variable measuring the incidence of a crisis is a dummy
variable which takes a value of 1 in the first year of a system banking crisis, and 0 in other years except for years immediately
after the start of a banking crisis (the next two years or until the end of a crisis, whichever is greater), which are treated as
missing. The dependent variable of crisis severity measures the lost GDP associated with crisis years. The instrumented
endogenous variables are the natural logarithms of the loans-to-GDP ratio, the household-loans-to-GDP ratio, and the mortgage-
loans-to-GDP ratio. The set of instruments include IMF best practice, emulation, an interaction term of IMF best practice and
emulation, World Bank loan, EU candidacy, and EU directive (see Table 1 for variable definitions). All variables except for the
exogenous instruments are winsorized at the 1 and 99 percent. Robust standard errors are shown in brackets. ***, **, and *
represent statistical significance at the 1 percent, 5 percent, and 10 percent, respectively.

     A. Data source and definitions for balance sheet variables

         The data source for aggregate banking system balance sheets is IMF’s International
Financial Statistics (IFS) database. We use the IFS’s monetary data on Other Depository
Corporations, which includes all depository corporations of a country except the central banks.
         Our definition of bank assets and liabilities follows the IMF’s Monetary and Financial
Statistics Manual. We measure bank loans by claims on private sector (line 22d). We measure
bank assets as the sum of claims on central banks (line 20), claims on nonresidents (line 21),
claims on central government (line 22a), and claims on other sectors (line 22s). We measure
bank liabilities as the sum of demand deposits included in broad money (line 24), other deposits
included in broad money (line 25), securities other than shares included in broad money (line
26a), deposits excluded from broad money (line 26b), liabilities to nonresidents (line 26c),
liabilities to central government (line 26d), securities other than shares excluded in broad money
(line 26s), loans (line 22l), financial derivatives (line 26m), insurance technical reserves (line
26r). We measure bank equity using shares and other equity (line 27a). The IFS has a residual
item—other items (net) (line 27r)—to classify other unspecified, or country-specific amounts. To
minimize inconsistency due to misreporting, missing values, or other data issues, we check the
following balance sheet identity:
                                         assets  equity  debt  residual ,
and delete all country-year observations in which the discrepancy is larger than 1 percent of bank
assets. 22

     B. Additional tables




22
  Inconsistency occurs primarily due to missing values for countries that have not adopted IMF’s standard reporting
forms. If an item from our standard definition is missing, we replace with the sum of detail components when
available.

Notes: This table shows step 2 results of a three-step model. The first step estimates the probability of enacting deposit insurance.
The second and third steps proceed as a standard IV model with the inverse Mills ratio (lambda) estimated from the first step as
an additional control. The independent variable is the deposit insurance (DI) score. The set of exogenous instruments used to
predict DI score include IMF best practice, emulation, an interaction term of IMF best practice and emulation, World Bank loan,
EU candidacy, and EU directive (see Table 1 for variable definitions). All variables except for the exogenous instruments are
winsorized at the 1 and 99 percent. Robust standard errors are shown in brackets. ***, **, and * represent statistical significance
at the 1 percent, 5 percent, and 10 percent, respectively.

Notes: This table shows step 2 results of a three-step model. The first step estimates the probability of enacting deposit insurance.
The second and third steps proceed as a standard IV model with the inverse Mills ratio (lambda) estimated from the first step as
an additional control. The independent variable is the deposit insurance (DI) score. The set of exogenous instruments used to
predict DI score include IMF best practice, emulation, an interaction term of IMF best practice and emulation, World Bank loan,
EU candidacy, and EU directive (see Table 1 for variable definitions). All variables except for the exogenous instruments are
winsorized at the 1 and 99 percent. Robust standard errors are shown in brackets. ***, **, and * represent statistical significance

Notes: This table shows step 3 results of a three-step model. The first step estimates the probability of enacting deposit insurance.
The second and third steps proceed as a standard IV model with the inverse Mills ratio (lambda) estimated from the first step as
an additional control. The independent variable is the natural logarithm of the debt-to-assets ratio. Deposit insurance (DI) score is
treated as an endogenous variable. The set of instruments include IMF best practice, emulation, an interaction term of IMF best
practice and emulation, EU candidacy, and EU directive (see Table 1 for variable definitions). All variables except for the
exogenous instruments are winsorized at the 1 and 99 percent. Robust standard errors are shown in brackets. ***, **, and *
represent statistical significance at the 1 percent, 5 percent, and 10 percent, respectively.
