                                      ABSTRACT

     Improved understanding of retirement behavior is a key to better under-
standing of many important economic problems. In as close as we can come to
a general "social experiment," real Social Security benefits were increased
substantially for the period we study the retirement patterns of a cohort
of white males: 28% on average between 1970 and 1972, with the maximum
benefit increased by over 50% in real terms between 1968 and 1976. Other
important structural changes in the method of computing benefits were also
made. Hence, we have extremely detailed longitudinal data on a cohort of
people spanning the years of most active retirement behavior (ages 58—67)
over a period of abrupt change in the economic incentives surrounding their
retirement.
     We have analyzed these data in a variety of ways to examine the impact
of the changes in Social Security, as well as other factors, on retirement
probabilities. The most simple to the most sophisticated analyses reveal
the same set of inferences:
1.   The acceleration in the decline in the labor force participation of
     elderly men over the period 1969—73 was primarily due to the large
     increase in real Social Security benefits; our probability equations
     estimate effects of changes in real benefits combined with the actual
     changes    to predict declines in participation rates virtually identical
     to actual observed changes from independent data.
2.   Social Security wealth interacts with other assets. A substantial
     fraction of the elderly appear to have few other assets and this group
     shows a markedly larger propensity to retire early, e.g., at age 62
     when Social Security benefits become available. We find strong evidence
     of this liquidity constraint effect for an important subgroup of the
     elderly.
3.   The magnitude of the induced retirement effect is large enough that if
     it is ignored in estimating the direct fiscal implications of major
     changes in benefit provisions, these may be substantially underestimated.
4.   We interpret our results in the historical context of a particular
     cohort undergoing a major, unanticipated transfer of wealth via larger
     real benefits. We make no attempt to distinguish these from the long—
     run effects if the system were to remain unchanged for many years
     or if future changes were readily predictable.

       THE EFFECT OF SOCIAL SECURITY ON RETIREMENT IN THE EARLY 1970's



 I.   Introduction

          The labor force participation rates of the elderly have been in decline

for decades; but in about 1970 the rate of decline seemed to accelerate. Graph

1 shows the labor force participation rates over time of males by three age

groups: it shows that even among 55-59 year olds participation dropped sharply

beginning in about 1970. What were the causes of these declines, and can we

expect them to continue? In this paper we attempt to give at least a partial

answer to the first question by linking it with another important fact: beginning

in about 1969 the level of real Social Security benefits was raised by Congressional

action. These increases were by no means trivial: the average benefit of a

beneficiary husband and wife increased by 28% in real terms from 1970 to 1972;

between February, 1968 and January, 1976 the maximum benefit possible increased by

about 133% while the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by about 54%. A

consequence of the large increases in benefits and the decline in labor force

participation of people aged 62 and over has been the increasing fraction of

personal income devoted to Social Security benefit payments: in 1970 about

3% of personal income; in 1976 about 3.5%. Another consequence was that the

amount of employee and employer contributions to the Social Security trust

funds proved to be inadequate at the levels called for by the laws of the

early 1970's. For example, the 1969 law envisioned a contribution rate of

5.7% by both employees and employers in 1976; the 1971 law changed the rate to

5.85%, which was the actual rate in 1976. More important    was the increase

in the tax base: its was $7800 from 1968 through 1971, but rose to $15,300

in 1976. It is scheduled to be $29,700 in 1981 with a rate of 6.65%. Thus

the maximum contribution by each employee and employer rose from $374 in 1970

to $895 in 1976. It is scheduled to rise to $1975 in 1981.

     We investigate the relationship between retirement and various features

of Social Security with data from the Retirement History Survey (RHS). This

survey of about 11,000 heads of households who were between the ages of 58 and

63 inclusive in 1969 is ideal for the period of study because the heads reached

the most likely retirement ages just at the time of the increases in Social

Security benefits. They thus constitute an experimental population who were

subjected to substantial increases in assets, which, it is reasonable to

suppose, were not anticipated.

     From the RHS we have selected a subsample of white working husbands, and

from the subsample we give a wide range of evidence that there was a relationship

between Social Security benefits and retirement probabilities.

     The evidence ranges from the calculation of simple retirement probabilities

by age to the specification and estimation of logistic probability equations.

The data strongly support the view that there was a positive relationship

between Social Security benefits and retirement probabilities: this relationship

comes out almost independently of the way in which the data are studied. In

the latter part of the work when we attach magnitudes to the effect of Social

Security benefits, we find that the changes in benefits in the early 1970's

offer a good explanation of the decline in labor force participation over that

period. We conclude it is reasonable to hold that a substantial part of the

decline in participation and subsequent increase in costs of the Social Security

Systems were caused by retirement induced by increases in Social Security

benefits.

II. The Social Security Law

          It may seem obvious that the Social Security system can have an effect

on retirements; but this view is certainly not universally accepted in the

theoretical literature, and it is not always supported in the empirical literature.

Part of the disagreement comes because people do not distinguish carefully

between the short run and the long run. This is especially true in the empirical

literature. Gordon and Blinder [1980], for example, take as a working hypothesis

that the Social Security system has no effect on retirement. They do not,

however, consider that changes in the Social Security law which result in

unexpected asset transfers could affect retirement even though the system might

have no effect on retirements in long-run steady state. Alternatively, we

(Boskin and Hurd [1978]) considered the long run effects when workers have

high rates of time discount; in that situation there are very high tax rates

on working past age 62.*

     A second source of disagreement is that some researchers have not carefully

researched the complex Social Security law. Blinder, Gordon and Wise [1980]

especially have made a valuable contribution by pointing out important features

of the law ignored by previous researchers. Much of what follows in this

section is derived from their paper.




     *A large number of other studies have used alternative types of data and
estimation techniques to examine the relationship among labor force participation
rates of the elderly or individual retirement probabilities and economic incentives,
including social security benefit and coverage levels. The bulk of such studies
-- reviewed in Campbell and Campbell [1976] and Boskin [1977] -- conclude that
Social Security does - or has - affect retirement. But each of these studies
(present authors not exempted) raise problems of data or technique or interpre-
tation while making their contribution. Thus, starting in Section III below
we utilize an improved data source and an abrupt historical change in social
security benefits to gain new insights into the retirement process.

     Any analysis of the effect of Social Security on retirement must rest on

a reasonable treatment of the complicated Social Security law.   Here we shall

describe the main features of the law as it pertains to retirement benefits

of workers of ages 62 through 65 in the years 1969 through 1973. Then we shall

discuss the possible theoretical effects of Social Security on retirement in the

steady-state and in the short run following a change in benefits.

     For our purposes the main features of the Social Security law are the

calculation of the Primary Insurance Amount (PIA), the calculation of benefits,
                                     5




the earnings test and the exogenous changes in benefit levels mandated by

Congress from February, 1968 through June, 1974.* The intent of the Social Security

law was to make benefits depend on past earnings, and to provide income insurance

at the age of retirement. As the law was initially envisioned, in steady

state there would be a fair rate of return on contributions; yet workers

with low lifetime earnings due either to low wage rates or to career inter—

ruptions would receive at least subsistence payments. In fact, these goals

are not consistent, so the present law is a compromise.

     For most people, benefit calculations depend on Average Monthly Earnings

(AME), which are a function of their earnings history. Roughly speaking people

with higher lifetime earnings will have higher AME. The PIA is calculated

from the AME according to a piecewise linear function that is progressively

redistributive in that the slope decreases in AME. AME is a complicated average of

past Social Security contributions; but for our sample the important feature is

that if a worker works an extra year he is allowed to replace a year of zero

or low earnings in the calculation of the AME with a year of current earnings.

This has the effect of raising AME, and hence the PIA and benefits, but the

magnitude of the effect will vary from worker to worker because of difference

in earnings histories: someone with only a few years of contribution could

have a large change in PIA both due to a large change in AME and because

the change in PIA for a change in AME is high when AME is low; someone with

a long history of high contributions would have a small change in PIA from

working an extra year. Blinder, Gordon and Wise report calculations of the

magnitude of this effect for a larger population than ours and find the

effect to be substantial. Because our sample has more stable and higher

     *Whether workers are covered under the Social Security law is not very
important for the population we study although we take coverage into account
in our calculation. Almost all of our working data set is covered.
                                      6




earnings histories we find a much smaller effect, but we do take the effect

into account as we shall outline in the section on estimation.

     A retired worker's monthly benefits are related to the PIA according

to the age of retirement. Before the age of 62 no benefits may be drawn.

Between the ages of 62 and 65 benefits may be drawn upon retirement but the

benefits are reduced from the PIA by 5/9% for each month of retirement

before the age of 65. Thus if a worker retires at age 62 his benefits

are reduced by 5/9% x 3 x 12 = 20% of his PIA. This reduction is permanent;

that is, it applies even after the retired worker's 65th birthday. We call

this the actuarial reduction because the aim in the law was to make the

reduction roughly actuarially fair. Whether the reduction is in fact

actuarially fair or not depends on a number of factors: the rate used to

discount future benefits, the life expectancy, the age of retirement, and

the age of a married worker's wife.   In Table 1 we give some examples of

the effect of the actuarial reduction on both single and married male workers

for several discount rates. The entries show the fraction of the present value

of Social Security benefits lost by waiting a year to retire. The

entries are calculated by finding the present value of the increased benefit

stream over the expected lifetime (and, in the case of a married man, the

lifetime of his widow), subtracting from that the year's benefits lost by not

retiring, and dividing the negative of that difference by the present value

of benefits. For example, at a discount rate of 5% a 62 year old single worker

would lose about .009 of the present value of his benefits by waiting a year to

retire, and, therefore, the 5/9% per month gain is not quite large enough to

be actuarially fair. At a discount 3% it pays, but just slightly, to wait a

year to retire. Even at large discount rates, however, the fraction of present

value lost by delaying retirement is not large.

     Probably a more natural way to judge the effects of the actuarial

reduction is in terms of an implicit tax or subsidy on working. Unfortun-

ately there is no standard case: one can only give examples, which we do in

Table 2. The entries refer to a male worker with a history of maximum Social Securit

contributions and, therefore, with the maximum possible PIA, $160 in 1969.

He is assumed to earn $7800, the median income in our sample in 1969.

It is apparent that the tax rates are not large for discount rates of 3%

to 5%. The negative entries indicate that there is, in fact, a subsidy to

working. The tax rises with age for two reasons: life expectancy decreases

so the payback period of the higher benefits decreases; and the amount foregone by

delaying retirement rises with retirement age from 0.8 PIA at age 62 to 0.933

PIA at age 64. To the extent that the actuarial reduction offers incentives

to retirement, the incentives are greatest at age 62; but unless one believes

that people discount at very high rates, the incentive is not large,

especially for the category of worker we consider. In short, the aim of the

law was to make the reduction in benefits actuarially fair for retirement

before the age of 65, and reoughly speaking that seems to be the case.

     Retirement after the 65th birthday is far from actuarially fair: future

benefits are increased by about 1% for each year of delayed retirement

versus about 7% for each year before age 65. The Social Security system, therefore,

offers a strong incentive to retire at the 65th birthday.

     The earnings test causes benefit payments to be reduced if earnings

exceed $1680 per year.* The reduction is at a 50% rate for earnings up

to $2880 and then at a 100% rate until benefits have been reduced to zero.


     *This refers to the law through December 1972; in later years the
maximum permitted earnings was raised.

Many empirical studies have interpreted the earnings test as a tax on

earnings.* If there are good capital markets and the actuarial reduction is

fair, this is not the case before age 65: if benefits are reduced due to the

earnings test, benefits are recomputed at age 65 and credit is given for

each month's benefits withheld under the earnings test. Furthermore,

if partial benefits are paid in some months, the benefits are aggregated

into full—month equivalents and the appropriate credit given. Under

actuarially fair reduction, therefore, the apparent taxes under the earnings

test are simply savings at a fair rate of return. There is, however, a

second-order effect that does discourage both part-time work and unretirenients

(returning to the labor force after drawing benefits): the recalculation

of benefits is not made until age 65, so that the credit for benefit re-

duction is not realized until that age. This means that if someone decides

to be retired for, say, a year during the time he is between 62 and 65,

it is better to work full time until 64 and then retire permanently rather

than to retire at 62 and reenter the labor force at 63.   This effect and

the fact that if the actuarial reduction is fair at age 62,it is unfair

at later ages, both combine to discourage unretirement. We shall see that

in our data there are not many unretirements, and other data suggest the

same thing.

     The effect of the earnings test after the 65th birthday is to provide a

strong incentive to retire, or at least to earn less than $1680 per year.**

    *See Boskin and Hurd [1978], for example.

    **There is a complication in the earnings test because there is also a
monthly test: benefits may not be reduced in a month in which earnings are
less than $140 even though earnings are high in the other months. If there
were jobs with high earnings that could be started and stopped at will, this
could cause bunching of earnings by month. We assume that there are sub-
stantial costs in changing jobs, which eliminates this kind of behavior, and
our data seem to be consistent with this view. Gordon and Blinder [1980]
also report a substantial drop in wages accompanying job changes in this
age group.
                                      11




     Over the period of our data the law on the calculation of the PTA from

AME was changed a number of times. These changes had the effect of increasing

benefit levels considerably faster than the rate of inflation. We view these

changes as causing exogenous changes in the value of Social Security to someone

of retirement age, and we give evidence below that these changes in Social

Security benefits are at least partly responsible for the decline in labor

force participation of the elderly. That this conclusion is plausible may be

seen from the magnitudes of the increases in Social Security benefits: between

February, 1968 and January, 1976, the maximum benefit possible increased by

133%, yet the CPI increased over this period by about 54%. Most importantly

for our study, the changes were concentrated in the early part of the l97Os:

in 1969 the average benefits of a retired worker and wife were 169 in 1969 dollars;

in 1972 that figures was 239, again in 1969 dollars, an increase of 41%.

     We do not want to conduct here a full-scale discussion of the effect of the

Social Security system on retirement in the steady-state. Rather we want to

take what is possibly an extreme view, and ask if there is any effect on early

retirement if the actuarial reduction is fair and the system does not cause

any net transfers among individuals. Under these assumptions the system should

not have any effect on retirements before the age of 65: each invididual has

the same lifetime resources, and so he will want to consume the same amount of

leisure including retirement years. Furthermore, the age of retirement can be

chosen independently of the age at which benefits can be drawn provided the

individual has private assets that can be consumed in substitution for his future
                         *
Social Security benefits. Why do there seem to be extra retirements at
age 62 if the foregoing is true? Even under actuarially fair reduction


     *
      In consonance with the literature we call future Social Security benefits
(or wealth) the present value of the lifetime benefits that could be drawn were
the worker to retire.
                                       12



the Social Security system may have an effect on retirement if, in response to

the system, some people choose not to accumulate private savings. Suppose, for

example, in an actuarially fair system the required rate of saving is so high that

some workers find they accumulate more in Social Security savings than they wish

in total savings. Their response is to reduce private savings to zero, and, if

there is a capital market in which they can borrow against future Social Security

benefits, retire at the age dictated by their lifetime wealth.   If that age were

before the age of entitlement under Social Security, their consumption could be

financed by borrowing.   In the absence of such a capital market, however, people

must retire to draw on their Social Security wealth. Because the consumption

of Social Security wealth is tied to the consumption of leisure, the Social

Security system will have an effect on retirement of people who have been forced

to oversave. A prediction is that people who have a high level of Social

Security wealth relative to their total wealth will not retire before age 62,

and will retire at 62 compared to people with the same total wealth but with

a mix towards private wealth. We call this the liquidity constraint effect.

     The short-term effects of a change in the Social Security law such as

those of the early 1970's are more clear. Benefits were increased by Congressional

action faster than the rate of inflation. It is not unreasonable to assume

that these were unanticipated transfers that increased the wealth of the

elderly. As long as leisure is a normal good the increases would act to

induce retirement.

    The main point of the analysis of the law is to show that if the reduction

is actuarially fair, the earnings test does not have to be taken into account in

the estimation of the effects of the Social Security system on retirement. Further

points are: to the extent that earnings affect future Social Security benefits, the
                                      13




gross wage needs to be adjusted to account for that effect; the liquidity

constraint hypothesis suggests that the dependence of retirement on Social Security

benefits is not a simple linear dependence but, at a minimum, should include

an interaction between benefits and other assets; the effect of Social Security

on retirement should vary with age.

     Finally, it is clear that to obtain a complete empirical understanding of the

effects of Social Security on retirement, a study should carefully distinguish

the steady state from the transitory. With the available data this is not at

all easy to do, and we do not attempt that here. Our goal here is to show

that the changes in the law in the early 19701s seem to have had an effect

III. Empirical Evidence of the Effect of Social Security on Retirement

          We do not believe that the state of research on the effect of Social

Security on retirement is advanced enough that we should be dogmatic about the

specification of estimating equations. Rather our aim will be to present a wide

range of evidence from simple conditional probabilities to logistic probability

functions. We believe that at a minimum the data show convincingly that there

was some effect of Social Security on retirement; at a maximum if one has

confidence in the magnitudes of our estimates they provide a good explanation

of the decline in labor force participation of the elderly.

     Our data come from the 1969, 1971 and 1973 waves of the Longitudinal

Retirement History Survey (RHS) and from Social Security earnings history

data that were merged with the RHS data. We have substantially complete

information on asset holdings, wage rates, work patterns, family structure,

and other usual economic and demographic variables over these years. Most

importantly, from Social Security earnings records we can calculate the

retirement benefits that a worker would receive were he to retire. If we

understand the Social Security law correctly we can calculate the benefits

with complete accuracy.

     Our basic working data set consists of all white married men who were

working at the beginning of our sample period as salaried employees in the

private sector.*



     *Information on the calculation of the important variables and a complete
description of the sample selection criteria are given in the Appendix.
                                         15



     Before we turn to the data on retirement, we present some evidence that

the liquidity constraint hypothesis may have support in the data. As outlined

in the Appendix we calculated net assets, housing wealth and Social Security

wealth, which is the present value of expected Social Security benefits were

the worker to retire. Of 61 year old workers, 22% had total assets, including

housing but excluding Social Security wealth, of less than $12,000 in 1969

dollars.     If housing wealth (because it may not be very liquid) is excluded,

22% had less than $3,000. About 9% had essentially no nonhousing assets,

yet 31% of this group had more than $20,000 in Social Security wealth.

These examples, taken from more extensive tables we report elsewhere, suggest

that there are many people near the end of their work lives who have accumulated

almost no private wealth. Whether this is in response to the savings required

by the Social Security system or the result of negative ex post rates of

return on investments cannot be determined in the data; but it is still true

that increases in Social Security wealth could not induce retirement before

age 62 in this group. We conclude that the distribution of assets certainly

increases the plausibility of the liquidity constraint hypothesis.

      To study retirement the data were divided into six subsets. Each subset

 is used to estimate the probability that a person retires at a particular

 age given that he has not previously retired. Thus, for example, the age 62

 data set consists of all workers who reach their 62nd birthday without having

 retired. All the estimates presented in this paper are conditional

 probabilities of retiring.

      We define retirement simply to occur when someone leaves the labor

 force and does not reenter by the end of our sample period.* We found very


      *Other definitions in this data set are possible: for example, people
 who left the LF were asked if they were retired. We chose the behavioral
 definition because of considerable ambiguity in many of the answers to that
 question.
                                     16




little evidence of unretirement even though in some cases we have a period

of observation of more than five years in which to observe reentry.* This

is, of course, not absolutely certain: it is possible that some workers

leave the labor force and reenter after a long period out of the labor force.

There are, however, a number of theoretical and empirical reasons for believing

this does not happen often: the Social Security system itself makes this kind of

behavior unattractive; job skills are bound to deteriorate, and reentry

wages suffer. On the empirical side in addition to our calculations on

labor force reentry, are data reported by Hall [1980] on job tenure. These

data which come from special labor force reports of the Bureau of Labor

Statistics indicate that very few workers above the age of 60 hold new jobs.

Since the fraction that drops out of the labor force for more than a year

and then reenters to hold a job would be very much smaller than this

fraction, the number of unretirements must be very small indeed. Finally,

Gordon and Blinder [1980] report that there is a substantial decline in

the wage rate associated with job changes at the ages we study. This would

induce workers either to remain at their job or to retire. They conclude

that the typical worker will work full time until he nears retirement and

then withdraw completely from the labor force.


     *In addition we were conservative in guarding against end effects.
For example, the last vintage that was used in calculating the retirement
probabilities at 62 was vintage 5, which is comprised of workers aged 59
on January 1, 1969. All of this vintage was 63 on January 1, 1973, and since
the survey was in the Spring of 1973, we can be sure that anyone who enters
the calculations of the age 62 retirement probability was observed during his
entire 62nd year. Anyone who was classified as retired would have had on
average, about a year of no job holding or job search activity. Of course,
anyone who left the labor force at age 62, and reentered before the survey in
the Spring of 1973 would not have been counted as retired; but in our data there
are very few such cases. It is possible that this upper truncation could account
for part of the apparently rising retirement probabilities; but if the evidence
from the vintages that are observed for long periods provides a reliable
indication of the effect, it is small.
                                        17




     In Graph 2 we present the simple conditional retirement probabilities

at each age. They are calculated by dividing the number of workers who

reach a certain age without retiring by the number who retire at that age.

The striking feature of the graph is that the conditional retirement proba-

bilities increase smoothly from age 59 through age 66 except for sharp jumps

age 62 and 65. At age 65 there are a number of reasons why there should be

a high frequency of retirement: some workers face mandatory retirement;

workers may become eligible for private pensions; and the actuarial reduction

is certainly not fair. At age 62 there are no institutional reasons of any

serious empirical magnitude except for Social Security to explain why the retirement

rate is about 50% higher than what would be expected by a straight line

interpolation between ages 61 and 63. These data do not tell us of course

what features of the Social Security system cause the extra retirements, hut we believ

they give strong support to the view that there is some effect.

     In Table 3 we give by vintage the same kind of conditional probabilities.

Since we have a panal data set workers will reach a certain retirement age in

different calendar years according to their year of birth. Classifying by

vintage is therefore a way of finding the way the conditional retirement

probabilities have varied through time. Vintage is defined according to

age on January 1 ,   1969.   Vintage 1, those who were 63 on that date is the

oldest vintage; vintage 7, those who were 57 on that data is the youngest

vintage. The table also reports the estimated standard errors of the

estimated probabilities. Typically the estimates are based on about 200

observations.

     Holding vintage constant and reading across the table, one generally

finds the pattern of graph 2: rising probabilities until 62, then a

decline or at least not a rise at age 63.     If one reads the table from

 bottom to top, however, one finds the pure time trend in retirement proba-

 bilities at each age. For example, the workers of vintage 2, who would have

 been 62 for at least part of 1969 retired with a probability of .05 at age

62 whereas workers of vintage 5, who would have been 62 for part of 1972

retired at age 62 with probability .19. These are very large changes in

retirement probabilities over just a few years, and the detail from this

table shows that the decline in labor force participation of 60-64 year

olds reported in the introduction is due to changes in retirement probabilities at

all ages. What could have caused the large changes? At this point the answer is

purely speculative; but the large changes in Social Security benefits were

concentrated on the years spanned by this table. Roughly speaking, from the

bottom entry in a column to the top entry spans the calendar years of 1969 to

1972, precisely the years when Social Security benefits changed most rapidly.

     Our next step was to ask whether the workers with high potential levels of

Social Security benefits were those who tended to retire most frequently. To

answer this question and to make the comparison with other assets we constructed

each worker's 1969 Social Security wealth, the present value of the Social Security

both the worker and his family would receive were the worker to retire in 1969.

We assumed he would live to his life expectancy and his widow to hers.   We discounted

at 6%.* A cross-tabulation of retirement by five categories of Social Security

wealth, six categories of private assets in 1969 and seven vintages was made.

The assets are net assets including housing wealth but excluding Social Security

wealth. Details are given in the Appendix. From the cross-tabulations, all cases

in which there were at least 10 observations on two levels of Social Security

wealth holding constant the other variables are reported in Table 4 By

comparing adjacent rows one can see the difference in retirement frequencies


     *Since the discount factor is just multiplicative to Social Security benefits, a
different discount factor would change the mqnitçide ut not the sign of the
effects. The change in magnitude from changing the discount tactor
is easily calculable.

                                       22




 as the value of Social Security wealth changes holding constant asset category

 and vintage. For example, the conditional probability of retirement at age 62

 was 0.09 for workers of vintage 5, assets of 10-25 thousand and Social Security

wealth of 15-20 thousand; the conditional probability of retirement of workers

 of the same vintage and asset category but with Social Security wealth of 20-25

thousand was 0.29. The results in this table are rather remarkable because

high Social Security wealth is almost always associated with high retirement

probabilities except at age 61 when assets are low, and in several cases at

age 64 when there are very few observations and the standard errors are high.

The discussion of the Social Security law indicated why at ages before 62 increases

in Social Security benefits would not cause a change in retirement probabilities

among workers with low other assets. If we exclude the three comparisons at

age 61 in the first asset category on the grounds that these workers had low

private assets (the median asset holding among all workers at that age was about

60 thousand) we can make 21 comparisons. Of these 17 have higher retirement proba-

bilities associated with increased Social Security wealth. Of the four with the

reverse sign, two (those at age 64) have very large standard errors (entry at

vintage 2, Social Security wealth of 20-25 thousand has a standard error of

about 0.12, for example).

     Because the cross-tabulation is by wealth and Social Security wealth in

1969 and by vintage, the row comparisons are cross-section comparisons.

Roughly they indicate differences in retirement probabilities when people are

classified according to initial wealth and they are observed through time.

But since our comparison is over people who have not retired, and the changes in

the law were changes raising benefits of everyone to preserve rankings in the

distribution of benefits a row comparison is probably a good comparison over

ranking of benefits in the year of retirement. Some comparison of the trend

in probabilities can be seen by comparing probabilities across vintage holding
                                         23




 Social Security wealth constant. For example, at retirement age 62 and assets of

 10-25 thousand the probabilities in the 20-25,000 Social Security wealth category

 increased from .0 to .29 as vintage increased from 2 to 5. Because vintage 2

reached age 62 in 1968 and vintage 5 reached age 62 in 1971, the latter vintages

actually had considerable higher Social Security wealth than indicated in the

table due to the increases in benefits from changes in the law.

     It is difficult to find any systematic relationship between asset levels

in 1969 and subsequent retirement. Simple theory would suggest cetpar.

a positive relationship: if assets are exogenous they will be used at least

partly to purchase leisure; if assets are endogenous, people who plan early

retirement will accumulate at high levels to finance the retirement. Of

course, in these tables everything else is not held constant: in particular

there is no control for the wage rate, which is correlated with assets.

     More extensive cross tabulations are not practical so we estimated

conditional probability of retirement equations, which, within our functional

form, allow us to account for many more variables than in the cross tabulations.

In particular the probability equations were made to depend on an adjusted

wage rate, private assets, Social Security wealth, vintage, health status and

interactions among these variables. At one extreme, these equations may be

viewed as pure data description, a more complicated, specific functional form

version of the cross tabulations. At the other, one may interpret them as

giving estimates of behavioral parameters. Since we have not constructed a

complete life-cycle model of retirement choice and savings behavior, we feel

uncomfortable at the latter extreme. Nevertheless, we view a substantial part

of the variation in Social Security wealth to be unexpected asset transfer,

and, therefore, we are more willing to give a behavioral interpretation to

the Social Security wealth parameters.
                                     24




      We estimated conditional probability of retirement equations for each

 of the ages 59 through 65 inclusive. The wage rate is adjusted to take into

account the effect working has on eventual benefits. As we mentioned in the

discussion of the Social Security law, an additional year's work allows a year of

zero earnings to be dropped in the calculation of the average monthly wage.

The apparent return to work, the actual wage, is, therefore, less than the

true return, which includes the present value of the increased PTA. We

calculated this difference and treated it as a wage subsidy. The asset

variable is a categorical variable which indicates in which quartile of the asset

distribution the observation lies. Social Security wealth is the present value of

Social Security benefits the worker and his wife would receive were the worker

to retire, and both the worker and his wife live for their life expectancies.

Discounting was at 6%. In some cases the wife's benefit on her own earnings

history is larger than her benefit as a wife and in that case her worker's

benefit was used in the calculations. Health status takes the value one

if the person's health was judged by him to be worse than average in 1969,

and zero otherwise. Because everyone in the sample was at work when the

question was asked, the response is free from the most obvious kind of

expst bias.

     Both linear and logistic probability equations of varying degrees of

generality were estimated. The most general had categorical variables like

the asset variables for both Social Security wealth and wages and interactions

between the variables; but the specification was too general to admit interpre-

tation. The results from a slightly less general logistic specification are

reported in Table 5. The specification does allow the variation of probabilities

with assets to be nonlinear, and the variation with Social Security wealth and with

 wage to be different for each asset category. There is also an interaction

 between Social Security wealth and wage. It is not particularly interesting to

 give the results for other more restrictive
                                                 specifications because the important

 conclusions were very robust to variation in the function form.

      Because of the interactions and because this is a logistic function,

 the interpretation of the results directly from the table is not straightforward.
 In Table 6 we give the change in retirement
                                                 probabilities associated with a
 $10,000 change in Social Security wealth, where the wage interaction is evaluated

 at the median of the wage in each group. The point estimate of the change

 In the estimate, P was taken to be the observed frequency.

     The results of Table 6 are remarkably consistent with the cross tabulations:

when assets are low before the age of 62, Social Security wealth does not have a

positive association with retirement probabilities; of the other 20 entries all

but three are positive. Although standard errors were not calculated for the

entries it is apparent from Table 5 that most of them would be fairly large.

It is also apparent from Table 5 that a number of the individual entries are

significant. We will discuss below a formal test in a more restrictive model.

If these results are interpreted as giving changes in retirement probabilities

from an unexpected change in Social Security wealth, they are in very close

agreement with the two main predictions made in Section II: that Social

Security wealth would have a positive effect on retirement; that people younger

than 62 with low assets would be little affected by changes in Social Security

wealth. One result that was not predicted by the theory, but which comes out

quite strongly in these results is that until the age of 65 workers with low

private assets are not strongly affected by changes in Social Security wealth. For

Notes: 1. The wealth categories are the quartiles at each age
        2. The changes include the wage interaction evaluated at the
              medians.
          3. The changes are calculated on the linear approximation as
              p(l-p) . (logit coefficient) where p is the observed probability.
          4. The entry at wealth=2 and age=64 gives an estimated probability
              of -.091 when the linear approximation is used. The number in
              parentheses gives the change when the logit function is used.
              The second number is used in calculating the average.

example, the average change in probability before the age of 65 over the

two lower wealth groups was just .005 whereas the average over the two higher

wealth groups was .049. This difference will show up in a more illuminating

way later when we analyze the implied effects on labor force participation.

     In the cross tabulation very little variation of retirement with assets

was discovered. In the interactive specification some was found although

the evidence is far from overwhelming. In Table 7 we report those effects

evaluating the interaction at the medians.* They indicate how retirement

probabilities were found to vary by asset quartile, taking into account the

variation by Social Security wealth, the wage and the other variables of Table

5. Probably the only mildly consistent finding is that workers in the

highest quartile retire more frequently than other workers, but there

are a number of exceptions.

     The wage also appears interacted with other variables in Table 5;

its association with retirement probabilities is not immediately obvious.

When the interactions are evaluated at the medians, we find that there is

very little systematic variation of the wage with probabilities, and certainly

no pattern in them with respect to wealth. Again, if these results are

interpreted as giving how individuals would react to a change in their wage

rates, there is no evidence of much effect in our results.



     *These results are for a linear probability specification; but the
results in the logit specification were so similar it was superfluous to
make the extra calculations to convert the logit coefficients to probabilities.

     The effects of health status in 1969 are all in the direction that one

would expect except for the entry at age 65. Because the variable refers to

status in 1969 in some cases the status is several years before the retirement

age. That is particularly the case for retirement at age 65: anyone who is

found in that data set could have been no older than 63 in 1969, and, therefore,

at a minimum two years would have passed since the health questions had been

asked. In Table 8 we have translated the logistic health coefficients into

probability changes using the logistic function itself rather than the point

derivative because the coefficients are so large.* It may be seen that the

effects of bad health are strong at all ages.** There is a dip at age 61 because

people in bad health postpone retirement until they are able to draw Social Se-

curity benefits at age 62. Of course the effects cumulate on labor force par-

ticipation until by the 65th birthday the labor force participation rate of people

who were in the labor force at their 59th birthday but in bad health is estimated

to be .298 whereas for healthy workers it is estimated to be .601.

     Mandatory retirement at age 65 operates very strongly to cause complete

retirement: the probability of retirement at age 65 rises from .445 to .889

when the worker has a job with mandatory retirement at age 65.



     *Specjfjcally we calculate t such that                =          where p0 is the observed
                                                                 l—

    **We have included here results for 59 year olds. The basic logistic
probability function was estimated for them, but we generally have not reported
them because the retirement probabilities are so low: .023. But the health
effect is so strong we thought it would be interesting here.

     A variable indicating the age of the wife was included in the probability

equations because the fairness of the actuarial reduction depends on the age

of the wife through the life expectancy of the widow. This is especially

true if the wife is 65 or over because she cannot draw benefits unless the

husband is retired; yet, she receives a wife's benefit of half the husband's

NA regardless of when she starts to draw benefits. Thus, there is not even

the 1% delayed retirement credit that a worker receives for retirement after

the 65th birthday. If the wife draws benefits before she is age 65 her

benefits are reduced at a slightly higher rate (25/36 per cent for each month

of early benefits) than the rate of reduction for a worker (5/9 of a percent).

The results in Table 5 do not show any systematic variation in the retirement

probabilities with the wife's age.

     The other set of variables that appears in Table 5 is the vintage variables.

The normalization in each case is on the youngest vintage for which there are

observations; except at age 60, the trend is toward higher probabilities of

retirement. This is, of course, a finding that takes into account within the

functional form the growing size of Social Security wealth. It is, of course,

possible that we have underestimated the size of the effect of Social Security

on retirement: part of the effect of the growing Social Security wealth would

be attributed to vintage. If the vintage coefficients are translated into proba-

bilities, they show less variation than the vintage effects that can be deduced

from the probabilities of Table 3. Thus some of the trend in probabilities that

appeared in Table 3 by scanning up the columns has been accounted for by the

variables that appear in the logistic function. Probably the most important of

these variables is Social Security wealth. We make two conclusions from the

vintage variables: first, the substantial collinearity between Social Security
                                       34



 wealth and vintage requires that vintage should be taken into account when

 estimating the effects of Social Security on retirement; second, even though

 increasing Social Security benefits may be partly responsible for the trend

 toward early retirement, there is a residual trend that should be the subject

 of further investigation.

      We have not emphasized hypothesis testing in this paper because we do

 not feel the state of research is far enough advanced. In particular there

are many issues to be resolved such as the proper formulation of the life cycle

problem that will lead to econometrically tractable estimating equations, the

treatment of uncertainty, implicit taxes under the Social Security benefit schedule,

and so forth. However, as we indicated earlier, some of the coefficients in the

results of Table 5 are signficant. As a more formal test of the null hypothesis

that Social Security has no influence on retirement probabilities, we tested the null

hypotheis that there is no influence at any age against the one-sided alter-

native that there is some positive influence at least at one age. We made this

test with a more restrictive version of the logistic function than what is

reported in Table 5 because the interactions make this kind of test statistic

very difficult to calculate. In the restricted model there were no interactions

between variables. As a description of the average effects of Social Security,

the restricted model gives generally the same picture as the formulation with

interactions: the influence of Social Security was estimated to be positive at all

ages except 64; the average effect of $10,000 of Social Security wealth was abcut

.02 in proability against an average of about .03 in the model with interactions.

One of the coefficients was itself significant at the 5% level. For a test

of the null hypothesis of no effect at any age we calculated a one-sided

chi—square statistic. Our test statistic has a value of 9.29; under the

null hypothesis our test statistic would exceed this value about .036 of the
                                       35




 time by chance, and, therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis at the

 usual 5% level. More details of this test are given in the Appendix.

     We consider the results of Table 5 and the ihterpretations derived from

that table to be our main results. However, there are a number of other ways to

calculate the effects of Social Security on retirement from the data. We report

now the results of several of these calculations, mainly to show that in these

data there is a positive relationship between retirement behavior and Social

Security wealth which comes out almost independently of the statistical specifi-

cation.

     Using observations on individuals we estimated both logistic and linear

probability models. The specifications all had the same explanatory variables,

but the functional form in which the variables entered differed. A summary of

the effects of Social Security for four specifications in a linear model is

given in Table 9. The general impression is that the estimates are very stable

with respect to the functional forms given here. The only large difference is at

age 64 when an interaction with the wealth category    variables is included.

This is caused by a very large (- .28) effect of an increase in Social Security

wealth of $10,000 on the retirement probability of people in the second wealth

category. A comparison with the logistic specification shows that the linear

irobability specification produces smaller estimated effects, which is to be

expected on theoretical grounds.

     Another way to find rough estimates of the effects of Social Security on

retirement is to use the observed frequeiicis in Table 3 as estimates of the

probabilities at each age by vintage. The regression of these frequencies

on the means of Social Security wealth, assets, wage, health, age of wife,

and dummies for age of retirement, and vintage was calculated. It was

estimated that a $10,000 increase in Social Security wealth would cause an

Notes: In all cases wealth is represented by four categorical variables

        indicates an interaction. The probabilities are averaged over wealth
        groups and evaluated at the median wages.

increase of .12 in the conditional probability of retirement averaged over

the ages 59-65 inclusive. This is substantially larger than the estimates

in Table 6, which average about .03.

     Finally, the results in Table 6 give the probability changes when the

slope of the logistic function is evaluated at the observed frequency, and

the slope at that point is used to estimate the probability change. An

alternative method when the change in the right-hand variable is large is to

estimate the probability for the new value of the right-hand variable from

the logistic function, and subtract from that the initial frequency. Because

the starting frequencies are small except for 65 year olds, this method will

increase the estimated probability changes associated with a change in Social

Security wealth of $10,000. In fact, the average change in conditional probability

is estimated to be .070 by this method. This compares with an average taken

from Table 6 of .032.

V.      Induced Retirement and Labor Force Participation

             If we continue to interpret the results of Tables 5 and 6 as changes in re-

tirement probabilities caused by a change in Social Security wealth, we can ask how

would labor force participation of the elderly change when Social Security benefits

change as they did during the early 1970's. Under the assumption that no one reenters

the labor force once he has retired, the conditional probabilities of retire-

ment can be used to calculate the labor force participation rates by age of

people who were working at age 59. Graph 3 gives the participation rates

at age j calculated according to                 .
                                                     . (l-p)   where the p. are the

observed frequencies of retirement conditional on working until the ith age.

The changes in conditional probabilities for a change in Social Security wealth are

taken from Table 6, and added to the observed frequencies. These new conditional

probabilities produce the lower labor force participation rates shown in the

graph. The average decline in participation of 60-64 year olds is about .078.

This decline can be compared to the actual declines in participation that occur

during the early 1970's as follows: Taking the base date as February 1968,

the law was changed several times to increase benefits given work history.

By September 1972, the increases totaled 52%. Someone contemplating retirement

in 1973 would, therefore, have benefits about 52% higher than a comparable person

in l968.* The median Social Security wealth in our sample in 1969 was about 25,000

(real 1969), and a 52% change would be 13,000. This is a nominal change which

is 10,726 in 1969 dollars. According to our probability of retirement

equations a 10,000 real change produces a .078 decline in participation, so

a 10,726 change would produce a .084 decline (ignoring second order effects).

The actual participation rates were 77.3% in 1968 and 69.1% in 1973, a decline

of 8.2%!** We see, therefore, that the estimated effects of Social Security on

retirement probabilities are very close to the actual declines in participation

during the period of study. Because the comparison on changes in labor force

participation is made with independent data, we feel it lends support to the

interpretation that a substantial part of the variation in Social Security

wealth is the result of unexpected changes caused by legislation, and that

therefore, the interpretation of the changes in conditional probabilities

as partial regression effects is reasonable.

V.   Conclusion


     It is only a slight exaggeration to say that in any way the data were

analyzed we found a positive association between retirement probabilities and

Social Security wealth. When probability equations were specified to allow numeri-

cal magnitudes to be estimated for this association, the sizes of the effects

were found to be reasonable in the sense that the observed changes in labor

force participation taken from an independent data source were consistent with

the observed changes in Social Security benefits and the estimated effects of

changes in Social Security benefits.

     Although we believe our results show convincingly that there was an

effect on retirement from the large changes in benefits in the early 1970's,

we readily acknowledge that much needs to be done to understand the complete effects

of a Social Security system. In particular, we have not distinguished in this work

between transitory effects caused by changes in the system and long-run

effects which would remain if the system were to remain unchanged for a long

period. We did not attempt to estimate separately the effects for several

reasons.    First, our data were not well suited for this because all of the

observations were subject to the large changes in benefits. As the later years

of the RHS are made available for analysis, it may become possible to do this

because in later years the changes in benefit levels were made to depend on

the CPI rather than on Congressional action. Even so, within a life cycle

context, the transition from the shocks of the early 1970's to the steady

state may take more years than the RHS will cover. The second major reason

our results cannot distinguish between the long run and the short run is that

we have not constructed a complete life-cycle model of asset accumulation and

labor supply. In particular, we have not taken into account that a1 least in
                                      42




the steady state, assets, Social Security wealth and the wage may be econometrically

endogenous, which will produce formidable statistical difficulties. We believe that

by taking advantage of what was essentially an experiment on the retirement—age

population these difficulties are lessened. At a minimum we would claim that

changes in benefits have some effect on retirement.

     An implication to be drawn from these results is that if the law

on benefits calculation is changed, the costs of the law change will not be

simply the direct costs of the change in benefits over the retired population.

Rather there will be induced retirement in addition, and that will have to

be taken into account to forecast accurately the effects of a law change.

                                 Appendix



A. Sample Selection

     The basic working sample consisted of white, married males. They must

have satisfied the following criteria: private wage worker in 1969 or at

last job if not employed; a calculable wage rate in 1968 or 1969; a non-working

wife; not a welfare recipient in 1969; a wage rate between $1 and $35; net

wealth between $-5000 and $1,000,000; survived until the 1973 survey.



B. Calculation of Important Variables

     1. Net wealth.

     Data were reported on every important category of assets and liabilities.

For example, we have the individual's estimate of his house value, his stock

value, savings accounts, bonds and so forth. There are corresponding entries

on the liability side. The major uncertainties are insurance and private pensions:

the former is reported with ambiguity and the latter is known only with

considerable uncertainty by many respondents. We decided to ignore insurance,

which will be an error for those who hold some kinds of insurance. Pensions

were reported to be a monthly payment which we converted to a wealth stock

by discounting at 6% expected payments until death.

     2.   Social Security (SS) wealth.

     Under the Social Security law benefits are usually calculated from earnings

since 1950; however, in some circumstances earnings before 1950 may be used.

The wife's benefits is 50% of the husband's PIA but in some circumstances her

benefit on her own contribution would be greater than her wife's benefit. The

law allows the maximums always to be taken. Our calculation of SS wealth finds

the benefits of the husband and of the wife taking into account
                                          44




these provisions. We can do this accurately because we have data on contribu-

tion of both the husband and wife. The present value of SS, which is what we

call SS wealth, is the present value of the future benefit payments to the

husband, and the wife (and later to the widow if she outlives the husband)

discounted at 6%. Each is assumed to live to his life expectancy. The

benefits are calculated according to the law in effect at the time of the

calculation. The value of SS wealth varies as a worker ages for several

reasons: his earnings change; the law may change; his life expectancy changes;

the wife's life expectancy changes. We therefore, calculate his SS wealth

each year from 1969 through 1973, and the value that enters the probability of

retirement at a given age will be the value faced at that age.


     3. The wage rate.

     The two main problems in calculating the wage rate are that there is no

standard time interval over which earnings are reported, and that earnings increase

the value of Social Security wealth through the recalculation of AME and PIA.

The first problem was not empirically important but it did cause us to drop

some observations from the sample when we were unable to calculate an hourly wage.

The second problem was handled by converting the increase in Social Security wealth

into a wage subsidy. This was done by calculating what Social Security wealth would

be if the person were to work another year. The difference between that value and the

actual value of Social Security wealth was converted into a wage subsidy by assuming

he works during the coming year the number of hours he worked the past year.


B. The One-Sided Test

     Because the one-sided x2   test   is not found in empirical literature, we

outline its derivation and calculation. It is a generalization of the one-sided
                                                      45




t test, and it is used when the null hypothesis is that a number of coeffi-

cients are zero against the alternative that at least one coefficient is

positive. The conventional F test (or two-sided x2 test in large samples)

is appropriate when the alternative is that at least one coefficient is not

zero. We use the one-sided x2 test because the one-sided alternative is

appropriate: most people, we believe, would agree that the effect of

Social Security wealth on retirement is not negative.

     Suppose that y, i=l,...,n are independent N(p,l) random variables and

consider the statistic Q =             4 + •..+ z         where 4
                                                                     =              >   0 and 4 = 0

otherwise. Under H0, p.1 =             0.    Under H0, P(Q>q) =          P(Q>qy1,. ..   ,y   are negative).

                                                                 =                           2P(y1>) =
P(Q>qy1>0, y2,... ,y negative) =                P(y>qy1>0)           P(y1>jy1>0)
              + P(y1>      =
                               P(y>q).        But under H0, y hasthe 2(l) distribution.

                                            l/2, so the first term is               (l.P(x2(l)>q))
P(y1>0, 2'"'n negative)=                                                        2



where P(x2(t)>q) means the probability that a x2 with t degrees of freedom is

greater than q. The first n ternsin P(Q>q) are the same and sum to

L   1 '   1   1    P(2(l )>q) =               P(2(l )>q).


     The next set of terms arises when two of the y's are positive. For
                                                                            +
example P(Q>qy1>0, y2>0, y3,... ,y negative) =                       P(y        y>qy1>0,     y2>O). Since

each conditional random variable is 2(l) and they are independent, their sum


is x2(2). There are 2._fl!2)i terms in this set and they sum to

                 P(x2(2)>q). By similar reasoning it may be seen that P(Q>q) =



                      P(x2(i)>q).
    j i!(n-i)!


        Although we have not investigated the power of this test in general, it

is easy to see that it is more powerful than the F test in several extreme

examples. If n = 1, it is the same as the one-sided t test which is more

powerful than the F test. If the p become large so that the probability that

all the Y's are positive becomes large, the probability of rejecting the null

hypothesis is approximately the probability that the noncentral x2(n) is

greater than q. But q is less than the critical point of the F test of the

same size; that is q<c where c is found from P(x2(n)>c) =a and      is the size

of the test. Thus P(Q>q) > P(F>c) when all the p are large and the one-sided

x2 test is more powerful. It would be surprising if the general result is not

true.     In any event it is clear that the F test is not uniformly most powerful.

        Because the one-sided x2 test is almost impossible to calculate in our

general model, we estimated a simpler model which had no interactions between

Social Security wealth and any of the other variables. The estimated coefficients

divided by their estimated standard errors, are given below. We take these to

be i.i.d. N(O,l) under the null hypothesis.

Q   is   the sum of squares of the positive values and is calculated to be 9.29.

                                                6
From the x2 tables it may be found that                 . P(2(i)>9.29)     is
                                               i=l


approximately .036. Thus a 5% critical point would be less than 9.29, and
we can reject the null hypothesis that all the effects are zero in favor of

the alternative that at least one coefficient is positive.

         We make two observations about this test. At the 5% level the coefficient

for age 60 falls in the critical region of the one-sided t test; however, this

is an inappropriate testing procedure (to reject the null hypothesis if any of

the t statistics is greater than 1.645). Under the F test, which is the same

as a two-sided x2 test since the degrees of freedom in the denominators

are large the null hypothesis cannot be rejected: the sum of squares (including

the age 64 coefficient) is 10.1 and the critical point of the x2(6) is 12.59.
