                                          ABSTRACT

We survey 861 finance academics, professionals, and public sector regulators and policy
economists about climate finance topics. They identify regulatory risk as the top climate risk to
businesses and investors over the next five years, but they view physical risks as the top risk over
the next 30 years. By an overwhelming margin, respondents believe that asset prices
underestimate climate risks. We also tabulate opinions about the correlation between growth and
climate change; social discount rates appropriate for projects that mitigate the effects of climate
change; most influential forces for reducing climate risks; and, most important research topics.

1.      Introduction

        The rising appreciation of the risks due to climate change has led to a burst of research in

finance. In addition to this volume, special issues on "climate finance" have appeared, or are in

progress, in at least five other journals.1 Giglio, Kelly, and Stroebel (2021) and Hong, Karolyi, and

Scheinkman (2020) survey this emerging literature. Here, we report the results of a different type

of survey--an anonymous, global survey of select financial economists, finance professionals, and

regulators and economists in public institutions such as central banks.

        What is the value of such a survey? According to climate scientists, time is short to define

research agendas that help us manage the emerging financial and economic risks from climate

change.2 A survey allows researchers to identify areas of agreement and coordinate on promising

directions.

        There was a strong response to our survey request. Despite receiving just one unsolicited

recruitment email with a link to the survey, 861 invited participants completed the survey. The

first notable feature of the survey responses was the relative uniformity of opinion on a range of

important topics. This general commonality in responses extended across professional roles,

geographic regions, degrees of concern about climate change, extent of professional interest in

climate finance, and year of graduation.

        Given the large sample size and consistency of responses across subgroups, we can offer

robust conclusions about respondents' beliefs. We highlight four of them here:

       (i) Respondents are at least 20 times more likely to believe that climate risk is currently

              being underestimated by asset markets as opposed to overestimated.



        1
           These include Finance Research Letters, International Review of Financial Analysis, Management Science,
Review of Financial Studies, and Sustainability.

                                                        2
      (ii) Respondents view regulatory risk as the top climate-related risk for investors and firms

           over the next five years, but consider physical risk the top risk over the next 30 years.

      (iii) Pressure from institutional investors is viewed as the most powerful force for change

           among financial mechanisms. Among non-financial mechanisms, carbon taxes and

           government subsidies are considered the most potent.

      (iv) Most respondents believe that realizations of climate risk are not correlated with

           economic conditions. Those who believe in a correlation were more likely to see

           climate change as associated with good rather than bad economic conditions.

      We also gathered views on other subjects, such as the social discount rate for climate change

mitigation projects and the most important research topics in climate finance going forward. We

contrast the latter with actual research trends. Finally, we note the disagreements across subgroups

on some questions, which are typically second-order and intuitive.

       We hope this survey sheds light on where climate finance is and where respondents believe

it should go in the future. We start by reviewing the survey method and characteristics of the

respondents, proceed to analyze the responses, and then conclude. Please refer to the Internet

Appendix for additional tabulations.



2.     Survey Method and Respondents

       Our goal was to collect views about climate finance from sophisticated researchers and

practitioners around the world. We targeted a reasonably select group of finance academics,

finance industry practitioners, and finance-oriented economists within influential regulatory or

supranational institutions. These groups may consider the same issues from different perspectives,

so both the similarities and differences in their views are interesting.




                                                  3
        Specifically, to reach academics, we collected all available email addresses of professors

of the top 100 finance departments based on research output.3 We included tenure track, adjunct,

and clinical professors, for a total of 3,570 faculty email addresses. To reach practitioners, we used

a sample of 6,921 NYU Stern graduates working in finance.4 To reach those involved in policy,

we identified 17 relevant public-sector institutions and collected 955 emails of researchers or

policymakers working in their finance-related groups.5

        We do not imply that the relative number of email addresses gathered across these groups

reflects the relative importance of their views. One might be concerned that conclusions from the

pooled sample may be tilted toward one or the other group in ways that do not reflect that group's

relative knowledge or influence. For example, it is likely that the collective pressure of financial

professionals is more important in addressing climate change than the role of finance academics.

At a high level, however, our analysis shows that the responses turn out to be rather similar across

most subgroups. The reader may easily compute an equally-weighted average across subgroups of

interest. We present additional breakdowns in an Internet Appendix.6

        We sent a single recruitment email to each potential survey participant, which provided the

link to the Qualtrics online survey. The survey informed respondents that we would collect no



        3
            We used the list maintained at ASU: https://apps.wpcarey.asu.edu/fin-rankings/rankings/results.cfm. The
ranking was based on the total number of articles published from 2010 through 2020 in the Journal of Finance, Journal
of Financial Economics, and Review of Financial Studies.
          4
            These emails were kindly provided by the NYU Stern Alumni Relations office. We requested emails of
Stern MBA graduates that were working in finance and received their degree no more than 30 years ago as well as a
sample of emails of graduates of Stern's undergraduate program that were working in finance and received their degree
between 10 and 30 years ago (the undergraduates were granted ten years to achieve a practical familiarity with the
issues involved).
          5
            We gathered email addresses from a range of institutions that made researcher emails accessible on their
institutional websites. The institutions are Bank of Canada, Bank of England, Bank of Korea, Deutsche Bundesbank,
ECB, the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Minneapolis, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond and
San Francisco, IFC, IMF, Reserve Bank of New Zealand, and World Bank.
          6
            The Internet Appendix also includes results for an additional 158 respondents who were not contacted
directly but instead found the survey via Twitter and LinkedIn postings. This subsample again delivered broadly
similar responses.


                                                         4
personally identifiable information and that it would take five to seven minutes to complete. We

sent the recruitment emails and collected responses in July 2021.

       In total, we received 861 complete responses for an overall response rate of 7.5%. Some

42 respondents, or 4.9% of the pooled sample, did not self-identify their occupation. There were

453 responses from faculty (response rate = 12.7% and share of the pooled sample that self-

identified = 55%). There were 294 responses from practitioners (response rate = 4.2% and share

of the pooled sample that self-identified = 36%); this segment of the sample suffered from a lack

of updated email addresses, but we are not aware of any biases introduced as a result. Finally, there

were 72 responses from financial regulators or public-sector employees (response rate = 7.5% and

share of the pooled sample that self-identified = 9%).

       Overall, and for each of these groups, the response rates compare favorably to those of

other unsolicited surveys, e.g., 9% in the CFO survey of Graham and Harvey (2001), 4.3% in the

institutional investor survey of McCahery, Sautner, and Starks (2016), and less than 5% in the

retail investor survey by Giglio, Maggiori, Stroebel, and Utkus (2021). But any response rate less

than 100% leaves the door open to sample selection bias. In our survey, a bias is obvious:

Respondents are probably more interested in climate finance than nonrespondents. Depending on

the question, this selection bias is not entirely unhelpful, and for most questions, one might prefer

the views of those most informed over those of an overall population. At any rate, to explore

whether such a selection might bias our results, we collect respondents' concerns about climate

change and professional interest in climate finance and examine whether responses differ on these

dimensions.


                                [INSERT TABLE 1 NEAR HERE]




                                                 5
        Table 1 contains summary statistics and cross-tabulations of the demographic information

reported by respondents. As noted above, over half of the sample are faculty, followed by private-

sector professionals. Our respondents' locations tilt toward North America and Europe. The level

of climate concern across roles is similar, with around 69% in each group expressing personal

concern. The rate of concern is highest among those located in Europe. Our survey respondents

align with the general population in this respect.7 Across roles, a majority of participants claim

some professional interest in or connection to "climate finance" (as defined by the respondent),

and this rate is somewhat higher among those located in Europe and Asia. Perhaps unsurprisingly,

those individuals who work on climate finance topics are generally more concerned about climate

change, though causality may go both ways.

        Lastly, our participants appear to skew a bit younger, with many receiving their highest

degree between 2010 and 2021. Respondents of various age ranges expressed about the same splits

in terms of concern about the climate and professional interest in climate finance.



3.      Survey Results

        The survey consisted of five types of questions. We review them in this section.



3.1.    Which climate risks are most important?

        Many commentators and policymakers have made predictions about how climate change

will affect businesses and investors. But climate change involves a set of emerging risks, whereas

empirical academic research usually involves historical data. Therefore, it was natural to begin the



        7
           According to the United Nations Development Programme (2021), 65% of U.S. residents believe in climate
change as a global emergency. For Western Europe and North America, the number is 72%, whereas 63% of Asia-
Pacific residents share this belief. The global average is 64%.


                                                       6
survey with an understanding of what "climate risks" our finance-oriented respondents are most

concerned about.

       Specifically, we asked respondents to rank the relative importance of five types of risks

often expressed in general discussions of climate finance (e.g., Krueger, Sautner, and Starks, 2020;

Climate-Related Market Risk Subcommittee, 2020; Rudebusch, 2021). In addition, given that

climate changes and business responses will evolve over time, we asked respondents to judge the

importance of the various climate risks over both the next five years and the next thirty years.



                           [INSERT TABLE 2 NEAR HERE]



       The results show a widely-held belief that the primary climate risk over the next five years

involves regulatory activity along the transition path to a low-carbon economy. Such transition

risks can include, for example, the risk to various businesses models in the energy and

transportation sectors from increased regulation of carbon emissions. In the pooled sample,

regulatory risk was ranked a full position higher, on average, than the second-most-cited risk. Its

perceived importance as the first-order risk over the coming five years is consistent across all

subgroups. The second most highly ranked short-run risk from climate change, in particular among

private-sector respondents, was identified as stakeholder risk--a risk that includes changing

preferences of employees and customers. As a notable exception, public-sector professionals

already viewed physical risk as the second most important risk in the next five years.

       Over the next 30 years, however, almost all respondents judged physical risks as the most

important--this risk captures the direct risks from rising sea levels, wildfires, and other physical

changes to the planet as a result of climate change. One hopes the prediction is incorrect, but




                                                 7
physical risk was the most-cited long-term climate risk among all subgroups except (predictably)

among those relatively unconcerned about climate change. They continued to view regulatory

interventions to combat climate change as the most important risk to businesses over the thirty-

year horizon.



3.2.    Are asset markets pricing climate risks correctly?

        With some understanding of the nature of climate risks in hand, we turned to the extent to

which they are currently being incorporated into asset prices. Asset markets where climate risks

are often salient include the equities, real estate, and insurance markets. Indeed, a sizable literature

has documented that equity markets, bond markets, real estate markets, and derivatives markets

appear to incorporate climate risk in asset prices.8 However, little research has been done to explore

whether asset prices reflect climate risk to the correct degree--a question that is substantially more

difficult than rejecting the null hypothesis that climate risk is not priced at all. Notable exceptions

include Hong, Li, and Xu (2019), who argue that food stock prices may have underreacted to

droughts, and Shlenker and Taylor (2021), who find that weather derivatives have marched

roughly in alignment with temperature trends over the past two decades.



                                [INSERT TABLE 3 NEAR HERE]



        Our survey reveals a substantial consensus on this question. According to Table 3,

respondents overwhelmingly believed that asset prices do not, at present, sufficiently reflect



8
 See, for example, Baldauf, Garlappi, and Yannelis, 2020; Bernstein, Gustafson, and Lewis, 2020; Bolton and
Kacperczyk, 2021; Choi, Gao, and Jiang, 2020; Engle et al., 2020; Giglio et al., 2021; Goldsmith-Pinkham et al.,
2021; Eichholtz, Steiner, and Yonder, 2019; Ilhan, Sautner, and Vilkov, 2021; Painter, 2020.


                                                         8
climate risks. For example, those who think that stock prices reflect climate risks "not enough"

outnumber those who believe that stock prices reflect climate risks "too much" by a factor of

twenty to one (60:3 in the pooled sample in Table 3)! With respect to real estate, the outnumbering

is sixty-seven to one (67:1), and for insurance, the outnumbering is twenty-one to one (42:2).

Respondents have highly correlated beliefs across settings: Those who believe climate risks are

not sufficiently reflected in equity markets also generally believe they are not sufficiently reflected

in real estate and insurance markets.

       Is this really a consensus or merely an artifact of a sample biased toward those more

concerned about climate change? Pointing toward consensus, this belief is apparent in every

subgroup. Even respondents who have low concern about climate change themselves are far more

likely to believe that asset markets are underpricing the risks of climate change rather than that

they are overpricing them, perhaps consistent with those respondents worrying about potentially

underpriced transition risks due to regulatory interventions. Either the widespread belief that asset

prices and insurance markets insufficiently price climate risk is way off, or these markets have a

lot catching up to do.

       Nevertheless, we observe a number of important differences across groups. Those

individuals with a professional interest in climate finance--in other words, those individuals with

perhaps the most informed views--are even more convinced that asset markets do not yet reflect

climate risks accurately. When comparing across professional roles, private market participants

were 22 percentage points more likely to believe that climate risks were underpriced than

academics (73% of private-sector respondents vs. 51% of academics). In contrast, academic

researchers were more likely to believe these risks to be accurately priced, perhaps a result of a

stronger belief among finance academics in the efficiency of markets.




                                                  9
        What types of risks do individuals believe to be underpriced? Comparing answers of the

same individuals across questions, we find that respondents who think climate risks are not priced

sufficiently in asset markets rank the importance of physical risk substantially higher over both the

five and thirty-year horizons.



3.3.    How should investors and governments discount climate risks?

        We then turn to the normative issue of how current costs of mitigating climate risks should

be traded off against their potentially uncertain future benefits. The degree to which realizations

of climate risks (and, in particular, the physical realizations of climate risk) correlate with

economic conditions is an important input to this calculation for both investors and social planners

since this correlation determines whether such investments should command a positive or a

negative risk premium.

        We first asked respondents whether a hypothetical climate-change mitigation project

would tend to "pay off" in good economic times, bad economic times, or independent of economic

times. This was an effort to get at the covariance between realizations of climate risk and economic

activity and address a fundamental debate in the literature on how to model climate change: As a

tax on consumption which increases with economic growth and the associated carbon emissions

(e.g., as in Nordhaus, 2008); or, as a potentially disastrous event that, once realized, creates a deep

economic downturn (e.g., as in Barro, 2013 and Weitzman, 2012, 2014).9 Giglio et al. (2021)

construct a model that nests both approaches and highlights the implications for discount rates: If



        9
           Other important questions relating to how to incorporate climate change into general equilibrium models
that allow for the pricing of financial assets is which preferences to use and how to incorporate model uncertainty
about the transmission mechanism of economic activity to climate change (see Bansal, Kiku, and Ochoa, 2018;
Barnett, Brock, and Hansen, 2020; Daniel, Litterman, and Wagner, 2019). Giglio, Kelly, and Stroebel (2021)
summarize these issues.


                                                        10
climate change is more costly in good economic times, then investments to mitigate climate change

pay off disproportionately in those times and deserve a positive risk premium. On the other hand,

if investments to mitigate climate change pay of largely in bad economic times, they should be

considered hedges that command a negative risk premium.



                               [INSERT TABLE 4 NEAR HERE]



       As documented in Table 4, respondents were most likely to state that the payoffs for

projects to mitigate climate risks would be independent of economic times. This may reflect beliefs

about the global nature of climate change versus the comparatively local nature of economic

fluctuations or the different horizons at which climate and economic shocks operate. Still,

respondents were three times as likely to believe that mitigation payoffs occur primarily in good

economic times than in bad economic times, more consistent with the Nordhous view. Asian

respondents have a particularly strong belief in this covariance; this may reflect the salient

coincidence of worsening climate and rapid growth in developing Asia in recent decades, and the

substantial contributions of coal-based energy production in Asia to global carbon emissions.

       Interestingly, we find that respondents who are less concerned about climate change per se

(and those that worry more about regulatory than physical climate risks) are more likely to respond

that mitigating climate change will largely pay off in good economic times. This belief is consistent

with those respondents perceiving climate change itself is not problematic enough to be an

independent driver of economic downturns.

       Many governments are now making immediate practical decisions that involve calculating

the present discounted values of investments to mitigate climate risks. We asked our survey




                                                 11
participants to put themselves in policymaking shoes and suggest a single, suitable discount rate

for a hypothetical investment in climate-change mitigation whose benefits would materialize 50

years from now, a horizon for which private market returns are hard to come by.10 "Benefits" was

phrased broadly so as to include all economic and social benefits, including externalities.11 The

median respondent suggested discounting an investment with certain (risk-free) benefits at 4% per

year, and suggested discounting an investment with uncertain (i.e., expected) benefits at 7% per

year. The gap reflects a median risk premium for investments in climate change abatement of 3%,

directionally consistent with the view that economic conditions and climate change are positively

correlated. Implied risk premia for investments in climate mitigation were the largest, at a median

of 4%, for private-sector respondents, and the smallest, at 1%, for public-sector respondents.

Directionally, risk premia were lowest among respondents who believe that investments in climate

mitigation paid off largely in bad times, though even in this group, respondents assigned a positive

risk premium on average.



3.4.     What are the biggest forces for change?

         The next question asked respondents which economic and financial mechanisms are most

promising in moving corporations to reduce their climate risk exposures and carbon footprints. We

inquired about pressures from various financial stakeholders, including banks and creditors,

individual investors, and institutional investors; non-financial stakeholders, including customers



         10
              A recent exception is Giglio, Maggiori, and Stroebel (2015), who calculate discount rates in the housing
market over hundreds of years. See Gollier (2002), Gollier and Weitzman (2012), Dietz, Gollier, and Kessler (2018),
Giglio et al. (2021) and Lemoine (2020) for additional discussions on discount rates in the context of climate change
mitigation.
           11
              In light of the various respondent types, the reader can see that our questions had to balance simplicity with
sophistication. For example, our request for a static rate prohibited the ability to suggest a stochastic rate or one that
falls as the horizon lengthens. On the latter points, our request boils down to asking for a point estimate of a discount
rate for a "lump sum" net benefit realized 50 years from now.


                                                            12
and employees; and policy mechanisms, including carbon taxes (and emissions trading systems

which tax companies for exceeding limits), various government subsidies, or financial or non-

financial regulation.



                                     [INSERT TABLE 5 NEAR HERE]



         Table 5 indicates that the pooled sample viewed carbon taxes and institutional investors as

the two most important forces for change, with government subsidies and pressures from

customers not far behind.12 Europeans, with the most extensive systems for pricing carbon, had

the strongest belief in carbon taxes; across roles, faculty and public-sector policymakers and

economists are the strongest supporters. Private-sector respondents are more skeptical of relatively

hypothetical policies or mechanisms. They viewed institutional investors and customers, whose

pressures they already face, as the two most important forces for change.13 Despite C-suite rhetoric,

not one respondent was optimistic that voluntary behavior by corporations (including, or

especially, private sector respondents) would be a significant force; at the same time, no

respondent was pessimistic enough to view meaningful change as impossible.

         Among regulatory mechanisms, academics and public sector respondents viewed non-

financial regulation as the more powerful tool, while our financial market respondents believed

financial regulation to be more effective, perhaps because those respondents are already seeing the



         12
            A mechanism here could be institutional investor preferences or catering to sentiment that reduces the cost
of capital for firms and governments pursuing green projects. See Baker, Bergstresser, Serafeim and Wurgler (2022)
for evidence from green bonds, and Pastor, Stambaugh, and Taylor (2021) and Pedersen, Fitzgibbons, Pomorski
(2021) on the stock market. See Flammer (2021) for negative evidence from corporate green bonds. Another direct
mechanism would be institutional shareholder engagement, as in Azar, Duro, Kadach, and Ormazabal (2021).
         13
             Krueger, Sautner, and Starks (2020) survey institutional investors about their approaches to managing
climate risk, and document that many of these investors regularly engage with portfolio companies on issues related
to climate risk, providing a second mechanism through which institutional investors might affect firm behavior.


                                                         13
impact of efforts by financial regulators to understand and reduce the implications of climate risk

for the financial sector; see Rudebusch (2021) for a summary of some of these efforts.

        The forces for change identified by individuals correlate in reasonable ways with their

responses to other questions. For example, respondents who believe that carbon taxes are a

particularly important force for change ranked regulatory risks as more relevant in Table 2, while

respondents who viewed customers and employees as the biggest influence also ranked

stakeholder risk more strongly.



3.5.    What are the most important research topics? Are researchers working on them?

        The last question asked respondents to identify the most important research topics in

climate finance. We proposed thirteen topic areas motivated by the literature.



                             [INSERT TABLE 6 NEAR HERE]



        The topic area garnering most enthusiasm in the pooled sample was the effects of

government incentives to mitigate or adapt to climate change; such a research priority is consistent

with the previous question's result that carbon taxes and government subsidies are among the most

important perceived forces for change. The other topic at the top of the list was to understand the

pricing of climate risk in financial assets. This research priority is consistent with the earlier finding

that many respondents think that markets are currently underpricing climate risks--and indeed,

we found that this research priority was particularly strong among respondents who perceived

climate risk to be underpriced in asset markets. Public-sector policymakers and economists, many

from central banks, felt that understanding the possible systemic risks generated by climate change




                                                   14
was a critical topic for further research. Reassuringly, those with a professional interest in climate

finance have the same ranking of the top four research priorities as those without such an interest.

       Perhaps surprisingly, respondents did not believe that a better understanding of climate

risks in insurance markets should be a research priority, even though 30% of respondents had

suggested that they had "no opinion" on whether insurance markets accurately priced climate risks

at the moment.

       How does this line up with the research actually done at the moment? To answer this

question, we analyzed all uploaded finance publications on SSRN (that is, to the FEN journal)

within the last three years that contain "climate" in their title or abstract in a relevant respect. We

manually classified each of these works as relating to up to three of the topic areas. Then, we

determined the relative frequency of each topic among the publications that spoke to at least one

of the research areas.

       The Spearman rank correlation between topics that the pooled set of respondents find

important and the topics that appear in SSRN-FEN working papers is 0.85. While the survey

respondents viewed the effect of government incentives to mitigate or adapt to climate change as

the most important research topic, it is also the second most popular topic on SSRN-FEN, even

though some papers on this topic may often fall beyond traditional finance (i.e., FEN) boundaries.

       Overall, climate change's effect on systematic risk, real effects of socially responsible

investment, new climate-related financial instruments such as green bonds or catastrophe bonds

(see Baker et al., 2018), and a few other topics were not being pursued in proportion to their

perceived importance. Public sector respondents in particular were disproportionately concerned

about systemic risks, stress tests, and pricing of climate risk in real estate and insurance, so their

own perceptions of research needs correlated less well with the recent work on SSRN.




                                                  15
        Of course, many of those who post papers to SSRN are in our sample themselves, and

presumably, the topics they find important are the topics they write about. As a result, it is worth

reviewing the opinions of those who have no professional interest in climate finance. The rank

correlation between the SSRN-FEN topic frequency and the topic-importance percentage of the

"outsiders" is 0.64, still high but clearly lower than the 0.91 rank correlation for the "insiders."

The outsiders would like to see additional work on climate risk pricing in real estate markets and

insurance markets as opposed to research on pricing in financial markets or topics in green finance.



4.      Conclusions

        Scientists often describe climate change with superlatives. Urgent. Dire. Existential. The

superlatives are all bad. Encouragingly, financial economists are devoting more and more attention

to the intersection of climate and finance. Our survey aims to further this momentum by identifying

points of agreement, disagreement, and promising research topics.

        Our 861 anonymous respondents are selected from finance academia, the public sector, and

the private sector. They are located around the world and differ in their concern about the climate

and their interest in climate finance. Despite these differences, respondent subgroups agreed on a

majority of questions. For example, respondents tend to view regulatory risks as the most

important climate risk to businesses and investors over the next five years, but physical climate

risks as the most important over the next 30 years. In addition, an order of magnitude more

respondents believe that asset markets are underestimating climate risks as opposed to

overestimating them. As with other aspects of climate change, time will tell whether these beliefs

are justified.

Table 4
Covariance of climate risk with economic conditions and social discount rates
           Two questions were asked involving the connection between climate risk and economic conditions. In the
first, participants were asked: "Consider an investment project that mitigates the effects of climate change. In general,
would you expect this project to pay off primarily in good economic times, primarily in bad economic times, or
similarly across both good and bad economic times?" Possible responses were ordered randomly. In the second,
participants were asked: "What discount rate (in percent per year) should governments use to evaluate the certain
(risk-free) benefits of an investment in climate change abatement materializing in 50 years?" and "What discount rate
(in percent per year) should governments use to evaluate the uncertain expected benefits of an investment in climate
change abatement materializing in 50 years?" The median discount rates and median risk premium are reported here.

Table 6
Most important climate finance research topics vs. SSRN topic frequency.
          Participants were asked: "Which of the following research areas do you find most important? [Choose at
most three]." Possible responses were ordered randomly and listed below in order of their rank in the pooled sample.
The phrasing of options shown to respondents were: "Effects of government incentives for innovation in climate
change mitigation and adaptation"; "Pricing of climate risk in financial markets"; "Understanding systemic risks to
the financial system from climate change"; "Real effects of socially responsible investment initiatives"; "Design of
new financial instruments to manage climate risk"; "General equilibrium modeling of the interaction of climate risk
and economy"; "Effects of green finance (e.g., green bonds) on the transition toward a sustainable economy";
"Measurement of asset-level climate risk exposure"; "Pricing of climate risk in housing and mortgage markets";
"Understanding climate risk for the insurance sector"; "Design of climate stress test scenarios"; "Refinement of ESG-
type ratings"; and, "Role of access to finance in reducing social disparities caused by climate change." The last column
shows the distribution of topic coverage by SSRN papers uploaded within the last three years. We restricted the sample
to finance papers containing the word "climate" in their abstract or title. Excluding revisions and reuploads, our sample
consists of 420 publications. Papers were manually classified to belong to none, one, or up to three of the research
topics. The distribution is shown for the subset of papers that speak to at least one of the topics. The last three rows
show the Pearson, Spearman (rank), and Kendall's tau correlation of the distribution over topics for the pooled sample
and each subgroup with the SSRN topic frequency.
