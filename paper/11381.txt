South Korea’s Experience with International Capital Flows

JEL No. F3

                                           ABSTRACT

South Korea’s experience is unparalleled in its combination of sustained prosperity, capital controls,
and financial crisis. Over several decades, South Korea experienced rapid sustained growth in the
presence of capital controls. These controls and the de-linking of domestic and international
financial markets were an essential component of the country's state-led development strategy. As
the country developed, opportunities for easy technological catch-up eroded, requiring more
sophisticated corporate and financial sector decision-making, but decades of financial repression had
bequeathed a bureaucratized financial system and a formidable constellation of incumbent
stakeholders opposed to transition to a more market-oriented development model. Liberalization
undertaken in the 1990s was less a product of textbook economic analysis than of parochial
politicking. Capital account liberalization program affected the timing, magnitude, and particulars
of the 1997-98 crisis. Despite considerable reforms undertaken since the crisis, concerns remain
about both South Korea’s lending culture and its authorities’ capacity to successfully regulate the
more complex financial system. The main lesson of the South Korean case appear to be that while
the state-led model may deliver impressive initial gains, transitioning out of this approach presents
an exceedingly complex challenge of political-economy.

        South Korean economic performance over the last four decades has been nothing

short of spectacular. During this period the country experienced only two years of

negative growth—1980 in the wake of the second oil shock and the assassination of

President Park Chung-hee, and 1998 in the midst of the Asian financial crisis (Figure 1).

Between the initiation of a wide-ranging economic reform program by Park in 1963 and

the financial crisis in 1997, real per capita income growth measured in purchasing power

adjusted terms averaged more than six percent annually, and per capita income stood at

more than eight times its level when reforms began. According to the Penn World Tables,

at the start of that period the country’s income level was lower than that of Bolivia and

Mozambique; by the end it was higher than that of Greece and Portugal.1

        Most economists would probably subscribe to the rough notion that more

complete markets are preferable to less complete markets. In the case of financial

markets, there is a large theoretical and empirical literature supporting the notion that the

development of local financial markets and their integration into international markets

encourages a variety of desirable outcomes. Yet during its period of rapid growth, South

Korea deliberately eschewed the purported gains of international financial integration and

instead maintained extensive controls on international capital flows as part of a more

general policy of financial repression undertaken in the context of a state-led

development strategy. In other words, rapid sustained growth occurred in the presence of

capital controls for a period of several decades. This is not to argue that capital controls

1
  South Korea was “deceptively poor” in the 1950s, in that per capita income was unusually low
relative to human capital (Noland and Pack 2002 Table 2.1), a situation presumably explained in
large part to the destruction of the much of the physical capital stock during the Korean War
(1950-53). That said, South Korea also accumulated human capital extremely rapidly relative to
other large developing countries of that era (Noland and Pack 2002 Figure 2.3).

were causal: this paper will not speculate on the counterfactual of what South Korean

economic performance might have been under a different policy package, but will simply

acknowledge that this period of rapid growth coincided with the existence of capital

controls, and that these controls and the de-linking of domestic and international financial

markets was an essential component of the country’s state-led development strategy.

       Problems arose as the country approached the international technological frontier

and opportunities for easy technological catch-up began to erode. The disappearance of

straightforward paths for industrial upgrading based on imitating the prior trajectories of

more advanced economies put a heightened premium on the ability of corporate

managements and their financiers to discern emerging profit opportunities. The old

development strategy was no longer adequate, but decades of state-led growth had

bureaucratized the financial system and created a formidable constellation of incumbent

stakeholders opposed to liberalization and transition toward a more market-oriented

development model. As rents dissipated, both financial and non-financial firms

scrambled to claim the dwindling low-hanging fruit.

       Under these conditions, the liberalization undertaken in the early-1990s was less a

product of textbook economic analysis than of parochial politicking. A combination of

South Korean policy, its accession to the OECD, and the Basle accords on capital

adequacy created unintended incentives for short-term bank borrowing. The highly

leveraged nature of the South Korean economy, together with the currency and term

mismatches embodied in the mid-1990s surge of foreign debt exposure, left the economy

vulnerable to a variety of negative shocks, and in 1997, in the context of the broader

Asian upheaval, South Korea experienced a financial crisis with net clean-up costs that
                                                                                                3


eventually amounted to 16 percent of 2001 GDP.2 The South Korean case is interesting

precisely because it combines in an unparalleled manner the characteristics of sustained

success, capital controls, and financial crisis.

        To preview the conclusions of this paper, capital controls were a necessary

component of the state-led development process. The problem is that it is difficult to

transition out of the state-led model—interventions create their own constituencies, and

the 1990s liberalization was a function of political competition among domestic financial

and corporate institutions over declining rents and foreign financial service providers

seeking to enter the South Korean market.

        Two concerns were expressed contemporaneously in South Korea about capital

account liberalization—that it would adversely affect incumbent South Korean financial

services firms and that it could be macroeconomically destabilizing. Systemic risk was

sufficiently high that South Korea might well have experienced a financial crisis

regardless of capital account liberalization; the liberalization program affected the timing,

magnitude, and particulars of the crisis.

        The degree of financial market integration between South Korea and the rest of

the world is considerably higher as a result of the crisis-driven removal of capital

controls. Yet the “dumbing down” of the financial system produced by decades of

financial repression may have left lingering effects. South Korea seems to have emerged

from the crisis relatively successfully but concerns remain, largely centering on the

apparent difficulty of changing the lending culture of until recently bureaucratized


2
 In these regards, the South Korean case is similar to those of Japan and Taiwan that also
combined state-led growth and capital controls, and in the 1990s experienced financial crises
costing double-digit shares of GDP.

financial institutions and the counterpart challenge of improving the quality of market-

oriented financial oversight by regulators more experienced in systems of greater direct

command and control. In the specific historical and political circumstances of South

Korea, whether the use of capital controls could have been separated from the more

general policy of financial repression and more dynamic domestic financial markets

fostered in their presence is an open question.




HISTORICAL CONTEXT



        South Korea inherited a legacy of financial repression from Japanese colonial

occupation (1910-1945) that carried into the period of independence (1948), reflecting

the dirigiste character of Japanese colonial administration and the continuation of

extensive controls by the US military authorities in the immediate post-war period. A

continuing theme throughout South Korean economic history has been the critical role of

the state, its role in the generation of rents, and the politicization of their distribution,

starting with the first post-colonial president of South Korea, Rhee Syng-man, who

exploited the policy-generated rents to build political power.3 According to Cho (1994),

South Korean economic policy was aimed at maximizing the value of American aid in

the aftermath of the Korean War (1950-53) that had left the country devastated and the

ensuing Cold War standoff. Aid financed most of capital accumulation and, at its peak in

the late 1950s, more than half of imports (Figure 2).

3
  See Cargill (1999) for a comparison of the Japanese and South Korean financial systems. See
Jones and SaKong (1980) and Woo (1991) for examples of the use of state-derived rents for
political power building.
                                                                                            5


       A military government led by General Park Chung-hee took control in 1961. As

shown in Figure 3, when Park seized power, gross domestic saving net of aid was

derisory. Gross investment, financed mostly by aid, stood at a bit more than 10 percent

of GDP and the current account was in rough balance. After two years of poor economic

performance, the military government unified the existing multiple exchange rate system,

devalued the currency, and initiated a series of wide-ranging reforms. After a brief

experiment with floating, the currency was pegged to the US dollar and would remain so

until 1980 (Koo and Park 1990). Domestic saving net of aid began rising rapidly (looking

at Figure 3 one can understand why development economists adopted Rostow’s take-off

metaphor). Domestic investment began rising even faster.

       While in some ways Park’s reform package marked a fundamental departure from

past practices (with respect to trade policy, for example), it retained an important role for

the state in the development process. Pervasive regulatory entry barriers (and thus

protection from competition for incumbents), and Park’s penchant for sole-sourcing

important infrastructural and other large-scale government supported projects, in effect

socialized risk and created opportunities for cross-subsidization across different business

ventures, encouraging the chaebol (family-dominated conglomerates) to diversify into

otherwise unrelated lines of business. By the 1980s, the top 10 chaebol accounted for

more than 20 percent of national income (SaKong 1993 Table A.20). Bank of Korea

independence was ended and the Bank made subservient to the Ministry of Finance and,

ultimately, the Blue House.

       The accumulation of capital contributed to rapid technological upgrading and a

stunning transformation of the composition of output. In 1963 non-fuel primary products
                                                                                           6


accounted for more than half of South Korea’s exports, and human hair wigs were the

third leading item. A decade later South Korea’s exports were dominated by

manufactures such as textiles, electrical products, and iron and steel; only one primary

product category, fish, made the top ten. As seen in Figure 3, capital accumulation was

financed primarily by growing domestic saving, augmented by a significant inflow of

saving from abroad, nearly reaching 10 percent of GDP in 1971, and actually breaching

this threshold in 1974 after the first oil shock.

        These inflows predominately took the form of long-term loans and trade credits

from private lenders and public institutions (including the multilateral development

banks) all subject to Bank of Korea regulation (Figure 4). Portfolio inflows and inward

foreign direct investments were negligible during this period. A substantial academic

literature exists (e.g. Westphal, Purcell, and Rhee 1981, Westphal, Kim, and Dahlman

1985) that attempts to understand the sources of South Korean industrial competence and

that documents the varied forms of technological transfer and interaction between South

Korean and foreign firms. Figure 4 indicates that whatever the origins of South Korean

technical mastery, much of the foreign capital arrived in the form of technologically

disembodied loans.

        In 1972, Park, who had been reelected for a third term, pushed through the Yushin

(Revitalization) Constitution that in essence made him president-for-life. For a variety of

reasons, he initiated the intensive promotion heavy industry through what came to be

known as the Heavy and Chemical Industry (HCI) policy. Modest financial sector

liberalizations that had been undertaken in the late 1960s were reversed in 1972, when

interest rates were lowered and direct government control of the banking system was
                                                                                                 7


increased in order to channel capital to preferred sectors, projects, or firms (Figure 5). In

order to finance large-scale projects, special public financial institutions were established,

and private commercial banks were instructed to make loans to strategic projects on a

preferential basis. By the late 1970s, the share of these “policy loans” had risen to 60

percent (Yoo, 1994). These loans carried, on average, negative real interest rates, and the

annual interest subsidy grew from about 3 percent of GNP in 1962-71 to approximately

10 percent of GNP on average between 1972 and 1979 (Pyo, 1989).4 With such a large

share of national income at stake, the allocation of these highly subsidized loans became

the focus of intense political activity.

        Park was assassinated in 1979 during what amounted to a palace coup. General

Chun Doo-hwan and his fellow officers more or less stumbled into power, driven more

by intra-military rivalries and narrow career interests than by any real sense of where they

wanted to take the country (Clifford 1997). Facing deteriorating economic performance,

exacerbated by the second oil shock, Chun and his cronies turned to Western-trained

economic technocrats, who were already attempting to introduce a stabilization policy

and reverse the worst excesses of the HCI policy, to fix the economy and shore up the

generals’ political legitimacy.5

        Despite at times carrying a large volume of fixed-interest loan debt, South Korea

managed to avoided financial trouble until the early 1980s slowdown in global growth in

  The definition of “policy loans” is imprecise and various sources report significantly different
figures. See Cho (1994) for discussion, and see SaKong (1993 Tables A.18 and A.19) and Krueger

  Chun literally scheduled early morning tutoring sessions. Perhaps there is something peculiarly
Korean about this: it is hard to imagine the typical military dictator staying up late to study for
his daily economics lesson.

the wake of the second oil shock. The external shocks that hit South Korea during the

period 1979-1981 were actually larger than those experienced by a number of other

countries discussed at this conference, including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Mexico

(Balassa 1985 Table 1). Although external debt and debt service ratios had increased

substantially in the late 1970s, South Korea was able to re-attain high sustained growth

by 1983, more rapidly than its comparators, through a combination of a reduction in

imports associated with a sharp, though brief, decline in income, together with real

exchange rate depreciation achieved through a 20 percent nominal devaluation. (The

currency had also been devalued by 20 percent in 1974 following the first oil shock.) This

pattern of relatively a sharp income decline and real depreciation followed by rapid

recovery was to be repeated in the 1997 crisis (Lee and Rhee 2000). The technocrats

around Chun implemented a policy of macroeconomic stabilization through which they

began to liberalize and deregulate the South Korean economy. A liberalization of the

financial sector initiated under the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1982-86) and extended under the

Sixth Five Year Plan (1987-91) attenuated “policy lending.”



Domestic finance



       The capital channeling development strategy pursued up through the 1980s rested

on the twin pillars of financial repression and capital controls to de-link the domestic and

international financial markets. The government had to limit capital markets to

institutions that could be dominated if not controlled, and it had to limit the firms’

financing options to those institutions. At the core was a positive list system through
                                                                                                    9


which anything not explicitly permitted was prohibited. This hampered the introduction

of new instruments throughout the financial sector. In practice this meant emphasizing

indirect finance and maintaining limitations on foreign participation in financial markets

and domestic firm access to foreign capital. Presumptively less compliant foreign banks

could not be allowed into the market in any significant way, for if they were allowed to

establish a significant presence, they would undermine domestic banks operating under

the burdens of “policy lending.”6 Thus the financial system had to be built around a

relatively small number of South Korean banks and corporate finance had to be largely

limited through regulatory fiat and tax provisions to borrowing from those intermediaries.

        Alternative sources of corporate finance were suppressed: the development of

money markets and bond markets was retarded and restricted to a limited range of

maturities with no real secondary markets, and issuance was effectively dependent on

bank-guarantees. The government discouraged the development of an efficient auction and

secondary market for government bonds, and no swap, bond or interest futures markets

existed. As for the stock market, in 1990 the government established a quarterly quota on

new issues, and prior to the 1997 crisis, a backlog of more than 360 companies was

waiting to be listed (relative to the 776 that were already on the exchange). Criminal

proceedings documented how firms were forced to resort to bribing officials to bring




6
  In the characterization of one South Korean economist “Dominance of the Korean financial
market by foreign institutions were abhorred, as it would deprive authority over various
instruments of monetary control, weaken many customary, informal practices associated with
industrial policy, and might also alter the public-good nature of the financial system” (Lee 1993
7).
                                                                                                       10


their initial public offerings to the market.7 As a result of these policies, corporate capital

sourced through bank loans exceeded equity, bonds, and commercial paper combined

until the late 1980s and indirect finance from all sources was the primary form of

corporate finance until 1991 (Cho 2002 Table 4).

        There were multiple implications of these policies. First, the firms emphasized

growth, not profitability, since risk was socialized and increased borrowing made further

borrowing advantageous under the “too big to fail” notion, promoted by the

government’s habitual interventions. From the standpoint of a lender, the bigger the firm,

the more credit-worthy the firm, since size increased the likelihood that the government

would intervene in the event that the firm got into financial trouble, which it did on a

fairly routine basis. The implication was that firms became extraordinarily leveraged as

growth became the name of the game.8 Loans were the mechanism for growth and,

paradoxically, debt signaled credit-worthiness, a state of affairs that Yoo (1999)

described as the “survival of the fattest.” Indeed, one study of corporate finance covering

the decade 1977-1986 found that “the largest firms have the weakest financial structure,”

as measured by the degree of equity in their capital structures (Kim 1990, 342), while

another found that the major chaebol were systematically less profitable than other South

Korean firms (Krueger and Yoo 2002). A corollary to this system of corporate financing

was the encouragement of extensive cross-shareholding, cross-loan guarantees, and non-

7
  In June 1996, the governor of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and a director of
the MFE were arrested for taking bribes to get firms listed. Six other SEC executives were forced to
resign.
8
 In July 1997, just prior to the crisis, the average debt-equity ratio of the thirty largest chaebol
exceeded 400 percent (Yoo 1999 Table 9). By the end of 1997, it stood at 500 percent, and 600
percent of the debt of subsidiaries was included on a consolidated basis (Claessens, Ghosh, and
Scott, 1999). See also Krueger and Yoo (2002) Table 6.
                                                                                                   11


transparency, all of which served to facilitate borrowing and had the effect of

disadvantaging outside shareholders.



Capital Controls



        Comprehensive capital controls were used to insulate the domestic financial

market from the global market.9 Inward remittances were monitored to impede

unauthorized foreign exchange transactions and inward investments. Inward FDI was

discouraged by permitting entry only into a limited range of sectors, imposing minority

ownership requirements, requiring technology transfer (in the absence of any intellectual

property rights enforcement), and imposing strict export requirements. And while there

were modest relaxations beginning in the late-1970s, actual FDI inflows remained

minuscule until a wide-ranging liberalization was undertaken in response to the 1997

crisis (Figure 4). On the eve of the crisis, South Korea and India were the only countries

in Asia where the dominant modality of US foreign investment was minority-stake joint

ventures, as opposed to majority-stake joint ventures or wholly owned subsidiaries.

        Stock market investment by nonresidents was prohibited until 1992 and then

subject to stringent quantitative ceilings.10 At the time of the 1997 crisis, foreign

detailed chronology of the policies applied.
10
  Initially this was set at 10 percent in January 1992, and subsequently raised to 12 percent in
December 1994, 15 percent in July 1995, and 18 percent in April 1996. In June 1996, the
government announced a further phased opening that would increase the ceiling to 20 percent in
1996, and three additional percentage points annually thereafter to 29 percent by 1999, and the
government added that it might abolish the ceiling entirely in 2000 if “economic circumstances”
were appropriate.
                                                                                             12


ownership of listed companies was limited to 20 percent of capital with individual stakes

limited to 5 percent. Investment by nonresidents in domestic bonds was prohibited until

1996, and then subject to quantitative limitations. The local presence and activity of

foreign financial institutions were highly circumscribed.

        For much of this period outbound investment was similarly restricted. Domestic

residents were not permitted to open foreign bank accounts or purchase foreign securities,

nor were foreign entities permitted to issue won-denominated securities domestically.

Export earning had to be repatriated within six months. Outward direct investment

required official approval, and was subject to regulations that had the effect of

encouraging the intermediation of South Korean banks.11

        The local currency, the won, was non-convertible and the South Korean

government discouraged the development of any offshore market in won or won-

denominated instruments. A rapid real appreciation of the Japanese yen beginning in

1985, encouraged a process of relocation of manufacturing activities from Japan to South

Korea. The Bank of Korea accommodated the capital inflow and between 1985 and 1989

the money supply increased by 105 percent, the price level rose by 3 percent, and the

stock market increased by 458 percent becoming the world’s ninth largest in terms of

capitalization.

        In February 1980, following a 20 percent devaluation the previous month, South

Korea moved off a strict dollar peg and began pegging the won to a basket of currencies

that constituted the Special Drawing Right (whose respective weights in the basket were

undisclosed) plus a “policy adjustment” factor. In the words of Jeffrey A. Frankel this
11
  For example, there were restrictions on firms’ ability to issue securities abroad and on
contracting foreign loans at rates more than 100 basis points above LIBOR.
                                                                                        13


was a basket peg “in name only” (Frankel 1993). As observed by Balassa and Williamson

(1990) the policy adjustment factor predominated: between 1984 and 1987 the won

depreciated against all five currencies in the basket, generating an undervalued currency

(I. Kim 1993). The IMF was astute enough to classify South Korea’s exchange rate

regime as a managed float rather than a basket peg.

       The undervalued won, relocation of productive activities from Japan to South

Korea, and expansionary macroeconomic policies in the US, generated a growing

bilateral surplus with the US (Noland 1993). Through the experience of the Yen-Dollar

talks, the US political system had become enamored with negotiating with other countries

over exchange rate and financial market policies. The US initially sought to use the

IMF’s special consultative mechanism to pressure South Korea over its exchange rate

policy despite the fact that as late as 1985 the Fund had been advising further

depreciation of the won. Starting in 1986 the US Treasury began publicly to pressure

South Korea to revalue the won. Although Japan was the primary focus of the financial

provisions of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (“The Trade Act”),

South Korea emerged as a secondary target.

       In its first three Congressionally mandated reports under Section 3004 of the

Trade Act, the Treasury identified South Korea as an “exchange rate manipulator”

removing South Korea from the list in April 1990, after a new exchange rate management

system called the market average exchange rate system was introduced. Under this

arrangement, the mid-band won-dollar rate was calculated as an average of the previous

day’s transactions and then allowed to float within officially prescribed margins around

this rate. In 1991 the government began a process of very gradually widening the bands,

with the putative expectation that as the bands were widened a freely floating exchange

rate would emerge (B. Kim 1993). Needless to say, things did not work out this way.

        The pervasive pattern of government intervention created a symbiotic relationship

between the government and the private sector, eroding private sector autonomy and

facilitating the corruption of the political system. The move toward more genuine political

competition in the late 1980s arguably shifted the balance of power away from the

government and toward the private sector, which became the source of badly needed

campaign funds (Kang 2002a, 2002b). In the words of one contemporary observer,

corruption “exploded” (Clifford 1997). With the exception of current President Roh

Moo-hyun, every South Korean President since Park Chung-hee and/or at least one of

their sons has been imprisoned on corruption offenses.



FINANCIAL LIBERALIZATION IN THE 1990s



        Over time, pressure for liberalization developed from both domestic firms

disadvantaged in international competition by relatively high domestic interest rates and

limited options for corporate finance, and the US government promoting the interests of

American financial service providers (Figure 6).12 The outcome of this tension was a

political compromise resulting in a gradual, uneven, and ultimately problematic




12
  In Figure 6 the interest rate differential is calculated as the difference between yields on South
Korean won-denominated 10-year government bonds and US government bonds of the same
maturity. If one expected the Balassa-Samuelson effect to hold and the won to appreciate in real
terms over the long run then from the standpoint of a South Korean firm, the implicit differential
was even larger.

liberalization program that both contributed to and was overtaken by the 1997 financial

crisis. (A chronology of policies actually applied is provided in the Appendix.)

        The US had begun pressuring South Korea for improved market access for US

financial services providers in the late 1980s, initiating a more or less ongoing process of

bilateral consultations on the issue of financial market liberalization. The conclusion of

the Sixth Five Year Plan (1986-91) provided Treasury officials an opening to talk to their

South Korean counterparts about “the vision thing”.13 Some commentators (Park, Song,

and Wang 2003) argue that these discussions formed the basis of the first of a series of

multiyear financial sector policy plans, the most important of which was promulgated in

1995 and scheduled to run through 1999 (Kwon 1996).14 Additional reforms were

announced as part of South Korea’s 1996 accession to the OECD, which itself was

undertaken for largely politically symbolic reasons by President Kim Young-sam.

Nevertheless, there was considerable domestic opposition to these initiatives (from

underwriters of domestic securities, for example) and the 1995 plan and South Korea’s

application to join the OECD became the focal points in the internal battle over reform

(as well as an opportunity for further US government pressure).

        The aspects of the plan itself were arguably captured by special interests through

corruption. Part of the process of unifying the financial markets had been the

   Wang (1993 186) quotes the November 1991 Treasury report to Congress mandated under
Section 3004 of the Trade Act as reading in part “Most troubling at this stage is that the Korean
government appears to lack a “vision” and well-defined strategy for the liberalization of its
financial markets. [Recent reforms] are steps in the right direction but do not appear to go fast
enough…”
14
  American demands for financial market opening are a hardy perennial. Invariant to partisan
control of the government, they continue to this day. See Frankel (1989, 1993), Wang (1993),
Blustein (2003), Stiglitz (2003), and USTR (2004) for examples.

regularization of curb market lenders as investment and finance companies. The

traditional commercial banks began to get squeezed: their share of deposits and lending

fell steadily from roughly 80 percent in 1975 to less than 50 percent in 1990. This process

accelerated in the mid-1990s when a new class of institutions, merchant banks, with a

broader remit than the existing non-bank financial intermediaries was established.

Merchant bank licenses were issued in two tranches in 1994 and 1996. The issuance of

licenses was dominated by bribery and kickbacks and a later investigation by the Board

of Audit and Inspection determined that three of the fifteen merchant banks approved in

1996 were insolvent when the licenses were issued (Haggard 2000). The merchant banks

played a significant role in the subsequent crisis both at home and abroad through

connected lending to their chaebol owners, particularly financing “unviable” investments

in steel, automobiles, and chemicals during the mid-1990s investment boom, and reckless

investments in Russia and Southeast Asia (Ishii and Habermeier 2002, 69). The

commercial banks were experiencing both erosion of market share and margins: in 1996

their share of deposits and lending had fallen to 33 percent and 43 percent, respectively,

and returns on assets and equity was declining as well.

       Out of the OECD application process came a multiyear, phased, financial

liberalization plan to break down some barriers within the domestic market and liberalize

capital outflows before capital inflows. The plan amounted to a continuation of the

ongoing liberalization process on a variety of fronts, though many of its provisions would

leave the government with significant discretion. It was unclear what controls would

remain in 1999, the terminal year of the plan. At the end of 1995, domestic market

interest rates had largely been freed (indeed, a year ahead of schedule). However, the
                                                                                               17


government still regulated the portfolios of commercial banks. It still owned a large

number of financial institutions (of which the Korea Development Bank was the largest),

and state-owned financial institutions dominated some markets (such as mortgage

lending). It announced in August 1996 that foreign investors would be allowed to invest

in convertible bonds issued by large corporations beginning in 1998, but that full opening

of the bond market would be delayed until the differential between Korean and overseas

interest rates (at the time 500-600 basis points) narrowed to 200 basis points.15 Of course

there was no guarantee that this condition would ever be met.

        Government control over the introduction of new instruments had retarded the

adoption of innovations in the securities market, and would be expected to continue to do

so under this plan. Despite the decline of policy loans, the central bank would still act as

a source of subsidized lending to preferred borrowers. Foreign participation in South

Korean financial markets would continue to be circumscribed, and access by residents to

international capital markets would still be restricted. Under this plan, the South Korean

financial system would have remained among the most repressed in Asia. Reservations

to OECD codes are permitted, and the average acceptance rate of financial liberalization

codes in the financial services area is 89 percent; South Korea used its exceptions remit

liberally, accepting only 65 percent of the OECD’s financial system codes (though in

fairness, some of these exceptions were scheduled for phase-out by 2000) (Dobson and

Jacquet, 1998). A Presidential Commission for Financial Reform was established in


15
  The chaebol had been lobbying to be allowed to access foreign capital directly through the
bond market. The government had been reluctant to do so, fearing that this would further
advantage the chaebol relative to smaller firms which would be less able to take advantage of this
opportunity. The banks presumably also preferred to their privileged position as financial
intermediaries.

January 1997 to propose broad follow-on recommendations for the modernization of the

financial system (Cargill 1999). Needless to say, its recommendations were overtaken by

events.

          The case for international financial market integration is well-known: the benefits

include enhanced opportunities for inter-temporal consumption; greater opportunities for

portfolio diversification and risk reduction for both borrowers and lenders; enhanced

competition and technology transfer in both financial and non-financial sectors; and a

reduction in systemic risk. Conversely, the symptoms of financial repression include low

rates of return to savers, banking sector inefficiency manifested by high spreads between

lending and deposit rates, poor allocation of funds across alternative uses, politicization of

lending decisions, and the existence of large informal and unregulated credit markets (“the

curb market”). Financial repression tends to retard the development of the economy by

discouraging the accumulation of capital. Savers are offered low rates of return, while firms

face a high cost of capital for their investment needs. At the same time financial repression

impedes the efficient allocation of what capital is accumulated. Projects are typically not

funded according to their rates of return, but rather on the basis of non-economic

considerations, which may include political connections or bribery of the relevant officials.

The likely result of financial repression is that the total amount of savings is lower than it

should be, and the allocation of the total among its possible uses is inefficient.

Disequilibrium in the financial markets generates rents that may be allocated through

corruption. These distortions become severe when the real economy develops rapidly and

profitable real investment opportunities abound, and yet the financial system lags behind.

Capital controls act as an implicit tax on holders of government debt. By restricting
                                                                                             19


international capital flows, the government can in effect force domestic residents to accept

government debt at lower interest rates than would be the case if there were no controls on

capital.

           These arguments are easily applicable to the South Korean case, and indeed

supporting evidence could be observed contemporaneously—note that the citations for

the next 10 paragraphs all refer to the pre-crisis literature. Opportunities for inter-

temporal consumption smoothing could be particularly important for a country like South

Korea where the rate of return on capital during this period was quite high (Figure 5) and

the economy was subject to major financial shocks such as the need to finance unification

(Noland 1996b).16 With respect to portfolio diversification, during the period under

consideration, foreign investment in the South Korean stock market was legally restricted,

and in statistical terms it was “mildly segmented” from the rest of the world (Claessen and

Rhee 1994; Watanabe 1996). There was even some evidence that the correlation between

movements in the South Korean and foreign markets was declining, which would have

enhanced the attractiveness of cross-border diversification. Although it was sometimes

argued that foreign investment in the stock market amounted to “hot money,” the dominant

behavior of foreign investors was to re-invest sales as part of the process of portfolio

realignment (Jun, 1995). Giovanni and deMelo (1993) estimate that in the case of South

Korea for the period 1975-1987, the “financial repression tax”—the reduction in borrowing

costs to the central government generated by capital controls that effectively force domestic

residents to invest in local instruments or the implicit tax rate—was more than 5 percent,

amounting to 0.25 percent of national income, or 1-2 percent of actual tax revenues.

16
   See Cho (2002) Figure 1 and Krueger and Yoo (2002) Tables 3 and 4 and Figures 1 and 2 for
alternative estimates of rates of return.
                                                                                                 20


        Not only were the prospective gains to relaxation capital controls discernable, but

the implicit costs were also evident. There were enormous spreads across borrowers,

reflecting the segmentation and repression of financial markets (Figure 5). The South

Korean financial services sector was bureaucratized, bloated, and backwards. This was

reflected in the low average rate of return on bank assets, which was among the lowest of

those observed in emerging markets (Goldstein and Turner, 1996, Table 5). The role of

foreign firms was highly circumscribed. Given the highly concentrated South Korean

industrial structure with respect to both firms (a relatively few firms accounted for a large

share of national income) and the composition of output and exports (highly concentrated

in a few products such as automobiles and computer chips), systemic risk was a real

concern. The situation was exacerbated by a relaxation in 1995 of bank provisioning

requirements, and fragmented regulatory authority in which the BOK was responsible for

oversight of the commercial banks while “poor supervision [of the merchant banks] by

the MOFE created the possibility for regulatory arbitrage and high risk practices” (Ishii

and Habermeier 2002, 69).17 Macroeconomic volatility was higher than in other Asian


17
   Writing prior to the crisis the present author summarized the situation as follows: “The
potential problem with the system is the implicit guarantee that banks not be allowed to fail; this
together with deposit insurance, simultaneously creates an incentive for banks to seek risk, while
it relieves depositors of the incentive to monitor bank health….Moreover, the Korean definition
of bad loans is narrower than that commonly used abroad, and foreign bankers estimate the true
bad loan problem may be three times as large as admitted….Concerns about the banking system
are further aggravated by the MFE'    s dual function as a promoter and supervisor of financial
institutions, and legitimate questions can be raised about the degree of independence of the
regulatory authorities...The bottom line is that Korea should be concerned about the strength of its
banking system, and much of this concern is related to domestic financial repression and is
unrelated to the issue of external financial liberalization. Market discipline does not work when
there is a lack of information, or when the notion that banks cannot fail is widely held. The
appropriate responses are to deal with the structural problems of the banking system (which are
likely to involve both domestic and international liberalization together with strengthened
prudential supervision by public authorities), to strengthen public disclosure requirements, and to
signal limits on public bail-outs” (Noland, 1996a, p12-14) [emphasis in the original].

economies, and data from the BIS indicated that the risk-adjusted capital adequacy ratio of

South Korean banks was among the lowest of all developing countries (Goldstein and

Turner 1996).

        South Korean reluctance to deregulate reflected a mixture of motivations. There

were two sorts of counterarguments offered in opposition to liberalization. The first was

that the South Korean financial service firms simply could not compete. Some South

Koreans probably opposed liberalization out of self-interest, since liberalization would erode

their privileged position within the South Korean financial system. (Likewise, some foreign

calls for opening the Korean financial market were surely motivated by similar self-interest.)

For example, Park (1995, 7) argued, “domestic financial institutions have little

competitive advantage over their foreign counterparts. At best Korea’s financial sector

remains an infant industry and may need market protection.”18 On some level this was

undoubtedly true (and irrelevant): the South Korean banking sector was highly

inefficient as could easily be observed at the time, a condition that was subsequently

confirmed by the industry’s post-crisis consolidation, which, despite a strong union

presence in the industry, was accompanied by a roughly 40 percent decline in sectoral

employment and no apparent diminution in service.

        A more serious argument was that destabilizing capital flows would create

macroeconomic instability. Park and Song (1996, 14) wrote, “Korean policymakers have


18
   Another South Korean economist wrote “Unless the weakness in domestic financial institutions
is improved, financial markets in Korea could eventually be controlled by foreign firms.
Fortunately, [under the agreement with the OECD] it is predicted that liberalization of capital
movements will not result in foreign control of domestic financial industries. Such prediction is
supported by the fact that foreign banks operating in Korea have experienced a decline in their
asset size, and foreign insurance firms’ market share is less than one percent…” (Chae 1997 71-
2).
                                                                                               22


been reluctant to liberalize the capital account rapidly. There is concern that devastating

macroeconomic instability would result from a sudden opening of financial markets. In

contrast efficiency gains to the economy from liberalization are considered to be small,

possibly even insignificant, and at best realized in the long-run.” Johnston et al. (1999,

71) write that upon joining the OECD, South Korean government officials expressed

their disinclination to ease capital controls further and explicitly stressed that they wished

to maintain controls over short-term capital inflows that may “hamper macroeconomic

and financial market stability.” A major source of reluctance to remove barriers to capital

inflows was the fear that inflows of reserves would increase the money supply excessively

and lead to real exchange rate appreciation, either through inflation, or alternatively through

nominal appreciation of the currency.19

        A striking aspect of the South Korean case is that while a variety of policy

responses to this concern were suggested, it does not appear that any were seriously

considered. One way of avoiding excessive appreciation would have been to continue to

sterilize the capital inflows, as South Korean policymakers had done throughout the 1980s

and 1990s by forcing domestic financial institutions to purchase Monetary Stabilization

Bonds (MSBs) to offset the expansionary impact on the money supply of foreign capital

inflows. Indeed, research cited by Park (1995) indicated that the optimal policy from a

South Korean standpoint would have been a mixture of exchange rate adjustment and

sterilization. Sterilization may have been advisable in the short-run, but it is doubtful

19
   For example in an NBER paper, Cho and Koh (1996) write that “With the current level of
interest rate differentials between Korea and developed economies, drastic full-scale
liberalization would certainly induce a large amount of capital inflows and appreciate the Korean
won. This would affect the price competitiveness of Korean products in international markets,
which could bring about significant macro-instability in an economy like Korea which relies
heavily upon external transactions” (p.1).
                                                                                                    23


whether this is a good long-term policy: such a policy generates quasi-fiscal costs as long as

the interest rate on the MSBs exceeds the return on holding foreign exchange (in the case of

comparable Latin American countries, Leiderman (1995) estimated their annual costs at

0.25 percent to 0.50 percent of national income). In any event, since domestic rates were

higher than foreign rates, it would be desirable to reduce domestic rates and obtain the

benefits of higher investment and growth.20 Moreover, as domestic financial markets

became more complex, the ability of the Bank of Korea to exercise monetary control

through administrative guidance and MSBs would be increasingly less possible,

underscoring the advisability of developing the capacity for indirect control through open

market operations. Another alternative proposed by Dornbusch and Park (1995) was for the

government to create a long-term (six years or more) won currency bond exclusively for

foreigners for use when sterilizing capital inflows.

        If it is not possible to adequately sterilize or otherwise offset inflows, and the capital

inflows are financing consumption (instead of investment), another response would be to

reintroduce some controls on capital inflows, presumably in the form of “Tobin taxes” that

would throw some sand in the external financial market wheels.21 Dornbusch and Park

(1995), Park (1995), and Park and Song (1996) devoted considerable effort to thinking about

this in the South Korean context. They raised two possibilities, which they appeared to

20
  Park (1995) suggested central bank swaps as a possible alternative to sterilization. When central
bank foreign exchange holdings got too high, the central bank would sell foreign exchange to
domestic financial institutions to invest abroad. At the end of a specified time, the swap would be
reversed, and the central bank would compensate financial institutions for losses due to interest rate
differentials and exchange rate movements. The problem, as in the case of sterilization, is that the
quasi-fiscal cost could be high.
21
   If the foreign capital inflows were going into productivity-enhancing investment, the proper
response would be to allow the exchange rate to appreciate with productivity gains, and allow the
capital inflows to continue.
                                                                                                24


regard as temporary measures for extreme situations. The first was a variable deposit

requirement (VDR), in which reserve or deposit requirements are imposed on capital

inflows, with the deposit varying according to type of inflow and investor. It is possible, in

principle, that the reserve requirement could be set exactly so that the opportunity cost of the

deposit sitting in a non-interest bearing Bank of Korea account could exactly offset the

international interest rate differential. Apparently the legal framework existed for the

imposition of this deposit requirement, and the existing procedures would make it feasible to

impose this on foreigners. The main problem (beyond damage to future credibility with

foreign investors) would appear to be that this would also most certainly generate conflicts

with foreign governments and investors and, depending on its implementation, possibly

amount to a violation of South Korea’s WTO commitments. These emergency safeguards

were to be explicitly authorized post-crisis in the Foreign Exchange Transaction Act of

1999.

        The alternative to controlling quantity (in terms of setting the size of the deposit)

would be to control price, and Park and Song raised the issue of a transaction tax, for which,

like the VDR, the necessary legal framework apparently already existed. The transactions

tax could be confined to capital account transactions, and in principle could be imposed

solely on foreigners. Like the VDR, this would surely raise hackles with foreign firms and

governments. Moreover, although the won could not legally trade outside of South Korea, it

is hard to see why interested parties could not simply move their activities offshore and

avoid the tax. More generally, the market for the won was already relatively thin, and it is

not clear that reducing the volume of transactions would be desirable.
                                                                                                25


        Finally, one might fight destabilizing inflows by encouraging outflows. At first

blush, encouraging outflows to offset inflows would appear to be the natural response to

concerns about excessive net inflows. There are two arguments as to why encouraging

outflows may actually exacerbate the problem, however. First, barriers to outflows create an

element of irreversibility to foreign investors, and if there is uncertainty about the future

conduct of economic policy, then this irreversibility may deter investment. Elimination of

irreversibility through the removal of capital controls could reduce foreign investor caution

and paradoxically lead to higher net inflows. Second, since barriers to external flows are

sometimes maintained to facilitate the collection of financial repression taxes, the removal

of the impediments may be regarded as a signal of a lower permanent rate of taxation on

capital, and thus can induce capital inflow. It is unclear whether either of these arguments

carried much force in the South Korean case.

        In any event, South Korean authorities appeared to be proceeding more rapidly with

liberalization on outbound flows than on inbound flows. To the extent that one believes

that, for conventional portfolio diversification reasons, domestic residents wish to hold

foreign currency assets and have been prevented from doing so, the elimination of these

impediments would encourage capital outflow. If the fundamental concern about external

financial liberalization is that it would lead to destabilizing net inflows, the South Korean

policy amounted to firing the guns before the enemy was in sight.

        Not only that, the effect of government policy was to encourage those inflows to

take the form of short-term lending to South Korean banks. The closure to foreign

investors of the long-term corporate bond market created the perverse incentive to raise

capital through short-term borrowing. This was significant because South Korean firms
                                                                                              26


were highly concentrated in relatively footloose manufacturing industries and subject to

contentious labor relations at home. As a consequence, South Korean firms began

investing abroad at a scale that was unusually large for an economy at its level of income

and industrial development.

        In 1993, the government expanded the scope for short-term foreign currency

borrowing by allowing firms to borrow abroad directly or through South Korean banks to

finance the importation of capital goods (Figure 7). With interest rates relatively high in

South Korea, and continued restrictions on firms’ ability to issue long-term bonds or

secure long-term loans in foreign markets still in effect, firms were encouraged to

increase their reliance on short-term foreign borrowing and South Korean banks were

encouraged to step up their on-lending activities (Figure 8).22

        The following year, the government removed restrictions on banks’ foreign

currency loans, resulting in a massive increase in net foreign currency liabilities (Figure

8). Moreover, the Bank of Korea applied window guidance to limit medium- and long-

term borrowing on international markets, apparently due to concerns about potential loss

of control over domestic financial institutions through debt-equity swaps biasing

borrowing toward the short end of the term spectrum (Johnston et al. 1999). Short-term

external debt rose from $40 in 1993 to $98 billion at the end of September 1997,

representing more than half of external liabilities and more than three times the amount of

foreign exchange reserves (Figure 9). The growth of short-term debt outstripped the

growth in usable reserves raising the specter of a liquidity crunch. The ratio of usable


22
  Further impetus was provided in October 1995 when the government announced that, in the
case of direct investments abroad by South Korean corporations of $100 million or more, at least
one-fifth of the funds would have to be raised at home.
                                                                                            27


international reserves—official reserves less the amount of illiquid funds that had been

deposited at overseas bank branches to cover short-term debt repayments—to short-term

debt declined from 42 percent in 1993 to 29 percent at year-end 1996 (Chopra et al.

2002).

         These “demand-side” factors were reinforced by “supply-side” effects through the

Basle Accords. Lending to other OECD banks, irrespective of the term of the loan, is

assigned a risk weight of 20 percent in the capital adequacy requirements. However, in

the case of non-OECD banks, the assessments vary with the term of the loan: loans of

less than one-year duration receive the 20 percent risk weight while those with a duration

of more than one year are assigned a 100 percent risk rate. Since all corporate lending

receives the 100 percent risk weight, Basle Accord incentives arguably encouraged

lending to South Korea to take the form of short-term bank lending, reinforcing South

Korean government policy (Johnston et al. 1999). When South Korea joined the OECD,

the effect was to reduce the risk premium on lending to South Korea.

         The net result was currency and term mismatching on a massive scale. One way

of getting a handle on the implications of this is suggested by Goldstein and Turner

(2004), who propose an aggregate effective currency mismatch measure—the net foreign

currency asset position normalized by a country’s export openness and the foreign

currency share of total debt— as a short-hand stress indicator of the vulnerability of an

economy to an exchange rate depreciation. As shown in Figure 10, South Korea moved

from a small net negative position in 1994 (i.e., an exchange rate depreciation would

slightly reduce the net worth of the economy) to a sizeable negative position in 1996, as

the economy experienced a 10-fold rise in net currency liabilities and a smaller increase
                                                                                                 28


in the foreign currency share of total debt, in the absence of a significant increase in

export openness. The implication of this movement in the Goldstein-Turner measure was

that, heading into 1997, South Korea was both more likely to experience a currency

collapse and that such an event would have a severe impact on the economy.23 Unlike the

few if any analysts properly understood the external vulnerabilities created by the

borrowing activities of overseas bank affiliates.



THE 1997 CRISIS AND ITS AFTERMATH



        Between 1994 and 1996 South Korea experienced an investment boom that was

increasingly financed by mismatched foreign borrowing. Unlike Southeast Asia, where

the investment boom was concentrated in the real estate sector, much of the capital was

flowing into manufacturing, presumptively giving less cause for concern.24 However, a

substantial share was invested in industries that were already arguably characterized by

excess capacity, and by the mid-1990s South Korea was experiencing slowing total factor

productivity growth, deteriorating terms of trade, and declining profitability. South

Korea’s largest export market, Japan, went into recession in 1996, and the yen began to

depreciate significantly against the dollar, generating an effective real appreciation of the

won. Export growth slowed in 1996 and turned negative the following year. Stock

market prices, which peaked in 1994, accelerated their decline.

        As conditions worsened in 1996, the margin of error for the highly leveraged

chaebol evaporated. In January 1997 Hanbo Steel, the seventeenth largest chaebol ranked

by sales, collapsed amid $6 billion of outstanding debts. The collapse of Hanbo, the first

major chaebol to go bankrupt in more than a decade, was to have repercussions beyond

its debts: a subsequent series of bribery arrests culminating in the arrest and conviction of

President Kim Young-sam’s son and political confidante, Kim Hyun-chol, shook the

political establishment and greatly damaged the elder Kim. The Hanbo collapse was

followed by the failures of two more chaebol, driving up interest rates in the large

corporate bond market, and imposing negative externalities on all corporate borrowers.

During the second quarter of 1997, spreads on South Korean government bonds began to

widen, while, as points of comparison, those on Indonesian and Malaysian government

bonds remained unchanged. The market was signaling an increase in South Korean

country risk. The turning point arguably came in June with the failed nationalization of

Kia, the country’s third-largest automaker.

        Despite these worsening conditions, the vulnerability of the South Korean

economy was not universally appreciated, neither by forecasters, whose expectations for

the South Korean economy were myopic in the extreme (Figure 11), South Korean

government officials, nor the IMF.25


25
  For example, the head of one government think tank, after accurately diagnosing the labor
problems, loss of political confidence, and macroeconomic imbalances emerging in South Korea,
in a public address in Washington in April 1997, dismissed concerns over the short-term debt and
concluded: “There is, in fact, no economic crisis in Korea, if, by a crisis, we mean that there is
                                                                                              30


        If domestic turmoil was its only problem, South Korea might have been able to

avoid the conflagration that was to engulf it. Instead, in the second half of 1997 South

Korea was rocked by the shocks emanating from the financial crisis that had seized

Southeast Asia and an emerging banking crisis in Japan, its principal source of foreign

loans. The South Korean economy was adversely affected through three channels:

spillovers in real terms as the depreciations of its competitors (especially Taiwan)

effectively acted as competitive devaluations; contagion in financial terms; and a

precipitous decline in roll-over rates as Japanese banks hunkered down. The result was a

collapse in private capital inflows (Figure 4).

        These forces put considerable downward pressure on the won in the latter part of

1997. South Korean authorities spent billions of dollars in an unsuccessful attempt to

maintain their quasi-peg, but by December they were forced to abandon any pretense of

controlling the exchange rate.26 The currency went into freefall. Developments in the

currency market rebounded on the domestic financial system. As the exchange rate

collapsed, financial and non-financial firms with un-hedged foreign-currency-

denominated debt were crushed by a mounting debt burden in domestic resource cost



imminent danger to the national economy—as was the case with Mexico in 1994” (Young 1997
4). He was not alone—as late as September 1997, IMF missions to Seoul were giving the
economy a clean bill of health.
26
   On 27 August a high ranking official of Ministry of Finance and Economy (MFE), in one
history’s weirder abuses of metaphor, told a Seoul press conference that the BOK would defend
its “Maginot Line” of 900 won to the dollar. Unfortunately, this new Maginot Line was as
ineffective as the original, and the level was soon breached. The BOK continued to intervene in
the foreign exchange market in a futile attempt to defend the won. On 17 November, in a press
conference that would have been farcical if not for the stakes, MFE officials again invoked the
“Maginot Line” imagery, solemnly declaring that they would defend their newest line of 1000
won to the dollar. They spent billions of dollars trying, but the following day the barrier was
breached once again.
                                                                                         31


terms. By year’s end the stock market had lost more than half its value in a period of

eight months.

           South Korea initially sought assistance from Japan and the United States

bilaterally, and after being rebuffed, approached the IMF. The Fund the multilateral

development banks and bilateral donors agreed to contribute to a rescue. Agreement was

reached in November on a $57 billion package, then the largest in history, nearly 20

times South Korea’s IMF quota, in return for broad, though vaguely worded, reforms.

This agreement was promptly denounced by all three candidates in the ongoing

presidential campaign. The National Assembly refused to consider a package of financial

reform legislation proposed by MFE, and the bank regulators marched on the National

Assembly to protest their possible reorganization. Moreover, given the vagueness of the

reform commitments, outside observers expressed skepticism about their eventual

implementation. South Korean asset prices continued to plummet. On December 18 a

former political dissident, Kim Dae-jung, was elected President. The following week,

default was avoided when a second agreement, involving expedited disbursements was

concluded, and William McDonough, chairman of the New York Federal Reserve,

persuaded the international banks to keep their credit lines open. Ultimately, South

Korea’s creditors are persuaded to exchange their existing short-term loans for

government-guaranteed bonds of longer maturity.27

           In negotiating the second package, the Fund extracted significant policy

commitments including both monetary and fiscal tightening (despite the fact that the

1996 general government budget surplus was five percent of GDP), as well as a variety of

27

                                                                                             32


structural reforms, some unrelated to the financial crisis, such as the removal of the ban

on the importation of Japanese automobiles. Although trade liberalization had been a

staple of other IMF programs, the inclusion of these items contributed to the perception

in South Korea that the IMF was simply being used as a tool of Japanese, and especially

US, commercial policy.

       Feldstein (1998) argues that the South Korean case could be thought of as a

fundamentally well-functioning economy experiencing a temporary liquidity crisis. Had

the Fund initially acted to coordinate a restructuring of private sector lending while

providing temporary credits (in essence a bridge loan) the huge official money package

could have been avoided and along with it the intrusive conditionality that the Fund

demanded as part of the second deal. Indeed, South Korea ultimately borrowed less than

$29 billion, and in fact, did not draw down the entire IMF portion of the loan.

       The South Korean crisis presented the IMF, the major finance ministries, and the

multilateral development banks with a difficult situation. It occurred in the context of a

cascading set of crises, which threatened to spread to Brazil and Russia. The South

Korean government’s willingness to guarantee the short-term foreign debt of private

entities socialized risk, creating moral hazard and ultimately increasing the severity of the

crisis. It waited too long to approach the Fund, and once it did, engaged in unhelpful

tactics such as leaking confidential documents. The Fund and its allies had little control

over these events, and confronted in November 1997 a situation that arguably posed a

systemic risk to the international financial system.

       When push came to shove, the Fund and its collaborators provided South Korea

with an enormous package, far beyond its past lending practices in other cases and a
                                                                                                 33


timely infusion of cash that undoubtedly prevented a chaotic default. That said, the

macroeconomic conditionality imposed on South Korea was too severe.28 It needlessly

intensified the recession that was to come to be known colloquially as “the IMF

recession” as the growth rate collapsed from 7 percent in 1996 to –7 percent in 1998

before rebounding to more than 10 percent in 1999 (Figure 1). Yet the South Korean

economy had been beset with some significant structural problems, and, given the

enormity of the December 1997 standby-agreement, considerable demands for structural

reform could be expected, at least with regard to financial market regulation and

corporate governance. Other aspects of the program, requiring specific trade and labor

market reforms, or demanding an independent central bank with price stability as its sole

mandate, were intrusive and at best only tangentially connected to the crisis.29 Yet one

could argue that the existence of such a demanding international organization allowed

Kim Dae-jung to advance his own relatively liberal economic agenda more effectively

than if the Fund or some similar organization had not existed.

        In a sense South Korea benefited from the vagaries of the electoral calendar—

President Kim entered the Blue House essentially owing nothing to the dominant interests

in the society, and could blame the mishap on his predecessor. Given this freedom to

maneuver, he moved resolutely to extract concessions from both the labor unions and the


28
  There is a substantial academic literature on the monetary policy aspects of the crisis response
reaching ambiguous conclusions about the in the interest rate increases embodied in the Fund
program. There is less disagreement that the fiscal tightening was inappropriate. See IMF (2003)
for a review.
29
   The Fund appears to belatedly acquiesced on this point, observing that: “the IMF may have
been better advised to confine its advice and conditionality to a narrower range of issues, and then
let the Korean authorities define their own agenda for implementation on a more focused set of
policy issues” (IMF 2003, 111).
                                                                                            34


chaebol. In the financial sector, the government immediately closed two brokerage

houses and a number of merchant banks (including some affiliated with chaebol). The

government began the process of auctioning off two nationalized commercial banks,

while putting other financial institutions on short tethers. Despite the austerity and

dislocation that would accompany the process of restructuring, the financial markets

responded positively to these actions.

        The crisis forced a restructuring of South Korea’s systems of finance, regulation,

and corporate governance, and a dismantling of the pervasive controls on international

capital flows that characterized the pre-crisis regime. Since the crisis South Korea has

arguably made better progress on economic reform than the other heavily affected Asian

crisis countries, or Japan for that matter.

        One manifestation of this has been an increase in FDI. As noted earlier, before

the crisis, South Korea was unusual in that the dominant modality of investment was

minority stake joint ventures. FDI spiked in 1999 and 2000 and has fallen considerably

since then (Kim 2004 Table 1). The temporary hike was in large part stemmed from

foreign minority partners buying out their South Korean counterparts—given the opacity

of South Korean accounting practices at the time, incumbent investors were uniquely

informed about the franchise value of these businesses.30 Subsequent FDI has mostly

taken the form of green-field investments.

        In the financial sector, prudential regulation has been consolidated and

strengthened through the creation of the Financial Supervisory Commission and the


30
  One issue is whether these acquisitions amounted to a “fire-sale” of assets by financially
distressed South Korean firms. Econometric results reported by Chari, Ouimet, and Tesar (2004)
suggest not.

introduction of new regulatory practices, approaches, and standards. Competition was

injected into the financial sector by the increased role of foreigners through a variety of

institutional arrangements. What appears to be more difficult to change has been the

lending culture of South Korean financial institutions (Mann 2000). In the aftermath of

the crisis, lenders went from bingeing on corporate lending to bingeing on household

lending: South Korean household debt registered the fastest growth in the world,

increasing 18 percentage points of GDP in two years, before ending in crisis with the

insolvency of the country’s largest credit card issuer.31 A current challenge centers on the

rapidly growing use of financial derivatives by South Korean financial institutions and

the concern that the regulatory regime may not have kept pace with financial innovation.

          Nevertheless, the improvement in the function of South Korea’s financial system

can be seen in firm level balance sheet data: South Korean corporations on the whole

have reduced their leverage, and access to capital increasingly is a function of

profitability (Alexander 2003). This development is, in turn, facilitated by improved

corporate governance through enhanced financial transparency, stricter enforcement of

existing laws, and expanded scope for minority shareholders to seek legal redress.

          What has not happened is the development of independent institutional investors

capable of monitoring management. To the extent that such institutional investors exist

in South Korea, they tend to be affiliated with the major chaebol, and though some

foreign institutional investors and the nascent shareholder rights movement have exerted

some salutary influence, it is fair to say that the country still lacks a real market for

corporate control. South Korean equity markets have become more integrated with

markets elsewhere. In part this increase reflects the natural integration of markets

following the removal of restrictions on foreign ownerships of South Korean stocks

(foreigners now own more than 40 percent of the shares on the Korean Stock Exchange)

and the removal of restrictions on South Korean residents’ ability to invest abroad. Yet

despite these developments, the interest rate spread on South Korean debt remains higher

than it was pre-crisis (Figure 12).

       In June 1998 the government announced a plan to liberalize all foreign exchange

transactions in two stages. The first stage took effect 1 April 1999 with the

implementation of the Foreign Exchange Transaction Act which liberalized most existing

restrictions on current account transactions and established a negative list system for

capital account transactions under which transactions are legal unless stipulated by law or

decree. (See Kim (2001 Appendix) for a complete description.) The second stage of the

exchange control liberalization took effect 1 January 2002.

       In April 2002 the government announced “The Plan for the Development of the

Korean Foreign Exchange Market,” which envisions full liberalization of foreign

exchange regulations by 2011 as part of the government’s attempt to establish South

Korea as a regional business hub for Northeast Asia. At present the exchange rate system

is classified as independently floating in an inflation-targeting framework by the IMF. In

recent years exchange rate interventions have been sizeable however, and would appear

to go beyond the smoothing operations as characterized by the Fund, and instead, involve

an attempt to prevent appreciation of the won. As of August 2004, South Korea has

accumulated $171 billion in official reserves, and exchange rate policy and the magnitude

of currency market interventions have emerged as a source of controversy within the

South Korean government.



CONCLUSION



       South Korea is a fascinating case in that it combines the characteristics of

sustained prosperity, capital controls, and financial crisis in striking manner. Pervasive

capital controls, which de-linked South Korea’s internal financial markets from the rest

of the world, were a necessary component of the country’s capital channeling

development strategy. This strategy clearly was consistent with rapid and sustained

economic development, though it may or may not have been causal.

       These interventions create domestic political constituencies for both their

perpetuation and dissolution, and the implementation of liberalization programs will

reflect political competition among these groups. Transition is also affected by the

demands of foreign financial services providers, which, having developed greater

efficiency in a more competitive environment, regard the protected market as an

opportunity. All of these phenomena are evident in the South Korean case.

       Because of its somewhat amorphous nature, perhaps the most difficult challenge

is the legacy of financial repression in “dumbing down” both private sector actors and

their public sector regulatory counterparts. The main ongoing concern in South Korea is

not the macroeconomic adjustment to the removal of capital controls per se, but rather

the lingering concerns about both the lending culture of South Korean financial sector
                                                                                            38


firms and the capacity of South Korean authorities to successfully regulate the more

complex financial system enabled by liberalization.

       The obvious question is whether South Korea could have developed a more

dynamic and market-oriented financial system in the presence of international capital

controls. In theory there is no reason why this could not have happened if South Korea

had chosen this path. Indeed, the strengthening of domestic financial institutions prior to

opening the capital account is a staple of the sequencing literature, and South Korea in

the late 1980s appeared to meet the basic preconditions for a successful transition, such

as fiscal health (Edwards 1989). Similarly one can imagine a greater (or lesser) role for

foreign financial service providers under a variety of institutional and regulatory

constructs. Yet it is doubtful whether this could have been obtained in practice. Neither

South Korean government officials nor the intelligensia evinced much ideological

commitment to the notion of freer financial markets, and perhaps more importantly, there

were some very large and powerful interest groups that were opposed to liberalization.

For better or worse, given the specifics of the South Korean situation, freer international

capital flows, a less regulated domestic financial system, and an increased role for foreign

financial service providers were probably not greatly separable components of financial

sector reform.

               Chronology of Capital Flow Liberalization in South Korea

This appendix provides a timeline of capital flow liberalization in South Korea. It is
derived primarily, though not exclusively, from Johnston et al. (1999) and the Bank of
Korea website, www.bok.or.kr. The chronology is organized by topic: foreign direct
investment (FDI), followed by portfolio investment, other capital flows, capital market
organization, and foreign exchange.

Foreign Direct Investment

   •   Revision of Foreign Capital Inducement Law establishes principle that inward
       FDI, subject to approval, permitted except in specific “negative list” sectors.

1985
   •   More than 100 sectors eliminated from the “negative list.” “Liberalization ratio”
       (share of industries open to FDI) reaches 76 percent, 92 percent in manufacturing.

1986
   •   Initial liberalization of restrictions on direct investment abroad begins.

1987

       percent, 98 percent in manufacturing.
   •   Limit on automatic approval is raised to $5 million from $3 million.

       while a 50 percent exemption is established for the two successive years.
   •   Restrictions on foreign ownership of retail businesses are relaxed.
                                                                                       40

   •   The Foreign Capital Inducement Act is amended to streamline application
       procedures. Rules on land ownership are relaxed.

1995
   •   Investment in 101 sectors is permitted or greatly liberalized.

1997
   •   August the debt limits on corporations making overseas direct investments,
       whereby 20 percent of investments exceeding $100 million had to be financed by
       a firm’s own capital, were abolished

1998
   •   Foreign Investment Promotion Act establishes the principle of national treatment,
       further narrows the “negative list” down to 5 percent of all sectors and 1 percent

       development, waterworks, and investment companies and trusts fully open to
       foreign investment; broadens the scope of tax incentives available to foreign
       investors; simplifies approval procedures; and establishes foreign investment
       zones.

Present situation: Twenty-nine out of 1,121 industries remain partially or completely
closed to FDI. There is no limit on the amount that corporations can invest abroad, but
all direct investments require notification of the corporations’ banks and, for financial,
banking and insurance companies, acceptance is required by the Ministry of Finance and
Economy (MOFE). Notification of the BOK and foreign exchange banks is also required
for purchases of foreign real estate by domestic companies or purchases of domestic real
estate by foreigners. Minimum standards of domestic companies’ foreign exchange
earnings must be met in order for them to establish branches overseas.

behalf. The overall open overbought (oversold) position in foreign currencies of foreign
exchange banks must be lower than 20 percent of the equity capital. A foreign exchange
bank must maintain reserves amounting to a prescribed proportion of its foreign currency
deposit liabilities in the form of foreign currency deposits at the BOK. The current

       abroad requires MOFE’s approval.
   •   November 11 band widened to +/- 10 percent.
