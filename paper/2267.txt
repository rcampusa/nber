               The Decline of Unionization in the United States:

                  What Can Be Learned From Recent Experience?




                                   ABSTRACT



      The dramatic decline in unionization over the last decade is
investigated in the context of a supply/demand model of union status
determination. Data from surveys conducted in 1977 and 1984 are used to
decompose the decline into components due to a drop in the demand for union
repre3entation and a drop in the supply of union jobs relative to demand. It
is found that there has been a substantial drop in demand that can be
accounted for by an increase in the job satisfaction of nonunion workers and a
decrease in nonunion workers' beliefs that unions improve wages and working
conditions. It is also found that there has been a substantial drop in the
supply of union jobs relative to demand that is attributed to an increase in
employer resistance to unionization. Increased foreign and increased nonunion
domestic competition (particularly in deregulated industries) are cited as the
likely key underlying causes of these changes.

I.   Introduction

       The last fifteen years have seen a precipitous decline in the extent of

unionization in the United States. Based on data from the Nay Current

Population Surveys summarized in table 1, the fraction of private

nonagricultural employment made up of union members has fallen from 25.6

percent in 1973 to 14.1% in 1985. The reasons for this decline are not clear.

           Union I'Iembership as Fraction of Nonagricultural Employment

                       (Based on tabulations of Nay CPS's)

              1973            .256                1980          .208
              1974            .249                1981          .197
              1975            .230                1982
              1976            .226                1983          .159
              1977            .218                1984          .150
              1978            .209                1985          .141
               1979           .220


One potential explanation is that the decline is due to increased employer

hostility toward unions and union organizing activity (Freeman and Medoff,

1984; Freeman, 1985). Another potential explanation is that increased

competitiveness of American markets, partly due to the past behavior of the

unions themselves, has resulted in unions having less to offer workers today

than they did in the past. A third potential explanation is that shifts in

the demographic, industrial, and occupational composition of the labor force

away from traditionally heavily unionized types of workers and sectors can

account for at least part of the decline in unionization (Farber, 1985;

Dickens and Leonard, 1985).

       Of course, these positions are neither independent nor mutually

exclusive. For example, it may be that the increased competitiveness of the

domestic and world economy makes it difficult for unionized firms to compete

if their labor costs are higher than their foreign or nonunion domestic

competition. This has the implications that employers will resist
                                             2

unionization more strenuously and that potentially unionizable workers will

feel that unions cannot offer the advantage of higher levels of compensation

without an unacceptable risk to employment. In addition, these same forces

may have caused part of the shift in employment away from traditionally

heavily unionized blue—collar manufacturing jobs.

        In this study a model of the determination of the union status of

workers, based on the work of Farber (1983), is used to decompose the decline

in unionization into separate components due to a decline in demand and a

decline in supply relative to demand. While the usual data on the union

status of workers is not sufficient to identify shifts in demand and supply

separately, data from the 1977 Quality of Employment Survey (QES) and a survey

done by Louis Harris and Associates for the AFL-CIO in 1984 contain

information that can be used for this decomposition. These data provide the

focus of the empirical analysis.

        The central findings are that the decline in unionization since 1977 is

accounted for by 1) increased employer resistance to unionization (probably

due to increased product market competitiveness) resulting in a decrease in

the supply of union jobs relative to demand and 2) decreased demand for

unionization by nonunion workers due to an increase in the satisfaction of

nonunion workers with their jobs and a decline in nonunion workers' beliefs

that unions are able to improve wages and working conditions. The evidence

further suggests that shifts in the demographic, industrial, and occupational

composition of employment can explain little of the decline in unionization

between 1977 and 1984.



II. A                 Model of the   Extent      of Unionization

        The simplest empirical model of the union status of workers is a

univariate discrete choice model. In         this model   a worker is unionized (U. =1)
                                                                                  1

only   if some latent variable, Y4. ,   is   positive. The interpretation generally
                                                     3


given to this latent variable (for example, Lee, 1978) is that it represents

the difference between worker i's utility on a union job and his/her utility

on a nonunion job. Given that

           (11.1)        Y        = X. /3   +
                             Ii      1 1        Ii

where X. is a vector of worker characteristics, 3 is a vector of parameters,
and          is a random component, the probability of a worker being unionized is

           (11.2)         Pr(U.1 =1) =      Pr(YIi. >0)   =
                                                                         ii
                                                              Pr( 1) >—X. /3 ).
If     •    has a standard normal distribution then this is the usual probit model

so that Pr(U.=1) =
                         +(X131)
                                     where (') is the standard normal cumulative
distribution function.

           A key assumption underlying this model is that all workers who desire

union representation are actually working on a union job. However, there are

good reasons to believe that there is, in fact, excess demand for vacancies

in existing union jobs (Abowd and Farber, 1982; Farber, 1983). This implies

that not all nonunion workers who would prefer their job to be unionized by

the criterion outlined above (Y >0) are willing or able either to find a
                               Ii
union job or to organize their current job. To the extent that this is true,

?r(U.=1)
    1               Ii
               Pr(Y >0). There will be some nonunion workers for whom Y
                                                                                  11 >0, and
the   univariate probit model of union status summarized in equations 11.1 and

11.2 loses its structural interpretation. However, it is still useful as a

summary of the data.

       It is reasonable to ask why all workers who would prefer their job to

be unionized do not organize their job or find a union job. Some nonunion

workers might not be willing to take a different job simply because it is
                                      4

unionized because to do so would entail the sacrifice of seniority rights and

other valuable aspects of their current job.' Second, some workers may prefer

their current job to be unionized, but they may not be willing to undertake

the costs of organization and petitioning for an election. These costs are

bound to exceed the costs of simply supporting an already existing

organization through the payment of dues where others have borne the cost of

organization. Even if some workers might be willing to invest time and effort

in a union organizing drive, such an effort might not be successful so that

the job would remain nonunion. Finally, some workers who may be willing to

quit their current job to take a union job might not be offered a job by a

unionized employer.

      The implication of this discussion is that there are likely to be queues

for vacancies in existing union jobs in the sense that there will be nonunion

workers who would like the benefits of a union job but who would not be

willing to undertake organization themselves. In this context the demand for

union representation is composed of two distinct groups of workers. The first

group consists of those workers who demand union representation and were hired

by a union employer. This group is easy to identify. They are simply the

workers who report themselves to be unionized. The second group consists of

workers who demand union representation but are unable or unwilling either to

find a union job or to organize their current job. This group is more

difficult to identify since they are a subset of the workers who report

themselves as not union members.

      The key to the analysis in this study is that data are available in 1977

and 1984 that can be used to split the group of nonunion workers into a group

that prefers union representation and a group that does not. Essentially,




1See Abraham and Nedoff (1984, 1985) for evidence on the importance of
seniority in nonunion workplaces.
                                      5

nonunion workers were asked if they would prefer their job to be unionized,

and the response to this question (No=O, Yes=1) is interpreted as an indicator

of whether the worker feels that he/she would be better off if the job were

unionized (Y1)O). It is argued that the workers who are in the queue for

union jobs are identified by their response to this question (called VFU here)

and that this measures the demand for union representation among nonunion

workers. A worker is classified as demanding union representation (D1) if

he/she is unionized (13=1) or he/she is not unionized and responds

affirmatively to the union preference question (VFU=1).

      In the light of these considerations, a useful tool for the analysis of

the decline of unionization is an economic model based on movements in the

suppiy of and demand for union representation. A stylized version of such a

model has two components. First, the demand for union representation is based

on the model of rational choice, outlined above for the simple univariate

model of union status determination. Second, the supply of union jobs is

based on the amount of organization undertaken by unions and the success of

these efforts as they affect the number of union jobs available. The quantity

of unionization is determined by the minimum of demand and supply.

      Note that these notions of supply and demand are interdependent.

Employer behavior in response to the threat of unionization will affect both

the net benefits of unionization to workers (demand) and the expected net

benefits of unionization to unions (supply). Employer responses can range

from higher wages and "union—like" personnel policies on the one hand to

outright resistance to union organizing efforts and implicit discrimination

against union supporters on the other. Nevertheless, the distinction will

prove useful.

      The demand for union representation by an individual worker is a

discrete choice problem where the worker compares his/her utility on union and

nonunion jobs and selects the job with the higher utility. This utility
                                                    6

difference is defined above (equation 11.1) as Y1.. Thus, worker i will

prefer union representation (D=l) only if Y1. is positive, and worker i does

not prefer union representation (D.=0) otherwise. On this basis, the

probability that worker i prefers union representation is

        (11.3)            Pr(D.1 =1) =     Pr(Y Ii >0)      =
                                                                           ii
                                                                Pr( Ii >—X. /3 ).
This   is the fundamental relationship for the demand for union representation.

Given data on D. for all workers and assuming a standard normal distribution

for     •   , the   parameter vector /3 can be estimated using standard univariate

probit maximum likelihood techniques.

       The notion of the supply of union jobs relative to demand is based

fundamentally on ability of workers who demand union representation to find a

union job. This will depend not only on the characteristics of the particular

worker but also on employer behavior with regard to unions and organizing as

it affects the total number of union jobs available. For example, more active

employer resistance to unionization will undoubtedly result in the existence

of fewer union jobs, and this will reduce the ability of workers who demand

union representation by the criterion outlined above to find a union job.

       More formally, suppose that a worker who demands union representation

is able to find a union job (S1=1) only if some index                               is positive and is

not able to get a union job (S.=0) otherwise. Let

       (11.4)             Y
                              21
                                   =.x./3
                                     1 2 ÷ 2i
where 82 is a vector of parameters, and                           is a random component. Thus, the

probability that worker i who prefers union representation is able to find a

union job is

       (11.5)             Pr(S.I =1 !D. =1) =Pr(U. =1 !D. =1)
                                       1                1          1

                                             = Pr(Y >0) = Pr(E
                                                   2i          2i               12
                                                                             >-X. /3 ).

Given data on U for all workers who demand union representation and assuming
                                             7

a standard normal distribution for e !D=1, the parameter vector         can be

estimated using standard univariate probit maximum likelihood techniques.2

This conditional probability is fundamentally related to the supply of union

jobs, and it neatly accounts for much of the confusion of factors that affect

demand and supply because it is a measure of the supply of union jobs relative

to demand.

       Based on these relationships, a worker i will be unionized (U.=l) only

if he/she both prefers a union job and is able to find one (Y1. andY,. are

positive). The probability of this event is

       (11.6)            Pr(U.=1)=Pr(D=1)Pr(S.=1ID.=1)
                             1       1        1    1

                                 =   Pr(YIi.>0)Pr(Y2x>0).
It is clear that with data only on union status it is not possible to estimate

the determinants of demand (Y1.) and supply (Y,.) separately with any

robustness. However with data on the demand and supply, such estimation is

possible.3



III. The Data and Sampling Issues

       Data from two surveys that contain information on nonunion worker demand

for union representation independent of union status are used in the analysis.




2Farber (1983, 1984) develops and estimates a multivariate probit model where
 2i• has a standard normal distribution so that 2i ID.=1
                                                       • has a distribution
                                                     1
that depends on the joint distribution of           and E. Farber (1984) derives
estimates of /3 using both the univariate probit model and the multivariate
probit model based on the 1977 QES data, and they are virtually identical. On
this basis, the analysis proceeds using the more straightforward univariate
probit model. This is equivalent to assuming that      and e   are
independently distributed.

31n fact, it is possible to derive estimates of the determinants of demand and
supply separately with data only on union status, but identification will
depend crucially on the functional forms chosen for the distributions of
and        .   See Poirier (1980).
      2i
                                         8

The first survey (QES) is the Quality of Employment Survey (QES), which was

carried out by the Survey Research Center at the University of Nichigan in

1977 (Quinn and Staines, 1979). The second survey (AFL) was carried out by

Lewis Harris and Associates Inc. for the American Federation of Labor —

Congress of Industrial Organizations in 1984 (Lewis Harris and Associates,

1984).

         The QES was designed to be a representative sample of American workers.

However, the AFI survey is not representative of the workforce in that, since

its goal was to learn about the attitudes of nonunion workers toward unions in

order to aid organizing efforts, unionized workers were "quota sampled".

Workers were contacted randomly by Harris, and all nonunion workers who met

certain criteria (age over eighteen, employed, not self—employed) were

administered the survey. Union workers who were contacted and who met the

criteria were administered the survey until a quota of 250 was reached. Any

union workers contacted after this point were counted but not administered the

survey. Given the central role that union membership plays as an endogenous

variable in the analysis, this creates a classic choice—based sampling problem

(Manski and Lerman, 1977; Manski and McFadden, 1981). This is accounted for

in the analysis that follows in two ways. Where frequencies are analyzed, the

counts are weighted appropriately. Where probit models involving the

probability of union membership are estimated, a straightforward modification

(to accommodate the discrete choice nature of the problem) of the maximum

likelihood choice—based sampling procedure suggested by Hausman and Wise

(1981) is used.

      Samples of workers were derived from the two surveys in an identical

fashion. These samples consist of all non—managerial workers who were not

self—employed and for whom complete information was available on the workers'

demographic characteristics, industry, occupation, union status, preference

for union representation, attitudes about the general usefulness of unions,
                                          9

 and job satisfaction. The QES sample has 920 observations while the AFL

 sample has 1082 observations. Table 2 contains sample proportions (both

 overall and for 1977 and 1984 separately) for the labor force structure

 measures that are used in the analysis.

        In order to account for the undersampling of union workers in the AFL

survey, the degree of undersampling needs to be estimated. Actually, this is

quite simple because Harris kept track of the number of union workers who were

"quota'd out". After administering the survey to the 250 union workers, an

additional 28 union workers were contacted but not surveyed. Assuming (as is

reasonable) that the sample selection criteria outlined above have the same

proportional impact on those actually surveyed and those who were quota'd out,

the probability of observing a randomly selected union worker who meets the

sample selection criteria in the final sample is simply .899=250/278. On this

basis a value of .9 is used for this probability, and counts of union workers

from the AFL sample are weighted by 1.11=11.9.

       The key information contained in both the QES and and the AFL survey is

the response of nonunion workers to a question (VFU) asking whether they would

vote for union representation on their current job if a secret ballot election

were held. The response to this question (No=O, Yes=1) is interpreted as an

indication of the worker's demand for union representation. An affirmative

response (VFU=1) suggests that the worker feels he/she would be better off if

the job were unionized (Y1.0). Similarly, a negative response suggests that

the worker feels he/she would be better off if the job were not unionized

(Y1-i.<0).

       Neither   survey asks the analogous question of unionized workers.

However, since nonunion jobs are relatively freely available, it is assumed

that all unionized workers are unionized because they prefer their jobs to be

unionized and that they would answer the VFU question affirmatively (Y. >0).

This is clearly not completely accurate, and there are likely to be some
                                           I

 unionized workers who would prefer their job not to be unionized. However,
 there is relevant evidence from the National Longitudinal Surveys of Young Men

 and Young Women which asks the VFU question of unionized workers in 1980 and

 1982 respectively. In samples constructed similarly to those used in this

 study, only about 11%   of   unionized workers reported that they prefer their job

not to be unionized.4

      Simple tabulation of the data confirm the dramatic decline in

unionization between 1977 and 1984. Fully 32.9% of the workers in the 1977

QES reported that they were union members while only 20.1% (21.8% weighted) of

the 1984 AFL survey reported that they were union members. Tabulation of the

data also verifies that the demand for union representation and the supply of

union jobs relative to demand fell between 1977 and 198g. The demand for

union representation among nonunion workers, Pr(D=1IU=0), is the fraction of

the nonunion sample that responded affirmatively to the VFU question. This

fell from 39.5% in 1977 to 32.4% in 1984. The overall demand for union

representation, Pr(D=1), is the sum of the fraction of the sample that is

unionized and the fraction of the sample that is nonunion and responded

affirmatively to the VFU question. On this basis, the demand for union

representation fell from 59.5% in 1977 to 47.1% (weighted) in 1984. Finally,

the supply of union jobs relative to demand is measured by the fraction

unionized of the workers who demand union representation. This is

Pr(tJ=1ID=1), and it fell from 55.4% in 1977 to 46.3% (weighted) in 1984.

These frequencies are summarized in table 3, and the sample proportions of the

labor force structure measures for the workers who demand union representation

are contained in the last column of table 2.




4mese data are not analyzed in detail here because they sample only a limited
age range of workers (late twenties to late thirties).

      With this information, the decline in union membership from 32.9% in

1977 to 21.8% in 1984 can be broken out into components due to the drop in

demand from 59.5% to 47.1% and the drop in supply relative to demand from

55.4% to 46.3%. Taking the differential of equation (11.6) yields

      (111.1) APr(U=1)=APr(D=1)Pr(S=1D=1)]+Pr(D
                 1         1      1    1        1=l)APr(S=11D.=l))

                                1        1   1

The first term represents the effect of a change in demand, the second term

represents the effect of a change in supply, and the last term is a second

order term that can be safely ignored here. Based on the numbers derived

above and using the average of the 1977 and 1984 levels, of the 11.1

percentage point drop in unionization, 6.3 points are due to a decline in

demand and 4.8 points are due to a decline in supply relative to demand.

Thus, both factors have been very important.

      This analysis, which is essentially a comparison of means, relies

heavily on the comparability of the QES and the AFL1 sampling designs. It is

clear from table 2 that there are some differences in the means of the labor

force structure measures between the two samples that are not likely to be the

result of changes in labor force structure over the seven year period between

the surveys. The next step is to estimate multivariate discrete choice models

that can account for observable differences in the relevant probabilities.

This will also shed light on the extent to which the declines in these various

measures can be accounted for by the standard explanations of shifts in the

demographic, occupational, and   industrial   composition of the labor force.
                                                 12

 Before turning to estimation of the discrete choice models specified in

 section II, it is necessary to specify a probit estimator that can account for

 the choice—based nature of the AFI1 data.



 IV. The Choice-Based Sample Probit 1odel

        Following Hausman and Wise (1981), consider a random variable y                          with
 density function f(y). Assume that y is sampled with probability p1 if y is

 less than zero and that y is sampled with probability p7 if y is greater than

or equal to zero. In this case the distribution of y in the resulting sample

is
                                                  p1 f (y)

        (IV.1)        h(y) =
                                        ——s-
                                                               ——
                                                                                    for   y<O.
                                    p   J      f(w)d     +
                                                             p,[
and


                                                  p2f(y)
        (IV.2)        h(y) =                                   ——                   for yO.
                                        —--
                                    p J        f (w)   d +   p2 J   f   (ca)   dw

Note that is is essentially a variable weighting procedure.

        Consider first estimating the simple probit model of union status

outlined in equations 11.1 and 11.2. Workers are undersampled if they are

both unionized and from the AFL sample. In this context, P1=1 for all

observations, and, based on the evidence presented earlier in this section,

        (Iv.3)        P        = (1—Am.) +AFL.*o.9
                          2i                 x

for   observation i, where AFL. is a dummy variable that equals 1 if the

observation is from the AFL sample and equals 0 if the observation is from the

QES sample. The choice—based density function in equations IV.1 and IV.2

reduce to f(y) for the QES sample because both P1 and P2 equal one for these

observations.

       Given the standard normal distribution of the errors and the choice

based nature of the sample, the probability that a worker is unionized is
                                              13

                                              P 2i .(X.fl)
                                                       1

        (IV.4)         Pr(U.1 =1) =         ———————————,
                                        [l-(X.Ifl) + P ..4'(X.13)
                                              1       2i     1

where        is defined in equation IV.3. Similarly, the probability that a

worker is not unionized is l—Pr(U.=l) which is
                                         1

                                                      1

                                        [l—(X.i)]
                                             1
                                                     + P
                                                           2i +(X./3)
                                                                  1

and the log—likelihood function can be formed in a straightforward manner from

these probabilities.

        The model of demand for union representation is specified in a similar

fashion. However, only the union workers from the AFL sample are

undersampled. The nonunion workers from the AFL sample and all workers from

the QES sample are appropriately represented. In this case,

        (IV.6)        P        =   (1-AFL.) +AFL*(1-U.) +AFL.*U.*O.9,
                          2i             1      i     1      1  1

so that the sampling rate equals one for all but the union observations from

the AFL sample. The probability that a worker demands union representation is



        (IV.7)        Pr(D.1 =1) =
                                              P 21     ii
                                                 •(X.i3 )
                                             ——————————,
                                        [l—(X.3
                                             1 1             i1
                                               )] + P 2j.•(X./3
where D=1 if the worker either is unionized or is nonunion and responds
affirmatively to the VFU question and D.=O if the worker is nonunion and

responds negatively to the VFU question. Pr(D.=O) is simply 1-Pr(D.=1), and

the log—likelihood function is derived straightforwardly.

        The model of demand for union representation among nonunion workers is

the same model as for the demand for union representation overall. However,

there are obviously no union workers so there is no choice—based sampling

problem and the probability in equation (IV.7) reduces to a simple probit

specification.

        The model of the supply of union jobs relative to demand is specified

identically to the model of the probability of unionization except that it is
                                       14

 estimated only over the subsample of workers who demand a union job (D=1).

 The probability that a worker who demands union representation is actually

 unionized is
                                               P2x•(X.!3
                                                      1 2

                         1   1
                                            i 2 )] + P 2i•(X.i32
                                       [1—(xf3               1

 and P,. is as defined in equation (IV.3). The Pr(U1=O!D=1) is simply

 1—Pr(U.=1!D.=1), and the log—likelihood function is derived from these

 probabilities in a straightforward fashion.



 V. The Decline in the Fraction Unionized

       Before investigating the demand for and relative supply of union jobs,

 it is worth investigating the change in the fraction unionized between 1977

 and 1984. Table 4 contains estimates of the choice—based sample probit model

 of the probability that a worker is unionized discussed in section IV. This

model does not have a structural interpretation, but it is useful as a summary

of the data. The model in the first column includes only a constant and the

AFL dummy variable. The estimated coefficient on the AFL dummy is

significantly less than zero, suggesting that that probability of unionization

was lower in 1984. The model in the second column includes an additional

nineteen dummy variables (defined in table 2) that control for various

dimensions of labor force structure (sex, race, age, region, industry, and

occupation). These labor force structure variables clearly are significantly

related to the probability of unionization based on a likelihood ratio test.5

The coefficient of the MI dummy variable in the model that includes the labor

force structure variables is still significantly negative and of approximately

the same magnitude as in the basic model.




5The likelihood ratio test statistic is 302.8 (p—value < .0001) which is
distributed as x with 19 degrees of freedom.

Note: Labor Force Structure includes a set of 19 variables for sex, race,
age, education, industry, and occupation. The numbers in parentheses are
asymptotic standard errors. The 1977 mean probability is computed using the
actual values of the labor force structure variables for the combined sample
assuming AFL.=0 for all observations. The 1984 mean probability is computed
using the actual values of the labor force structure variables for the
combined sample assuming AFL.=1 for all observations.

          While the results are not presented here, the model was reestimated

 allowing labor force structure to have different effects on the probability of

 unionization in the two years. A separate probit model was estimated for each

 year (choice—based for 1984). On the basis of these results, it is not

 possible to reject the hypothesis that the parameters of the labor force

 structure variables are the same in 1977 and 1984 against the model with a

 single set of labor force structure variables plus an intercept shift for

 1984.6

        Given the nonlinearity of the probit model, the negative estimated

 coefficient for the AFIJ variable does not imply an invariant relationship with

 the probability of unionization. In order to interpret the results correctly,

the lower half of table 4 contains mean predicted probabilities of

unionization for the entire sample under two assumptions. First it is assumed

that it is 1977 for all workers (AFI. = 0 V i). This mean probabilIty is

computed as
                            1

        (V.1)          P77 =—
                            N i=(X.77i3)
where   /3 is the vector of estimated parameters and X.77 is the vector of labor

force structure variables with AFL1 forced to zero for all observations.

Next, it is assumed that it is 1984 for all workers (AFI. = 1 V i). This mean

probability is computed in a similar fashion as

        (V.2)
                       P84 =—.(Xf3)
where X
          i84 is the vector of labor force structure variables with AFI.
                                                                       1
                                                                         forced

to one for all observations. The difference in these mean probabilities is




6The likelihood atio test statistic is 17.0 (p—value = .52) which is
distributed as    with 18 degrees of freedom. There are nineteen labor force
structure variables, but there were no union workers in the finance, insurance
and real estate industry category so that its coefficient could not be
estimated for 1984. The result is 18 degrees of freedom for the test.

 first order approximations to the nonlinear function of random variables.

       The estimates in the first column of table 4 confirm a statistically

 significant 11.4 percentage point drop in the mean probability of unionization

between 1977 and 1984. The key finding is that, even after controlling for

 labor force structure, the mean probability of unionization is fully 10.2

percentage points lower in 1984 than in 1977.

      The conclusions are 1) that the raw difference between 1977 and 1984 in

the probability of unionization is not an artifact of different sample designs

and 2) that changes in labor force structure can account for very little of

the overall decline in unionization over the past decade. This contrasts with

evidence from the 1950—1980 period (Farber, 1985; Dickens and Leonard, 1985)

which suggests that as much as half of the decline in unionization over that

period can be accounted for by structural shifts in the labor force. The

explanation for the recent decline must lie elsewhere.



VI. The Decline in Demand for Unionization

      Table 5 contains estimates of the choice-based probit model of the

probability that a worker demands union representation. This analysis is

identical to the analysis of the probability of union membership in the

previous section except that the dependent dichotomous -variable equals one not

only for union members but also for nonunion workers who would vote for union

representation.

      The model in the first column of table 5 includes only a constant and

the AFL dummy variable. The estimated coefficient on the AFL dummy is

significantly less than zero, reflecting the fact that the demand for union

representation was lower in 1984 than in 1977. The model in the second column

includes the nineteen labor force structure dummy variables. Based on a

likelihood ratio test, these labor force structure variables clearly are

representation.7

      While the results are not presented here, the model was reestimated

allowing labor force structure to have different effects in the two years on

the probability of that a worker demands union representation. A separate

probit model was estimated for each year (choice—based for 1984). The

hypothesis that the parameters of the labor force structure variables are the

same in 1977 and 1984 can be rejected at the 5% level but not the 1% level of

significance against the model with a single set of labor force structure

variables plus an intercept shift for 1984.8

      In order to interpret the results quantitatively, the lower half of

table 5 contains mean predicted probabilities of the demand for union

representation for both 1977 and 1984. These probabilities are defined in the

same manner as the mean predicted probabilities of union membership computed

in the previous section. The estimates in the first column confirm a

statistically significant 13.0 percentage point drop between 1977 and 1984 in

the mean probability that a worker demands union representation. Once again,

the key finding is that, even after controlling for labor force structure, the

mean probability that a worker demands union representation is fully 10.9

percentage points lower in 1984 than in 1977.

      The conclusions, consistent with the analysis in the previous section,

are 1) that changes in labor force structure can account for very little of

the overall decline in the demand for union representation over the past

decade and 2) that the difference between 1977 and 1984 in the demand for

probability that a worker who demands union representation is, in fact,

unionized. This analysis is identical to the the analysis of the probability

of union membership in section V except that the model is estimated over the

sub—sample of only those workers who either are union members or are nonunion

but would vote affirmatively for union representation.

      The model in the first column of table 6 includes only a constant and

significantly less than zero, reflecting the fact that that the supply of

union jobs relative to demand was lower in 1984 than in 1977. The model in

the second column includes the nineteen labor force structure dummy variables.

Based on a likelihood ratio test, these labor force structure variables

clearly are significantly related to the probability of that a worker who

wants a union job is actually unionized.9

allowing labor force structure to have different effects on the probability of

 that the parameters of the labor force structure variables are the same in

 1977 and 1984.10

       In order to interpret the results quantitatively, the lower half of

 table 6 contains mean predicted probabilities for both 1977 and 1984 that a

 worker is unionized conditional on demanding union representation. These

 probabilities are defined in the same manner as the mean predicted

 probabilities computed in the previous two sections. The estimates in the

 first column confirm a statistically significant 9.1 percentage point drop

 between 1977 and 1984 in the mean probability that a worker who demands union

 representation is actually unionized. As before, the key finding is that,

 even after controlling for labor force structure, the mean probability that a

worker is unionized conditional on demanding union representation is still

substantially lower (8.7 percentage points) in 1984 than in 1977.

      The conclusions, consistent with the analyses in the previous two

sections, are 1) that changes in labor force structure can account for very

little of the overall decline over the past decade in the supply of union jobs

relative to demand and 2) that the raw difference between 1977 and 1984 in the

relative supply of union jobs is not simply an artifact of sample design

differences.




VIII. Increased Employ Resistance as an Explanation for the Decline in

      Unionization

      The evidence presented to this point clearly shows that insubstantial

fractions of the declines in the probability of unionization, the demand for




10The likelihood2ratio test statistic is 10.4 (p—value = .918) which is
distributed as x with 18 degrees of freedom. There are nineteen labor force
structure variables, but there were no union workers in the finance, insurance
and real estate industry category so that its coefficient could not be
estimated for 1984. The result is 18 degrees of freedom for the test.
                                       20

 union representation, and the relative supply of union jobs can be accounted

 for by shifts in the structure of the labor force. This is consistent with

 the view that the decline is associated with an increase in employer

resistance to unionization (Freeman, 1985). The key direct evidence for this

increased resistance is the dramatic decrease in the quantity of union

organizing activity and success over the last decade coupled with the equally

dramatic increase over the last decade in representation election related

unfair labor practice charges filed by unions against employers.

      The form of increased employer resistance ranges from outright hostility

to unions to the improvement of wages and/or working conditions so that

workers don't feel they need union. One key tactic is to hire

labor—management consultants whose hallmark is defeating unions in

representation elections. Freeman (1985) outlines three approaches that these

consultants take. First, they can emphasize "positive labor relations" by

which it is meant having the nonunion employer provide a union—like

environment including higher wages, better fringe benefits, workplace

due—process, etc. Second, they can conduct a very active but legal campaign

that includes much communication with workers regarding their views of what

unionization will mean, gerrymandering of the unit of representation, and

delay of the election itself. Finally, they can conduct an illegal election

campaign by committing obvious unfair labor practices. There is evidence from

data on individual votes in actual NLRB elections that very active legal

campaigns and illegal campaigns have a significant influence on the outcomes

of representation elections (Dickens, 1983). In addition, there is evidence

that simply delaying the election significantly reduces the probability of

union success in representation elections (Roomkin and Block, 1981).

     Table 7 contains data on trends in union organizing activity. The first

column of the table contains the percentage of nonunion workers who were

eligible to vote in National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) supervised

representation elections. Eligible workers are those who worked in potential

bargaining units where elections were held. This percentage fell from 1.15%

in 1970 to 0.27% in 1983, the last year for which data are available. This

measures the decline in the quantity of organizing activity undertaken, and it

may reflect increased employer resistance to union organizing for two reasons.

First, to the extent that increased employer resistance takes the form of

outright hostility to union organizing efforts, unions and workers will

perceive a lower probability of success in organizing efforts. The result is

that fewer elections will be undertaken, and the supply of union jobs relative

to demand (as measured in this study) will be reduced. Second, to the extent

that employer resistance takes the form of improved wages and working

conditions and 'tpositive labor relations", the measured demand for union

representation will be lower and there will be less election activity.

      The second column of table 7 contains data on union success in the

elections that they do undertake as measured by the percentage of elections

undertaken that are won by unions. This percentage fell from 55.2% in 1970 to

43.0% in 1983. This is likely to reflect the increased sophistication of

employer responses to explicit organizing efforts and to result in a reduction

in the relative supply of union jobs. That employers are responding more

aggressively to union organizing efforts is clear from the data contained in

the third column of table 7 which show that. the number of employer unfair

labor practice charges per election rose from 2.61 in 1970 to 7.45 in 1982.

      These unfair labor practices are a set of activities of employers that

are proscribed under the National Labor Relations Act because they are felt to

interfere with employees' rights to make a free decision regarding collective

organization. Examples are threats, harassment, firing, and unduly

pessimistic claims of what will result from unionization. This resistance

makes it more difficult for unions to organize for any given level of demand,

and unios and workers will   be less   willing to undertake organization efforts.
                                        22

 This can account for at least part of the decline in both the quantity of

 election activity and union success with election activity documented in table

 7.

       The reasons for this increased employer resistance to unionization are

 not clear. It may be that new and more effective tactics to resist union

 organization have been invented in a manner analogous to technological

 advancement in any production process. In particular, it has been argued

casually that the advent of labor—management consultants is just this sort of

event. However, it is more likely that the costs of unionization to firms

have increased. This would provide firms with an incentive to resist

unionization more strenuously than in the past both by utilizing existing

techniques for remaining nonunion and by "inventing" new and more effective

techniques. Viewed in this context, the increased use of labor—management

consultants is demand driven, and the discussion of increased employer

opposition must start with a discussion of how the economic environment has

changed with regard to the ability of unionized firms to compete successfully.

      The most obvious change in the U. S. economy over the past decade is the

increased level of foreign competition, particularly in the manufacturing

sector that has formed the heart of the union movement in the United States.

Some newly tabulated data on import penetration illustrate this graphically.11

In 1958 only 2.5% of manufacturing sales in the U. S. were imports. This rose

to 7.2% by 1977 and to 11.0% by 1984.

      To. the extent that unions raise production costs, some of this increase

in imports is likely to be due to the unions themselves. However, it is also

likely that other countries have rapidly developed industrial capacity that

rivals (and in some cases even surpasses) our own for reasons unrelated to




See Abbwd (1987) for a description of these data.
                                       23

unionization in the United States. In any case, in the past, with no

significant foreign competition, it may be that American firms could afford to

accommodate higher costs associated with labor unions by sharing some of the

gains of a relatively closed economy with their workers. However, the

increased openness of the American economy may make it prohibitively expensive

to bear these higher costs because higher product prices will not be borne by

consumers who have attractive foreign alternatives.

      Another structural change in the U. S. economy is the deregulation of

some key heavily unionized industries such as trucking and airlines. These

industries have become much more competitive since the government removed

entry barriers and rate regulation.12 In this more competitive environment

firms may resist unionization more strenuously than in the past because their

market position is no longer protected by the government.

      Some recent evidence, developed by Abowd and Farber (1987), on the

relationship between the decline in union organizing activity and product

market competition in U. S. Nanufacturing is mixed. They argue that changes

in product market competition, as reflected in changes in the total quantity

of quasi—rents available to be divided between the union and the employer, is

an important determinant of the quantity of union organizing activity. As

expected, they find that union organizing activity is positively related to

the change in the total quantity of quasi—rents but that there is still a

substantial negative time trend to organizing activity that is not explained

by changes in product market competition. In addition, they are unable to

find any relationship between changes in import penetration and union

organizing activity. However, Cone (1987) finds that there is a positive




12See Rose (1985, 1987) for analyses of the the relationships among regulation,
market power, and unions in the trucking industry. The problems of both the
firms and the unions in the airline industry are common knowledge.
                                       24

relationship between changes in import penetration and employer unfair labor

practices.

      Overall, increased employer resistance may account for some of the

decline in the demand for and relative supply of unionization. However, the

reasons for increased employer resistance are not well understood. An

important missing piece of the puzzle is a full understanding of the decline

in the demand for union representation among nonunion workers documented in

the last column of table 3. While this may be due in part to increased

employer resistance, particularly of the "positive labor relations" variety,

it may also be due to changing economic circumstances and attitudes among the

nonunion workforce. This is the focus of the next two sections.



IX. The Decline in the Demand for Unionization among Nonunion Workers:

    Is it Explained bi Shifts in Labor Force Structure?

      The decline in demand for unionization among nonunion workers is an

important contributor to the overall decline in the demand for unionization.

Evidence was presented earlier that the fraction of nonunion workers who

desired union representation fell from 39.5% to 32.4% between 1977 and 1984.

Further evidence of the long run decline in demand for union representation

comes from the data on NLRB supervised representation elections discussed in

the previous section and contained in table 7.

      The possibility that the decline in the demand for unionization among

nonunion workers can be fully accounted for by structural shifts in the labor

force can be dismissed easily. Estimates of a simple probit model of the VFU

measure over the sample of nonunion workers including a constant and a dummy

variable for the AFL survey are contained in the first column of table 8.13




13Note that the undersampling of unionized workers in the ATh survey does not
affect this analysis because it deals strictly with nonunion workers.

 The bottom panel of the table contains mean predicted probabilities that a

 nonunion worker demands union representation first assuming that all 1482

 workers are in 1977 and then assuming that all 1482 workers are in 1984.14

 These results verify that the demand for union representation among nonunion

 workers fell from 39.5% in 1977 to 32.4% in 1984 for a drop of 7.1 percentage

 points.

       Estimates of the probit model containing the 19 labor structure

 variables are contained in the second column of table 8. Based on a

 likelihood ratio test, these labor force structure variables clearly are

 significantly related to the probability of that a nonunion worker demands

 union representation.15 The coefficient of the AFI dummy variable is still

significantly negative at conventional levels.    The mean predicted

probabilities reported in the bottom panel of the table suggest that the

demand for union representation was a statistically significant 5.0 percentage

points lower in 1984 than in 1977. Thus, structural shifts can account for

about thirty percent of the decline in demand for union representation among

nonunion workers.

      While the results are not presented here, the model was reestimated

allowing labor force structure to have different effects on the probability

that a nonunion worker demand union representation in the two years. A

separate probit model was estimated f or each year, and it is not possible to

X. Job Satisfactioi Union InstrumentalitL and the Deci        in Demand

       An important theme in an earlier literature on the demand for union

representation is that workers join unions in order both to improve their

wages and to protect themselves from what they feel is arbitrary treatment by

their supervisors (Rees, 1962). Seidman, Karsh, and London (1951), in their

important study of "Why Workers Join Unions" argue (p.77)

               that personal experiences in the plant play a large part in the
       thinking of workers, and that an unpleasant personal experience becomes
       a powerful motivation that turns workers toward a union . .   . ."
Following    these arguments, Farber and Saks (1980) investigate the role that

a worker's satisfaction with his/her job and a worker's perceptions of the

ability of unions to address problems on the job play in determining a

worker's vote in a representation election. They find strong support for the

view that workers are more likely to vote for union representation when they

are dissatisfied and feel that unions can improve conditions in the relevant

dimension.

       These considerations are relevant for the analysis of the decline in the

demand for union representation among nonunion workers. By working with a

sample of strictly nonunion workers it is appropriate to investigate the role

of subjective variables, specifically measures of job satisfaction and worker

attitudes toward unions in general, that may play a key role in determining

the demand for union representation. It would not be appropriate to analyze

these variables across union and nonunion jobs because they would play very

                                            27

 different roles. For exanpie, we would expect that nonunion workers who were

 dissatisfied with their job to be more likely to demand union representation.

At the same time, union members who were dissatisfied with their job would be

less favorably disposed toward union representation.

       It is fortunate that the QES and the AFL survey have comparable measures

of job satisfaction in two key dimensions (pay and job security) as well as

overall job satisfaction. The three measures of satisfaction were developed

using a four value response scale. These were recoded to two values (1 =

satisfied,   0 =   not   satisfied) 17 The two surveys also have comparable measures

of worker perceptions of the ability of unions in the abstract to improve

wages and working conditions (union instrumentality). This was also recoded

from a four value response scale to two values (1= unions improve wages and
                                            18
working conditions, 0 = unions do not).          In both surveys, the questions

referred to are worded virtually identically, and the allowed responses are

scaled alike. While there may be problems due to the fact that the two

surveys are different in overall structure, the properties of the samples are

similar enough and the particular questions are similar enough to proceed with

a comparison with some confidence.

      The first part of table 9 contains information on the fraction of the

workers in the QES and AFLI samples that reported satisfaction in each of the

three dimensions. It is clear from this table that both union and nonunion

workers reported very high levels of overall satisfaction with their jobs in

1977 and 1984. Union workers' satisfaction fell slightly between 1977 and




17
  The four possible responses to these questions (How satisfied are you with
  • ?) were 1) very satisfied, 2) somewhat satisfied, 3) somewhat
dissatisfied, and 4) very dissatisfied.

       question was "Tell me if you 1) agree strongly, 2) agree somewhat, 3)
disagree somewhat, or 4) disagree strongly that unions improve the wages and
working conditions of workers."

1984 while nonunion workers' satisfaction rose slightly. Union workers report

slightly lower levels of satisfaction in 1977 with the specific aspects of

their jobs reported on in table 3, but these levels rose slightly by 1984. A

substantially different picture emerges from analysis of the satisfaction of

nonunion workers with specific aspects of their jobs. Aside from the

relatively low reported satisfaction with pay in 1977, the most striking

result is that reported levels of satisfaction with pay and job security among

nonunion workers rose dramatically between 1977 and 1984. This suggests that

at least part of the decline in the demand for unionization may be due to less

dissatisfaction on the part of nonunion workers.

      The reasons for this increase in perceived job satisfaction are not

clear. Satisfaction with pay may reflect how workers evaluate their pay

relative to either their best alternatives or to some norm that they consider

equitable. Given the well known decline in real earnings since the

mid—1970's, the general increase in worker satisfaction with pay then suggests

that the standards against which workers judge their wages fell. In other

words the period from 1977 through 1984 is marked by declining expectations,

and this may be a cause of the decrease in demand for union representation.

      It may also be that the increased reported satisfaction is the result of

cognitive dissonance by workers. This argument runs that the chances of

workers improving their current situation have deteriorated since 1977 and

that workers protect themselves psychologically by convincing themselves that

they are satisfied with the current situation. In other words, it is

unhealthy for an individual to be unhappy about a situation over which he/she

has no control so a natural defense is to convince oneself that he/she is not

unhappy.
      It is tempting to argue that the measured increase in satisfaction among

nonunion workers is a statistical artifact due to the fact that the

satisfaction measures were derived frorn   cuite   different surveys in different
                                        29

environments. However, the contrast between the union and nonunion fractions

in table 9 belie this argument. If there were a systematic bias in the

responses, say toward more satisfaction in the AFL survey, we would expect

this to show up in the union responses as well as the nonunion responses. The

fact that it does not is strong evidence that there has been a "real'

change.

      With regard to union instrumentality, the numbers in the second part of

table 9 suggest that, while most nonunion workers still believe that unions

improve the wages and working conditions of workers, the fraction of nonunion

workers who believe that unions are effective in this dimension fell

substantially from 1977 to 1984. Thus, nonunion workers are less likely to

believe that unions can help with a central area of concern on the job, and

this too may be a cause of the decline in demand for union representation.

Over the same period of time, the fraction of union workers who reported that

they believe that unions improve wages and working conditions actually

increased slightly.

      It remains to demonstrate the links between worker preferences for union

representation and these subjective measures of job satisfaction and union

instrumentality. The third column of table 8 contains estimates of a simple

probit model of th demand for union representation among nonunion workers

that includes the four subjective variables along with the set of controls for

labor force structure. All of the satisfaction measures have a statistically

significant effect (p—values < .001) in the hypothesized direction on nonunion

workers' preferences for union representation. Workers who are satisfied with

their job are significantly less likely to demand union representation. The

single measure of union instrumentality also performs as expected. Workers

who feel that unions improve pay and working conditions are significantly more

likely to desire union representation than workers who do not feel that unions

are instrumental   in this dimension.
                                            30

            While the results are not presented here, the model was reestimated

allowing the labor force structure, job satisfaction, and union

instrumentality variables to have different effects on the probability that a

nonunion worker demand union representation in the two years. A separate

probit model was estimated for each year, and it is not possible to reject the

hypothesis at conventional levels that the parameters of the labor force

structure variables are the same in 1977 and 1984.19

            To get a feel for the magnitude of the effects of job satisfaction on

the demand for union representation, table 10 contains mean predicted

probabilities over the entire sample of 1482 nonunion workers assuming

particular configurations of the satisfaction variables for all workers.

These are based on the estimates in column 3 of table 8, and the magnitudes

are impressive. If it is assumed that all workers are not satisfied with

their job overall (SAT=0), the mean probability that a nonunion worker demands

union representation is fully 23 percentage points higher (s.e. =      4.1) than in
the case where it is assumed that all workers are satisfied with their job

(SA'r=l). The difference is somewhat smaller, though still quite large for

the other two measures of satisfaction. If it is assumed that all workers are

not satisfied in any of the dimensions, the mean probability that a worker

demands union representation is a dramatic 47.4 percentage points higher (s.e.

=    4.2)    than in the case where all workers are satisfied in all three

dimensions.

            Table 10 also contains mean predicted probabilities assuming particular

configurations of the union instrumentality variable. It is clear that worker

perceptions of union instrumentality are quite important. If all workers are

assumed to feel that unions improve wages and working conditions, the mean

probability that a worker demands union representation is 17.2 percentage

points higher (s.e. =     2.7)   than in the case where no workers feel that unions

improve wages and working conditions. This works quite powerfully in

conjunction with the satisfaction measures. In the extreme case, where all

workers feel that unions improve wages and working conditions and where all

workers are not satisfied in any of the three dimensions, the mean probability

that a worker demands union representation is 63.7 percentage points higher

(s.e. =   4.4)   than in the case where no workers feel that unions improve wages

and working conditions and all workers are satisfied with their jobs in each

of the three dimensions.

      The conclusion from the analysis in table 10 is that job satisfaction

and perceptions of union instrumentality are very important factors in

individual worker demand for union representation. The magnitude of the

effects of these variables dwarfs the decline in demand between 1977 and 1984

summarized in table 8. This lends strong support to the views, expressed in

the earlier literature and cited earlier in this section, that a central force

motivating workers to demand union representation is "unpleasant personal

experience" in Seidman, Karsh, and London's (1951) terms.

      With regard to the decline in the demand for unionization between 1977

and 1984, it is clear from the estimates in the third column of table 8, that

the coefficient of the AFL dummy variable is not significantly different from

zero at any reasonable level after controlling f or the satisfaction and

instrumentality variables. The mean predicted probabilities in the third

column of table 8 verify that the probability that a nonunion worker demands

union representation is no lower in 1984 than in 1977 after controlling for

the satisfaction and instrumentality variables.

      Although the results are not presented here, the probit model in the

third column of table 8 was reestintated using     various   subsets of the

satisfaction and instrumentality variables in order to gain some insight into
                                         32

which variable accounts for the disappearance of the decline between 1977 and

1984. No clear answer emerges. Including any one of the four subjective

variables reduces the effect noted in column 2 of table 8. The difference in

predicted mean probabilities is still negative but generally insignificantly

different from zero. Inclusion of overall satisfaction (SAT) has the smallest

effect on the 1984—1977 difference, while inclusion of any one of the other

three measures (SATPAY, SATSEC, or UIMPPAY) has a large effect on the

difference.

      Overall, the decline in demand for union representation by nonunion

workers is fully accounted for by measures of job satisfaction and worker

perceptions of union instrumentality. Nonunion workers who are dissatisfied

with various aspects of their job and/or who perceive that unions improve

wages and working conditions are more likely to demand union representation.

However, for reasons that are not well understood workers are reporting higher

levels of satisfaction in 1984 than in 1977 along with less expectation that

unions are instrumental in improving jobs.



XI. Concluding Remarks

      The dramatic decline since the mid—1970's in the fraction of the labor

force that is unionized is a phenomenon that is not yet fully understood.

Indirect evidence was presented here which showed that employer resistance to

unionization has increased and that, as a result, the ability of workers who

desire union jobs to find such jobs has decreased. This is formalized as a

decline in the supply of union jobs relative to demand. Evidence was also

presented that the demand for union representation among nonunion workers has

declined substantially since the mid—1970's. It was found that very little of

the declines in these quantities can be accounted for by changes in the

structure of the labor force.

      One strong result that    was found is that the decline in demand for
                                        33

 unionization can be fully accounted for by an increase in the satisfaction of

 nonunion workers with their jobs and a decrease in their belief that unions

 are instrumental in improving wages and working conditions of workers in

 general. However, the rationale for this is not obvious. Objectively,

nonunion workers were no better off in 1984 than they were in 1977, but

satisfaction levels increased. It may be that the economic dislocations of

the 1970's and the increased competitiveness of the economy have reduced

workers' expectations.

      The most obvious unresolved issue is exactly why employer resistance to

unionization has increased so dramatically. One obvious answer is the

increased competitiveness of U. S. markets, both in markets for traded goods

and in previously regulated domestic markets. In this more competitive

environment firms may feel that they must be more cost conscious than they

needed to be twenty years ago if they are to thrive. Recent work by Abowd and

Farber (1987) partially supports this view. A related unresolved issue is the

extent to which the increased international competitiveness is due to union

policies that raise employment costs.

      Another answer to the question of increased employer resistance is that

the political and social climate may have changed so that the role that unions

have played in American society and the economy is being called into serious

question for the first time since that role was defined in the 1930's. Some

recent work completed at ?1.I.T. (Kochan, Katz, and McKersie, 1986) suggests

the following scenario. Employers have never accepted unions as an integral

part of their firms, but until the 1970's overt anti—union behavior was not

socially or politically acceptable. The compact forged in the 1930's and

codified as public policy in the NLRA protected the union movement. In the

2.960's employers began to implement effective strategies to remain nonunion

when opening new plants. ''ith the economic recessions of the 1970's and

1980's, more overt anti—union behavior becane socially and politically
                                      34

acceptable, turning what had been a stagnation of the union movement into a

virtual rout. Explicit anti—union strategies, including such tactics as

development of innovative nonunion personnel systems, active resistance to

organizing efforts, and siting of plants in locations unsympathetic to unions,

have become the standard mode of operation in U. S. industry.

       While the change in the strategy of employers could be thought to be the

result of changes in social and political attitudes that arose independently

of economic factors, it is reasonable to conclude that both employers'

strategies and general attitudes toward unions have been affected by the

dramatic changes in the U. S. economy over the past two decades. These

changes, toward an increasingly competitive economy, have made the costs of

unionization to firms much higher than they were thirty or even twenty years

ago.

       What can the union movement do to recoup its losses? The results on

the relationship between worker demand for union representation on the one

hand and job satisfaction and union instrumentality on the other suggest that

the task is to convince workers of the effective role that unions play in the

workplace. However, it may be that until workers feel less satisfaction with

their jobs, this is a nearly impossible task. The recurring theme is that the

competitiveness of the economy has increased dramatically. Unions need to

convince workers that they offer real value in a competitive environment.
