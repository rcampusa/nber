Negative Nominal Interest Rates: Three ways to overcome the zero lower bound

                                             ABSTRACT

The paper considers three methods for eliminating the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates and
thus for restoring symmetry to domain over which the central bank can vary its policy rate. They are:
(1) abolishing currency (which would also be a useful crime-fighting measure); (2) paying negative
interest on currency by taxing currency; and (3) decoupling the numéraire from the currency/medium
of exchange/means of payment and introducing an exchange rate between the numéraire and the currency
which can be set to achieve a forward discount (expected depreciation) of the currency vis-a-vis the
numéraire when the nominal interest rate in terms of the numéraire is set at a negative level for monetary
policy purposes.

Introduction

         There is a notable asymmetry in the design and implementation of monetary policy:

nominal interest rates cannot be negative.                 During boom times, when the economy is

overheating and inflation threatens to rise to undesirable levels, the central bank can raise the

official policy rate (a short, risk-free nominal interest rate) to any level it deems necessary.

During economic downturns, when excess capacity rises and deflation threatens, the official

policy rate can be cut no further than zero. If a further stimulus is desired, unconventional

monetary policy, such as quantitative easing (QE) and credit easing (CE) must be resorted to.

         The zero lower bound is not just of academic interest. In Japan and the US, the

official policy rates are effectively at their zero floors. In the UK, Bank Rate is 0.50 percent,

which the Bank of England regards, for technical operational reasons, as its effective zero

lower bound. In the Euro Area, the official policy rate still stands at 1.00 percent, but the rate

banks get on their reserves with the central bank has been much closer to zero.

         A number of economists have suggested that, using calculations based on variations

of the Taylor rule (a rule that makes the official policy rate an increasing function of the

output gap and of the excess of actual or expected inflation over target inflation) and ignoring

the zero lower bound, the official policy rate in the US early in 2009 should have been as low

as minus 5 percent or even minus 7.5 percent.1 Whatever the merits of the Taylor rule and

the specific calculations, there is a strong case that the zero lower bound has indeed, during

the current downturn, been a binding constraint on central bank interest rate setting.




1
 The minus 7.5 percent figure was suggested in March 2009 as a level of the Federal Funds target rate that
could be required by the end of 2009, by Laurence Meyer, a former Fed Board member, now vice chairman of
Macroeconomic Advisers, in a note to clients. The minus five percent figure was widely reported in April 2009,
as the product of internal analysis prepared by Fed staff for the Federal Reserve's last policy meeting (see e.g.
Financial Times (2009) and Taylor (2009b)).

                                                       1
         The zero lower bound on the short-risk-free nominal interest rate on non-monetary

financial instruments derives from the existence of a risk-free nominal instrument that carries

a zero interest rate. Since the instrument in question, currency, has other attractive properties

that are not shared by other nominally denominated non-monetary stores of value like

Treasury Bills, including legal tender status, and is, for practical purposes, perfectly liquid, a

Treasury Bill with a negative nominal interest rate would be dominated by currency as a store

of value. There would be a simple pure arbitrage opportunity for anyone able to borrow at a

negative nominal interest rate and invest in currency.

         The reason no interest, at a positive or at a negative rate, is paid on currency is that it

is costly and administratively awkward and intrusive to do so. All financial instruments can

be divided into two categories: bearer instruments and registered instruments.                            Bearer

instruments have anonymous owners: the issuer (borrower) does not know the identity of the

owner (holder or bearer).            This makes it difficult to pay positive interest rates: the

owner/bearer could present the same instrument repeatedly for interest due to the owner only

once. The solution is to ‘mark’ the instrument itself, so it can be identified as current on

interest. Historically, this was done by ‘clipping coupons’ of fixed interest bonds or by

stamping the bond document. Paying negative interest on bearer instrument is even harder,

because the issuer has to incentivise the holder to come forward to pay the issuer the interest

due. The holder is anonymous. Why would he volunteer to reveal himself to the issuer?

         Currency being a bearer instrument is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the

payment of interest on currency, positive or negative, to be difficult. Many of the most

common bonds are, after all, bearer instruments.2 Currency, however, is a negotiable bearer



2
  The vast majority of international bonds, historically called Eurobonds, are bearer. Bearer bonds can take two
main forms. First, the traditional definitive style, where the bonds literally are individual pieces of security -
printed paper in denominations of, say, $10,000, which individual holders bring in to paying agents so as to
receive payment of interest and principal. Second, global bonds, which are technically bearer instruments but
                                                        2
bond, and one that is transferable without endorsement. A financial instrument is negotiable

if it is transferable from one party to another by being delivered (with or without

endorsement) so that the title passes to the transferee.34 Thus, not only does the issuer not

know the identity of the holder of a negotiable bearer bond, that holder can change easily and

with little cost. Negotiable bearer bonds make their owners very difficult to keep track of.

The solution is that if you cannot identify the owner, you identify/mark the individual

instruments themselves as current on interest.

         Operationally, this marking of instruments can be achieved by putting an expiration

date on the instrument. Unless interest due by the bearer to the issuer is paid before the

expiration date and the instrument marked is marked as current on interest, the instrument

represents no further claim on the issuer. During the 1930s, there were many experiments, in

continental Europe, Canada and the US, with sub-national stamp scrip money.5 The problem



consist of a single piece of paper representing the entire issue (and so worth hundreds of millions or even
billions of dollars). In practice, the terms of the global bond say that only Euroclear (the settlement system based
in Brussels) or Cedelbank (the settlement system based in Luxembourg) are entitled to the proceeds of the
global bond, and that Euroclear and Cedelbank will in turn divide the proceeds up amongst the end-investors
whose details are stored in their electronic records. Thus the global bond is not an instrument which in practice
can be passed from one owner to another, even though it is technically bearer. Effectively the bonds are
dematerialised.

Bearer bonds are legal and quite common in the UK. While the bearer debenture went out of use, replaced by
the non-negotiable debenture or debenture stock, transferable (in the same way as common stocks) by entry in
the company’s register, a number of new negotiable investment securities have evolved. They include the
modern bearer bond, the negotiable certificate of deposit, and the floating rate note. A limited number of gilts
have also been issued with a bearer option. Before July 1983, municipal securities in the U.S. were issued for
the most part in certificate form with coupons attached. Some of these so-called old-style bearer bonds are still
available in the marketplace. The issuer has no record of who owns these bonds. The owner clips the coupons
and collects the interest from the issuer’s paying agent. Transferring the bonds requires physical delivery and
payment. Bearer bonds issued by municipal authorities were made illegal in the U.S. in 1982.
3
  Key elements of negotiability include the following: (1) transfer by physical delivery; (2) transfer confers on
its holder unchallengeable title and (3) a negotiable instrument benefits from a number of evidential and
procedural advantages in the event of a court action.
4
  An endorsement is a signature on a negotiable instrument indicating a person's intent to become a party to the
instrument.
5
  From the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (2008), I cite the following: “Stamp scrip, sometimes called
coupon scrip, arose in several communities. It was denominated in dollars, in denominations from 25 cents to
$5, with $1 denominations most common. Stamp scrip often became redeemable by the issuer in official U.S.
dollars after one year. What made stamp scrip unique among scrip schemes was a series of boxes on the reverse
side of the note. Stamp scrip took two basic forms-dated and undated (often called "transaction stamp scrip").
Typically, 52 boxes appeared on the back of dated stamp scrip, one for each week of the year. In order to spend
                                                         3
in applying this to government fiat currency is that currency has no expiration date. As a

financial instrument, it is like a zero coupon perpetuity or consol – promise to pay nothing

forever. While private or local government IOUs may lose their value if they are not at some

point redeemable into legal tender (at least in principle), currency is already legal tender. It is

also irredeemable: it does not represent a claim on the issuer for anything other than the same

amount of itself. So incentives have to be created to induce private holders of currency to

reveal their ownership of currency, come forward and pay any negative interest due. No

government has, as yet, had the stomach for that.

        Registered instruments are instruments where the identity of the owner is recorded in

some central register. Common stock is an example. So are bank accounts, including

commercial bank accounts held with the central bank. Negative interest rates on bank

balances would be as easily implemented as positive interest rates – both are just entries in an

electronic ledger. Negative dividends are not technically difficult (it would amount to a

compulsory cash call on the shareholders) although it may not be legally permissible in most

jurisdictions. In addition, since equity has a variable market value, nominal rates of return can

be negative, when dividends and capital gains are considered together. The same holds for

fixed-interest nominal debt instruments.

        This paper considers three methods for removing the zero lower bound on nominal

interest rates. Each follows a quite different route, although the end result is the same. The

first, abolishing currency, ensures that all money (means of payment/media of exchange)

consists of registered instruments on which the payment of positive or negative interest is

trivially easy.    The second, taxing currency, is a means of paying negative interest on


the dated scrip, the stamps on the back had to be current. Each week, a two-cent stamp needed to be purchased
from the issuer and affixed over the corresponding week's box on the back of the scrip. Over the coming week,
the scrip could be spent freely within the community. Whoever was caught holding the scrip at week's end was
required to attach a new stamp before spending the scrip. In this scheme, money became a hot potato, with
individuals passing it quickly to avoid having to pay for the next stamp.”
                                                      4
currency, using what amounts to stamp scrip methods, even though more high-tech ways than

physically stamping bank notes are now available as means of identifying currency notes as

current on interest due. The third method decouples the numéraire function of currency from

its means of payment/medium of exchange function and introduces a variable exchange rate

between a unit of the one-period safe non-monetary security denominated in terms of the

numéraire and the currency/means of payment. That exchange rate can either be set by the

government or be market-determined. This permits the nominal interest rate in terms of the

numéraire to be negative, even though the nominal interest rate in terms of the currency is

subject to the zero lower bound.

       The literature on negative nominal interest rates is limited. There is the notable work

by Silvio Gesell (1916) and the Great Depression-era writings of Robert Eisler (1932) and

Irving Fisher (1933). In the ‘modern era’, only Robert Hall has repeatedly addressed issues

close to the ones considered in this paper (Hall (1983, 1997, 2002), Hall and Woodward

(2009)). The issue of the zero lower bound became of interest again since about 1996,

following the Japanese zero interest rate policy and experiment with quantitative easing, and

because of the low nominal interest rates encountered in much of Europe and the US

following the bursting of the tech bubble at the end of 2000. Examples are Goodfriend

(2000), Buiter and Panigirtzoglou (2001, 2003), Buiter (2004, 2007a), Buiter and Sibert

(2007), Davies (2004) and Fukao (2005). The experience of having both the Fed and the

Bank of Japan effectively at the zero lower bound, the Bank of England very close to it and

the ECB also not far away, resurrected the policy debate, mainly in the blogosphere, in

parliamentary or congressional evidence or in speeches since 2008 (Mankiw (2009), Buiter,

(2009a, b, c), Taylor (2009a,b)).

       Section 1 establishes a map between the two short nominal interest rates of the formal

model and the much larger set of short nominal interest rates encountered in the real world of
                                              5
central banking. Section two develops a simple formal model which is used, in Section 3, to

present the three methods for removing the zero lower bound. Section 4, prompted by

discussions with Fabrizio Zilibotti, offers a number of reinterpretations and extensions of the third

method – unbundling numéraire and currency. Section 5 points out that the model does not support a

liquidity trap equilibrium (short nominal interest rates at their lower bounds for all maturities) if the

authorities pursue even the mildest form of quantitative easing.

1. Clearing the ground for the formal model

        The academic version of the zero lower bound problem is generally stated in terms of

a non-negativity constraint on ‘the’ short nominal risk-free rate of interest – the one-period

rate in a discrete time model and the instantaneous rate of interest in a continuous time

model. In the world of actual monetary policy making, there are many different short-term

nominal rates. In what follows I define the more important ones, relate them to each other

and make explicit the assumptions that permit one to simplify the exposition to the point that

it is meaningful to speak of the short nominal interest rate.

        We start with the following set of six one-period nominal interest rates:

i : interest rate on one − period Treasury Bills.
i M : interest rate on base money held for one period.
i N : interest rate on currency ( notes and coins ) held for one period.
i D : one − period interest rate on bank reserves ( deposits ) held with the central bank.
i B : one − period interest rate on collateralised commercial bank borrowing from the central bank.
i CB : one − period official policy rate.
         In addition to i B , which measures the one-period interest rate at which commercial

banks can borrow from the central bank against high-grade collateral, generally through

repos, most central banks have a discount window where banks can borrow against a wider

range of collateral, sometimes including illiquid assets. For reasons of space this is not




                                                    6
considered here. Nor are the many ad-hoc facilities created by central banks during the

current crisis.

        The first five of these interest rates are attached to financial instruments that may have

a non-negative carry cost – the cost of storing, safekeeping (including insurance) and using

these securities.

       k : carry cost on one-period Treasury Bills.
       k M : one-period carry cost on base money.
       k N : one-period carry cost on currency.
       k D : one-period carry cost on bank reserves with the central bank.
       k B : one-period carry cost on collateralised bank borrowing from the central bank.

        The interest-rate on one-period Treasury Bills will in what follows stand for the safe,

that is, free of default risk, nominal yield on non-monetary assets.                   Because even US

sovereign debt is no longer viewed by the markets as entirely free of default risk (credit

default swaps written on five-year US sovereign debt have during 2008 shown a default risk

premium of around 40 basis points), there may be no completely default-risk free assets in the

real world.6 Base money, M , has two components: currency, N, (bank notes and coin in

circulation with the public) and reserves held by commercial banks with the central bank, D .

For simplicity, I do not distinguish here between required reserves and excess reserves or

other partitions of total reserves. Unsecured or non-collateralised bank borrowing from the

central bank is not risk free, because banks can default on their obligations. Commercial

banks therefore typically borrow from the central banks against collateral. When the quality

of the collateral is very high (if, say, Treasury bills or bonds are offered as collateral or are

used in repo (sale and repurchase) contracts between the commercial bank and the central

part of the CDS market is rather unusual.

bank), the loan from the central bank has the risk of the sovereign and is therefore, for the

purposes of this paper, risk-free.

        Finally there is the official policy rate of the central bank. In the US, this is the

Federal Funds target rate, which is not a rate charged or paid on any instrument, but instead a

guide or target for the overnight rate in the Federal Funds market (a market for unsecured

interbank borrowing and lending of excess reserves with the Fed). In the UK it is Bank Rate,

the overnight interest rate paid on commercial bank reserves with the Bank of England. From

1997 until early 2006, however, the official policy rate in the UK was the two-week repo rate,

the rate at which the Bank of England would lend for a two-week maturity to commercial

banks against eligible, high grade collateral. In the Euro Area the official policy rate is, since

July 2008, the Main refinancing operations fixed rate (for fixed rate tenders). This is a repo

rate against (supposedly) high-grade collateral for a range of maturities from overnight to a

year.   Before July 2008, it was the Main refinancing operations Variable rate tenders

Minimum bid rate. In Japan, the official policy rate is a target rate for the Uncollateralized

Overnight Call Rate, the lending rate charged for uncollateralised loans in the Japanese

interbank market, the Japanese version of the Federal Funds rate. In Switzerland, the official

policy rate is a target (range) for 3-month Libor, the 3-month unsecured interbank borrowing

rate. The variety of arrangements in the real world is quite remarkable.

        The following restrictions on the relative magnitudes of these short rates and their

associated carry costs are plausible:

                      i − k ≥ iM − k M
                      or, in terms of the two components of base money:
                           i − k ≥ iN − k N
                           i − k ≥ iD − k D
                      iB − k B ≥ iD − k D



                                                8
        The restriction that the risk-free one-period interest rate on non-monetary assets (net

of carry costs) cannot be below the rate on base money (net of carry costs) or below the rate

on the components of base money follows from the assumption that base money (currency

and reserves) yields non-pecuniary liquidity services that are not found to the same extent in

other assets. The restriction that the interest rate at which banks borrow against collateral

from the central bank is not below the rate the banks earn when depositing funds with the

central bank (both net of carry costs) is an assumption about central bank behaviour: even

with sovereign debt instruments as collateral, a central bank loan to a private bank cannot

have a lower default risk than a private bank’s deposit with the central bank. The central

bank does not wish to offer the commercial banks a pure arbitrage opportunity. This is

reflected in the rates the central bank sets for its deposits and loans.

        The only financial instrument of the five considered likely to have significant carry

costs is currency: it is bulky and costly to store, it can be stolen and it can be destroyed by

fires and other man-made or natural disasters. I therefore assume

                                         kN > 0
                                         k = kD = kB = 0

        Finally, I assume

                                          i D ≤ iCB ≈ i ≤ i B

        It therefore follows that

                                            i ≥ iN − k N                                       (1)

        Even if the interest rate on currency is zero, i N = 0 , the short nominal interest rate on

non-monetary securities could be some (small) negative number, because of the high carry

costs on currency. In the formal model of the next section, I will simplify notation by

equating all risk-free non-monetary one-period interest rates to each other, and by setting the

carry costs on currency equal to zero, k N = 0 . This gives us:
                                                  9
                                       i = i CB = i D = i B ≥ i N                             (2)



2. A simple model of the euro currency economy

         I will formally present the main ideas about removing the lower bound on the short-

term risk-free nominal interest rate using a simple model of a closed endowment economy

with a representative infinite-lived household-worker-portfolio manager and a government

sector consisting of a consolidated Central Bank and Treasury. For simplicity, and because

none-of the results depend on it, I assume that there exists a complete set of time and state-

contingent markets. Price setting follows a variant of the New-Keynesian Calvo-Woodford

approach (Calvo (1983), Woodford (2003)).

2.1 The private sector in the euro-currency economy

         The competitive representative household receives an endowment yt > 0 of a single

perishable commodity (potential labour time) each period, t = 0,1, 2,... ., which it takes as

given.     It can either consume the endowment or sell it to other consumers or to the

government. The household maximizes lifetime expected utility, as defined in equation (3).

         The lifetime utility functional is defined over an infinite horizon, is time-additive and

has a constant psychological discount factor β . The period utility function is increasing in

consumption ct ≥ 0 and real base money balances mt ≥ 0 , and strictly concave. The results of

the paper are not affected if the ‘money-in-the-direct-utility-function approach’ were to be

replaced by a ‘cash-in-advance’ approach, a ‘shopping-time’ approach or a ‘money-in-the-

production-function’ approach.

         For expositional and notational simplicity, the period utility function is assumed to be

additively separable in consumption, leisure and the real euro monetary base. Each of the

sub-utility functions is assumed to be iso-elastic. The conditional expectation operator at
                                                  10

period-t general price level and mt ≡            . Note that M t is the stock of euro base money and
                                              Pt

that Pt is the euro price level in period t. Most of the time, the formal model treats base

money as a homogeneous instrument with an exogenous single-period own rate of interest,

i M , rather than decomposing it into currency, N , and reserves with the central bank, D , each

with its own, possibly distinct, interest rate.                    Where it matters for the analysis, this

simplification is relaxed.

       The household’s optimisation programme is subject to its period budget identity (4),

The inflation factor (1 plus the proportional rate of inflation) between periods t1 and t0 is

denoted Π t1 ,t0 ≡ Pt1 / Pt0 and the real stochastic discount factor between periods t1 and t0 by

Rt1 ,t0 ≡ I t1 ,t0 Π t1 ,t0 . The one-period risk-free real interest rate, rt +1,t is defined as:

                                                              1

       The household solvency constraint (5) holds with equality. Equation (13) is the Euler

equation for consumption. The demand for real euro money balances is proportional to

consumption and depends inversely on the pecuniary opportunity cost of holding money,

it +1, t − itM+1, t . Equation (14) is the transversality condition governing the long-run behaviour of

the stock of money balances (see Buiter and Sibert (2007)). It says that the value, across all

states of nature, of the terminal stock of real money balances, evaluated at its appropriate

present value shadow price, is zero. So either the stock of real money balances goes to zero

or its shadow price goes to zero, or both. The state-contingent present value shadow price of
                                                                          13
terminal real money balances equals the terminal marginal utility of consumption discounted

using the subjective discount factor. The risk-free real interest rate equals the risk-free

nominal interest rate minus the expected inflation rate and the inflation risk premium

(equation (16)).

           Pricing behaviour is assumed to be governed by a New-Keynesian Phillips curve with

both a back-ward looking and forward-looking inflation component in the ‘augmentation

term’; yt > 0 is the exogenous level of capacity output or potential output in period t.

Perfect price flexibility is the special case of (18) where α = 0 , in which case it becomes

yt = yt for all t ≥ 0 .

2.2 The government in the euro currency economy

           The government in what follows is the consolidated general government and central

bank. It spends on real goods and services, gt with 0 ≤ gt ≤ yt , raises real revenues τ t and

finances its financial deficit by issuing base euro money, M t or safe, euro-denominated one-

period government debt, Bt . The government’s period budget identity is

           This can be re-written as

         The equivalence of the two intertemporal government budget identities in (21) can

also be expressed through what I have called the intertemporal seigniorage identity, linking

two common concepts of ‘seigniorage’ – the revenue obtained by the state from the issuance

of base money (Buiter (2007b)). The first is the present discounted value of current and

future base money issuance; the second is the present discounted value of current and future

interest payments foregone due to the state’s issuance of base money rather than risk-free

non-monetary assets:

         The solvency constraint for the government is that the present discounted value of its

terminal non-monetary liabilities be non-positive:

                                                  Et lim I t +T +1,t (1 + it +T +1,t +T ) Bt +T ≤ 0                                                       (23)
                                                      T →∞



         Note the contrast between (23) and (5). Anticipating the asset market equilibrium

condition, it is clear that, in equilibrium,

                                                               At = (1 + it ,t −1 ) Bt −1

                                                                           15
Since Wt = At + (1 + itM,t −1 ) M t −1 = (1 + it ,t −1 ) Bt −1 + (1 + itM,t −1 ) M t −1 , the household solvency constraint

(5) can be written as:

                          Et lim I t +T +1,t ( (1 + it +T +1,t +T ) Bt +T + (1 + itM+T +1,t +T ) M t +T ) ≥ 0        (24)
                              T →∞


         Comparing (23) and (24), households treat their holdings of government base money

as an asset, even in the long run, while the government recognises that fiat base money is

irredeemable: it does not represent a claim on the issuer for anything other than the same

amount of itself (two five euro notes for one ten euro note). As it is irredeemable it does not

belong in the government’s solvency constraint. This, I believe, is the correct mathematical

expression of the well-know proposition in monetary economics that fiat money represents an

asset to the owner, but not a liability to the issuer (see Buiter (2003)).

         Government spending, gt , is exogenous, as is the nominal interest rate on euro base

money, itM,t −1 . The short risk-free nominal interest rate on the euro-denominated bond is

governed by a simplified Taylor rule, where the short rate responds more than one-for-one to

the expected rate of inflation, as long as the lower bound constraint, that the short risk-free

nominal interest rate on bonds cannot be lower than the short risk-free nominal interest rate

on base money, is not binding. If the Taylor rule were to cause the constraint to bind, the

short nominal interest rate on bonds is set equal to the nominal interest rate on base money;

Π
ˆ − 1 is the exogenous target inflation rate.

         If the lower bound constraint binds, the government engages in quantitative easing,

according to

                                     If it +1,t = itM+1,t then M t +1 = (1 + µt +1,t ) M t                           (26)

                                                                 16
           The proportional growth rate of base money under quantitative easing, µt +1,t , is

assumed to be exogenous subject to µt +1,t > −1 . When the lower bound constraint i ≥ i M

binds, the nominal stock of money becomes a choice variable of the government, or policy

instrument. This is true even when the authorities ‘monetary’ policy rule when the lower

bound constraint does not bind, is a rule for the short nominal interest rate, like the simplified

Taylor rule of this model. The policy rule governing the nominal stock of base money under

quantitative easing could take any form. The exogenous sequence of base money growth

rates assumed here is just for expositional simplicity. The second half of the interest rate rule

in (25),

                         1 + it +1 = 1 + itM+1, t if β −1Π
                                                         ˆ + φ ( Et Π t +1, t − Π
                                                                                ˆ ) ≤ 1 + itM+1, t

           is not redundant. In principle, should the Taylor rule produce a nominal interest rate

value at or below the interest rate on money, the authorities could set the actual interest rate at

any level equal to or greater than the interest rate on money.

           When the lower bound constraint does not bind, the nominal stock of base money,

M t , is endogenously determined from the money demand function (14). The stock of one-

period non-monetary government debt, Bt , and real lump-sum taxes, τ t , are only constrained

by the requirement that the government’s solvency constraint (23) be satisfied. There are

many possible tax rules or borrowing rules satisfying this, including, trivially, the rule that

the stock of non-monetary public debt is always equal to zero:

                      τ t = gt −

2.5 The lower bound can become a binding constraint in the euro currency

economy

         It is clear that the constraint i ≥ i M can become binding in our model. From equations

(39) to (44), interpreted as the fundamental solution of the deterministic flexible price level

special case when the exogenous variables are all constant, a sufficiently low target rate of

           ˆ − 1 , possibly assisted by a sufficiently low pure rate of time preference, β −1 − 1 ,
inflation, Π

can cause the lower bound constraint to bind. From equation (43), however, this would

require a negative target rate of inflation that is equal to or larger in absolute value than the

pure rate of time preference, if the nominal interest rate on base money is zero. In the New-
                                                    19
Keynesian variant of the model ( α > 0 ), there always exists a sufficiently large negative

shock to gt − yt to ensure that the lower bound constraint binds.




3. Overcoming the lower bound on nominal interest rates

             I now consider the three methods for removing the lower bound on nominal interest

rates referred to in the introduction: (1) abolishing currency, (2) paying negative interest on

currency or taxing currency, and (3) separating the medium of exchange/means of payment

function from the numéraire function.

3.1 Abolishing currency

             Base money, M , is the sum of currency, N ≥ 0 and bank deposits held with the

central bank, D .7 The interest rate on currency, i N , is zero, because it is a negotiable bearer

bond. The interest rate on commercial bank deposits with the central bank, i D can be zero,

positive or negative without significant administrative or enforcement costs, because they are

registered financial instruments.                                     From a government and private sector financing

perspective, M ≡ N + D , but from the point of view of the provision of liquidity services,

currency and deposits may not be perfect substitutes.8 One can formalise this by representing

base money in the utility function as a constant-returns-to-scale CES function of N and D ,

with elasticity of substitution θ between currency and bank deposits as regards the provision




7
 Without changing the argument in any meaningful way, we can permit negative values for D, letting that stand
for commercial bank borrowing from the central bank against high-grade collateral, say Treasury Bills.
8
    The government’s period budget identity (20), for instance, becomes
N t + Dt + Bt ≡ N t −1 + (1 + it , t −1 ) Dt −1 + (1 + it , t −1 ) Bt −1 + Pt ( g t − τ t ) >
                                      D




                                                                                    20
of liquidity services . So m in the period utility function in equation (3) is no longer given

         M
by m ≡     but becomes:
         P

                                                                       θ
                                             θ −1               θ −1 θ −1
                                                                     
                                  m = P −1Λ  aN θ + (1 − a ) D θ                                     (45)
                                                                    
                                         Λ > 0; 0 ≤ a ≤ 1, θ ≥ 0

         Abolishing currency would mean setting N t = 0, t ≥ 0 , leaving only bank deposits

with the central bank to provide the monetary base function. With positive or negative

interest rates on bank deposits with the central bank feasible at trivial cost, the lower bound

on the short, risk-free non-monetary nominal interest rate would be removed.

         The expected welfare gain associated with the removal of the zero lower bound on

currency would have to be balanced against the welfare consequences of the loss of currency.

In our model, there would be no welfare impact from the loss of currency if currency and

bank deposits were perfect substitutes as regards the provision of liquidity services ( θ = +∞ ).

Even if currency and commercial bank deposits with the central bank are imperfect

substitutes as regards the provision of liquidity services, the authorities can still achieve

satiation with real liquidity services, even without currency, by setting itM+1,t = itD+1,t = it +1,t , that

is, by the interest rate on commercial bank reserves with the central bank tracking the short

safe nominal rate on non-monetary securities.

         What would the costs of abolishing currency (that is, government-issued fiat base

money in the form of negotiable and freely transferable bearer securities)?

         In advanced industrial countries, with well-developed financial markets and

institutions, and with an ever-growing range of electronic payment and settlement vehicles,

currency has effectively become a redundant medium of exchange and means of payment for

legitimate, legal transactions (see e.g. Bolt (2003)). As regards legitimate transactions, they

                                                    21
are only used for small retail payments. In countries with developed financial systems,

between checkable bank deposits, giro accounts at post offices, money market accounts,

charge cards, credit cards, debit cards, a wide range of private forms of E-money or digital

cash cards, like the CashCard made by NETS or the EZ-link card, currency has become

redundant as a means of payment for legitimate transactions goods and services and as a store

of value for legitimately acquired financial wealth, except for the poorest members of society.

       Although hard evidence is, for obvious reasons, difficult to come by, there is a

reasonable presumption that the majority of US dollar and euro currency notes either are held

abroad for legitimate reasons by citizens of countries where the authorities do not have a

strong reputation for low and stable inflation, or are held for illegitimate reasons, both at

home and abroad.

       At the beginning of May 2009, the stock of euro currency notes and coin in

circulation amounted to €781bn (see Table 2 for the euro notes time series). Eurozone

population is just under 310 million. This would mean that, if all euro notes were held inside

the Eurozone, each man, woman and child would hold just over €2,519 in cash. At the end of

March 2009, the stock of US$ currency notes and coins outstanding amounted to just under

US$904bn (see Table 3). With a US population of around 306 million, this means that, if all

US$ currency notes were held inside the US, per capita US dollar holdings would be

US$2,950.

       The US Treasury (2006) estimated that in 2005 about 50 percent of the stock of US

currency was held abroad (see also Rogoff (1998, 2002)).          Feige et. al. (2002) report

estimates that between 30 and 69 percent of DM currency used to circulate outside the

borders of Germany in the final years before the introduction of euro notes in 2002. It is




                                              22
unlikely that the share of euro notes held outside the euro area is significantly lower than the

share of DMs held outside Germany towards the end of the DM’s existence.9

         Even assuming 50 percent (in value) of US dollar notes and euro notes are held

abroad, it is clear that the distribution of the remaining domestically held notes is likely to be

strongly skewed to the right: a small number of persons hold the vast majority of currency by

value. Note from Tables 1 and 4, that the vast majority of euro and US$ currency (by value)

is held in the largest denominations. At the end of March 2009, fully 75% of US dollar

currency was held in 100 dollar bills – the largest denomination still issued. In April 2009,

36 percent of euro notes was held in €500 notes. The €500, €200 and €100 denominations

made up 59 percent of the stock of euro notes. The true retail notes, €5, €10 and €20 just

accounted for 10 percent of the total value of euro notes.

         The only domestic beneficiaries from the existence of anonymity-providing currency

are the underground economy – the criminal community: those engaged in tax evasion,

money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and those wishing to store the proceeds

from crime and the means to commit further crimes. The existence of fiat currency with legal

tender status - an anonymity-providing secure store of value provided by the government –

represents a subsidy to criminal (illegal/underground) activity. It is particularly surprising to

find so many large denomination bank notes, because these are unlikely to be held by poor

and low-income households. The usefulness of currency as a means of payment and store of




9
  It is true that the euro is the domestic currency of 15 countries whose inhabitants could have held the DM as a
foreign currency before the creation of the euro in 1999 (as well as of Germany). This would tend, cet. par. to
make for a lower share of euro currency held outside the 16-country euro area than the share of DM currency
held outside Germany, which is just one of the 16 euro area countries. Against this, the euro is already a more
important official reserve currency than the DM ever was, and regional and global developments since 1999
have probably increased the demand for a safe and secure foreign currency alternative to domestic currency in
many emerging markets.

                                                       23
value for low income households is a standard argument in defence of the continued

existence of currency.

       Advanced industrial countries can move to electronic and bank-account-based means

of payment and media of exchange without any significant transitional problems, permanent

efficiency loss or adverse distributional implications. Negative interest rates on bank accounts

and on balances outstanding on ‘centralised or networked electronic media’ like credit cards

are as easy as positive interest rates.     Debit cards simply transfer money between two

accounts, both of which could pay negative interest rates and don’t pose a problem. You

could even retain a measure of anonymity and have ‘cash-on-a-chip cards’, which, whenever

the balance on the card is replenished by drawing funds from some account, calculate the

average balance held on the cash card since the last replenishment and arrange for the

appropriate interest rate (positive or negative) to be applied.

       Because currency is a redundant or dominated medium of exchange/means of

payment, except possibly for the smallest denominations, which may still be useful for small

retail transactions (up to perhaps € 20 or US$20, say), what accounts for its continuing

existence and popularity? The only rational argument I can see is that seigniorage, the

resources that can be appropriated through the issuance of non-interest-bearing legal tender,

is a valuable source of revenue, either for the central bank or for its beneficial owner,

typically the ministry of finance or Treasury.        From Table 2, over the year 2007, the

Eurosystem earned €49 bn as seigniorage from the issuance of bank notes, and over 2008, as

much as €86bn. From the first week of June 2007 till the first week of June 2008, US

currency in circulation increased by US$10.5bn. Between the first week of June 2008 and

the first week of June 2009, US currency in circulation increased by US$85.5bn.

       Is it likely that the social benefits from this seigniorage revenue, together with the

convenience benefits that currency still may yield when used in legitimate small retail
                                                24
transactions and held in small savings balances, exceed the social costs of the incremental tax

evasion, money laundering, terrorism and other criminality encouraged by the anonymity and

privacy provided by currency?

        Should fiat currency be abolished, the loss of these retail transactions benefits could

be compensated for by offering free accounts with the central bank to all legal residents.

These accounts could be administered through commercial banks, post offices and other retail

facilities. These accounts, being registered instruments, could, of course, pay a positive, zero

or negative rate of interest, as required.

        Should the government decide to abolish government base money, it is possible that

the private sector would start supplying a close functional substitute, as it did before such

practices were made illegal and the government established its monopoly of currency

issuance. If there were no enforceable legal prohibition against this private issuance, it would

lead to the case discussed in Section 4.4 below.

        By abolishing currency and introducing a close substitute on which interest, positive

or negative can be paid, the authorities can remove the lower bound on the short nominal

interest rate by adopting a simple rule for the nominal interest rate on money, such as the one

given in equation (46). Note that if the policy-determined wedge between the two interest

rates were zero, ω = 0 , Friedman’s optimal quantity of money (OQM) rule would be

automatically implemented all the time (Friedman (1969)).

3.2 Taxing currency

        As discussed in the Introduction, paying interest, positive or negative requires

individual notes (or even coins) to be identifiable as current on any interest due. With the

identity of the currency unknown to the issuer of the currency, it must be possible to identify
                                                25
the individual notes and coins as being up-to-date on interest due or owed. When interest is

received or paid the notes must be marked somehow. Historical proposals for achieving this

often involved stamping currency. Silvio Gesell (1916) is an early example of such a

proposal, which was also supported by Irving Fisher (1933). In the case of conventional

bearer bonds, coupons were physically clipped from the bond document or certificate.

       Another variant is to give the currency note an expiration date. Unless this scrip

money is stamped no later than the expiration date, it loses its legal tender status. When it is

stamped, the negative interest can be collected by the issuer or his agent. Unstamped currency

ceases to be recognised as money by the authorities and will thus, in the eyes of the

proponents of scrip money, become worthless.

       The reason this proposal is incomplete is that the value of fiat money is what people

believe it to be and are willing to exchange it for. No doubt losing legal tender status might

undermine people’s confidence in a currency, but many financial instruments have served as

means of payment, medium of exchange and store of value without having legal tender status.

If enough private agents were to consider a €10 note that had expired (had not been stamped)

to be worth as much as a €10 note that was current on interest (had been stamped), then the

stamped and unstamped notes would indeed have the same value (exchange for the same

bundles of goods and services and for each other).

       So to ensure that expired (unstamped) currency does not continue to circulate on a par

with current (stamped) currency, a penalty must be imposed on those caught with expired

(unstamped) currency. The penalty must be sufficient to induce those holding the currency to

pay the currency tax. Confiscation of the expired (unstamped) notes, or a fine would be

possible enforcement mechanisms of a negative interest rate on currency. This would involve

searches etc. Such monitoring and enforcement of negative interest rates (taxes) on currency

would be a rather illiberal policy and unlikely to be popular.

       An operational proposal for taxing currency mentioned by Mankiw (2009), who

attributes it to one of his graduate students, appears to get around this monitoring and

enforcement problem. All currency notes have a serial number ending in an integer from 0 to

9. All currency notes also should have a year printed on them (most I know of do). Once a

year, on a fixed date, the central bank randomly selects an integer from 0 to 9. All currency

notes ending in that integer, printed in that year or earlier, lose their legal tender status and

are no longer redeemable/exchangeable at the central bank or its agents for anything else.

       The expected nominal interest rate on currency is therefore -10% under this scheme,

which is effectively a negative interest rate version of the British Premium Bond - a

government bond that bears no interest or capital gains but enters the holder into lotteries,

based on the serial number of the bond. It can also be viewed as a lottery version of putting

an expiration date on all currency notes and charging 10% of face value tax on each note.

       However, the Mankiw scheme falls foul of the same problem that currency with an

expiration date falls foul of, unless there is external enforcement. The value of fiat money is

what people think it is. If the central bank randomly selects 7 as the unlucky number this

year and I own a € 100 note whose serial number ends in 7, I may still be able to purchase

goods and services worth €100 with that note, provided other private agents are willing to

accept it as being worth that much.         Legal tender status or convertibility into other

government notes at the central bank is not necessary for fiat money to have value. Some

form of monitoring currency holdings and a penalty for those caught with expired currency

(such as the threat of confiscation plus a fine) are likely to be necessary to make Mankiw’s

scheme work.



                                               27
        If the authorities are willing to incur the administrative and surveillance costs, and to

incur the political unpopularity likely to be associated with taxing currency, they could

eliminate the lower bound on the risk-free one-period nominal interest rate on non-monetary

assets, by adopting a rule for the one-period own rate of interest on currency like the one

specified in equation (46).



3.3 Unbundling the numéraire and the medium of exchange/means of

payment

       A third way to eliminate the lower bound on the short nominal interest rate was

suggested by Eisler (1933) (see also Einaudi (1953) and Gaitskell (1969)). It involves

decoupling the numéraire function from the currency, which would retain its numéraire and

means of payment/medium of exchange roles. A simple way to implement this decoupling,

which involves the abolition of the old government-issued fiat currency and its replacement

by a new government-issued fiat currency is discussed first. Many interesting variations on

this theme exist, however, and I shall introduce some of these later in Section 4.

       The first step is to abolish the euro currency, by withdrawing all euro notes and coins.

The next step is the introduction of a new currency, which I shall call the wim (in honour of

Wim Duisenberg, the first President of the European Central Bank). The euro is kept as the

numéraire for wage and price contracts. This is an assumption that leads to an interesting

model only if it is plausible.

       I believe that there are many ways in which, despite the abolition of physical euro

currency, the authorities can encourage the continued use of the euro as numéraire. The

government could require all contracts involving the state to be denominated in euro. It could

present tax claims and require tax returns in euro, and require tax payments using euro-


                                               28
denominated instruments. Going beyond that, it could ban bank deposits denominated in

wim. As a last resort it could declare all wim-denominated contracts not to be enforceable in

Eurozone courts.

                 In the model, private agents and the authorities are free to issue and hold contingent

claims denominated in both wim and euro. Specifically, there are both safe one-period wim-

denominated bonds and safe one-period euro-denominated bonds.

                 As there is no longer any euro currency, there no longer is a lower bound on euro

interest rates. There is a lower bound on wim interest rates, because there is wim currency.

The government sets the sequence of spot exchange rates, or of spot and forward exchange

rates, between the euro and the wim.

3.3.1 The private sector in the wim currency economy

                 The household optimisation problem changes slightly. Let M t* ≥ 0 be the nominal

stock of wim currency at the end of period t, St the period t spot exchange rate between the

euro and the wim (number of wim per euro), Ft +1,t the one-period forward exchange rate

between the euro and the wim (number of wim per euro), it*+1,t the one-period safe nominal

interest rate on wim-denominated bonds, itM+1,*t the one-period own rate of interest on wim

currency, I t*1 ,t0 the nominal wim stochastic discount factor between periods t1 and t0 , Rt*1 ,t0 the

real wim stochastic discount factor between periods t1 and t0 , P* the wim general price level,

Π   *
    t1 ,t0   ≡          the wim inflation factor (1 plus the wim inflation rate to the power t1 − t0 ) and
                 Pt0*

                 St1
Σt1 ,t0 ≡               the wim exchange rate depreciation factor between periods t1 and t0 .

       If there is to be no pure (risk-free) arbitrage possibility in this economy, the “law of

one price” will have to hold, that is the wim price of goods is the euro price of the good times

the wim-euro exchange rate:

                                                               Pt * = St Pt                                        (47)

This implies

                                                         Π*t1 ,t0 = Π t1 ,t0 Σt1 ,t0

       Beginning-of-period nominal financial wealth (measured in wim) in period t is

denoted Wt * . The wim value in period t (including interest or other income paid) of the

portfolio of financial assets other than money purchased in period t-1 is denoted At* . These

financial aggregates are related as follows:

                                             Wt* ≡ At* + (1 + itM, t −*1 ) M t*−1                                  (49)

        In the wim currency economy, the real interest rate on euro bonds is the same as the

real interest rate on wim bonds (equation (57)). This does not mean, of course, that the wim

currency economy behaves identically to the euro currency economy. While the real interest

rate on euro bonds is the same as the real interest on wim bonds in the wim currency

economy, this common real interest rate will be different from the real interest rate that would

prevail in the euro currency economy (starting from the same initial conditions) if there is any

probability that the lower bound constraint on the short nominal interest rate would become

binding in the euro currency economy.

        From the money demand function (55), it is clear that there is a lower bound on the

one-period wim interest rate:
                                                              31

but since there is no euro currency in the wim currency economy, there is no lower bound on

the one-period euro nominal interest rate, i.

          Unsurprisingly, covered interest parity (CIP) holds in this economy between euro

interest rates and wim interest rates (equation (56)). From equation (58), uncovered interest

                                                                                                           Covt ( ct−+11Π t−+11,t , Σt−+11,t )
parity (UIP) holds only if the risk-premium on euro interest rates,                                                                              , is
                                                                                                                 Et ( ct−+11Π t−+11,t )

zero.10 In that case, the euro interest rate (approximately) equals the wim interest rate plus

the expected proportional rate of appreciation of the wim in terms of the euro, Et ( Σ t−+11,t ) − 1 .

          Since the euro remains the numéraire and invoicing currency for wage and price

transactions, the Phillips curve is unchanged in the wim currency economy from what it is in

the euro currency economy (equations (18) and (19)).

        The Taylor rule for the euro nominal interest rate in the wim currency economy looks

as follows:

                                          1 + it +1, t = β −1Π
                                                             ˆ + φ(E Π
                                                                    t  t +1, t − Π )
                                                                                 ˆ                                       (65)

        To complete the policy regime (assuming exogenous real public spending as before), I

assign a simple quantitative easing rule for wim currency, when the lower bound constraint in

the wim nominal interest rate binds:

                                     If it*+1,t = itM+1,*t then M t*+1 = (1 + µt*+1,t ) M t*                             (66)

where {µt*+1,t > −1; t ≥ 0} is, for simplicity, an exogenous sequence of proportional growth

rates of the nominal stock of wim currency.

        Comparing (65) with the Taylor rule for the euro nominal interest rate in the euro

currency economy, (25), we note that, because the lower bound constraint on the euro

nominal interest rate has been removed, the interest rate now does not switch from the Taylor

rule to the quantitative easing rule given by the second line of equation (25) and by equation

(26).

        We can represent the monetary authority as having four potential instruments in any

given period, t : the short nominal euro interest rate, it +1,t , the one-period wim nominal

interest rate, it*+1,t , the spot exchange rate between the euro and the wim, St and the one-

period forward exchange rate between the euro and the wim, Ft +1,t The interest rate on wim

currency, itM+1,*t is, by assumption, not an instrument. All we need is for it to be exogenous. In

practice, it is equal to zero. When the lower bound constraint on the short nominal wim




                                                                  33
interest rate binds, it*+1,t = itM+1,*t , the proportional rate of growth of the stock of wim currency,

µt*+1,t becomes an instrument (quantitative easing).

3.3.3 Equilibrium

        Goods market equilibrium in the wim currency economy is given by the same

equation (27) as in the euro currency economy. The asset market equilibrium condition,

however, changes from equation (28) to

                                  At* = (1 + it ,t −1 ) St Bt −1 + (1 + it*,t −1 ) Bt*−1            (67)



3.3.4 How monetary policy is implemented in the wim currency economy

        With it +1,t , it*+1,t , St and Ft +1,t as the potential monetary instruments in any period t and

with covered interest parity (equation (56)) constraining the four instruments, only three of

the four can be chosen independently. In the model under consideration, the short nominal

euro interest rate is determined by the Taylor rule (65), regardless of whether this takes the

euro nominal interest rate into negative territory. There are infinitely many combinations of

rules for the spot and forward exchange rates and the wim rate of interest that are consistent

with equilibrium.     Any given equilibrium sequence for the real variables and for euro

nominal interest rates and euro inflation rates can also be supported by infinitely many

different combinations of spot and forward exchange rates and wim rates of interest. I will

start by considering a simple, transparent example.

        The rule for the one-period risk-free wim nominal interest rate on non-monetary

securities satisfies (68), that is, when the euro nominal interest rate set by the Taylor rule (or

any other rule) exceeds the lower bound on the wim nominal interest rate, the authorities set

the euro interest rate and the wim interest rate equal to each other. When the euro nominal

interest rate is equal to or less than the lower bound on the wim nominal interest rate, the
                                                          34
authorities set the wim nominal interest rate equal to its lower bound, i M * . This ensures that

the lower bound on the wim nominal interest rate, (61), is never violated.

                                        it*+1,t = it +1,t if it +1,t > itM+1,*t
                                                                                                                                    (68)
                                                 = itM+1,*t if it +1,t ≤ itM+1,*t

                                                                                               Ft +1,t       1 + it*+1,t
       From the covered interest parity condition, we know that                                          =                 , so under the
                                                                                                St           1 + it +1,t

rule given by (68),

                                       Ft +1,t
                                                 =1                   if it +1,t > itM+1,*t
                                         St
                                                                                                                                    (69)
                                       Ft +1,t       1 + itM+1,*t
                                                 =                    if it +1,t ≤ i   M*
                                                                                      t +1,t
                                         St          1 + it +1,t

       With it +1,t and it*+1,t as instruments (subject to it*+1,t ≥ itM+1,*t ), the forward premium factor

               Ft +1,t
on the euro,             , is market-determined by covered interest parity. The authorities can set
                St

either the spot or the forward exchange rate, with the remaining one residually determined.

       As long as the lower bound constraint on the wim nominal interest rate is not binding,

the spot rate equals the forward rate; when the lower bound constraint on the wim nominal

interest rate is binding, the euro stands at a proportional forward premium to the wim equal to

the difference between the interest rate on wim currency and the interest rate on one-period

safe euro bonds. Consider the practically relevant case where the interest rate on wim

currency is zero ( itM+1,*t = 0 ). It follows that, if the (zero) lower bound constraint on wim

interest rates is binding ( it*+1,t = itM+1,*t = 0 ) , the relationship between the spot and forward

exchange rates is given by

                                                  Ft +1,t           1
                                                             =                                                                      (70)
                                                      St         1 + it +1,t


                                                                 35
            So if the Taylor rule (65) were to imply a negative value for the short nominal euro

rate of interest, it +1,t , there would be no profitable arbitrage possibilities borrowing at the

negative euro rate and lending at the zero wim rate, because the forward premium on the euro

equals the wim-euro interest differential.                          If there is no currency risk premium (

Covt ( ct−+11Π t−+11,t , Σt−+11,t ) = 0 ), the expected proportional rate of appreciation of the euro vis-à-vis

the wim would equal the wim-euro interest differential, that is, UIP holds -

                       −1
               1 
Ft +1,t   =  Et           . If UIP holds, when the zero lower bound constraint on wim interest
                  S t +1  

rates is binding, a negative euro nominal interest rate is consistent with portfolio balance

provided the expected proportional appreciation rate of the euro vis-à-vis the wim exactly

compensates for the negative interest rate on the euro:

                                         1 + it +1, t                        S 
                                               ∗
                                                         = 1 + it +1,t = Et  t                         (71)
                                         1+ i  t +1, t                       St +1 

                            S 
So if it +1,t < 0, then Et  t  = 1 + it +1,t < 1 .
                            St +1 

3.3.5. Would the numéraire ‘follow the currency’?

            Key to the effectiveness of the unbundling solution is the assumption that the euro

remains the numéraire for wage and price contracting, even after the euro currency has been

abolished and replaced by the wim currency, that is, that the euro price level Phillips curve

(32) remains the operational one and that the inflation rate of concern to the authorities is the

proportional rate of increase in the euro general price level, as exemplified in the wim

currency model by the continued relevance of the Taylor rule for the euro interest rate

(without the lower bound), given in (65).




                                                               36
       If the numéraire instead were to ‘follow the currency’ and a wim price level Phillips

curve, we would have achieved no more than a change in the unit of account for the euro

currency economy, like the change from old French francs to new French francs in January

1960, with 100 old French francs – 1 new French franc. The zero lower bound would

continue to exist in the new French franc economy as it had in the old French franc economy.

       Monetary economics has very little to say about what or who determines what the

numéraire is or about what physical, fiat or imaginary substances serve as numéraire. Even

the great monetary thinkers of the past had little to contribute, other than anecdotes or appeals

to common sense (see e.g. Patinkin (1965), Hicks (1967), Niehans (1978)).

       Fundamentally, what serves as unit of account (or multiple units of account) in an

economy is determined through a collective but uncoordinated, decentralised social choice of

the agents making up the economy. The authorities can certainly encourage the use of a

particular financial instrument as unit of account. As pointed out earlier, the government

could require contracts involving the state to be denominated in euro, even after the abolition

of the euro currency and the introduction of the wim currency. It could require taxes to be

reported in euro and to be paid in euro-denominated instruments. It could even impose a ban

on bank deposits denominated in wim or declare all wim-denominated contracts not to be

enforceable in Euro Area courts. What does history tell us happened when numéraire and

currency parted ways?

       The unit of account used most widely in a society need not be the unit of

denomination of whatever financial instruments are used as means of payment and medium

of exchange. Everyone is familiar with the Guinea, which was neither the official unit of

account used by the UK monetary authorities in their transactions, nor a medium of

exchange/means of payment after 1813, but continued to be used as the numéraire in auction

houses and expensive and pretentious shops until decimalisation in 1971.
                                               37
       The history of primitive monies, described in Paul Einzig's book (Einzig (1949))

contains many examples of the uncoupling of the official numéraire function both from the

private numéraire and from the medium of exchange/means of payment function. Medieval

Iceland had a cattle, a cloth and a fish-standard. The monetary unit known as the kugildi was

defined precisely in terms of a standardized cow. It is doubtful that the kugildi could ever

have been extensively used as a medium of exchange. Einzig reports that in documents it

was often explicitly stated that "...payment fixed in kugildi was actually to be made in

metallic money or in other form" (Einzig (1949, p. 260)). Plain home-woven woollen cloth

(wadmal ) served as a general standard of value (unit of account) throughout the Icelandic

medieval period.

       Wadmal was used to determine the amount of wergeld (compensation for wrongful

death)y to be paid and for the valuation of damages. Taxes were fixed in wadmal. Unlike

kugildi, wadmal was widely used as a medium of exchange. There was a fixed legal

exchange rate between kugildi and wadmal. In the 15th century, dried stockfish appears to

have been used widely in Iceland as a unit of account. Einzig expresses doubt as to whether it

was widely used as a medium of exchange (Einzig (1949, p. 262)), and one can only hope he

is right in this. In the case of the wadmal, it is interesting that, while the authorities fixed

taxes in terms of wadmal, there was no monetary authority with a monopoly of the supply of

wadmal. Every home with a spinning wheel and a hand-loom could become a private mint.

       In more recent times, and even in the fiat money era, there are examples that support

the view that the unit of account used most widely in a society need not be the official

monetary unit used to define (some of) the liabilities of the central bank. In countries with

very high inflation or hyperinflation, the unit of account has often been a more stable foreign

currency, although the means of payment/medium of exchange for small-scale retail

transactions remained the national currency. For instance, the US dollar played that role in
                                              38
Israel during the inflation surge that prompted the successful stabilisation plan of July 1985

and in Peru during the hyperinflation that led to the successful stabilisation package of

August 1990. The US dollar was used as the numéraire for posting retail prices, but after a

hasty verification of the current exchange rate, retail transactions tended to be settled in

shekels, respectively intis or soles.

           An interesting, albeit short-lived monetary experiment took place in the eleven

countries that made up the Eurozone between the date of the official designation of the euro

as the new numéraire on January 1, 1999 and the introduction of the physical euro currency

around January 1, 2002.11 During that three-year period, the national legacy currencies

continued to function as media of exchange and means of payment for cash transactions.

           Officially, however, the euro was the numéraire from January 1, 1999 on, and the

national currencies represented inconvenient non-integer denominations of the euro. In

reality, however, the national legacy currencies continued to be used overwhelmingly as the

unit of account not just in transactions involving payment with these national legacy

currencies, but also in contracts that might be settled using non-cash means of payment. The

numéraire in the bulk of private transactions (cash and non-cash) stayed with the means of

payment/medium of exchange despite the introduction of the new numéraire, the euro. In

practice, until euro currency was introduced and the national legacy currencies lost their legal

tender status, the euro was treated as an inconvenient non-integer denomination of the

national legacy currencies.

           All three methods for eliminating the lower bound on nominal interest rate make it

possible to target true price stability ( Π
                                          ˆ = 1 ) or any low rate of inflation without fear of

hitting the lower bound. The inflation targets of most real-world central banks, including the


11
     Greece became the 12th Euro Area member on January 1, 2001.

                                                      39
ECB (close to but below 2 percent per annum for the HICP), the Bank of England (2 percent

per annum for the CPI) and the Fed (an informal target for core CPI inflation of between 1.5

and 2.0 percent per annum) are for positive rates of inflation rather than for a zero rate of

inflation for two reasons. The first is that there are biases in the price indices used to measure

inflation that cause the measured rate of inflation to overstate the true rate of increase in the

cost of living. The second is that the asymmetry in the policy maker’s choice set created by

the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates makes it desirable to target an inflation rate

somewhat higher than the one that would be targeted without the existence of the zero lower

bound. This second argument for targeting a positive rather than a zero rate of inflation

would no longer apply.

       Both taxing currency and unbundling numéraire and currency would permit the

authorities to implement Friedman’s optimal quantity of money (OQM) rule without this

constraining the rate of inflation they target.

       When currency is taxed, the tax rate is −i M . The OQM rule, which requires a zero

pecuniary opportunity cost of holding base money, that is, i = i M , still leaves the nominal

interest rate free to target any rate of inflation. In terms of equation (46), we set ω , the

wedge between the nominal bond interest rate and the nominal interest rate on currency,

equal to zero.

       When numéraire and currency are decoupled, the OQM is satisfied with the wim rate

of interest, i* equal to the (exogenous) rate of interest on wim currency, i M * (which could be

zero without affecting the argument). Clearly, this pins down the rate of inflation in terms of

wim, Π * . In the deterministic flexible price version of the model with constant values of the

exogenous variables, the stationary fundamental solution would have the wim inflation rate

                                                   1      1
equal to minus the real interest rate: Π * =            =   = β −1 . However, the euro rate of
                                                  1+ r 1+ r
                                                      *


                                                  40
inflation can be anything the authorities want it to be, because the euro nominal interest rate

can be set freely (because of CIP): Π = β (1 + i ) .




4. Alternative implementations and interpretations of the

unbundling of numéraire and currency

4.1 Retaining the old currency but no longer supplying it on demand at a

fixed parity with bank reserves at the central bank

          This is no more than a re-interpretation of the wim currency economy. It interprets

the wim currency model as a real-time evolution of the euro currency model, modified with

the assumption that the authorities no longer exchange one euro worth of euro currency notes

(at face value) for one euro worth of euro-denominated bonds when they wish to set the

interest rate on euro-denominated bonds at a zero or negative value.

        More precisely, in the euro currency economy, let the monetary base consist of

currency and bank reserves with the central bank: M = N + D . Assume that the interest rate

on euro currency is zero and that the interest rate on euro reserves is the one-period nominal

euro bond rate: i N = 0 and i D = i . Assume for simplicity that only euro currency appears in

                                                                        1−γ

perfect substitutes for one-period euro bonds. As long as the zero lower bound on the euro

nominal interest rate is not binding, the authorities supply euro currency on demand at a fixed

exchange rate with euro bonds: St = St +1 = Ft as long as i > 0 . Starting from a position like

the present, when negative nominal interest rates have not occurred in the past, the natural



                                                 41
fixed exchange rate would be 1. Note that in this interpretation it is the euro bond that is the

numéraire in terms of which prices and wages are set, not the euro currency.

       If in period t the zero lower bound on the euro nominal interest rate becomes a

binding constraint, I assume, for simplicity, that the authorities set the period t spot exchange

rate St at the same value as the period t − 1 forward rate, that is, St = Ft ,t −1 (which would

equal 1 in the current historical episode), but the period t forward rate will now be set at the

level required to produce that value of the forward premium for the euro bond vis-à-vis the

euro currency that prevents arbitrage between euro bonds and euro currency.

       In general, the authorities would set the interest rate on euro bonds and the spot and

forward exchange rates between euro bonds and euro currency to satisfy:

                                   Ft +1,t
                                             =1           if it +1,t > 0
                                    St
                                                                                            (72)
                                   Ft +1,t        1
                                             =             if it +1,t ≤ 0
                                    St         1 + it +1,t

       Note that since the spot exchange rate is a policy instrument, we don’t have to worry

about appropriate boundary conditions to pin down the initial value of the exchange rate.

This can be given by history (at 1 today) or by government fiat.



4.2 A floating exchange rate version of the euro bond and euro currency

model

       An appropriate terminal condition for the spot exchange rate does become an issue in

the floating exchange rate version of the model considered in the previous subsection.

       Instead of viewing the exchange rate of the euro bond vis-à-vis the euro currency as

the instrument and the stock of euro currency as endogenously determined (or demand-

determined), we can have the authorities select some trajectory (or rule) for the nominal stock

                                                     42
of euro currency whenever they wish to set a negative interest rate for euro bonds. The

exchange rate of euro-bonds vis-à-vis euro currency could then be determined by a

competitive market process.

        I continue to assume that the interest rate on euro bonds is determined by the Taylor

rule (65). Should the Taylor rule take the nominal interest rate for euro bonds into positive

territory, the exchange rate would be fixed again. If period t is the first period the nominal

interest rates on euro bonds becomes positive again after a spell in zero or negative territory, I

assume, for simplicity, that St = Ft ,t −1 . When the interest rate on euro bonds is positive, the

exchange rate between the euro bond and the euro currency is fixed and the euro currency

stock is demand-determined.

        It is obvious that the exchange rate equations in (72), which were constructed to avoid

arbitrage possibilities, will also characterise a competitive market solution for the exchange

rate.   In this case, however, we need a boundary condition, in the form of a terminal

condition, to pin down the initial value of the exchange rate. The reason for this is obvious

from the no-arbitrage equilibrium condition (58), which (because the interest rate on currency

is zero) allows the exchange rate process (72) to be written as:

                   Ft +1,t = St if it +1,t > 0
                                                                                                    (73)
                                        St  Covt ( ct +1Π t +1,t , St / St +1 )
                                                      −1     −1

                   1 + it +1, t   = Et        +                                 if it +1,t ≤ 0.
                                        St +1    Et ( ct−+11Π t−+11,t )

        This shows that the current spot exchange rate depends on the entire future

(stochastic) path of euro interest rates and risk-premia, and on a terminal boundary condition

for this stochastic exchange rate process. As there is no easy intuitive way to specify a

terminal boundary condition for the spot exchange rate, I finessed the problem by assuming

that the authorities set the initial value of the spot exchange rate during any period when the

                                                           43
euro bond interest rate goes zero or negative, if in the previous period it was positive. All

subsequent exchange rates are market-determined. Concretely, I assumed that the authorities

set the initial value of the spot exchange rate in that period at the value of the one-period

forward exchange rate from the previous period. So the exchange rate satisfies (as in the

managed exchange rate regime of the previous subsection:

                  St +1 = Ft +1,t = St if it +1,t > 0


                  St +1 = Ft +1,t = St if it +1,t ≤ 0 but it ,t −1 > 0                                                        (74)


                                      St  Covt ( ct +1Π t +1,t , St / St +1 )
                                                    −1     −1

                 1 + it +1, t   = Et        +                                 if it +1,t ≤ 0 and it ,t −1 ≤ 0.
                                      St +1    Et ( ct−+11Π t−+11,t )

4.3 A floating exchange rate version of the wim currency model with pet

rocks

        There is nothing in the logic of the model that requires the fiat money to be provided

by the government. Assume that instead of fiat paper or electronic currency, there is some

exogenous supply of intrinsically worthless objects, say ‘pet rocks’ like rai, the stone money

of the Yap islands. These are large, doughnut-shaped carved disks, usually of calcite, that

can be up to 4 meters in diameter, although most are much smaller. Money would disappear

from the government budget constraint (62), which would become

                                          Bt∗                                            B∗
                                   Bt +       ≡ (1 + it , t −1 ) Bt −1 + (1 + it∗, t −1 ) t −1 + Pt ( g t − τ t )
                                          St                                              St

and      from            the         government                tax         rule         (64),         which         would   become

τ t = gt −
              1
             SPt
                 ( (1 + it*,t −1 ) Bt*−1 − St (1 + it ,t −1 ) Bt −1 ) .      The government solvency constraint (63)


would be unaffected. Note that the pet rock money is a true ‘outside asset’, an asset to the

owner but not a liability of anyone else – ‘nature’ was the issuer.

                                                                       44
       As long as there is an exhaustive initial assignment of property rights for the pet

rocks, the household optimisation problem would not be affected. Interest on this pet rock

currency is zero. In the case of rai, the total stock is given, but in principle the supply could

change exogenously over time (if meteorites were the currency, say) as long as any addition

to the stock has an exhaustive assignment of property rights.

       In the pet rock currency model, pinning down the initial value of the exchange rate

between one unit of euro bonds and a unit of pet rocks, during a period when the interest rate

on euro bonds goes negative after being positive in the previous period, would again require

either a terminal boundary condition, or a fixing by the government. In the case of fiat euro

currency, the authorities certainly have the ability to set the value of the exchange rate in any

period, as they can issue any (non-negative) amount of currency. This is not true in the case

of pet rocks whose aggregate supply is given and finite. All I can offer at this point is that the

solution for the stochastic exchange rate path given in (74) is a solution for the case where

currency is pet rocks. There are bound to be many other solutions as well, however.




4.4 A private currency interpretation of the model

       Assume that, in the euro currency economy, the government abolishes its fiat

currency and retires all notes and coin. Assume that the prohibition against the private

issuance of currency were lifted. There are private firms (banks) owned by the households,

that then create and produce non-interest-bearing currency, again called ‘wim’ for the

representative bank. Assume they maximise profits and that there is free entry and exit into

the banking sector. In equilibrium the banking sector will therefore make no pure profits, so

we don’t have to worry about including bank equity in the asset menus and endowments of

the households. If euro bonds and media of exchange on which interest can be paid are


                                               45
imperfect substitutes for the old euro currency but the new private currency is a perfect

substitute for the old euro currency, there will be a demand for the new private currency. The

real value of currency demanded would still be given by equation (55).

          When writing down the profit function of a bank, we must make an assumption about

whether the currency it issues is irredeemable in the sense we assumed government fiat

money to be irredeemable. If it is irredeemable, the present discounted value of the terminal

stock of private bank currency outstanding can be positive, if not, it must be zero. For private

banks I prefer the assumption that the currency they issue must ultimately be redeemed in

present discounted value terms. Let f t be the fixed real cost of producing currency in period

t. The bank maximizes the present discounted value of current and future real profits:

    ∞           ∆M t*+ j             
Et ∑ Rt*+ j ,t           − ft + j −1 
                P                    
   j =1         t+ j                 

          I have assumed the marginal cost of issuing currency is zero (a reasonable

assumption, as it is always possible, with negligible cost, to add a zero to the face value of a

currency note). In that case, there will be an incentive in each period, in a competitive setting

where each bank takes the general price level, P * = SP , and the stochastic discount factors

Rt*+ j ,t as given, to continue issuing currency, that is, to boost ∆M * , as long as currency has

any positive value. An infinite price level in each period would be the outcome – there would

be no equilibrium

          If there were a private monopoly, which allowed for the endogeneity of discount rates

and prices, the present discounted value of current and future real seigniorage would, for

money demand functions that have the Laffer curve property (see Buiter (2007b)) be

maximised (in the stationary case), when the wim risk-free nominal interest rate equals the

reciprocal of the (absolute value of the) semi-elasticity of demand for money with respect to


                                               46
that interest rate. Since this is surely a positive number, the zero lower bound would never

bind in this economy. The budget constraints of the households would have to be modified to

include their share of the profits from the monopoly bank.

       If the private sector were regulated (neither competitive nor a monopoly), the

authorities could restrict the rate of issuance of private wim currency to the point that the zero

lower bound in wim interest rates became a binding constraint. In that case, we would,

except for the distribution of the profits of the regulated banking sector, be back to the case of

the wim currency model with pet rocks.



5 The liquidity trap and quantitative easing

       The model has implications for the conditions under which a liquidity trap exists in

the case where the lower bound constraint is not removed by any of the three methods

outlined in Sections 3 and 4. I interpret a liquidity trap as an equilibrium in which risk-free

nominal interest rates at all maturities are at their lower bound (typically zero). There are

stronger versions of the liquidity trap, which require not only that risk-free nominal interest

rates at all maturities be at their lower bound, but also that all liquidity premia at all

maturities be zero.

       In the model used in this paper, which is a complete markets model with frictionless

markets, there are no liquidity premia.      Indeed, as the complete markets assumption is

combined with the (implicit) assumption that there is costless enforcement of the

intertemporal budget constraints of all agents, there also are no default risk premia, as every

agent, in every state of nature, always satisfies his intertemporal budget constraint and

consequently there is no default risk.




                                               47
       It is easily shown in the model of this paper that there exists no liquidity trap

equilibrium in this economy, unless the authorities demonetise the economy. In this section I

return to the euro currency model.

       In period t, the risk-free nominal discount factor over a j -period horizon j ≥ 1 j is

defined by

             Et I t + j ,t = Et ∏ k =t +1 I k ,k −1
                                         t+ j




                     (               (                   (
             = Et I t +1,t Et +1 I t + 2,t + 2 Et + 2 I t +3,t + 2 (....Et + j −1 I t + j ,t + j −1 ) ...   ))) = ∏   t+ j
                                                                                                                      k = t +1
                                                                                                                                     1
                                                                                                                                 1 + ik ,k −1

       In a liquidity trap, therefore, ik +1,k = ikM+1,k , k ≥ t .                                          Now consider the household

solvency constraint (17), which holds with equality, the definition of private financial wealth

(9), the asset market equilibrium condition (28) and the government solvency constraint (23).

Assume the government solvency constraint holds with equality – this is a policy choice open

to the authorities. We then obtain from the household solvency constraint:

                                     lim Et I j +1, t ( (1 + i j +1, j ) B j + (1 + i Mj +1, j ) M j ) = 0                                      (75)
                                      j →∞



and from the government solvency constraint:

                                                    lim Et I j +1, t (1 + i j +1, j ) B j = 0                                                   (76)
                                                     j →∞



       Equations (75) and (76) imply that,

                                                   lim Et I j +1, t (1 + i Mj +1, j ) M j = 0                                                   (77)
                                                    j →∞



       Assume that we are in a liquidity trap equilibrium. It is easily seen that (77) is

violated unless the proportional growth rate of the nominal stock of base money is below the

interest rate on base money. In a liquidity trap

                                                            j 
                                                                       1 
                                                    lim ∏                       Et M j = 0                                                   (78)
                                                    j →∞         
                                                         k =t +1  1 + ik , k −1 
                                                                        M




                                                                          48
       This will only be satisfied if the long-run expected proportional growth rate of the

monetary base is less that the long-run value of i M . Consider the practically relevant case

where the nominal interest rate on currency is zero. Equation (78) becomes

                                           lim Et M j = 0                                 (79)
                                            j →∞



So a liquidity trap equilibrium exists only if the authorities are expected to demonetise the

economy in the long run.

       Equation (77) is almost the same as the transversality condition of the household

optimum problem given in (15), although it is an implication of solvency constraints rather

than an optimality condition.

                                                    βj               
                                Pt lim Et  ct−+γ j            M t+ j  = 0               (80)
                                   j →∞            Π t + j ,t        
                                                                     

       In the fundamental stationary equilibrium of the deterministic flexible price version of

the model with constant values of the exogenous variables, summarised in equations (39) to

(44), equations (76) and (80) are equivalent, since household consumption is bounded.

Unless the authorities demonetize the economy in the long run (if the interest rate on

currency is zero), there can be no liquidity trap equilibrium because the shadow value of the

terminal money stock would not go to zero. Households would severally try to get rid of

excessive money balances, something that, in the aggregate they cannot do. This can be

viewed as a formal version of the ‘hot potato’ view of money.

       Friedman’s optimal quantity of money (OQM) equilibrium rule (Friedman (1969))

does indeed have the property that the nominal stock of base money goes to zero

asymptotically, even though there is satiation in real money balances in every period (see

Buiter and Sibert (2007).




                                                   49
Conclusion

        This paper discusses three methods for removing the zero lower bound on nominal

interest rates. All three are technically feasible, indeed operationally simple. Abolishing

currency may seem drastic, but should present no significant logistical problems for advanced

economies, except for the underground (grey and black economy). Taxing currency would be

the most administratively demanding and intrusive of the three methods. Unbundling the

numéraire from the currency would seem to have lack of familiarity as the main argument

against it.

        Whatever the demerits of these three operational schemes for removing the lower

bound on nominal interest rates, they must be set against the economic cost of handicapping

the central bank in its pursuit of expansionary monetary policies through the continued

existence of the zero floor. If, but for the zero lower bound, the Federal Funds target rate

ought indeed to have been set at minus five percent, the cost of not being able to go below

zero could be vast indeed.     We do not know what scale and scope of unconventional

monetary policies, such as quantitative easing or credit easing, can compensate for the

asymmetry in the domain over which the official policy rate can range. It may indeed be the

case that no amount of quantitative easing or credit easing can make up for the inability of the

monetary authorities to set negative nominal interest rates. The subject matter of this paper is

therefore not a theoretical curiosum.      It is a practical monetary policy issue of great

importance.
