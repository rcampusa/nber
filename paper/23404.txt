Co-authorship in Economic History and Economics: Are We Any Different?

                                         ABSTRACT

Over the last six decades articles published in leading economic history journals have been less
likely to be co-authored than articles published in leading general economics journals. However,
in both economic history and general economics journals there have been strong, monotonic
increases in the number of authors per article and the fraction of co-authored papers. Economics
and economic history differ in the nature of collaboration, in that co-authorships in economic
history are more likely to be formed of individuals of different seniority as compared to
economics generally.

         Hudson (1996) demonstrated that a change in the nature of publishing in economics

had occurred between the 1970s and 1990s, namely a rise in the extent of co-authoring in

articles published in major economics journals. Hamermesh (2013) showed that this trend

continued through the first part of the 21st century. He also demonstrated that co-authorships

in economics are typically not the result of teacher-student co-operation, but rather that co-

authors are usually quite close in age. Our research question here is whether research styles in

economic history have paralleled those in economics generally along these dimensions.

    A widely-held stereotype within the economics profession is of economic historians as

lone scholars digging through archival material and producing scholarly work on their own.

Anecdotally, economic historians appear to be more dismissive of co-authored work. For

example, the Economic History Department at the London School of Economics greatly

restricts (de facto prohibits) joint work as part of a Ph.D. submission; and the Economic

History Society has prohibited jointly-authored work from receiving its New Researcher

Prize. In 2014 the Abilitazioni Scientifiche Nazionali, the competition in Italy that is

conducted to determine the suitability of scholars for appointment to professorial positions,

formally excluded co-authored publications in economic history that did not contain explicit

statements indicating the contribution of each author (London School of Economics, 2017;

Economic History Society, 2017; European Historical Economics Society, 2017). In this note

we examine whether this stereotype and the anecdotal evidence are consistent with the nature

of publication in economic history journals.1

    I.       Co-authorship in Economic History and Economics, 1963-2011

    We first tabulated the authorship patterns in six decadal volumes of the Economic History

Review, Explorations in Economic History, and the Journal of Economic History, three of the

oldest and arguably the three leading scholarly journals in economic history. To match the

1
 This is hardly the first bibliometric paper to examine publications in economic history (e.g., Di Vaio et al,
2012, and earlier work). It is, however, the first to study the issues that we stress here.

                                                      2
tabulations for the “Top 3” general journals in economics—the American Economic Review,

Journal of Political Economy, and Quarterly Journal of Economics—produced by

Hamermesh (2013), we restricted the sample to articles published in 1963, 1973, 1983, 1993,

2003 and 2011.

    Columns (1) and (2) of Table 1 present calculations of the number of authors per article in

the three economic history journals and the three leading general journals over these six

decades. In each decade the number of authors per article is lower in the leading economic

history journals than in economics journals generally. The trends, however, are remarkably

similar: In economic history the number of authors per article has risen by 68 percent over

this period; and in economics generally (as indicated by publications in the “Top 3” journals)

the rise has been slightly, albeit statistically significantly more rapid, an 89 percent increase.

    The similarity is less pronounced if we examine the incidence of sole-authorship, shown

in Columns (4) and (5) of Table 1. Co-authorship was very rare in economic history and in

economics generally in the 1963 sample. By the turn of the 21st century, sole-authorship had

become fairly uncommon in economics, but remained much more common in economic

history. In both areas, however, the incidence of co-authorship has been rising monotonically

over the past five decades.2

    Research in economic history is occasionally published in the three top general journals

that are featured in Columns (2) and (5) of Table 1. To examine whether co-authorship

patterns in economic history differ when articles appear there, we take the data collected by

Abramitzky (2015) and tabulate statistics for economic history articles published in those

three journals.3 The results of these tabulations are presented in Columns (3) and (6) of Table


2
 Viewing these decadal tabulations as samples from populations of articles written in economic history and
economics generally, all of the percentages sole-authored are significantly higher in economic history than in
general economics.
3
 Because of the paucity of articles in economic history in any single year in these journals, we take triennial
averages centered around the years listed in Table 1.

                                                      3
1. For these representative years, in the last three decades both the numbers of authors per

article and percentage sole-authored are slightly lower in economic history articles published

in these outlets than is generally true; but they are closer to the co-authorship pattern of all

articles in these journals than to the pattern in the leading economic history journals.

Moreover, the data show that, just as in economic history journals and in economics

generally, the incidence of co-authorship has increased greatly.

    Table 1 aggregates all three economic history journals; but perhaps the growing number

of authors on each article and the decline in the incidence of sole-authorship in this aggregate

arise from changes in only one or two of the three journals. To examine this possibility, in

Table 2 we present the same data for each of the journals separately. The tabulations make it

clear that there are differences among the journals: Co-authorship has generally been most

frequent in Explorations in Economic History, the most quantitative of the three economic

history journals, and least frequent in the Economic History Review, the least quantitative. All

three journals, however, have seen roughly the same rate of increase in the number of authors

per article and declines in the incidence of sole-authorship.4

    II.      Co-author Relationships

    With co-authored articles increasingly common and, indeed, now more common than

sole-authorship in the leading economic history journals, the question becomes what their

prevalence implies about other aspects of economic historians’ research style. Research in

economic history requires a somewhat different set of skills from research in other fields of

economics, and impressionistically economic historians produce fewer papers than

economists. These differences in research style may imply differences in research



4
 The patterns in other economic history journals are not that different. Appendix Tables A1 and A2 to this paper
show sole authorship and number of authors per paper over the period 1963-2011 for a wide range of English-
language economic history journals. The levels of co-authorship in the other economic history journals is
generally lower than those shown in in Table 2, but the trend increase is very similar.


                                                       4
relationships: for example, teacher-student relationships may be more important in economic

history.5

    To examine this issue we collected information on the ages of all authors of two-authored

papers that were published in these three journals in 2003 and 2011. Of the 66 two-authored

papers in this subset of our data, we were able to obtain the ages of both authors in 63 of the

pairs, with one missing from EEH and two from the EHR.6

    Column (2) of Table 3 presents the frequency distribution describing the differences in

ages between the authors of two-authored articles. 44 percent of scholarly partners are fewer

than 10 years different in age; but another 44 percent are at least 15 years apart. The average

age difference is roughly 13 years.

    Compare these statistics to those calculated from the data on two-author co-authorships

underlying Hamermesh (2013), presented in Column (3) of Table 3, which summarizes these

same age differences for articles published in these two years in the leading general

economics journals. 64 percent of co-authors of those articles are fewer than 10 years apart in

age, and only 16 percent are at least 15 years apart. The average age difference is less than 8

years. Given the number of observations in each sample, the average age difference in

economics generally is highly significantly below that in economic history.7 Indeed, the

overall distribution is different from that in economic history (Χ2(5) = 108.16).8



5
 Several people have also commented to us that they believe that these differences in the nature of research are
likely to have led to more stable co-authoring relationships in economic history, with more co-author pairs
working together over years or even decades. While this claim seems plausible, the decadal publication data
used in this study are not suited to testing it. It is an interesting topic for future research.
6
 As a note, there is a huge range of ages of authors at time of publication in these three journals, between 28 and
85, not that different from co-authorship in economics generally in these two years (ages 24 to 77).
7
 Even if the three co-authorships for which we failed to obtain information were between scholars of identical
ages (age difference = 0), the average age difference in two-authored articles in these economic history journals
would still be much, and highly significantly greater than that in economics generally.
8
 Taking the nine two-authored papers in 2003 and 2011 in the leading general journals that are classified as
economic history, the average age difference between the authors is 7.8 years (s.e. = 2.8) identical to the age
difference between co-authors of all two-authored papers in these journals and years. This provides suggestive

                                                        5
    Why is the difference between co-authors’ ages so much greater in economic history than

in economics generally? We cannot prove causation for this difference, but at least two

possibilities are consistent with it: 1) It may be that the nature of the research process in

economic history does lend itself more to senior-junior relationships than in economics

generally. Senior scholars may have a comparative advantage in knowledge of source

materials and other non-technical research skills, whereas junior scholars may have a

comparative advantage in the more technical aspects of research; or 2) Given the relative

sparseness in economic history of scholars over whom one might search for potential co-

authors, random searching will automatically generate a greater age difference than it would

in the thicker field of general economics (or even in most of the sub-fields in that discipline).

    III.     Co-authorship in Economic and Social History

    Table 2 shows that the Economic History Review has noticeably less co-authorship than

the other two leading economic history journals. A plausible reason for this contrast is sub-

disciplinary differences: Economic History Review is expressly a journal of economic and

social history, whereas the other two are journals of economic history. The stereotype of the

lone scholar may be more accurate for social historians than economic historians, and thus

the difference in the incidence of co-authorship across journals may simply be due to the

difference in the composition of papers. The higher incidence of co-authorship by economic

historians publishing in general journals is suggestive of this possibility. To examine this

possibility, we categorized each article in the EHR in 2003 and 2011 as either primarily

economic or primarily historical according to content and citations. We classified an article as

having economic content if it either had a formal mathematical economic model or used




evidence that, when publishing in these general journals, economic historians are again responding to a general
norm that differs from the specific norm in economic history journals.


                                                      6
econometric analysis.9 For each article we also counted the number of citations to leading

economics general and field journals outside of economic history.10 We classified an article

as primarily economic if it either had any citations to leading economics journals or, in an

alternative classification, if it had at least three citations to leading economics journals.

     Table 4 characterizes the co-authorship patterns of EHR articles from 2003 and 2011 by

different methods of categorization. Surprisingly, regardless of our approach to classifying

articles as primarily economic, there is no evidence to suggest that economic history has a

higher incidence of co-authorship than social history. Indeed, regardless of the definition

used, the rate of sole-authorship was higher in primarily economic articles, in some instances

significantly so. The lower co-authorship rate in the Economic History Review is due to some

underlying cultural differences associated with this journal or with work outside the United

States more generally, rather than with discipline-specific factors.11

     IV.     Conclusions and Implications

     Over the last six decades published articles in economic history journals have been less

likely to be co-authored than articles in general economics journals. While the number of

9
 Inevitably there were a couple of borderline cases where the classification was ambiguous. For example, one
article contained a linear regression on a time trend but no other explanatory variables. As a general rule, we
only classified an article as having economic content if we believed that the techniques used were examining an
underlying economic relationship. We did not classify as having economic content several articles that used an
explicit, but informal economic framework.
10
  Any definition of what constitutes the leading economic journals is ad hoc. We include the leading general
journals (AER, QJE, JPE, Econometrica, Rev. Ec. Stud., Rev. Ec. Stat., the Am. Ec. J.’s, etc.) and the leading
journals in each major sub-field (J. Labor Econ., J. Monetary Econ. J. Finance, etc.). It is fairly clear from
inspection that a classification using a broader list of economic journals would be very similar to that used in
this paper.
11
  Another hypothesis is that the differences in sole authorship rates are due to differences in time periods
covered across the three journals. The EHR publishes more papers covering medieval and early modern
economic history than the EEH or JEH. Sole authorship may be more common for work on earlier periods,
either because of differences in the nature of source materials, or less overall research activity and hence fewer
opportunities for collaboration. We have tested this hypothesis by looking at sole authorship rates and the
number of authors per paper for articles published in 2003 and 2011 covering the periods before 1500, 1500-
1750, 1750-1900, and 1900 onwards. Surprisingly, there are virtually no differences in the sole authorship rates
across periods of study. There is a small, but monotonic increase in the number of authors per paper over the
time periods; however, this alone explains virtually none of the differences among the three journals.



                                                        7
authors per article and the fraction of single-authored papers remain lower, the number of

authors has been rising rapidly and the fraction of single-authored articles has been declining.

One answer to the sub-titular question of this paper would be: Yes in both levels and trends in

co-authorship, but not that much different; and economic historians are even less different,

and appear to conform more to (economics) profession-wide norms, when publishing in

general economics journals. Economics and economic history are different in terms of the

nature of collaboration, at least as evidenced by publications in the major journals. Co-

authorships in economic history are more likely to be formed of individuals of different

seniority as compared to economics generally.

   This note has presented substantial and often surprising new facts about the “what” of

scholarship in economic history. We have not shed much light on the “why” underlying the

facts that we have discovered. Rather, they provide a series of paths for future research by

others examining styles of scholarship in economic history and comparing them to the field

of economics generally.
