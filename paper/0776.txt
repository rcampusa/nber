               Currency Diversification and Export Competitiveness:
                        A Model of the "Egyptian Disease"



                                    ABSTRACT



     The paper presents a dynamic portfolio model under currency inconver-

tibility which rationalizes the recent Egyptian experience of real exchange

rate appreciation and currency diversification following the increase in

oil exports and the partial financial liberalization that took place after

1976. The two shocks are linked because the relative price of manufacturing

exports in terms of oil is also the premium of the black market rate over

the official exchange rate. The effects of various official exchange rate

policies on the temporary equilibrium values of the premium and the real

wage and on the steady—state values of asset stocks are examined. A review

of the Egyptian experience shows that as the model suggests the official

devaluation of 1979 was ineffective against the "Egyptian disease" so that

little can be expected from the 1981 devaluation. In light of the model

results, a crawling peg policy is proposed instead.

        The notion of an "economic disease" is frequently used in policy circles,

but it is only recently that it has become popular in open economy macro-

economics. There are now about a    half   dozen models of the "Dutch disease,"1

a catchword for the loss of international competitiveness in manufactures

associated with a boom in natural resource—based exports. As the price of oil

rises relative to the price of manufactured exports, the trade balance of the

oil exporter moves into surplus and this leads to a combination of nominal

exchange rate appreciation and reserve inflows. If the latter are not sterilized,

there is domestic inflation and a decline in export competitiveness. Real

appreciation has also been observed in the context of Southern Cone stabili-

zation plans, entailing a financial liberalization and excessive capital

inflows, as recently described in another collection of models.2 Actually,

the 1979—80 British experience can be seen as an example of Southern Cone—type

excessive capital inflows exacerbating the effects of the oil surplus on the

real price of sterling.3

        Instead, in the recent Egyptian experience, oil—induced real appreciation

has been associated with capital outflows and an increase in foreign money

balances held by domestic residents. After Sadat's October Working Paper

called for "the opening" in early 1974, in effect, tight trade and exchange

restrictions were substantially relaxed.4 First, the various premiums and

surcharges on the official exchange rate were consolidated and expanded through

the creation of a "parallel market," where foreign currency was exchanged at

rates   about 10% below the ones prevailing in the sizable "gray market" toler-
ated by the authorities. Second, "own" imports, not requiring the purchase
of   foreign exchange, were greatly expanded. Third, foreign currency deposits

by domestic residents were allowed at competitive interest rates. Fourth,
                                       —2—


current account transactions were gradually moved from the official to the

parallel market. Effective January 1, 1979, raw cotton, rice, petroleum

and petroleum products ceased to he transacted at the old official rate

of 39 piastres per dollar and the parallel rate of 70 piastres became the

new official (unified) exchange rate.5

       The Egyptian pound has remained inconvertible for current as well as

capital account transactions and the official foreign exchange market has

continued   to be dominated by the monetary authorities but the existence of
the "gray" market has made it possible for the private sector to build up
foreign currency balances   via an unreported current account surplus made up

of   migrants' remittances, tourism and underinvoicing of exports. In short,
while Dutch disease models generally neglect portfolio   considerations, and

the   same is true of most macro models for developing countries,6 the effects
of real appreciation on the currency   composition of financial wealth are a

crucial   feature of the "Egyptian disease." On the other hand, the real side
of    the model presented here is drastically simplified. In particular, a

fundamental aspect of the industrialization of a relatively more absorptive

oil exporter is ignored, namely the effect of the future exhaustion of oil

reserves on capital accumulation.7 The analysis of the effects of partial

financial liberalization on relative prices and currency diversification is

nevertheless useful to understand monetary and exchange rate policy in Egypt,

and, given the increasing reluctance of governments to embark on full interest

rate liberalization, these lessons can be applied to other financially open

relatively more absorptive oil exporters, such as Mexico.

       The paper is organized as follows. In Section I, a simple three—good

two—asset dynamic model of portfolio diversification under inconvertibility is
                                     —3—


described. It is shown how the currency ratio changes with the relative

price of a good traded through the official foreign exchange market, taken

to be a natural resource—based export. Policies such as devaluation, exchange

rate unification and a crawling peg are contrasted in this set up. Section II

reviews the recent macroeconomic experience of Egypt and shows that the

implications of the model are consistent with the stylized facts. Finally, the

conclusion suggests better ways of coping with the "Egyptian disease" than

the conventional monetarist cures. Specifically, it is claimed that the recent

official devaluation cannot relieve the symptoms of the disease, whereas the

implementation of an official crawling peg together with the channeling of

manufactured exports at the gray market rate could restore competitiveness and

increase the demand for assets denominated in domestic currency, even without

bringing domestic interest rates to the world level.

I.    CURRENCY DIVERSIFICATION AND EXPORT COMPETITIVENESS UNDER INCONVERTIBILITY


1. A three—good, two—asset model

       Consider an economy producing and consuming two composite traded goods

and one non—traded good. Theprice of the non—traded good, NT, can be thought

of as a markup over unit labor costs in the usual way. The foreign currency

price of the two traded goods, on the other hand, is determined in the world

market, which allows the aggregation of exports and imports. The two traded

goods are then distinguished by the fact that receipts and payments for one

of them, the "official traded good," are channeled through the official

foreign exchange market, at the official exchange rate ,   while   the other one

is   channeled through the black market for foreign exchange at a rate e, and
will be denoted as the 'smuggled good."8 In fact, rather than a strict
separation between the two goods, most goods are likely to traded in both
markets,   depending on the premium of the black market rate over the official

rate. Proceeds from underinvoicing of official exports and the acquisition

of official imports over a particular quantitative restriction are clear

examples of the difficulty in distinguishing goods by the applicable exchange

rate. While the introduction of this aspect is straightforward, it is not

essential to the story and it is therefore left out.9 In this connection it

is more useful to interpret the official traded good as a natural resource—

based export and the "smuggled good" as comprising manufactured exports as well

as the usual invisible transactions that are more likely to evade the official

channel. All that matters then is that the existence of a sufficient flow

of unreported current invisibles allows the black market exchange rate to

be seen by exporters as the rate applicable to their transactions, so that the

premium becomes a measure of the export subsidy that would make exporters
                                               —5—


indifferent between the two channels.

        We therefore have two relative prices. Choosing the official traded

good, whose price is P0, as the numeraire, starring foreign currency prices,

we define:


(1)           p =
                      ePB/eP


(2)           q =     w(l   +


                  NT =
where         P          w(l+),        being a markup and w unit labor costs.


        If the factors of production are fully employed, domestic supply of

each one of the three goods only depends on the two relative prices. Domestic

consumption, on the other hand, will be taken to depend on goods prices,

nominal income and         nominal wealth——to be defined below. If   demand is

homogeneous   of      degree zero in prices and income, consumption can be expressed

as a function of relative prices p and q and wealth in terms of the numeraire.10

Excess demand functions, also homogeneous of degree zero, can then be defined.

In fact the excess supply of the official traded good will be the reported

trade surplus (RCAB) while the unreported trade surplus (UCAB) equals the

excess supply of the smuggled good. We will assume that the market for non—

traded goods always clears, so that we can write our three excess supply

functions as:


(3)           (p,q,t) =         UCAB


                  +--
(4)           B(p,q,)           RCAB

                  -   +-
              N(p,q,W) = 0
(5)
                                           —6—


where             = W/P0 is real wealth.


Wealth is composed of two assets, domestic money, M, and foreign money, F.

Foreign money is valued at the black market rate in investor's portfolios,

while domestic money represents the foreign assets of the central bank, FG,

valued at the official exchange rate plus the stock of domestic assets of

the central bank, C.'1 Ignoring the banking system for simplicity (or

interpreting M as high powered money) we have:


(6)           M     C + FG


(7)           W=M+eF

        Now interpreting reported capital flows as transfer payments,

which are included in RCAB, and assuming also that the stock of private

foreign assets can only change by an unreported trade surplus, we have the

change in asset stocks described by:


(8)           F =   B(p,q,)

(9)           M =   C   + B(p,q,W)


Valuing the domestic money stock in terms of the numeraire and using (3)

we can rewrite (9) as


(9')          M=B+6M

where         M M/P° is the real money stock

and               = C/N — P° is the real increase in domestic credit creation.


Given the foreign currency price of the official traded good,P° is simply

the rate of crawl of the official exchange rate.
                                                 —7—


        Now, given financial wealth, the private sector chooses its currency

composition based on relative returns, transactions and wealth (with a unit

elasticity for convenience). Transactions demands can be proxied by the prices

of the goods. It will be assumed that an increase in the prices of the

official traded good and the non—traded good increase the demand for domestic

money while an increase in the price of the smuggled good increases demand for

foreign money. Expressing asset demand fluctuations in terms of the numeraire,

and eliminating the demand for domestic money by the wealth definition in

(7) we write portfolio balance as



(10)          pF
                             *     + +-
                       h(R + i — R,p,q)M

                   *
where         R(R )     is       the nominal return to the domestic (foreign) money

and               is the expected rate of change of the black market rate.


        In most of what follows the relative returns will be exogenous and

indeed the interest account on private foreign assets will be subsumed into

UCAB.12 Reference can be made, however, to the consequence of allowing an

endogenous expected rate of change of the black market rate as a measure of

relative returns, r.13 The first assumption is that expectations depend on the

level of the black market premium


(11)          =    g(p)

Depending on whether g' is positive or negative, we will have regressive or

extrapolative expectations. From (11) we have


(12)        p= pp
                                        —8—


where          p is the elasticity of expectations.


The alternative assumption is perfect foresight, according to which


(13)


In that case we have a third dynamic equation, obtained by inverting (10),

namely

                         +
(14)             =
                     v(,q,,F)
The model is now complete in its outline. Given asset stocks, and expectations,

equations (5) and (10) determine the temporary equilibrium values of the two

relative prices. Given relative prices, and expectations, equations (8) and

(9') determine the steady—state values of the asset stocks. Expectations can

be made endogenous by using either (12) or (14).


2.     Temporary equilibrium


       The temporary equilibrium values of p and q are obtained from (5) and (10)

above. From (5), an increase in q creates an excess supply of the non—traded

good, which, given asset supplies, can only be offset by an increase in the

black market premium. The combination of p and q consistent with equilibrium

in the non—traded goods market are thus given by an upward sloping locus in

p,q space, drawn as NT in Figure 1.    From (10), an increase in q generates a

decreased demand for foreign assets. Given asset supplies and expectations,

this implies a decrease in the premium, so that the combinations of p and q

consistent with portfolio balance are given by a downward sloping locus, PB

in Figure 1. If an increase in the price of the non—traded good increased

the demand for foreign assets (or if the effect of the premium       thereon
were larger than the valuation effect), the portfolio balance locus would
                     14
be upward sloping.

        In any case, the slope of the NT locus (which has the "own" price

effect on the non—traded goods market in the numerator) is steeper than a ray

through the origin defining the price of the smuggled good in terms of the

non—traded good, p/q. At the intersection of the NT and PB loci, the system

is in temporary equilibrium with relative prices p0 and q0. To ascertain

the effects of changes in asset stocks and expectations on the temporary

equilibrium, logarithmic differentiation of (5) and (10) yields:



                                                        -(l-a)

                                                                                      )r

                                                                     /        \0     /


where           = pF/W is the share of foreign assets in wealth;

                          is the positive elasticity of demand for foreign

                          assets with respect to the premium (the relative price

                          of non—traded goods, relative returns) e.g.             sf/f
                                                                         E2       q/q
                 =   —WN/W    is   the positive semi—elasticity of the excess supply

                          of non—traded goods with respect to real wealth;

                      is the positive semi—elasticity of the excess supply of

                          non—traded goods with respect to the premium (the relative

                          price of non—traded goods), e.g. l =     p/p
                                                  —11—


        From (15), the slope of the NT and the PB loci can be written as:


                          =
                              2l    +




                   q PB
                          =    1-       -




         As indicated, the slope of the NT locus is positive and greater than

p/q, while the PB locus will be downward sloping if the valuation effect

of p dominates, so that:


(16)              l-c >s1


         Thus condition (16) puts as an upper bound on the premium elasticity

of the share of foreign assets in wealth the share of domestic money in

wealth: if domestic money is 80% of wealth, the elasticity has to be less
           15
than .8.          If the premium elasticity were at its upper bound the PB wnuld

be vertical.

         The effect of an increase in the demand for foreign assets on the

temporary equilibrium can be seen by going back to Figure 1. From T, an

increase in the return to foreign currency (increase in iJ)            will   shift PB

up: given asset stocks, an increase in q would reduce the demand for foreign

assets,    while an increase in p           would increase the valuation of the existing

stock    (since   this effect dominates by assumption). The NT locus does not

shift,    so that the two     relative prices increase to T1, p increasing by more

than q. Conversely, an increase in F shifts the PB locus down, while it

shifts the NT locus to the right because an excess demand for non—traded goods

implies an increase in its relative price, or a decline in the black market
                                                               —12—




premium.       As a consequence p has to decrease to accomodate an                          increase in

F   but   q may increase or decrease. In any event, p/q falls. In Figure 1,

it is assumed that the PB curve shifts by more so that q is also smaller at

T2. To ascertain this, solve (15) given relative returns and write it

compactly as:


(15')
                IP   1        =        M      F1 H
                                                     L
where                     =            — co1s2)(l—c)/A

                          =       -(             +
                                                     w1s2c)/A

                          =            +


                          =                     +


and              A =                            +             +            >
                           \2(l-c—s1)                (Yü1         \)1)E2

          It   is clear from (15') that, if condition (15) holds and A > 0

as assumed,'6 then                      < 0   and        <   0, the case depicted in Figure 1.      Similarly,

and increase in M will unambiguously raise                                     > 0) but it may increase or

decrease p.          In fact the increase in N shifts the PB locus up because it

generates an increase in the demand for foreign assets and requires an

increase in p or in q to maintain portfolio balance. The effect on the NT

locus is the same as the effect of an increase in F, it shifts to the right

and requires an increase in q or a decrease in p .                                The condition for both

q and p to increase (or for                          >   0) as shown in Figure 1 by T3, is the dominance

of the "own"         effect            in the non—traded goods market, or:


(17)                  >
                                               —13—


Even when p    increases, however, it will only increase by more than q if
a stronger condition than (17) holds, namely              >
                                                              q   ,   which in turn will
be true if:

(18)
               2>l       w1(i—1
         The effect of a once—and—for—all devaluation of the official rate is to

lower p, q and

                               l
                     in proportion. This will generate an excess demand for

non—traded goods if        >       +       , so that the NT locus will shift to the
right to maintain equilibrium and q will not decline in proportion. The

effect on the demand for foreign assets hinges on whether the demand effect

of the premium is stronger than the valuation effect of the premium plus the

demand effect of the relative price of non—traded goods. In particular, demand

for foreign assets will decrease if             >

3.     Steady—state equilibrium

        The dynamics are governed by (8) and (9') above. Substituting for p

and q , we can express asset accumulation as a function of asset stocks and

(stationary) expectations:


(19)            =   B(p,N,F)   +M
(20)          F =   B(,M,F)

        In long—run equilibrium, when B          0, since the non—traded goods

market and the asset markets are always in equilibrium, we have to have

B = 0 as well. This implies an equilibrium relationship between credit

        Similarly, if V2 and r are large relative to                        and w1, the trace

will be negative and given by:


(23)          -TR =
                      2(V2(1-)       + ow1E2) +                -
                                                                   w1(c2( + )

        The dominance of the own effect has to be stronger than assumed in

signing (23) for the two diagonal elements in (21) to be negative and the
                                        —15—



two off—diagonal terms to be positive. Assuming that this is the case,

the two loci where M = 0 and ] = 0 will be positively sloped. And, because

of condition (22), the F = 0 locus will be steeper than the H = 0 locus in

M, F space, as depicted in Figure 2. As shown by the arrows, above the

M = 0 locus, the reported current account has a deficit larger than real

domestic credit creation and real money balances are decreasing, while

below they are increasing. Above the F = 0 locus the unreported current

account is in surplus and the private stocks of foreign assets is increasing,

while below it is decreasing. Steady—state equilibrium obtains at A with

asset stocks F and N. Note from (10) that a ray through the origin has

slope p/h.

        Consider first the long run effects of an exogenous increase in the demand

for foreign assets, from a position of equilibrium at A. As shown above,

given asset supplies, p and q go up. This moves the reported current account

into deficit, so the M = 0 locus shifts to the right, and (if the "own" effect

dominates) the unreported current account into surplus so the F = 0 locus also

shifts to the right. As shown in the Appendix, at the new steady—state (A1),

there   is a larger currency ratio. Consider next the effect of a once—and—for—all
devaluation of the official rate from A1    ,   which   decreases p and q (as well as
p/q).     This brings the reported current account into surplus and the unreported

current   account into deficit, so that M has to increase (or F has to decrease) to
restore   balance. Thus the N = 0 locus shifts up and the F = 0 locus shifts to

the left, while the premium also increases, moving the economy to A3, where the

currency ratio is the same as at A1. Conversely, from A2, a decrease in S

shifts the M = 0 locus down because a decline in M (or an increase in F) will

improve the reported current account to compensate for the decreased domestic

credit creation. The F = 0 locus does not shift so that if the N = 0 locus

shifts back to A1 the new steady—state will have a lower currency ratio.

Thus, unlike devaluation, a crawling peg can decrease the steady—state currency

ratio. The reason for this difference lies in the effect of the two measures

on real balances. The improvement in the reported current account due to a

once—and—for—all devaluation increases real balances (in proportion) while
                                   18
the crawling peg decreases them.

        Consider finally the effects of exchange rate unification. If unification

is accompanied by a floating official exchange rate, central bank reserves do

not change, portfolio balance is described by (10) above with p= 1, domestic

money is given and the change in the stock of foreign assets is equal to the

aggregation of the reported and unreported current account, so that we have

the conventional portfolio model with non—traded goods.19 If unification were

accompanied by a fixed but fully—convertible official exchange rate, on the

other hand, domestic and foreign money would become perfect substitutes and

we could apply the simple monetary approach to the balance of payments. It

is,   however, difficult to believe that such a policy would be   credible without

full   interest liberalization so that the reasons for the development of a black
market for foreign exchange would probably remain and the private valuation of
foreign currenc\ would still differ from the official exchange rate, with the

consequences suggested above.

       We now proceed to review the recent Egyptian experience and to interpret

it in light of the results of the model.

II. THE EGYPTIAN EXPERIENCE


     The philosophy of the October Working Paper may not have succeeded in gener-

ating a private entrepreneurial class that would replace the bureaucracy of the

Nasser era: private investment is still less than 20% of the total. Never-

theless, the opening of the Egyptian economy is unquestionable. Imports and

exports increased from 15% and 21% of GNP in 1972—73 to 44% and 53% in the

late 1970's.2° In 1979, furthermore, the increased oil revenues, Suez Canal

dues and reported migrants reached 17% of GNP, accruing mostly to the govern-

ment rather than to the private sector. If reported capital flows are also

interpreted as tranfer payments, balance of payments data shows a reported

transfer from abroad partly offset by an unreported private capital outflow.

Given that the propensity to save in Egypt is probably less than in its trading

partners, the net income effect of the reported transfer is expansionary. Coupled

with the effect of emigration on the supply of skilled labor, the transfer also

explains that real unit labor costs in manufacturing have been rising faster

than abroad. In short, the recent Egyptian experience can be seen as the

response of relative goods prices and the currency composition of financial

wealth to two shocks: an increase in the price of the official traded good

and an increase in the return to foreign assets.

     Even though there has been some concern about the decline in export compe-

titiveness and the increase in currency diversification that are at the heart of

the "Egyptian disease,t' these do not seem to bother the authorities as much as the

acceleration of consumer price inflation from about 10% pa. to perhaps 30% in

1980 (taking into account the free market price of some controlled commodities),

first because attempting to stabilize the price of wage goods has involved an
                                    —19—


increasing share of government expenditure. The policy measures of May 1980

addressed the decline in real wages that came as a consequence of inflation

both by an increase in labor compensation and by an increase in the subsidy

of some essential consumer goods. These measures have thus required govern-

ment credit creation both to sterilize the deterioration in the foreign

asset position of the Central Bank in 1977 and 1978 and not to sterilize the

improvement in 1979 and 1980.

      It is therefore no wonder that most analyses of Egyptian monetary

problems rely on conventional open economy monetarism, ignoring the two basic

features of the "Egyptian disease." To illustrate the conventional view,

define monetary equilibrium from the quantity equation and the purchasing

power parity hypothesis. Then, using changes in an average official import

exchange rate against the dollar (taking into account the gradual shift of

goods from the official to the parallel rate between 1975 and 1978 to be

described below) plus U.S. consumer price inflation as a proxy for the world

pound inflation, and the Egyptian CPI as a proxy for domestic inflation,

we do get a clear monetarist message for the period 1975—78: money growth

(24—30% p.a.) exceeded real output growth (19% p.a.) so domestic inflation

(about 10%) was bound to catch up with world pound inflation (13—14%). But

then the official devaluation (15% in 1978 and 30% in 1979) implied monetary

contraction at world prices (—8% and —26% respectively) even though inflation

continued to be repressed at 10—15% p.a. Nevertheless, domestic inflation

exploded in 1980 as "equilibrium" inflation dropped to the fixed exchange

rate level of U.S. inflation. As a consequence, monetary contraction at

domestic prices was exacerbated, while there was 12% excess money creation at

world prices, as shown in Chart 1. Before showing how real appreciation and

 currency diversification qualifies the simply monetarist cure of reducing

credit creation so as to bring "money growth" to the level implied by nominal

output growth at world prices,21 it is useful to take a closer look at the

deviations from purchasing power parity, that is to say at export competi-

tiveness.

     A common measure of international competitiveness is provided by unit labor

costs relative to major trading partners. For a semi—industrialized country such

as Egypt, this measure should be interpreted with caution since the comparison

of unit labor costs with, say, the United States, has to be made relative to

an arbitrary base period, and has to ignore the implications for labor pro-

ductivity of the substantial sectoral reallocations that are likely to take

place as a consequence of industrialization. Furthermore, the existence of

multiple exchange rates has to be taken into account. This is done in Chart 2,

where unit labor costs in manufacturing relative to the U.S. are reported at

both the average official export exchange rate and the gray market rate

(see Appendix Table 1). The gain in competitiveness achieved by the gradual

unification of 1977—79 is evident from the chart, as well as the appreciation

of the official rate in 1980, but the striking feature is the deterioration

in competitiveness of the goods valued at the gray market rate, whose relative

costs in late 1980 were 30% above the ,base period level. The chart also

shows relative real unit labor costs. The difference between these and unit

labor costs is simply the change in either nominal exchange rate and a relative

price index: the continued appreciation of the real gray market rate is evident

from the widening distance between the two top curves in Chart 2.22

and during the same period the premium of the gray market rate over an

average official export rate (which takes into account the gradual shift

of goods from the official to the parallel market) declined from 55% to

31%.     After the unification, however, the gray market rate began to

follow the rising foreign interest rates and the premium on the unified

(parallel) rate increased steadily until mid—1980. At that time, the decline

in foreign interest rates as well as the announcement by the government that

customs dues on imported goods could again be paid for in local currency led

to a drop in the premium to about 10% (Chart 3).   But soon after the premium

returned to over 20% and it reached 27.5% in mid—1981, to drop to less than

7% after the July devaluation which brought the unified rate to 83—84 piastres

and raised interest rates from 7.5% to 10%. The increasing return differential

also induced further currency diversification. Private holdings of foreign

currency are hard to measure because of widespread hoarding of foreign bank

notes, and substantial private foreign currency deposits in business and

investment banks, and offshore banks.24 Nevertheless, the currency ratio

(private foreign currency deposits in commercial banks over domestic money

supply) reached 15% at the end of 1979 and has continued to increase since

then (Appendix Table 2).25

       Behind this accumulation of foreign currency balances is a substantial

change in the pattern of financing of a current account deficit around $1.5

million (Appendix Table 3). There has been a rise in the "autonomous"

component of the capital account (which includes direct investment, suppliers

credits and other private non—monetary operations as well as long term aid)

from about $1.3 billion in 1977 to about $2.5 billion in 1980, the increase

in direct investment in 1979, accounted for by foreign oil companies and by

Law 43 firms, being particularly noteworthy. This has more than matched

the decline in special balance of payments financing loans and grants to the

Government from $1.6 billion in 1977 to zero in 1979 and 1980, which was

largely due to non—economic considerations. The balance on non—monetary

transactions has therefore been in surplus and the net foreign asset position

of the monetary institutions has accordingly improved. In 1980 central bank

reserves increased almost $1 billion, while foreign assets held by commercial

banks declined by one third of this amount. In fact, from 1974 to 1976 and

again   in 1980 commercial banks were borrowing abroad hi1e on net they were
repaying loans and placing funds in external financial markets between 1977
and 1979. At the same time, there has been a growing "unallocated" capital

outflow: less than half of the commercial banks' outflow in 1977, it more

than offset commercial bank borrowing in 1980, so that, even after accounting

for errors and omissions, due to current account transactions, a sizeable

private (non—bank) accumulation of foreign assets remains.

     Against this background, the stylized facts of the "Egyptian disease"

are apparent from Chart 4: on the left panel we plot the shocks——the

increase in pound oil revenues and the return differential, on the right

panel we plot the responses——real appreciation and currency diversification.

Deviations from purchasing power parity were already discussed in connection

with Charts 1 and 2.   Now Chart 4 suggests that defining money correctly will

substantially reduce the rate growth of the money stock. Indeed conventional

monetary equilibrium would obtain in 1980, rather than the 12% increase in

excess money creation reported in Chart 1. The results from the model in

the previous section——gathered for convenience in Table 1——provide a ration-

alization for the stylized facts in Chart 4 that are missed by the conventional

explanation, even after the corrections suggested. It is clear from the

table that the return differential in favor of the foreign currency increases

the currency ratio but causes real depreciation while the increase in the

domestic currency price of the official traded good causes real appreciaton

but has no steady—state effect on the currency ratio: it is the coincidence

of the two shocks that explains the two responses of Chart 4.   It was shown

above, however, that a crawling peg would succeed in lowering the currency

ratio, while an official revaluation could temporarily offset increases in

P. In short, allowing manufactured exports at a rate closer to the gray

market seems to be the only way to preserve export competitiveness, fight

inflation and prevent a continued increase in the currency ratio.


Conclusion

      The present stance of the government to try and eliminate currency

diversification by a new unification——or at least by a once—and—for—all

devaluation——is obviously misguided. The financial openness that Egypt has

achieved makes it impossible for the government to control the stock of

foreign assets of the private sector. The existence of a black market

premium naturally follows from the reluctance to raise interest rates. If

the crawling peg is implemented——possibly after a once—and—for—all revaluation——

it may stabilize the black market rate somewhat, but it is the earlier

practice of allowing exports at the black market rate, rather than the

ensuing unification, that should be followed.

     Even though these conclusions would need to be checked by a model

with real capital formation, the major point can be restated: invisible

receipts in an oil exporting country are likely to be diverted from the
                                    —29—



official exchange market so that, in order to avoid full interest libera—
lization and real appreciation, official exchange rate policy has to reduce
the incentives to hold foreign assets. Since an official once—and—for—all

devaluation does not alter these incentives, a crawling peg policy suggests

itself.

       for low interest rate elasticities, Krugman (1980b) has shown that (com-

      The index in chart 4 is therefore obtained by multiplying lines 9 and 5

      ence in 1978, but the share would increase to 28% in 1979.

24. Decisions regarding the currency denomination of financial wealth are not

      restricted to the differential between Egyptian pound and Eurodollar rates.

      Changes in otl:r Eurocurrency rates and in the expected exchange rates

      between major currencies will indeed be more important if the wealth—holder's

      consumption basket includes only a small share of goods produced in Egypt.

25. Monetary statistics in Egypt are notoriously defective. To begin with,

      they exclude business and investment banks as well as offshore banks (which

only deal in foreign currency) ,and even for commercial banks (which include
four belonging in the Government's foreign exchange budget and a number of
joint venture banks) foreign currency deposits have only been available since
the exchange rate unification. In terms of domestic currency assets and ha--
bilities, the statistics generally include public sector companies on the
grounds   that they behave like private companies (and may now have private

equity    participation). However, it has been   argued   that their deposits
should be excluded from the money suppay in order to calculate a more mean-
ingful public sector borrowing requirement; this approach is followed in
Appendix Table 1. See the discussion in McKenzie (1979) and Bhattacharva
et al (1980).
