  THE EFFECTS OF INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION ON COLLECTIVE BARGAINING OUTCOMES:
                  A COMPARISON OF THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA


                                     ABSTRACT


      We study the effects of import and export competition on collectively
bargained wage settlements and bargaining unit employment from the sixties to
 the mid-eighties for the United States and Canada. Both value-based and price-
based measures of international competition are considered. We distinguish
between the expected effects of increased international trade on new collective
bargaining agreements and the realized effects over the life of existing
agreements. Using value-based trade measures, the estimated effect of an
 increase in import domestic market share, holding constant the rate of growth
of the domestic market, is negative for employment in both countries and
exceeds the effect of a comparable change in the size of the domestic market.
The import effect on wage rates is also negative for the United States but not
for Canada. The import wage effect in the U.S. is also larger than the effect
of a comparable change in the domestic market size. The estimated effect of
increased export growth is positive for employment in both countries. The
export effect on employment is comparable in magnitude to the effect of a
change in the size of the domestic market. The export effect on wage rates is
mixed-weakly positive for the U.S. and ambiguous for Canada. For Canada, we
also estimate world price effects.    Increases in the world import price index
for the industry are associated with increased union employment. Increases in
the world import price index for the industry are associated with increased
union employment and lower wage settlements.

      The decade of the seventies heralded the latest era of product and labor

market globalization with renewed internationalization of the United States

economy.' Canada, which has long been a very open economy, also experienced

substantially increased internationalization during this decade.2 The two

countries have very substantial bilateral trading activity. Canada is the

largest single destination of U.S. exports and the second largest source of

U.S. imports (after Japan). In the seventies Canada was the largest

destination and origin of U.S. traded goods.3

      The growing importance of internationally traded goods in the United

States economy and the continuing importance of such goods in the Canadian

economy are displayed in Figure 1. The figure shows exports plus imports as a

percent of Gross National Product in 1960, 1970 and 1980 for both countries.

That the Canadian economy is three or four times more open than the U.S.

economy is directly evident from examining Figure 1.' The figure also

indicates that the Canadian economy experienced very significant increases in

its openness over this time period—imports plus exports grew from less than

forty percent of GNP to almost sixty percent. In the United States imports

plus exports grew from about seven percent of CNP to over twenty percent

during this period. The sixties and seventies, therefore, represents a period

of increasing international economic activity for both the U.S. and Canadian

economies. Both countries experienced changes in economic openness during

this period large enough to have detectable effects on the domestic labor

market.

      For the last two decades the highly unionized Canadian manufacturing

sector5 and the less unionized United States manufacturing sector have become

more integrated into both the North American and world markets. The share of

imported manufactured goods in apparent Canadian consumption has increased



                                      1
from 22 percent to 31 percent over this period. Similarly, exports as a share

of Canadian manufacturing production have more than doubled. Much of the

increased integration of the North American economy occurred in the

transportation equipment industry, which is covered by a 1965 bilateral

agreement between the U.S. and Canada that eliminates most tariffs in both

directions. Canadian transportation equipment imports rose from 28 percent of

apparent domestic consumption in 1960 to 51 percent in 1968 to 65 percent in

1983. Canadian transportation equipment exports also rose, from 14 percent of

domestic production in 1960 to 48 percent in 1968 to 67 percent in 1983. In

the United States transportation equipment imports increased from two percent

of apparent domestic consumption in 1960 to 18 percent in 1983 while exports

increased from six percent of domestic production to 14 percent in 1983. The

increased bilateral trade in many other U.S. and Canadian industries, although

not as substantial as the increased trade in transportation equipment.

supports our premise of increased integration of the North American economy.

       In Canada the   effect of international competition on unionized domestic
workers is regarded as a macroeconomic question susceptible to analysis using
the   tools of open economy international trade theory.6 In the United States,

the effect is generally regarded as a microeconomic question susceptible to

analysis on an "impacted industry" basis.7 This paper is an attempt to blend

these two views.    Like the Canadians, we will estimate equations for the
average effect of international competition on unionized wages and
employments.' Like other U.S. researchers, we will model the microeconomic
basis for the trade effects.9
       Our study   addresses the relations among international product market
competition and    the outcomes of domestic collective bargains. We have three

specific   goals. First, we quantify the effects of import and export


                                         2
competition on the wages and employment of unionized domestic workers using

comparable data for the U.S. and Canada. Second, we compare the magnitude of

the estimated effects to a reference value—the effects of a comparable change

in domestic shipments—to determine if the trade effects are relatively large.

Finally, for Canada we compare the estimated effects of value-based measures

of import and export activity to the estimated effects of price-based

measures, which may be more appropriate from a theoretical viewpoint.

      Using value-based trade measures, the estimated effect of an increase in

import domestic market share, holding constant the rate of growth of the

domestic market, is negative for employment in both countries and exceeds the

effect of a comparable change in the size of domestic shipments. The import

effect on realized real union wage rates is also negative for the United

States but not for Canada. The import effect on real wage rates in the U.S.

is also larger than the effect of a comparable change in the domestic market

size. The estimated effect of increased export growth is positive for

bargaining   unit employment in both countries. The export effect on employment
is comparable in magnitude to the effect of a change in the size of the
domestic   market. The export effect on real wage rates is mixed—weakly

positive for the U.S. and ambiguous for Canada. Increases in world export

price indices are associated with increased union employment in Canada.

Increases in world import price indices are associated with increased union

employment and lower wage settlements in Canada. All of the estimated world

price effects on the Canadian unionized labor market are consistent with the

estimated effects of based upon value-based export and import measures for

that economy.




                                       3
 The Role of International Competition     in   Collective Bargaining

       International   competition may   influence domestic collective bargaining

 in two ways. First, to the extent that foreign manufactured products are good

substitutes for domestically manufactured products, domestic firms must

compete for global market share. Within the domestic product market, import

competition reduces the effective extent of union organization in an industry

and may reduce the quasi-rents available to existing bargaining units. Within

foreign product markets, exports work in the opposite direction to increase

the effective extent of union organization in an industry and possibly to

increase the quasi-rents available to domestic bargaining units. Second, as

substitute foreign manufactured products gain market share within the domestic

product market, complementary services—wholesale distribution, retail

distribution, and repair—also gain market share. The expansion of service

employment opportunities may create quasi-rents that could promote the

formation of new bargaining units in these industries. This paper deals only

with the direct competition effects of imports and exports on unionized

workers in domestic labor markets. We do not consider the indirect effects of

service sector expansion.'°

      The major direct effects of international competition on unionized

workers occur because either the union wage rate falls (relative to what it

would otherwise have been) or there are employment displacements, which may be

associated with unusually long unemployment spells and/or wage reductions on

re-employment. We consider only direct wage costs and direct bargaining unit

employment   effects. We do not examine unemployment spell length or
re-employment wage rates. The major direct benefit to worldwide consumers is
lower average product prices in the markets where there is substantial
international competition. We do not measure this benefit to the consumer,


                                          4
 although this is certainly an essential component of any policy prescription

 arising from this research.

       A bargaining unit is an ongoing relationship between a union and a

 financially viable employer." The union represents the interests of the

organized employees. The management represents the interests of the

shareholders and other ultimate beneficial owners. For simplicity, the claims

of other factors of production are ignored. During the negotiations that

accompany the expiration of an existing collective bargaining agreement,

management and the union use current information to form an estimate of the

total value of the productive enterprise for which they represent competing

interests. A collective bargaining outcome consists of explicit and implicit

rules concerning the allocation of resources (employment) and the division of

the resulting quasi-rent between union members and shareholders (wage rates)

that is expected to remain in force for some fixed term.

      If international competition is expected to have an adverse effect on

the fin's future profitability,'2 then the current collective bargaining

agreement will reflect that expectation. If the expected effects of

international competition are too severe, the bargaining unit may disappear so

that the evidence on surviving bargaining unit settlements will not reflect a

complete   analysis of either employment or wage effects. If the international
competition is   expected to improve the firm's future profitability, current

bargaining   units should be favorably affected.
      In   this paper we measure the expected effects of increased foreign

competition on the future value of the firm using the relation between future

revenues (of organized employers) and current information on domestic

shipments, apparent domestic consumption, exports and imports in the

employer's product market. We consider two collective bargaining



                                        5
 outcomes—bargaining unit employment and wage settlements. Bargaining unit

employment is measured as the ex post growth rate of workers in the bargaining

unit over the life of the new the collective bargaining agreement, excluding

retirees and including members with recall rights.'3 Wage settlements are

measured as the realized growth rate of real wage rates over the life of the

agreement for the largest group of workers in the bargaining unit. We measure

the effects of predictable increases in international competition on

bargaining outcomes by relating employment growth and real wage growth during

a collective bargaining agreement to the growth of apparent domestic

consumption, exports, and imports expected to prevail during the life of the

agreement. We measure the effects of unpredicted changes in international

competition by relating the same outcomes to unexpected changes in domestic

consumption, exports, and imports over the life of the agreement.

        In an open economy union employment and wage rates within

internationally competitive industries should respond to changes in the world

market for manufactured goods. In general, we would expect these changes to

depend upon the world prices of traded goods. Although the importance of

using world prices in modeling the effects of international trade on domestic

labor markets has been recognized for some time,'4 most empirical analyses of

the United States use import penetration ratios and export supply ratios as

the   main indicators of changes in the international environment.   In this
paper we also consider the effects of changes in the world price of exports
and imports on union employment and wage rates using our Canadian sample. We
use Canadian data for two reasons. First, properly constructed price indices
exist for a much longer time period in Canada than in the U.S. Second, the
Canadian economy is substantially more open than the U.S. economy. Our
analysis thus permits examination of the consequences of using a variety of


                                        6
measures of international trade—value- and price-based—on the resulting

estimates of employment and wage sensitivity.

& Model for the Effects of International Trade on Union Wages and Employment

        We begin at the bargaining unit level. Consider the effects of

 increased international trade on the present value of the quasi-rents
                                                                               accruing
jointly to the employer firm and union members. The quasi-rents are measured

as the difference between net revenue16 and the cost of employment. The cost

of employment is evaluated at an external or market wage rate and not at the

negotiated wage rate. For firm j in year t let:

                     —       net   revenue of firm j In year t

                     —       union employment of firm j in year t
                     —       total employment of firm     j   in year t
              wit    —
                             negotiated     wage rate of firm j in year t

                     —       any   exogenous variable for firm j in year t
              r      —       one   year discount rate in year t
                     —       annual opportunity     cost of employment in year t
              q      —
                             length     of collective bargaining agreement.

If year t is the initial year of a new collective bargaining agreement, then

over the next q years the present value of the quasi-rents may be expressed

as:


                         q          —
                    —r
                      i—i          (1 +

Since   V measures the total quasi-rent available to the employer firm and
union, if increased import or export activity affects V, then wage

settlements and union employment will be affected by this activity.

Alternatively, if increased international trade has no effect on V, then

neither wage settlements nor union employment should be affected. The present



                                               7
value of the quasi-rents accruing to the bargaining unit captures the relevant

 total value of the enterprise, which may be divided among various claimants,

 including union members.'7 If the total value increases because of increased

export activity, then the potential exists for greater union employment or

wage settlements as a consequence of this export activity. Alternatively, if

increased import competition lowers N/fl, then there is a presumption that

lower employment and/or wage settlements should occur.

         To make these arguments concrete consider the effects of a change in

real industry shipments. Changes in real industry shipments due to external.

demand shocks should cause industry employment and total quasi-rents to move

in the same direction as industry shipments. If existing firms each represent

a constant fraction of industry output, then firm level employment and total

quasi-rents should also change in the same direction as the change in industry

output. The effect of a change in industry output on the negotiated wage rate

is less clear. An increase in industry output could be associated with an

increase or decrease in quasi-rents per worker. Since the negotiated

settlement divides the quasi-rents per worker between the firm and the union

members, an increase in quasi-rents per worker ought to be associated with

higher   wage settlements while a decrease in quasi-rents per worker ought to be
associated with lower wage settlements, all other things equal.
        These   predictions can be derived explicitly from a simple version of an

efficient bargaining relation between the employer firm and the union members.

Assume that the fin is fully unionized. Suppose the revenue that accrues to

the firm is given by the function:

           R(L) —    at   —



An   efficient bargain chooses L to maximize R(L) — xL and sets w to divide the
maximized quasi-rents in the proportion i to the union and     1 -   1   to the owners

                                          8
of the firm. The resulting values for total quasi-rents, employment, and the

negotiated wage rate are:


            V -
                   6[a;x]2
            L -
                   [a;x]
               -     +
                         iO{a_x]
In this simple model any increase in demand for the firm's product would be

modeled as an increase in a. As the equations for Vt L, and w show, increases

in a are associated with higher total quasi-rents, higher employment and

higher negotiated wage rates. Notice that the wage settlement awards each

union member the same percentage of the quasi-rents per worker (y)    as overall

negotiation determined. In the quadratic revenue model an increase in

quasi-rents is always associated with an increase in quasi-rents per worker so

that the negotiated wage rate must increase; however, general functional forms

for the revenue equation do not imply this particular result.

      Consider next the effects of a change in the world prices of imports and

exports on the output of a particular industry. Assume that the domestically

produced goods are Hicks-substitutes for the imported goods and that the

exported goods are identical to the domestically produced and consumed goods.

Then, an increase in the world price of industry imports results in

substitution away from the imported goods and into the domestically produced

goods within the industry. This should increase domestic output within the

industry. Hence, employment and total quasi-rents should increase for the

existing firms within the industry. Negotiated wage rates will increase or

decrease depending upon whether or not quasi-rents per worker increase or

decrease. An increase in the world price of exports results in expansion of




                                      9
domestic industry output along the industry supply curve. Hence, employment

and total quasi-rents should increase for the existing firms within the

industry. Again, the movement in negotiated wage rates will depend upon what

happens to quasi-rents per worlcer.t°

An Empirical Specification for Bargaining Unit Level Data

      In order to give our model empirical content, we must specify relations

connecting the exogenous economic factors (industry output, value-based trade

measures, import prices and export prices) to the total quasi-rent,

employment, and wage rate outcomes. We will not use comparable quasi-rent

data for the United States and Canada; hence, our empirical models will

consider only bargaining unit employment and wage rates. We deal with three

important practical problems in developing our estimating equations.

      First, since the model is developed for application to bargaining unit

data, the employer firms may have heterogenous shares of output within the

domestic industries and may face heterogeneous industry demand elasticities

with respect to import and export price changes. There are insufficient data

to attempt estimation of separate elasticities for each major industry.

Instead, we formulate the model to permit estimation of the

employment-weighted average elasticities across all domestic manufacturing

firms in    the sample for each country.
      Second, since nominal wage rates are renegotiated infrequently relative
to changes in the economic environment, we distinguish between the effects of
expected and unexpected changes in the exogenous variables. Expected changes
in the exogenous variables are movements forecast in advance of the current
negotiation.    The effect of expected changes is captured by including the
forecasted   value of the exogenous variable, conditional on information

available   at the time of contract renegotiation, among   the explanatory



                                           10
variables in the wage and employment equations. Unexpected changes in

exogenous variables are the difference between movements realized over the

life of the new agreement and the forecast of these movements formed during

the negotiation of the agreement. The effect of unexpected changes is

captured by including the forecast error among the explanatory variables.

         Third, since the important outcomes are not observed at frequent,

equally-spaced, synchronous intervals, we specify a set of relations that can

be estimated using observations on the relevant variables that are measured in

contract time. This allows us to estimate the models using vector

autoregressions linking the annualized rates of change in the dependent and

exogenous variables.

         In order to distinguish between the expected effects of economic factors

on collective bargaining outcomes and the realized effects of these changes

over the life of an existing agreement, we decompose exogenous economic

variables into expected and unexpected components. For any exogenous variable

Zit. we assume that the level follows a discrete martingale, so that:

                         I   Zjj —
for   any positive q. Then, write the logarithm of union employment, and wage

settlements as of the end of a contract that begins at date t and expires at

date t + q as:

              in             — E(in            in    L4, in Wit,      Zjt., Zit] +
              inwit,.,       —
                                 E[inw         in            in   Wit. Zit. Zit]   +

If the   conditional expectations are log-linear in the levels of the underlying

variables, then:

              in             —   fln + flju   in L4 + 0j13        in Wit   + fi   Zit
                             + J15 (Zit+q —    Zit)      +

where the average of the coefficients                          must be estimated and the error

vector         should be vector white noise. Our specification allows for firm

specific factors, summarized by the average elasticities in the log-level

equations. We difference this specification across collective bargains for

the same firm and correct for the differences in contract length. This

produces the following estimating equations:

          Equations (la) and (lb) form the basic statistical model used in our

analysis. The equations are a vector autoregression relating changes in union

employment and wage settlements over the life of the agreement running from t

to t +    q to lagged   changes in these variables, lagged changes in exogenous
variables    and the innovation in exogenous variables that occurs between t and
t+   q.    The last two   lines     of equations (la) and (ib),                   respectively,           show the
complete    error structure.        We   assume that           the   bargaining unit           specific error



                                                     12
in each elasticity (fir. —    Ps.) is   uncorrelated with all of the right hand side

variables in each equation. Furthermore, we assume that the heteroscedastic

error structure implied by equations (la) and (lb) can be adequately corrected

by a weighted least squares estimator in which the weight is the size of the

bargaining unit at time t. We do not require that the effects of expected

changes in exogenous variables and the effects of innovations in those

variables be identical.

        One of the key exogenous variables in the empirical analysis is industry

shipments. The rate of growth of real industry shipments can be decomposed

into a weighted combination of the rate of growth of real apparent domestic

consumption, the rate of growth of real exports, and the rate of change of the

import penetration ratio. This decomposition is given by:

(2)     A in       —   (S1—X1)    A in      +       A inX —             A IPRJ

where   S   is total real shipments for industry J    in   year t; X is real

exports; M3 is real imports; D4 is real apparent domestic consumption (D —           S

+ N —   X); IPRJ   is the import penetration ratio (IPR —    N/D);   and the discrete

differencing operation is defined in the notes to equations (1)." When the

separate components of this decomposition (multiplied by the indicated

weights) are used in the analysis instead of the rate of growth of real

industry shipments, the coefficients on the rate of growth of real apparent

domestic consumption and real exports should be the same and equal to the

coefficient on real shipments. The coefficient on the change in the import

penetration ratio should be equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to the

coefficients on apparent domestic consumption and      exports.      The equations

including   the value-based international trade measures are interpreted as
measuring   the effects   of increased export and import activity for a given
level   of apparent domestic consumption.

 Description of Data

          A detailed description of the methods used to form the bargaining

outcome, international trade and other exogenous variables is contained in the

Data Appendix and the references therein. Table 1 contains a summary           of   the

primary data sources for the United States and Canada.

         For the United States we used data from 2,515 collective bargaining

agreements representing 250 bargaining pairs in the manufacturing sector for

the years 1959 to 1984. The path of the realized nominal wage rate over the

life of the collective bargaining agreement and the level of employment at the

beginning of the agreement were extracted from the Major Collective Bargaining

Agreements file developed by Vroman (1982. 1984, 1986) based on Current Wage

Developments.

         For Canada we used data from 2,258 collective bargaining agreements in

Canadian manufacturing representing 299 bargaining pairs in the manufacturing

sector for the years from 1968 to 1983. The path of the realized real wage

rate over the life of the agreement and the level of employment at the

beginning and end of the contract period were taken from a version of the

Labour Canada wage tape based on the Collective Bargaining Review (see Card

1988).

         Table 2 contains a sunary   of   the basic definitions of the dependent

variables—bargainip.g    unit employment and real wage growth rates. Table 2
also contains smary definitions of the growth rates of real industry
shipments,    real apparent domestic consumption, and   real exports. Finally, the
table defines the change in the import penetration ratio.
         The timing of our measures of collective bargaining outcomes and
exogenous variables is based on the effective date of the current collective
bargain. To measure a realized change we must observe bargaining        unit



                                           14
employment, real wage rates, and all exogenous variables at two points in

time, Of necessity, there is some arbitrariness in the timing conventions

used. In selecting intervals over which to calculate the realized changes we

tried to use the available contract and exogenous information in a manner that

permitted distinguishing the estimated effects of changes that were known

prior to the settlement of the current contract and changes that occurred over

the life of the current contract.

         In order to understand the timing of the various measurements, Figure 2

shows a time line for an arbitrary three-year September contract effective in

year t. The relative dates of measurement for all variables and the value

labeled t, t-3, and t+3 are all shown on the figure. The figure illustrates

that the change in the real wage rate is taken between the last month of the

current contract (dated t+q) and the last month of the previous contract

(dated t).     Employment changes are measured between the effective month of the
next   contract (dated t+q) and the effective month of the current contract
(dated t). Monthly exogenous data (average hourly earnings) are measured as
of three months before the effective date of the current contract (dated t).
Annual   exogenous data are measured using     the year that overlaps with the

effective    date of the current contract (dated t).
       Table 3 presents comparative sary statistics for the United States

and Canada.     The period covered is longer for the United States. There are

more Canadian   bargaining units   but fewer Canadian   contracts.   U.S. bargaining

units are larger, reflecting both the prevalence of larger establishments and

the difference in the BLS   cutoff   for inclusion in Current Wage Developments

(1,000) versus the Labour Canada cutoff for inclusion in Collective Bargaining

Reviev (500).    Real wages grew faster in Canada but     employment fell faster in

the U.S. Although real exports and      import   penetration both increased faster



                                          15
in Canada, the time series variability of the U.S. and Canadian international

trade statistics swamps the difference in averages.

Results   of   Value and Price Analyses

         Table 4 reports the estimated effects of value-based international trade

measures on the bargaining unit employment growth rate in the U.S. and Canada.

The estimated effect of the expected change in the log of real shipments on

employment growth is much larger for Canada than for the United States

indicating that the basic employment equation is more output sensitive in

Canada. For both the United States and Canada the effect of an expected

change in real exports is comparable in magnitude and direction to the same

size change in shipments. Employment growth is not affected by the

destination of domestic production. The estimated effect of import

penetration on employment growth is negative, which is the expected direction

from equation (2); however, the magnitude is   greater than the magnitude   of   the
effect   of a change in real shipments. Employment growth is slowed more

severely by import penetration than a comparable change in shipments.

        The pattern of the estimated effects of unexpected changes in shipments

and   its components on employment growth is comparable to the effects of
expected changes in these variables. In the United States,    employment growth
is   somewhat sore sensitive to unexpected changes in exports than to unexpected
changes in shipments. Employment growth in the U.S. is substantially more
sensitive to unexpected changes in import penetration than to unexpected
changes in shipments generally. Employment growth in Canada responds with
about the same sensitivity to unexpected changes in real shipments, real
exports, and import penetration.
       Table 5. reports the estimated effects of value-based international trade
measuree on bargaining unit real wage rate growth in the U.S. and Canada. The


                                          16
 estimated effect of the expected change in the log of real shipments on

 employment growth is positive for the United States but negative for Canada.

 The finding implies that quasi-rents per worker move in opposite directions

 when expected output growth increases in the manufacturing establishments of

 the two countries. For the United States the effect of an expected change in

 real exports is comparable in magnitude and direction to the same size change

 in shipments. For Canada the direction of the export effect is consistent

with the shipments effect but the magnitude is larger. For the U.S. the

estimated effect of an expected change in import penetration on real wage

growth is negative and very substantially larger in magnitude than the

comparable change in real shipments.2° For Canada the estimated effect of

import penetration on real wages has sign and magnitude consistent with the

real shipments effect. Increased import competition in Canada is associated

with increased, not decreased, real wage rates.

      The pattern of the estimated effects of unexpected changes in shipments

and its components on real wage growth is not generally comparable to the

estimated effects of the expected changes. In the United States, real wage

growth is less sensitive to unexpected changes in real industry shipments

although the effect is still positive. In Canada, the estimated effect of

unexpected changes in real industry shipments on real wage rates is positive.

The finding implies that for both the U.S. and Canada quasi-rents per worker

increase when there is an unexpected increase in output. The size and

magnitude of the estimated effect of unexpected changes in real exports are

comparable to the estimated effects of expected changes in exports for the

U.S. For Canada unexpected increases in real exports are associated with

higher real wage rates, which is consistent with the sign and magnitude of the

unexpected change in real shipments. For both countries unexpected increases



                                      17
 in real imports are associated with decreased real wage growth. The magnitude

 of this effect in the U.S. is substantially larger than the effect of

 unexpected changes in shipments.

      Table 6 reports the estimated effects of changes in world prices on

collective bargaining outcomes in Canada.21 The estimated effect of increases

 in the expected world import and export prices is to increase bargaining unit

employment. The same is true of the estimated effect of unexpected increases

in the world prices on employment growth. All four of these results are

consistent with Canada's position as a (relatively) small open economy.

Increases in the world prices of Canadian exports stimulate Canada     production,
which increases employment. Increases in the world prices of Canadian imports

also stimulate Canadian production (presumably in response to substitution in

consumption away from the imported goods).

      The estimated effect of world prices (both imports and exports) on real

wage rates is negative. For the expected changes in world prices, these

estimated effects are consistent with the negative effect of real shipments on

real wage rates; however, for the unexpected changed in world prices, the

negative estimated effect on wage rates is the opposite of the estimated

effect of unexpected changes in real shipments.

Conclusions

      We have estimated very comparable bargaining unit   level   models for the

effects   of international competition on union employment and wages in the
United States and Canada. In the U.S. and Canada union employment increases
when exports increase by about the same amount as one would predict from the
estimated effect of industry shipments on union employment. On the other
hand, union employment declines in response to an increase in import
competition by substantially more than one would predict from the estimated


                                       18
industry shipment effect and the identity connecting shipments, domestic

consumption, imports and exports. The result suggests that import competition

has large employment effects in unionized establishments—larger than the

effects one would predict by mechanically assuming all imports replace

domestic production dollar for dollar.

      In the United States real union wage rates are equally sensitive to

increased shipments or exports; however, real union wage rates fall more in

response to an increase in import penetration than one would predict from the

knowledge of the shipment effect on real union wage rates! In Canada, real

wage rates move in the opposite direction in response to expected and

unexpected changes in shipments, exports and imports. The estimated export

and import effects on real wage rates in Canada are consistent with the

shipments finding. The effects of exports on Canadian real wage rates are

larger than the effects of imports. The pattern and relative magnitude of the

estimated price effects for Canada is very consistent with the estimated

value -based effects.

      The major similarity between the U.S. and Canadian experience, as

summarized by the statistical evidence presented here, is in the employment

effects of import competition. For bargaining units in both countries,

increased import penetration is associated with very large employment effects.

The major dissimilarity between the U.S. and Canada can be found in the

effects of expected changes in international competition on real wage rates.

For the U.S. increase import competition is associated with relatively large

decreases in real wage rates but increased export activity is associated with

real wage changes of modest magnitude. For Canada, the import competition

effects on real wage rates are modest but the export effects are relatively

large and in the opposite direction of the estimated effects for the U.S.



                                      19
        Although we have not provided all the pieces required to analyze whether

the consumers benefit enough from the increased trade to offset the effects of

that trade on the domestic labor market, it is clear from all of our analyses

that the union employment effects of increased import penetration are

substantial. The finding certainly explains the widespread protectionist

sentiment within union leadership. Furthermore, for the U.S. at least import

competition does appear to have created competitive pressures that resulted in

lower union real wage rates. In Canada, the openness of the economy makes the

domestic labor market susceptible to changes in the world prices of many

manufactured goods.

        The estimated responses of Canadian bargaining units to world price

changes are predictable from the small open economy international trade model.

Furthermore, the Canadian results using the value-based and price-based

international trade measures are essentially the same. This suggests that

although working with price data is theoretically preferable, the biases

associated with the value-based measures may not be severe. Civen the

similarity of the estimated U.S. and Canadian employment responses to changes

in   the value-based international trade measures, bargaining units in the
United States may now be operating in a more open economy than in previous
decades.

Exports and Imports as Related to Output.        For   the period from 1972 to 1981

the Bureau of Labor Statistics maintained a collection of times series called

the Trade Monitoring System that was designed to provide current information

on U.S. imports, the ratio of imports to domestic shipmànts plus imports,

exports, and the ratio of exports to domestic shipments on a detailed industry

basis. See Schoepfle (1982) for a report on the development and uses of these

data. His appendix contains numerous details of the calculations. See

Bennett (1982, available on request from the Department of Labor) for details

of the data base construction. We used the NBER Trade and Immigration Data

Files (Abowd, this volume) for the period from 1958 to 1971 and 1982 onward.

        Industry output was measured at the four digit SIC level using the value

Contract Data

        Bargaining unit wage rate and employment information were taken from the

data file on 250 major bargaining situations developed by Wayne Vroman from

the Bureau of Labor Statistics Current Wage Developments (CWD) printed

reports. The realized nominal wage increase over the life of the contract,

stated as an annualized percentage rate, was calculated from the periodic wage

change reports in CWD and Vroman's imputation of the average scale wage at the

beginning of the contract. See Vroman (1982, 1984 and 1986) for a discussion

of the methods. The basic situation number list from the Bureau of Labor

Statistics was linked to four digit establishment SIC's for the bargaining

unit, available from the BLS as unpublished data. The SIC-based trade data

was linked using to the contract file using the S establishment SIC. See

Vroman and Abowd (1988) for a discussion of the link to international trade

data.

        The wage rate reports in the CWD summarize scheduled fixed increases and

realized cost of living adjustments as they occur. The bargaining unit size

and average bargaining unit wage rate are reported (by the employer) at the

time a new contract settlement was recorded in the basic (confidential)

Current   Wage Developments data file, which is used to prepare the suimnary
information     on new collective agreements published quarterly.           The printed CVI)

reports   the   bargaining   unit   size   but not the average wage rate.
Canadian Data
Import and    ExDort   Prices and Values by      Industry

        The Laspeyres   price indices and the trade value measures were derived

using CMSIM data supplemented for 1967 and prior years from the Bank of

Canada Review. The system of classification closest to standard industrial

:lassifications (SIC), which is used by Labour Canada to classify the



                                                22
 bargaining units, is the System of National Accounts (SNA) classification used

 to construct the Canadian Input-Output tables. International trade price and

 value data are available using the SNA classification; however, all source and

 destination countries are aggregated. Since we wanted to eliminate trade with

 the United States from the world price measures, we used the price and value

 measures available on CANSIM under the import commodity classification
                                                                             (MCC)

 and the export commodity classification (XCC), which are disaggregated by

major countries. Unlike the SIC, the MCC and XCC classifications are
                                                                            systems
of classification for products and not for industries.       Using the Canadian

Input-Output tables to provide the connection between products and industries,

we developed a concordance between two-digit SIC industries and the

international, trade measures obtained from the MCC and XCC.

         Data on imports and exports for industrial sectors where the

international trade flows are not very substantial are very aggregated.       Only
an aggregated measure of import (and export) prices and values was available

for knitting industries, clothing industries, furniture and fixtures,

publishing and printing and miscellaneous industries. For exports, only an

aggregated measure was available for leather industries, fabricated metal and

non-metallic mineral products. Data for only seven and five aggregated

sectors were available for imports and exports before 1968 (in the Bank of

Canada    Review).
      The    import price index is a combination of transaction prices and unit
values. The short description given in CANSIM is "The Laspeyres price indexes
are based on fixed weights derived from      shipments 1971 quantities and hence

reflect   changes in prices alone. Most of the non-end product indexes are
based on average prices derived from commodity import value and quantity data,
The end product indexes are based on wholesale price indexes from Canadian,

see the September 1976 supplement to the summary of external trade catalogue

65-001." (CANSIM 1984, matrix 003681). The technical documentation may be

found in Statistics Canada 1976.

        The series description for the export prices is "The Laspeyres price

indexes are based on fixed weights derived from shipments 1971 quantities and

hence reflect changes in prices alone. Most of the non-end product indexes

are based on average prices derived from commodity export value and quantity

data. The end product indexes are based on Canadian industry selling price

indexes as proxies for export prices. For further information see September

1984, Statistics Canada       1976).
        Value   of imports and exports by country of origin/destination is
collected     as a part of the System of National Accounts. Combining data from

all sources produced the price and value measures for imports and exports for

the period from 1961 to 1984.

Input and 0utut Prices and Ouantities by Industry

        Data on output and input price and values by industry were obtained from

two   publications of Statistics Canada: Real. Domestic      Product per Sector   61-71
and   Gross   Domestic Output per   Industry   (1978 and 1984 issues).

       Basic monthly, quarterly, and annual time series data were extracted

from the CANSIX    University   Data Base from 1961 to 1984 and from the Bank of

                                           24
Contract data

      We used 2,258 collective bargaining agreements for 299 bargaining pairs

in the manufacturing sector of Labour Canada's Wage Tape. The wage measure

used is a base wage rate. For a description of the data set and of how the

wage settlement variable was constructed, see Card (1988).

      The employment variable provided on the Wage Tape is actually a measure

of how many workers were covered by the collective bargaining agreement on the

day of the agreement. Inspection of the data suggested that the employment

data were substantially contaminated by measurement error. In an effort to

reduce those measurement problems, we systematically compared the employment

data from the Collective Bargaining Review to the numbers from the Wage Tape

for all pairs where the employment was changing by 10% or more in absolute

value between two agreements at some point of time. In cases of discrepancies

between the two numbers, the employment from the Collective Bargaining Review

was used. More information is available from the Collective Bargaining Review

about the structure of the bargaining pair (for example, which plants and

which union locals are involved).

      Two levels of correction were performed. The first level consisted of

using the number of employees from the Collective Bargaining Review when the

only identifiable source of discrepancies between the two data sources was

reporting error. Employment data for 175 contracts was corrected on this

criterion. Employment from 28 contracts was discarded because of major

changes in the definition of the bargaining pair.

      Second, when the information from the Collective Bargaining Review

indicated that the structure of the bargaining pair changed over time, the

following rule was applied: if enough information was available from the

Collective Bargaining Review   to   construct a consistent series for a specific



                                          25
pair, such information was used. Otherwise, the changes in employment that

could have been explained by changes in the structure of the bargaining pair,

e.g. one local drops off, were eliminated. Employment   data   for 131. contracts

were adjusted and employment data for 176 contracts were discarded due to this

correction.

 1. See Abowd and Freeman (this volume) for an overview of the changes in the
United States.


 2. See Riddell (1986b) for a recent discussion of Canadian labor market
 responses to increasing global competition.


3.  In 1986 Canada accounted for $45 billion of $217 billion total U.S.
exports and $68 billion of $370 billion total imports. [n 1975 Canada
accounted for $22 billion of $108 billion total U.S. exports and $22 billion
of $97 billion total U.S. imports. (Statistical Abstract of the U.S. 1988,
page 770.)


4. The openness measure (imports + exports)/CNP is used by Abowd and Freeman
(this volume) to characterize the growing internationalization of the U.S.
labor market.


5.  Seventy-five percent of non-office employees in manufacturing industries
were covered by collective bargaining agreements in 1984 (Kumar, 1986).


6. See Cousineau (1987) and Riddell (l986a, 1986b, 1986c).


7. See, in particular, Hufbauer et p1. (1986). Other examples in the same
style as the current research include Heywood (1985) Kahn (1986).


8. See, for example, Riddell (1979) and Christofides (1980a, 1980b). These
relations are sometimes called "micro Phillips curves" (Hamermesh 1970).


9. See Farber (1986) for a review of these models.


10. See Leonard and McCulloch (this volume).


11.    When unions and employers   engage in industry-wide bargaining we assume
that  the multiple employer bargaining unit consists entirely of employers with
positive expected quasi-rents. When an employer has negative or zero expected
quasi-rents, we assume that the firm withdraws from the industry-wide
bargaining unit.


12.  Profitability is measured using quasi-rents. It includes the portion of
the return on the enterprise that goes to the unionized workforce. See Abowd
(1989).

  13. It is difficult to state precisely the
                                              definition of number of workers
  the bargaining unit. The reason for this is the absence of standards within in
  the Department of Labor Office of Wages and
                                              Industrial Relations for
 determining the Mnhimber of workers covered by a particular
                                                               collective
 bargaining agreement. The definition in the text is the usual interpretation
 of    this number. Itincludes all current employees and those
 who are on layoff but who could return to work before          former employees
 vote on the contract settlement.                       they lose the right to

 16. Net revenue is the difference between net sales
                                                      (gross sales less the
 value of discounts and other promotions) and the cost of all inputs except
 labor.



 17. See Abowd (1989) for a more complete development of this argument.


 18.   The world price of Canadian exports stated in terms of the Canadian
dollar is equal to the product of the world price stated in terms of a basket
of foreign currencies and the exchange rate between those currencies and the
Canadian dollar. The Canadian
                                dollar world price can increase either because
the world price stated in terms of the trading partner currencies increases at
a given exchange rate or because the Canadian dollar depreciates relative to
the trading partner currencies at a given trading partner
                                                           price. In this
paper we do not distinguish between these sources of price change, although we
intend to do so in future work.


19. See Freeman and Katz (this volume) for U.S. results
                                                        using this
decomposition.


20. This finding should be contrasted with the finding in Woman and Abowd
(1988) that nominal wage growth was only weakly affected by import penetration
in the same   data.

21.  The world price effects shown in Table 6 were estimated using price
indices that exclude trade with the U.S. The sign and magnitude of the
                                                                         price
effects are generally not affected by using a world price index that includes
trade with the U.S.; however, the estimates in Table 6 are more precise.


22. The finding is consistent with the Freeman and Katz (this volume) result
that the estimated effects of import penetration on
                                                     average wage rates in the
industry is largest for heavily unionized industries in the United States.
