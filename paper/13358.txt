Prescription Drug Coverage and Elderly Medicare Spending

                                              ABSTRACT

The introduction of Medicare Part D has generated interest in the cost of providing drug coverage
to the elderly. Of paramount importance -- often unaccounted for in budget estimates -- are the salutary
effects that increased prescription drug use might have on other Medicare spending. This paper uses
longitudinal data from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) to estimate how prescription
drug benefits affect Medicare spending. We compare spending and service use for Medigap enrollees
with and without drug coverage. Because of concerns about selection, we use variation in supply-side
regulations of the individual insurance market -- including guaranteed issue and community rating
-- as instruments for prescription drug coverage. We employ a discrete factor model to control for
individual-level heterogeneity that might induce bias in the effects of drug coverage. Medigap prescription
drug coverage increases drug spending by $170 or 22%, and reduces Medicare Part A spending by
$350 or 13% (in 2000 dollars). Medigap prescription drug coverage reduces Medicare Part B spending,
but the estimates are not statistically significant. Overall, a $1 increase in prescription drug spending
is associated with a $2.06 reduction in Medicare spending. Furthermore, the substitution effect decreases
as income rises, and thus provides support for the low-income assistance program of Medicare Part
D.

1      Introduction


       The primary objective of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and

Modernization Act (MMA) was to provide seniors with affordable coverage for their

prescription medications through the new Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit.

After the MMA was signed—but before Part D was implemented—there was a very

public controversy about the cost of the program. In March 2004, the Medicare Chief

Actuary testified before the House Ways and Means Committee that he was ordered by

the (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) CMS Administrator to suppress his

estimates of the 10-year cost of the program, which were substantially greater than

original Congressional Budget Office estimates.


       In fact, soaring costs have not materialized. According to the 2007 Medicare

Trustees report, the average 2007 plan bid was about 10 percent lower than in 2006.

These savings likely reflect a variety of factors, including vigorous plan competition,

increased generic use, and a general slowing of spending relative to earlier in the decade.

And there are even more reasons to be optimistic, since these estimates do not reflect the

increasingly important role prescription drugs play in improving health outcomes by

replacing surgery and other invasive treatments, and quickening recovery for patients

who receive these treatments. Official estimates of the costs of Part D do not take these

savings into account, in part because the magnitude and degree of such savings remain an

open question among the elderly and disabled population. While not designed to provide

estimates of the cost savings in Part D, this paper does provide insight into the potential

of Part D to improve the fiscal outlook for both Parts A and B.

        Medicare only partially covers medical services for seniors, and prescription

drugs were not covered before 2006.1 Supplemental Medicare was designed to fill this

gap. Beneficiaries can get prescription drug benefits from their former employers or

from Medicaid or other public programs, by enrolling in Medicare managed care2, or by

purchasing Medigap3. Although many beneficiaries had some source of drug coverage,

38% still had no coverage at all in 1999 (Laschober et al., 2002).


        Economic theory suggests that when a drug benefit lowers the price of

prescription drugs, it should increase the use of prescription drugs and complements of

prescription drugs and decrease the use of substitutes of prescription drugs. It is unclear,

however, whether prescription drugs and other medical services, including inpatient care

and outpatient care, are substitutes or complements. On the one hand, people with

prescription drug coverage may be more likely to have doctor visits to get the drugs they

need, and inpatient care and outpatient care are often combined with prescription drugs in

the treatment of many illnesses. In that sense, prescription drugs and other medical

services are complements. On the other hand, some diseases can be treated by either

prescription drugs or inpatient and outpatient care, and prescription drugs can improve

health outcomes, reduce illness, and, thus, reduce the demand for medical care. In that

sense, prescription drugs and other medical services are substitutes. Therefore, the

absence of prescription drug coverage and the presence of generous coverage on inpatient

and outpatient care would result in inefficient overall health care utilization: the

underuse of prescription drugs and the overuse of inpatient and outpatient care (Goldman

and Philipson, 2007). Furthermore, to the extent that these cross-price elasticities vary by

income, then overall efficiency could be improved by further subsidizing the poor.


       Few randomized studies have examined the effects of prescription drug benefits

or cost-sharing on prescription drug use and the use of other medical services. The

RAND Health Insurance Experiment (HIE) found the cost-sharing response to

prescription drugs (ε=-0.27) is similar to that for all ambulatory medical services

(Newhouse, 1993) in the non-elderly population. However, in the HIE, the pharmacy

benefits perfectly co-varied with other medical benefits (by design), whereas the real

question is how changes in pharmacy benefits, holding medical benefits constant, affect

spending. Several observational studies have tried to disentangle these effects using

quasi-experimental designs. Goldman et al (2007) recently reviewed 132 studies on the

effects of cost-sharing. The evidence clearly demonstrates that increased cost-sharing is

associated with lower pharmaceutical use. These effects can be quite large—even for

chronic medications—suggesting there will be long-term health consequences. However,

the direct evidence on the link between cost-sharing and health is rather limited. Most

studies examine important proxies for health (and medical spending) such as emergency

department use and hospitalizations. The findings from studies focusing solely on the

chronically-ill are unambiguous: for patients with congestive heart failure (Cole et al.,

2006), lipid disorders (Gibson et al., 2006 and Goldman et al., 2006), diabetes (Mahoney,

2005), and schizophrenia (Soumerai et al., 1994), greater use of inpatient and emergency

medical services are associated with higher copayments or cost-sharing for prescription




                                           -4-
drugs or benefit caps. These findings are corroborated by the one paper that looked at

clinical outcomes for a population with benefit caps (Hsu et al., 2006).


       By contrast, studies that look at the effects of cost-sharing more broadly (on all

drugs or a wide range of classes)—are ambiguous in their findings. Some find that

higher cost-sharing is associated with adverse outcomes (Lingle et al., 1987), particularly

among vulnerable populations such as the elderly and poor (Tamblyn et al., 2001 and

Soumerai et al., 1991). But most find that—when the population is not limited to certain

chronic illnesses—the effects of prescription drug cost containment policies are mostly

benign. For example, studies by Fairman et al. (2003), Motheral and Fairman (2001),

Johnson et al. (1997) and Smith and Kirking (1992) find that increased co-payments were

not associated with more outpatient visits, hospitalizations, or emergency department

visits. On the other hand, Gaynor et al. (2006) found that cost-sharing for prescription

drugs reduces both use of, and spending on, prescription drugs, increases spending on

outpatient care, and increases spending on inpatient care for those who are users of

impatient care.


       One of the reasons for the discrepancy in the findings is that any observational

study must account for the endogeneity of prescription drug coverage, and most do not do

an adequate job. Lillard et al. (1999) used an instrumental variable approach

(instrumental variables include employment history for employer-sponsored benefits,

measures of permanent income and wealth, the urbanicity of area of residence, lagged

health status and lagged measures of presence of private health insurance for Medigap

coverage) to estimate the effect of drug benefits on drug spending. Yang et al. (2004)

used a discrete factor model to control for unobserved individual heterogeneity and Khan


                                           -5-
et al. (2007) adopted an individual fixed-effects model. These two studies found that

prescription drug benefits either have no effects on non-drug medical spending or slightly

increase non-drug medical spending. None of these studies, however, fully distinguish

different sources of drug benefits. But even more importantly, none of these studies

controls for the generosity of the medical benefits in estimating the effects of prescription

drugs. Because health insurance with a drug benefit is more likely to have more generous

non-drug benefits, the cross-price effect is subject to underestimation when the generosity

of the medical benefits is not held constant.


           In this paper, we use the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) to

examine spending of Medicare beneficiaries with Medicare coverage and a Medigap

supplemental plan with or without a drug benefit. While the Medigap prescription drug

coverage may not be broadly representative, this study design has the appealing feature

that the medical benefits are completely known and are relatively homogeneous across

plan types. Thus, the quasi-experimental design is one in which medical benefits are held

constant, but drug coverage is allowed to vary. We use state reforms in the individual

health insurance market4 as instrumental variables and a discrete factor model to address

the endogeneity of Medigap drug coverage. Finally, we interact prescription drug

benefits with income to examine how the effects of drug coverage vary by income. We

find that a $1 increase in prescription drug spending is associated with a $2.06 reduction

in Medicare spending. Furthermore, the substitution effect decreases as income rises, and

thus provides support for the low-income assistance program of Medicare Part D.

2        Data


         The MCBS is a nationally representative sample of aged, disabled, and

institutionalized Medicare beneficiaries. The MCBS attempts to interview each

respondent 12 times over three years, regardless of whether he or she resides in the

community or a facility or transitions between community and facility settings. The

disabled (under 65 years of age) and oldest-old (85 years of age or older) are over-

sampled. The first round of interviewing was conducted in 1991. Originally, the survey

was a longitudinal sample with periodic supplements and indefinite periods of

participation. In 1994, the MCBS switched to a rotating panel design with limited

periods of participation. Each fall, a new panel is introduced, with a target sample size of

12,000 respondents, and each summer a panel is retired. Institutionalized respondents are

interviewed by proxy. The MCBS contains comprehensive self-reported information on

the health status, health care use and expenditures, health insurance coverage, and

socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the entire spectrum of Medicare

beneficiaries. We use data from the 1992-2000 MCBS in the analysis.


Measuring Spending


         Our primary dependent variables are Medicare Part A spending5, Medicare Part B

spending6, and prescription drug spending by Medicare beneficiaries. Medicare Part A

and Part B spending is based on Medicare claims data, linked to the MCBS. Medicare

5
  Medicare Part A covers care in hospitals as an inpatient, critical access hospitals (small facilities that give
limited outpatient and inpatient to people in rural areas), skilled nursing facilities, hospice care, and some
home health care.
6
  Medicare Part B covers doctor’s services, outpatient hospital care, and some other medical services that
Part A does not cover, such as the services of physical and occupational therapists, and some home health
care. Medicare Part B helps pay for these covered services and supplies when they are medically
necessary.

                                                      -7-
Part A and Part B spending in different years is adjusted using the Consumer Price Index

and reported in 2000 dollars. Prescription drug spending is based on respondent self-

reports and may be underreported. The CMS Office of the Actuary compared self-

reporting of expenses associated with physician office visits with Medicare claims

records and found underreporting of 33%. This result has led the Congressional Budget

Office (CBO) and others to assume drug expenditures are underreported by a similar

amount. However, because drugs are more salient (and regular) than physician office

visits, they are less likely to be underreported. Subsequent analyses by CMS staff

suggest drug expenses are probably underreported by 10–15%. This estimate is based on

examining records from people who were known to have accurate self-reported data—

that is, people who reported the same patterns of Part A and B utilization as indicated by

the claims records. Using this sub-sample, CMS developed an imputation scheme for

drug expenses. A comparison of imputed expenditures for the entire MCBS sample with

actual reported expenditures yielded the 10–15% estimate. As such, we assume that total

drug expenses are underreported by 15% in all our analyses (Goldman et al., 2002).


Measuring Insurance Coverage


       Medicare and Medicaid coverage is based on administrative records. In addition,

up to five plans are reported based on questions about plan type (private employer-

sponsored, Medigap, private unknown, private HMO or Medicare HMO), start and end

date, number of people covered, annual premium, prescription drug benefit, and nursing

home care. Because the exact benefit structure is unavailable, all insurance measures are

dummy variables.




                                           -8-
Measuring Health


       We focus on major disease conditions, functional status, and risk factors that are

known to be strongly associated with prescription drug and medical spending.

Conditions include diabetes, cancer (excluding skin cancer), heart disease (myocardial

infarction, heart attack, angina, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, or other

heart condition), hypertension, stroke, lung disease (emphysema, asthma, or chronic

obstructive pulmonary disease), Alzheimer’s disease, and osteoarthritis. Functional

status is typically measured by limitations in Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) and

Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs) in empirical studies. ADLs are defined

as any difficulty dressing, eating, bathing, getting in/out of chair, walking, and using

toilet or being bedridden. IADLs are defined as any difficulty using the phone, doing

light housework, doing heavy housework, making meals, shopping, or managing money.

Risk factor measures include current smoking and obesity (defined as BMI over 30).

Self-reported overall health is rated from 1 to 5 (1= excellent, 2=very good, 3=good,

4=fair, and 5=poor). Other variables included in our analysis are age, gender, race,

education, metropolitan area (urban), and income.

       We dropped beneficiaries from our data who were under 65, had partial or no

Medicare coverage, were in Medicare HMOs or Medicaid, resided in nursing home

facilities, were currently employed, or had multiple supplemental insurances. All the

remaining beneficiaries in our data had a Medigap plan with or without a prescription

drug benefit as their only supplemental insurance. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation

Act (OBRA) of 1990 requires that Medigap plans be standardized in as many as ten

different benefit packages offering varying levels of supplemental coverage. All policies



                                            -9-
sold since July 1992 (except in three exempted states: Massachusetts, Minnesota, and

Wisconsin)1 have conformed to one of these ten standardized benefit packages, known as

plans A to J. Plans H, I and J have prescription drug benefits. A high-deductible option

is also available for plans F and J. Policies sold prior to July 1992 are not required to

comply with these ten standard packages. Medigap plans with and without prescription

drug benefits, on average, have similar coverage for non-drug medical care (Table 1).


       Table 2 shows the descriptive statistics of the beneficiaries in our data by

Medigap plan type (with and without prescription drug benefits). Compared to those

with prescription drug benefits, Medicare beneficiaries without drug benefits tend to be

older, less educated, less likely to be in an urban area, and poorer. They are sicker in

term of both self-reported overall health and histories of chronic diseases, with

significantly higher prevalence of diabetes, cancer, and stroke. They have less

prescription drug spending but more Medicare Part A spending.


       The observed differences between those with prescription drug benefits and those

without prescription drug benefits seem to indicate potential self-selection, but the

direction is unclear. Richer and more educated beneficiaries are more likely to have

prescription drug coverage and tend to have higher prescription drug spending; the sicker

are less likely to have prescription drug coverage but they also tend to have higher

prescription drug spending. The literature provides strong evidence of the presence of

moral hazard in the Medigap market. The results on self-selection, however, are mixed.

Wolfe and Goddeeris (1991) estimated health care utilization for Medicare beneficiaries

and found that those with large past expenditures were more likely to hold private

supplemental insurance. Ettner (1997) found that respondents who purchase private


                                            - 10 -
supplemental insurance use more physician services and have higher Medicare

reimbursement, even after controlling for moral hazard. Hurd and McGarry (1997) found

there was little relationship between observed health measures and the propensity to hold

or purchase private insurance and argued that the differences in health care services

reflect moral hazard rather than adverse selection. There is little direct evidence, but the

literature seems to suggest adverse selection into prescription drug benefits (Pauly and

Zeng, 2006).


       The observed difference in health measures can also be the result of the

improvement in health because of increased prescription drug use for people who had

prescription drug benefits. If that is the case, the model with health measures as

covariates would underestimate the reduction in Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B

spending and overestimate the increase in prescription drug spending as a result of

prescription drug benefits.


3      Empirical Specification


       Medicare beneficiaries make their choice between Medigap plans with and

without prescription drug benefits by maximizing their indirect utility. The utility index

d* is a function of sociodemographic characteristics, health status, exogenous shocks on

Medigap market, and an individual unobserved component:


                                 d * = α 0 + α1 X + α 2 Z + ε1


We do not directly observe d*. Instead, we observe individuals with drug benefits when

d*>0 and without drug benefits when d*≤0.

                                                ⎩0 if d * ≤ 0


Here, X denotes individual sociodemographic characteristics and health status; Z denotes

exogenous shocks; and d is a dummy variable for prescription drug benefits.

Sociodemographic characteristics include age, gender, race (white or nonwhite), marital

status, college education or higher, urbanicity, and income. Health measures include

ever-smoked, obesity, general health index7, and chronic diseases, including cancer, heart

disease, hypertension, stroke, lung disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and osteoarthritis. We

also include Adjusted Average Per Capita Cost (AAPCC) by county to control for

regional difference in medical care costs. In addition, we include state and year fixed

effects in our model.


         The distribution of medical expenses has two characteristics (Duan, Manning,

Morris and Newhouse 1982). First, there are many zero expenses. Second, the

remaining positive expenses are highly skewed, but the positive expenses are

approximately log-normally distributed through most of their range. The econometric

and statistical literatures provide a number of models for dealing with this kind of data.

We adopt a typical two-part structure in modeling spending. The first part models the

probability of having positive spending and the second part uses a log-linear specification

to model spending conditional on positive spending. The any spending equation is:


                             p* = β 0 + β 1 X + β 2 d + β 3 d * Income + ε 2



7
 The construction of the health index is similar to Dor et al. (2003). The health index is a summary of self-
reported overall health (1–5), number of IADL (0–6) and number of ADL (0–6). All three components are
coded so that lower values indicate better health.

Log spending conditional on positive spending:


                    ln(Y | Y > 0) = γ 0 + γ 1 X + γ 2 d + γ 3 d * Income + ε 3


Here, Y denotes Medicare Part A spending, Medicare Part B spending, or prescription

drug spending. We also include a variable for whether people have nursing home

coverage to control for the generosity of their insurance coverage.


Identification


       We use state reforms in the individual health insurance market as instrumental

variables to address the endogeneity of prescription drug benefits. These state reforms

were aimed at reducing the number of uninsured and increasing the availability and

affordability of individual health insurance. These reforms include rate rating, pre-

existing condition restrictions, guaranteed issues, guaranteed renewal, reinsurance, and

minimum loss ratio and were mostly passed in the early to mid-1990s. Here, we focus on

the two most dramatic measures: guaranteed issue and rate rating:


       •   Guaranteed issue requires health plans to offer coverage to all individuals,

           regardless of their health status or claims experience.

       •   Rate rating includes rating bands, very tight rating bands, and community

           rating. Rating bands restrict health plans’ use of experience, health status, or

           duration of coverage in setting premium rates for individuals. Very tight

           rating bands allow very limited adjustment for experience, health status, and


                                              - 13 -
             duration. Community rating prohibits health plans’ use of experience, health

             status, or duration of coverage in setting premium rates for individual

             coverage. Some community rating laws also prohibit the use of demographic

             factors in setting premium rates for individual coverage.


        The impacts of these reforms are mixed. In states that adopted the most

comprehensive reforms ⎯guaranteed issue often combined with such other reforms as

guaranteed renewability, rate rating, and strict limits on exclusions for pre-existing

conditions ⎯insurance became more widely available, although comprehensive reforms

generally resulted in some carrier departures from individual health insurance markets

and less choice of insurance products (Swartz, 2000). That is, fewer policies were

available for people to purchase. Studies indicate that access to individual insurance

policies for people at high risk clearly increased in the comprehensive reforms states of

New Hampshire, New York, New Jersey, Vermont, and Washington.8 The research thus

provides some evidence that guaranteed issue of all policies assumes the availability of

policies to anyone regardless of risk factors, such as health status and prior use of health

services.


        Community rating generally resulted in higher premiums on average, lower

premiums for high-risk individuals, and higher premiums for low-risk enrollees (Swartz,

2000; Hall, 2000; and Kirk, 2000). States with more comprehensive reforms experienced

a decrease in overall coverage rates (Zuckerman and Rajan, 1999; Percy, 2000; Sloan and

Conover, 1998; and Marsteller et al., 1998). However, Buchmueller and DiNardo (2002),

                                                 - 14 -
looking at how coverage rates changed in a comprehensive reform state, New York,

compared to two states that did not enact such reforms, Pennsylvania and Connecticut,

found that New York’s community rating law was not responsible for changing the rate

of coverage but was responsible for changing the nature of individual insurance from

largely indemnity to HMO coverage.


       In New York, the risk pool changed ⎯ average number of claims per

policyholder and average age of policyholders increased (Hall, 2000). In New Jersey, the

evidence suggests a more complicated picture, one in which age of enrollees increased

but the health status of enrollees remained relatively good. Swartz and Garnick (2000)

compared self-reported health status, age, and other risk characteristics of enrollees in

individual policies compared with the state’s uninsured and employer-covered

populations after the New Jersey reforms were implemented. They found that enrollees

with individual coverage were more likely to be older than the uninsured but also more

likely to be healthier. Lo Sasso and Lurie (2003) analyzed data from the Bureau of

Census Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and concluded that

community rating reforms make healthy people less likely to be insured and unhealthy

people more likely to be insured by individual polices; as a result, the enrollees with

individual policies in community rating states were sicker.


       Although these reforms may not have achieved their goal of reducing the number

of uninsured and making health insurance more affordable, they nevertheless generate

some exogenous shocks to the individual health insurance markets from both the supply

side and the demand side. Past studies have exclusively focused on the effects of state

reforms on coverage rate, premiums, and change in risk pool and found that sicker


                                            - 15 -
individuals are more likely to purchase health insurance in states with reforms. The

empirical evidence is consistent with economic theory that sicker individuals would buy

more insurance with more risk pooling, and we speculate it would be also true that sicker

individuals are more likely to purchase health plans with more comprehensive coverage,

such as plans with prescription drug benefits. While federal regulations in the Medigap

market are very limited9, state reforms in the individual health insurance market further

limit health plans’ ability of risk adjustment ⎯ denying coverage and/or setting high

premiums for the sicker elderly. Elderly who did not get Medigap coverage can purchase

it later and can postpone the decision of purchasing a Medigap plan. Elderly also can

easily switch to another Medigap plan as they wish after the initial enrollment period.


         In this paper, we will explore the fact that state reforms reduced coverage rates

through both the demand side and supply side and that state reforms changed the risk

pool of enrollees. Guaranteed issue and rate rating are unlikely to operate independently

because, with guaranteed issue but not rate rating, health plans can simply charge

prohibitive premiums to drive risky individuals out of the market. Likewise, with rate

rating but not guaranteed issue, health plans can just refuse to offer a policy to potentially

risky individuals. In states with guaranteed issue requirements, some kind of rate rating

 Federal law provides Medicare beneficiaries with guaranteed access to Medigap policies offered in their
state of residence during an initial six-month enrollment period, which begins on the first day of the month
in which an individual is 65 or older and is enrolled in Medicare Part B. During this initial open-
enrollment period, an insurer cannot deny Medigap coverage for any plan types they sell to eligible
individuals, place conditions on the policies, or charge a higher price because of past or present health
problems. Additional federal Medigap protections include guaranteed issue rights, which provide
beneficiaries over age 65 with access to plans A, B, C, or F in certain circumstances, such as when their
employer terminates retiree health benefits or their Medicare + choice plan leaves the program or stops
serving their areas. Individuals must apply for a Medigap plan no later than 63 days after their prior health
coverage ends for these guarantees to apply. During the guaranteed-issue periods, no pre-existing
conditions exclusion period may be applied.

was also enacted. Therefore, there are three types of states in our analysis: states with

both guaranteed issue and rate rating; states with only rate rating; and states with neither.


       For state reforms to be valid instruments, two conditions have to be met. First,

they need to be a strong predictor of prescription drug coverage. Second, they need to be

independent of unobserved determinants of health care spending. The first condition is

testable, and we report the Wald statistics for joint significance of state regulations in

predicting individual prescription drug coverage. The second condition cannot be tested

directly. Although these reforms were primarily targeting the individual health insurance

market for people under age 65 to reduce the number of uninsured, it may be a proxy for

something else at the state level that is correlated with both state reforms and

determinants of individual health care spending. We include state and year fixed effects

in the model. Furthermore, if this is the case, then it should hold not only for Medigap

coverage, but also for employer-sponsored coverage.


       Table 3 shows the predictive power of state reforms on prescription drug benefits

for both Medigap and employer-sponsored coverage. States reforms strongly predict

prescription drug coverage for Medigap, but not for employer-sponsored coverage. So,

while state reforms, on average, reduce the amount of insurance purchased in the

Medigap market, they appear not to be approximating other state-level variables that also

affect employer-sponsored drug benefits.


       We further regress state reforms on lagged Medicare Part A spending, Medicare

Part B spending, and prescription drug spending to see if states with reforms have

different health care spending trends from states without reforms. Table 4 shows that



                                            - 17 -
past spending trends do not predict state reforms. It is also worth noting that the effects

of state reforms on prescription drug benefits in our analysis are identified across states

and over time because state reforms were enacted after 1992, the first period of our data.


Unobserved Individual Heterogeneity


        The error terms in the three equations discussed earlier are likely to be correlated

with each other, and we estimate them jointly to allow for this correlation. We adopt a

modified version of the model in Mroz (1999), Goldman, Leibowitz, and Buchanan

(1998), and Goldman et al. (2001) and assume all error terms have an unobservable

heterogeneity component η :


                                         ε 1 = η1 + υ1


                                        ε 2 = η2 + υ2


                                        ε 3 = η3 + υ3


We assume that υ1 , υ 2 υ 3 and η ' s are independent, that υ1 and υ 2 are standard normal

errors and that υ 3 has mean zero and variance σ 2 . Because the prescription drug benefit

equation and any spending equation are binary choice models, the variances are not

identified.


        Miss-specifying a continuous distribution for unobserved individual heterogeneity

would result in inconsistent parameter estimates. Discrete factor models have been

widely used in the study of the effects of endogenous dummy variables on a continuous

outcome with unobserved individual heterogeneity (Bhattacharya et al., 2003; Cutler,

                                            - 18 -
1995; Goldman, 1995; Goldman, Leibowitz and Buchanan, 1998). Mroz (1999) found

that when the true model has bivariate normal disturbances, estimators using discrete

factor approximations compare favorably to efficient estimators in terms of both

precision and bias; these approximation estimators dominate all the other estimators

examined when the disturbances are non-normal. A discrete factor model also

significantly simplifies the likelihood function and reduces the computational burden of

the estimation.


         We adopt a semi-parametric approach to model the correlation among error terms

and assume that η1 , η 2 and η 3 can each take one of three values ( η11 , η12 , η13 ),

( η 21 , η 22 , η 23 ), ( η 31 , η 32 , η 33 ) with probability p1 , p 2 and p3 =1- p1 - p 2 , respectively.

This implies that there are three types of people. Being each type has different effects on

drug coverage and health care utilization, ( η11 , η12 , η13 ) for drug coverage, ( η 21 , η 22 , η 23 )

for probability of any health care spending, and ( η 31 , η 32 , η 33 ) for health care spending

conditional on positive spending. For example, there is a p1 probability for someone to

be type 1, which would imply realization of η11 for drug coverage, η 21 for probability of

any spending, and η 31 for spending conditional on positive spending. Reasons for the

differences among three types of people can be contributed to unobserved health

characteristics, risk preference, discount rate, life-style preference, etc.

         Since all three equations have intercept terms, we normalize the mean of each

heterogeneity component to be zero10. This model allows non-zero covariance across

three error terms with the following variance-covariance structure:

Then, it is straightforward to write the likelihood function for individual i by integrating

over the distribution of the unobserved error components:


                 3
         li = ∑ p k {(Φ[α 0 + α 1 Z + α 2 X + η1k ]) d × (1 − Φ[α 0 + α 1 Z + α 2 X + η1k ]]1− d )
                k =1

         × (Φ[ β 0 + β 1 X + β 2 d + β 3 d * Income + η 2 k ]) (Y >0)
         × (1 − Φ[ β 0 + β 1 X + β 2 d + β 3 d * Income + η 2 k ])1−(Y >0 ) )
           1 ln Y − γ 0 − γ 1 X − γ 2 d − γ 3 d * Income − η 3k (Y >0)
         ×[ φ(                                                 )]      }
            σ                                 σ


And the log likelihood function is:


                                                      N
                                              ln L = ∑ wi ln(l i )
                                                     i =1




N is the sample size and wi is the individual weight. Robust standard errors are reported

for our coefficient estimates.

  For example, the third support in the prescription drug benefit equation can be written as a function of the
other two supports and probabilities of each support:
 E (η1 ) = 0
 ⇒ p1η11 + p2η12 + (1 − p1 − p2 )η13 = 0
 ⇒ η13 = −( p1η11 + p2η12 ) /(1 − p1 − p2 )

Simulation


        Because we adopt a two-part model structure for our spending equations, it is

difficult to interpret the magnitude of the parameter estimates directly. Furthermore, the

net effect is unclear when the coefficient on the first part of the two-part model has the

opposite sign from the coefficient on the second part. We simulate the average effects of

prescription drug benefits on prescription drug spending, on Medicare Part A spending,

and on Medicare Part B spending. The probability of having positive spending is

straightforward except we need to integrate over the discrete factor:


                Pˆ (Y > 0) = ∫ Pˆ (Y > 0 | η 2 )dF (η 2 )

                            = ∫ Φ( βˆ 0 + βˆ1 X + βˆ 2 d + βˆ 3 d * Income + η 2 )dF (η 2 )

                            = ∑ p j * Φ( βˆ 0 + βˆ1 X + βˆ 2 d + βˆ 3 d * Income + ηˆ 2, j )
                                j




We use the non-parametric smearing estimates (Duan et al., 1983) to retransform the

spending conditional on positive spending from log term to normal term.

This calculation is done by percentiles (1st, 5th, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th, 95th, 99th) of the

residuals to better account for heteroscedasticity, and the predicted values well re-

produce the mean spending.

4      Results


       Table 5 reports the results from simple two-part models, which adjust for

observed differences between elderly with drug benefits and elderly without drug

benefits. We then use state reforms in the individual insurance market as instrumental

variables to address potential self-selection and a discrete factor model to account for

unobserved individual heterogeneity. Results are shown in Tables 6-8 for prescription

drug spending, Medicare Part A spending, and Medicare Part B spending, respectively.

In our model, we include interactions between state reforms and health (age and health

index) to model changes in health status mix among Medigap enrollees in states with

reforms.


       In the insurance choice model, state regulations and its interactions with age

significantly predict prescription drug benefits with p-values around 0.0001. Guaranteed

issue and rate rating together increase the likelihood of prescription drug benefits for

younger elderly and reduce the likelihood of prescription drug benefits for older elderly

(Figure 1). The likely explanation is that when health plans are prohibited from using

health status and history of claims in their decisions about offering insurance and in

setting premium, age is the best available alternative to sort the elderly by their health

status. Rate rating alone reduces the likelihood of prescription drug benefits, but it does

not vary much with age, which is consistent with the view that, with rate rating but not

guaranteed issue, health plans simply deny offering insurance to sicker elderly, and,

                                              - 22 -
therefore, there is no need to use age as an indicator of health status. Interactions

between health and regulations seem to suggest that the less healthy are more likely to

have prescription drug benefits in states with regulations, but the effects are small.


       The effects of prescription drug benefits on the probability of having any

prescription drug spending increase with income, and the effects of prescription drug

benefits on prescription drug spending conditional on positive spending decrease with

income. Medicare beneficiaries with prescription drug benefits are less likely to have

positive drug spending (when income is less than $34,000), but incur more drug spending

conditional on positive spending (when income is less than $333,000). These two effects

are either too small or cancel each other out and the net effects of prescription drug

benefits on prescription drug spending do not appear to vary much with income (Figure

2), although prescription drug spending itself increases with income. The discrete factor

estimates do not indicate a clear direction of self-selection in terms of unobservables.


       The effects of prescription drug benefits on the probability of having any

Medicare Part A spending increase with income and the effects of prescription drug

benefits on Medicare Part A spending conditional on positive spending decrease with

income. Medicare beneficiaries with prescription drug benefits are less likely to have

positive Medicare Part A spending (when income is less than $80,600) and incur less

Medicare Part A spending conditional on positive spending. The net effects of

prescription drug benefits on Medicare Part A spending decrease with income (Figure 3).

The results imply that a $10,000 dollar increase in income is associated with $47

decrease in the substitution effect between prescription drugs and Medicare Part A. The

discrete factor estimates show that 70.3% of beneficiaries who are more likely to have


                                            - 23 -
prescription drug benefits, are more likely to have positive Medicare Part A spending,

and incur more Medicare Part A spending conditional on positive spending. 25.1% of

beneficiaries who are less likely to have prescription drug benefits, are less likely to have

positive Medicare Part A spending, and incur less Medicare Part A spending conditional

on positive spending. This indicates adverse selection into prescription drug benefit in

terms of unobservables in the sense that those with prescription drug benefits consume

more medical care covered by Medicare Part A than those without.


       The effects of prescription drug benefits on the probability of having any

Medicare Part B spending and on Medicare Part B spending conditional on positive

spending increase with income. Medicare beneficiaries with prescription drug benefits

are less likely to have positive Medicare Part B spending (when income is less than

$36,000) and incur less Medicare Part B spending conditional on positive spending

(when income is less than $66,000). The net effects of prescription drug benefits on

Medicare Part B spending decrease with income (Figure 4). The results imply that a

$10,000 dollar increase in income is associated with $35 decrease in the substitution

effect between prescription drugs and Medicare Part B. The coefficients on drug benefits

and its interactions with income are jointly insignificant. As in the drug spending model,

discrete factor estimates do not indicate clear direction of self-selection in terms of

unobservables.


       Table 9 shows the simulated effects of prescription drug benefits on prescription

drug spending, Medicare Part A spending, and Medicare Part B spending from the simple

two-part model and from the discrete factor model. The simple two-part model adjusts

for observables and the results show that prescription drug benefits increase drug


                                            - 24 -
spending by $157, reduces Medicare Part A spending by $135, and increases Medicare

Part B spending by $31.


       When both observables and unobservables are accounted for, prescription drug

benefits increase drug spending by $148 or 22%. After adjusting for the underreporting

of prescription drug spending in MCBS, our estimates suggest that prescription drug

benefits increase drug spending by $148*(1+15%) = $170; prescription drug benefits

decrease Medicare Part A spending by $350 or 13%; and prescription drug benefits

decrease Medicare Part B spending by $74 or 4% although the estimates are statistically

insignificant.


5      Discussion


       Among patients with Medigap insurance, those in worse health—both observed

and unobserved in the MCBS—self-select into prescription drug coverage. After

controlling for this selection, our results indicate that prescription drugs and medical

services covered by Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B are substitutes. Furthermore,

these substitution patterns are underestimated when one does not control for this adverse

selection. Each $1 increase in drug spending is associated with a steady-state $2.06

decrease in Medicare Part A spending and $0.44 decrease in Medicare Part B spending.

Thus, it appears that Medicare beneficiaries may have been overinsured with respect to

medical services, and underinsured with respect to prescription drugs. Medicare

beneficiaries without drug benefits had the incentive to substitute prescription drugs with

cheaper (to them, but not to Medicare) Medicare covered services (Medicare Part A and




                                            - 25 -
Part B). This suggests that Medicare Part D could potentially remove the incentive and

improve the overall efficiency of health care utilization among the elderly.


       We find that the substitution effect decreases with income; therefore, prescription

drug benefits would result in more cost savings among the poor. The simple explanation

is that prescription drug spending increases with income and the substitution effect

decreases with prescription drug use. The increase in prescription drug use from

prescription drug benefits for people with higher income is more likely to be from

increased use of non-essential drugs; therefore, it has less effect on health and inpatient

and outpatient care. Our results suggest that providing prescription drug benefits to the

poor would result in more cost savings and, thus, provide support for the low-income

assistance program of Medicare Part D.


       Prior studies on the Medicare population found that prescription drug benefits

either have no effect on Medicare Part A and Part B spending or increase Medicare Part

A and Part B spending. There are two potential problems with these studies. First, they

included beneficiaries with various types of drug coverage in their analysis and,

therefore, could not adequately address the self-selection into these different types of

drug coverage. For example, beneficiaries who have public drug coverage, mainly

Medicaid drug coverage, are less healthy, less educated, and poor, and beneficiaries who

have HMO drug coverage are relatively healthy.


       Second, the generosity of non-drug coverage matters because of the non-zero

cross-price elasticities; and in many previous studies the populations have very different

medical benefits as well as drug benefits. Our study focuses on beneficiaries that have



                                            - 26 -
Medigap supplemental coverage with or without drug coverage and adopts a discrete

factor model with instrumental variables to address the self-selection problem. Our

results are consistent with studies using quasi-experimental designs on the non-elderly

population (Goldman et al., 2004; Gaynor et al., 2006) and elderly population (Tamblyn

et al., 2001). The no finding by Motheral et al. (2001) may be explained by the fact that

switching from a two-tier prescription co-pay system to a three-tier prescription co-pay

system only reduces prescription drug spending by about 10% and the study population

still has a rather generous prescription drug benefit after the change.


       Gaynor et al. (2006) also found dynamics in the response to cost-sharing increase.

Their estimates imply that a $1 increase in prescription drug spending would result in a

$0.23 decrease in outpatient spending in the first year after the prices changes and a $0.41

decrease in the second year after the price changes. They found that prescription drug

prices have no significant effect on inpatient care in general but found large positive price

effects for individuals who had positive inpatient care. Our estimates should be

interpreted as the substitution effect at the steady state. Our estimate for the substitution

effect between prescription drugs and outpatient care (Medicare Part B) is virtually

identical to the estimate from Gaynor et al. (2006) in the second year after the price

changes. Our finding of a significant substitution effect between prescription drugs and

Medicare Part A (inpatient care) is consistent with their story that there is large

All plans include the Basic Benefits:

       −   Hospitalization: Part A coinsurance ($210 per day from 61st to 90th day and $420 from 91st to
           150th day) plus coverage for 365 additional days after Medicare benefits end.
       −   Medical Expenses: Part B coinsurance (generally 20% of Medicare-approved expenses)
       −   Blood: First three pints of blood each year

Plans F and J also have an option called a high deductible Plan F and high deductible Plan J. These high
deductible plans pay the same or offer the same benefits as Plans F and J after one has paid a calendar year
$1,650 deductible. Benefits from high deductible plans F and J will not begin until out-of-pocket expenses
are $1,650.

Out-of-pocket expenses for this deductible are expenses that would ordinarily be paid by the policy. These
expenses include the Medicare deductibles for Part A and Part B, but do not include, in plan J, the plan's
separate prescription drug deductible or, in plans F and J, the plans' separate foreign travel emergency
deductible.

Note: The analysis here was performed in the state level. We computed the state average Medicare Part A,
Medicare Part B and prescription drug spending by year for our study sample. For states with reforms, we
dropped the years after the reforms were implemented. Linear probability models were used in the
analysis.
