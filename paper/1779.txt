                     Rational   Bubbles in   Stock Prices?



                                   ABSTRPT


      This paper reports empirical tests for the existence of
 rational bubbles in stock prices. The analysis focuses on a
 familiar model that defines market fundamentals to be the
 expected present value of dividends, discounted at a constant
 rate, and defines a rational bubble to be a self—confirming
 divergence of stock prices from market fundamentals in response
 to extraneous variables. The tests are based on the theoretical
 result that, if rational bubbles exist, time series obtained by
differencing real stock prices do not have stationary means.
Analysis of the data in both the time domain and the frequency
domain suggests that the time series of aggregate real stock
prices is nonstationary in levels but stationary in first
differences. Applications of the time domain tests to simulated
nonstationary time series that would be implied by rational
bubbles indicates that the tests have power to detect relevant
nonstationarity when it is present. Furthermore, application of
the time—domain and frequency—domain tests to the time series of
aggregate real dividends also indicates nonstationarity in levels
but stationarity in first differences——suggesting that market
fundamentals can account for the stationarity properties of real
stock prices. These findings imply that rational bubbles do not
exist in stock prices. Accordingly, any evidence that stock
price fluctuations do not accord with market fundamentals (as
specified above) is attributable to misspecification of market
fundamentals.

     Popular commentators as well as professional economists——
see, for example, Keynes (1936, pp. 154—155)--—have long
entertained the idea that movements in stock prices can involve
"bubbles"——that is, psychologically based responses to extraneous
factors. More recently, theorists using the assumption of
rational expectations have analyzed formally the formation of
asset prices, their incorporation of market fundamentals, and the
possible influence of factors that are not part of market
fundamentals. In an earlier paper——Diba and Grossman (1985)—--we
develop a general theoretical case, summarized briefly below,
against the existence of rational bubbles. The present paper
reports complementary empirical evidence that fluctuations in
American stock prices do not incorporate rational bubbles.
     The empirical analysis utilizes the familiar linear rational
expectations model of stock price determination. This model
assumes that the expected real return from holding stock——
including expected dividends and expected capital gains or
losses——equals a constant required real rate of return. One
solution to this model, often referred to as the market
fundamentals solution, equates the real stock price to the
present value of rationally expected real dividends discounted at
a constant rate. LeRoy and Porter (1981) and Shiller (1981) find
that stock price indices exhibit more volatility than this
solution can account for. Blanchard and Watson (1982)
demonstrate that the model also possesses a solution that
includes a stochastic rational bubble component——leading to a
self—confirming divergence of stock prices from market
fundamentals in response to extraneous factors——that can
potentially account for the observed volatility of prices.
    As Blanchard and Watson point out, the apparent excess
volatility of stock prices, relative to what a particular
specification of market fundamentals can explain, does not by
itself prove that rational bubbles exist. Apparent excess
                              —2—

volatility instead can result from such factors as time—varying
discount rates (Grossman and Shiller, 1981), small sample bias
(Flavin, 1983), and misspecification of the process generating
the time series of dividends (Marsh and Merton, 1983, 1984).

     West (1984a, l984b) presents empirical evidence that he
interprets as supporting the idea that stock prices incorporate
rational bubbles. West (1984a) conducts a specification test
that rejects the joint hypothesis that (a) the expected real rate
of return from holding stock is constant, (b) rational
expectations holds, (c) a specific autoregressive process
generates aggregate real dividends, and (d) aggregate real stock
prices conform to market fundamentals as specified above. West
also reports diagnostic tests that do not reject hypotheses (a),
(b) , and (c) individually, and he concludes that the rejection of

the joint hypothesis can only be attributed to the existence of
rational bubbles.

     West (1984b) shows that the data do not satisfy an upper
bound on the conditional variance of stock prices that is implied
by the hypothesis that stock prices conform to market
fundamentals. He demonstrates that his test is immune to Marsh
and Merton's objections to earlier volatility tests, and he also
suggests that his test is not subject to the small sample bias
problem discussed by Flavin. On the basis of these results, he
argues that the contribution of rational bubbles to stock price
fluctuations is quantitatively large.
     West's conclusion that rational bubbles exist critically
depends on the power of his diagnostic tests against
misspecification of the market fundamentals component of stock
prices. Other empirical studies——see, for example, Fama and
Schwert (1977), Shiller (1981, pp. 432—433), and Campbell (1984)—
—reject the hypothesis that the ex ante required real rate of
return from holding stock is constant. Engle and Watson (1985)
analyze specifications of market fundamentals, bringing in
factors that West did not consider, that seem to be consistent
with the data and that do not require consideration of rational
bubbles.

     A general problem in testing for rational bubbles, which
arises specifically in interpreting West's evidence, is that the
econometrician cannot observe rational bubbles separately from
the market fundamentals component of an asset's price.
Consequently, any test of the hypothesis that an asset's price
involves rational bubbles must formulate a joint hypothesis about
variables that influence market fundamentals. Hamilton and
Whiteman (1984) analyze the econometric consequences of this
observation in the context of tests for the existence of rational
bubbles in the price level proposed by Sargent and Wallace (1984)
and implemented by Flood and Garber (1980), Burmeister and Wall
(1982), and Flood, Garber, and Scott (1982). Hamilton and
Whiternan demonstrate that rational bubbles and unobservable
variables (e.g., money demand disturbances) influencing market
fundamentals do not impose empirically distinguishable
restrictions on moving average representations of observable
variables. Accordingly, any evidence that can he interpreted as
suggesting that rational bubbles exist can also simply reflect
the fact that econornetricians do not observe some variables that
influence market fundamentals. Hamilton (1985) presents a clear
discussion of this point in the context of the stock market model
discussed below supplemented by an unobservable variable
reflecting such factors as risk—premia or anticipated changes in
tax laws.

     The main innovation in the present paper is the
implementation of a strategy for obtaining evidence against the
existence of rational bubbles in stock prices that does not
depend on accepting joint hypotheses about market fundamentals or
about the factors generating hubbies. This strategy is based on
the theoretical result that differencing the stochastic process
that generates rational bubbles a finite number of times does not
                              —4—

lead to a process with a stationary mean. This result does not
mean that evidence of nonstationarity establishes the existence
of rational bubbles, because such evidence could also be
attributed to nonstationarity of a possibly unobservable variable
in market fundamentals. The converse inference, however, is
possible. Namely, in principle, evidence that the time series
obtained by differencing stock prices n times, for any finite
n, possesses a stationary mean would be evidence against
rational bubbles.

     For any finite sample, however, there is always a value of
n large enough to induce the appearance of stationarity even in
a time series truly generated by a rational bubble.
Consequently, the choice of n is of considerable importance in
implementing this strategy. The empirical analysis reported
below uses a conservative procedure, justified by Hamilton and
Whiteman (1984), of setting n equal to the smallest number of
times the time series of observable variables entering market
fundamentals——in the present context, dividends——must be
differenced before they appear stationary. In the present case,
n turns out to equal one.

     The empirical evidence on stationarity of means is based on
inspection of estimated autocorrelations and spectra and on
Dickey—Fuller tests for presence of unit roots in autoregressive
models fitted to the relevant time series. Each of these
procedures strongly suggests that the time series of aggregate
real stock prices and dividends are nonstationary in levels but
stationary in first differences. Moreover, inspection of
estimated autocorrelations and application of Dickey—Fuller tests
to nonstationary time series generated by simulating rational
bubbles indicates that, given the actual sample size, this
analysis is able to detect the relevant nonstationarity when it
is present. These findings imply that rational bubbles do not
exist in American stock prices.

     In what follows, Section 1 sets up and solves the model.
Section 2 reviews the theoretical case against    rational
bubbles. Section 3 reports empirical analysis of the
stationarity properties of the time series of aggregate real
stock prices and dividends. Section 4 analyzes simulated
rational bubbles. Section 5 summarizes the analysis and
conclusions.


1.      The Model and Its Solution


        The theoretical model consists of a single equation that
assumes that the expected real rate of return from holding stock,
including expected dividends and expected capital gains or
losses, equals a constant required real rate of return——namely,

(1)          (l+r)Pt =   Et(dt÷i+
where
        r    is the constant required real rate of return,
        Pt   is the stock price at date t, relative to a general
             index of prices of goods and services,
      dt÷i is the real dividend paid to the owner of the
             stock at date t+l, and
             is the conditional expectations operator.
      Et

The information set at date t on which Et is based contains
at least the current and past values of         and dt. The
variable dt is stochastic and its innovations are independent
of past stock prices.
      Equation (1) is a first order expectational difference
equation. Because the eigenvalue, 1+r, is greater than unity,
the forward—looking solution to this equation involves a
convergent sum, as long as expected real dividends, Etdt+., for
any t do not grow with j at a geometric rate equal to or
                                       —6—

greater than l+r. This forward—looking solution, denoted by
Ft and referred to in the literature as market fundamentals, is
given by

(2)         Ft =         (l+r) Etdt+i.
                   j=l


Equation (2) says that market fundamentals equal the present
value of expected real dividends discounted at the constant
rate l+r.
     The general solution to equation (1) is the sum of Ft and
the general solution to the homogeneous expectational difference
equation

(3)         EtBt+i —     (1+r)B   =   0.

Solutions to equation (3) other than Bt = 0, for all t,
represent rational bubbles. Any solution to equation (1) can be
expressed as

(4)
            Pt=Bt+Ft
for some Bt satisfying equation (3).
     Solutions to equation (3) satisfy the stochastic difference
equation

(5)       Bti — (1+r)B        =


where   z1 is a random variable (or combination of variables)
generated by a stochastic process that Satisfies

(6)       Et.zti =        0   for all      j   0.


The key to the relevance of equation (5) for the general solution
of Pt is that equation (3) relates Bt to EtBti, rather
                                      —7—

than to Bt+i itself as would be the case in a perfect—foresight
model.

     The random variable z1 is an innovation, comprising new
information available at date t+l. This information can he
intrinsically irrelevant——that is, unrelated to F+1__or it can
be related to truly relevant variables, like d÷i through
parameters that are not present in                    The only critical
property of         given by equation (5), is that its expected
future values are always zero. (In the model of bursting bubbles
discussed by Blanchard and Watson (1982) the analog to
satisfies equation (6) even though it is not covariance
stationary.)
      The solution to equation (5), for any date t,             t > 0,       is


                   t
(7)        Bt =        (l+r)
                               tT   z I + (l+r)t B0


where date zero is the date of inception of the stock market.
(Note that the specification of date zero as a point in the
finite past is necessary for      to be finite, for finite t.)
Equation (7) relates Bt, the rational—bubbles component of
stock price at date t, to B0, the value of the rational—
bubbles component at date zero, and to realizations of the random
variable z between dates 1 and t. Since the eigenvalue
l+r exceeds unity, the contribution of z     to Bt increases
exponentially with the difference between t and r. For
example, a past realization z, 1      r < t, contributes only
the amount z    to B I, but contributes (l+r)tT z T to B
               I                                                         t


2.    Theoretical Arguments Against Rational Bubbles

      Although linear rational expectations models appear to
permit rational bubbles, deeper theoretical analysis suggests
that such models fail to capture important economic
considerations that would affect demand for assets at extremely
                                 —8—

low and/or extremely high prices and that would preclude rational
bubbles. Equation (3) implies that for any j > 0, the expected
rational—bubbles component of stock price is related to the
current value of the rational—bubbles component by


(8)       EtBt+i =   (l+r)3 Bt    j > 0.


Accordingly, if Bt differs from zero, market participants must
expect the rational—bubbles component either to increase (if
Bt > 0) or to decrease (if Bt < 0) without bound
geometrically at the rate l+r.

     As several authors (e.g., Blanchard and Watson) have
observed, equation (8) rules out negative rational bubbles
because a positive probability that stock prices will be negative
at a finite date in the future would be inconsistent with free
disposal of stocks. Moreover, as Tirole (1982) demonstrates,
equation (8) rules out positive rational bubbles in a model with
finitely many immortal agents. In this model, it is not rational
to expect real stock prices to grow without bound because such
growth would require indefinite postponement of consumption. In
addition, as Weil (1984) and Tirole (1985) show, equation (8)
also rules out positive rational bubbles in an overlapping—
generations model with a growth rate less than the real rate of
interest. In such a model, the expected growth rate of a
rational bubble would have to equal the real rate of interest,
but it is not rational to expect stock prices to grow faster than
the growth rate of the economy because such an expectation would
imply that the value of the existing stock eventually would
outgrow the endowments of the young generation.

     Diba and Grossman (1985) show that, even if the growth rate
of the economy exceeds the rate of interest and, therefore,
positive rational bubbles could be sustained, the impossibility
of negative bubbles restricts the inception of positive
bubbles. Consider the possible inception of a positive rational
bubble at date t, t > 1, assuming Bti = 0. The restriction
                              —9—

Bt > 0 together with equation (5) implies z ) 0. Because, by
condition (6), Zt must have a mean of zero, this nonnegativity
restriction implies z = 0 with probability one.
     Accordingly, in order for a positive rational bubble to
exist at any date t, t > 1, it must have existed at all
previous dates T, 0         t.  In particular, if at any date t,
t > 0,  an existing rational bubble were to vanish——an event
that, for example, has constant probability in the model of
bursting bubbles discussed by Blanchard and Watson (l982)——then a
rational bubble cannot exist at any subsequent date Ti   T > t.

     The specification of equation (1) assumes that demand for
stocks is infinitely elastic at a constant required rate of
return. The theoretical case against positive rational bubbles
would be even stronger in alternative models——for example, models
with a log—linear specification of demand——in which, because a
positive bubble would increase the fraction of equity in the real
value of asset portfolios, portfolio balance would require the
expected rate of return from holding stock to rise as the bubble
grew. In such models, positive rational bubbles would imply that
equity holders expect stock prices to grow at an accelerating
rate.  If the economy's output does not grow at a compatible
accelerating rate, positive rational bubbles would not be
consistent with the economy's output constraint.
     In a log—linear setting negative rational bubbles would
imply asymptotic convergence of the expected stock price to zero,
as its logarithm tends to minus infinity. Hence, the standard
argument against negative rational bubbles based on nonnegativity
of stock prices, discussed above, does not apply. Nevertheless,
it is also not rational to expect stock prices to converge to
zero if stocks entitle their holders to positive streams of real
dividends. The proof by Obstfeld and Rogoff (1983) that a
negative rational bubble cannot exist in the value of money that
is convertible to some real asset uses an analogous argument.
                             — 10 —



     Diba and Grossman (1985) contains a more detailed discussion
of the theoretical case for ruling out rational bubbles. The
following section presents empirical evidence that complements
this theoretical analysis.


3.   Evidence Based on Stationarity Properties

     If the excess volatility found by West (l984b) is
attributable to rational bubbles, the innovations in the
rational—bubbles component contribute much more than those of the
market—fundamentals component to stock price fluctuations. West
claims that "about 75 to 95 percent of the variance of the error
in forecasting the following year's stock price is attributable
to bubbles" (1984b, p. 22). If this claim is correct, it seems
reasonable to expect that the time series properties of stock
prices would closely resemble those of rational bubbles.
     An important property of rational bubbles reflected in
equation (8) is their explosive conditional expectations. For
most specifications of the generating process of z1 the
exploding conditional expectations property implies that time
series of rational bubbles do not possess a stationary
(unconditional) mean. The only exceptions discussed in the
literature involve stochastic rational bubbles that can burst in
any given period with nonzero probability. Quah (1985)
demonstrates that such rational bubbles possess a stationary
unconditional mean despite their exploding conditional
expectations property. As was pointed out in the preceding
section, however, the impossibility of negative rational bubbles
implies that if (positive) rational bubbles ever burst, they
cannot restart. Therefore, the only possible rational bubble
that tests of the stationarity properties of stock prices could
not detect is one that started at the inception of the stock
market and did not last long enough (relative to sample size) to
                                       — 11 —



induce the appearance of nonstationarity in the mean of stock
prices. The following empirical analysis abstracts from this
possibility.

     The explosive conditional expectations property associated
with rational bubbles is not peculiar to the model discussed in
Section 1. Mussa (1984) shows that various examples of attempts
to construct alternative models in which potential rational
bubbles are convergent all preclude a forward-looking market—
fundamentals solution for some relevant price variable and,
therefore, are not economically interesting.

     Quah (1985) develops a stock market model in which, although
stock prices are equal to the present value of expected future
dividends, convergent rational bubbles can affect both stock
prices and dividends. However, this model is based on a
backward—looking specification of the process generating
dividends. Specifically, Quah assumes that firms disregard
information about current and future earnings and other relevant
information about future events in choosing their dividend
stream. Moreover, even if convergent rational bubbles are
possible, their empirical implications, as Quah (1985, p. 43)
recognizes, are not distinguishable from thçse of unobservable
variables——e.g., expectations of a change in tax—laws——that may
impinge on market fundamentals. Accordingly, the following
empirical analysis focuses on the hypothesis that explosive
rational bubbles exist in stock prices.

      Differencing equation (5)          n times yields

                                 n                n
(9)        [1 —   (l+r)L](1—L)       Bt = (l—L)   z,
where L denotes the lag operator. If z is white noise, an
ARMA process that is neither stationary (i.e., the autoregressive
polynomial has a root inside the unit circle) nor invertible
(i.e., the moving average polynomial has unit roots) generates
the n th difference of Bt, (l—L) Bt.      More
                               — 12 —



generally,   equation (9) implies that,differencing the time series
of stock prices n times, for any finite n, yields a time
series with stationary mean, stock prices do not contain rational
bubbles.

     Implementing the above approach to testing for rational
bubbles involves two difficulties. First, even in the absence of
rational bubbles, the (differenced) time series of stock prices
may be nonstationary because the (differenced) time series of
some variables appearing in market fundamentals——including
dividends as well as other variables possibly left out of the
model——may be nonstationary. This problem is a reflection of the
general ambiguity of any evidence suggesting the existence of
rational bubbles, discussed in the introduction and in Hamilton
and Whiteman (1984) and Hamilton (1985). Second, even if
rational bubbles exist, given a finite sample, ditferencing the
time series of stock prices a sufficient number of times, will
always induce the appearance of stationarity. Therefore, the
choice of n is, in practice, quite important.
     A conservative response to both of these problems, justified
by Hamilton and Whiteman, is to set n equal to the smallest
number of times the time series of observable variables in market
fundamentals——in the present context, dividends——must be
difterenced before they appear stationary. To check that the
analysis has power, given sample size, to detect rational bubbles
when they exist, we also examine time series obtained by
differencing simulated rational bubbles n times.
     The data used for the present study, supplied by Robert
Shiller, are the same as Data Set 1 in Shiller (1981). West also
used this same data. The observations are annual from 1871 to
1980. The price series is Standard and Poor's Composite Stock
Price index for January of each year divided by the wholesale
price index. The dividend series is total dividends accruing to
this portfolio of stocks for the calendar year divided by the
average wholesale price index for the year.

       Table 1 presents sample autocorrelations of real stock
prices, dividends, and their first—differences, for one through
ten lags. The autocorrelations of the undifferenced price and
dividend series both drop off very slowly as lag length
increases—--suggesting nonstationary means. Their patterns
correspond closely to what would be expected for integrated
moving average processes according to a formula presented by
Wichern (1973). In contrast, autocorrelations of the differenced
series, both for prices and dividends, are consistent with the
assumption that these series have stationary means. Thus, the
autocorrelation patterns suggest that the nonstationarity of the
time series of real stock prices is attributable to their market
fundamentals component and that rational bubbles do not exist in
stock prices.

       The Dickey—Fuller test yields further evidence on
stationarity properties of the stock price and dividend time
series. The Dickey—Fuller procedure looks for stochastic drift
in the mean of a time series {x } by testing the null
hypothesis that the autoregressive representation of Xt, which
is assumed to exist, has a unit root against the alternative
hypothesis that all the roots of the autoregressive polynomial
lie outside the unit circle. For more discussion, see Fuller
(1976, pp. 366—382) or Nelson and Plosser (1982).
       The test is based on estimating the OLS regression

(10)        Xt =   i+   yt + px1+
                                     k

                                    i=l    1
                                               + residual,

where t denotes time and       is the difference operator. The
null hypothesis to be tested is that y = 0 and    p = 1.  Under
this null hypothesis, Ix is generated by an AR(k) process.
Therefore, we can select the lag length k in equation (10) by
applying Box—Jenkins identification procedures to choose the
appropriate AR model for          The test proceeds to calculate
the conventional t—ratio for testing p = 1 in the OLS estimate
                                         — 14 —


of equation (10). This statistic is not t—distributed but its
empirical percentiles have been tabulated——see, for example,
Fuller (1976, p. 373).
        If the bubble innovations,          z1 in equation (5) , are white
noise, the process that generates rational bubbles is AR(1) with
a root inside the unit circle. (Equation (5) is a special case
of equation (10) with i =    =1 =            = 0 and
                                                    k
 p   = 1+r.)
           Therefore, if rational bubbles exist, the Dickey—
Fuller test should not reject the unit-root hypothesis in favor
of the alternative hypothesis that the root is outside the unit
circle.

     Although rejection of the unit—root hypothesis would be
evidence against rational bubbles, failure to reject the unit
root hypothesis would not necessarily imply that rational bubbles
exist. The tests reported by Nelson and Plosser fail to reject
the unit root hypothesis for time series (such as nominal and
real GNP, wage and price indices, and money stock) that
presumably do not reflect rational bubbles. As in interpreting
the autocorrelation patterns, we attribute the presence of a unit
root in the time series of stock prices to market fundamentals
rather than to rational bubbles as long as the test also suggests
the presence of a unit root in the autoregressive process fitted
to the time series of dividends.

     A possible problem for the applicability of the Dickey—
Fuller test is that, even if bubble innovations are white noise,
first—differences of rational bubbles follow    an ARMA process
that is neither stationary nor invertible. Setting n equal to
one in equation (9) leads to

                                  =
(11)           [1 —
                      (l+r)Llbt       (l—L)zt,
where bt =
                (l_L)Bt.
                      The non—invertibility (i.e., the unit root
of the moving average polynomial) precludes the existence of the
pure AR representation on which the Dickey—Fuller test is based.
                                     — 15 —



As a practical matter, however, time series generated by this
process will resemble those generated by the process

            [1 —               =
                   (1+r)LJb        (1_AL)zt,
for  A close to but less than unity. This latter process has
the AR representation


(12)        [1 —   (1+r)L]   (1—AL) 1bt =   z.
The autoregressive polynomial in equation (12) has a root,
(1+r), inside the unit circle——implying p > 1 in the
counterpart of equation (10) with k set to infinity. The
simulations presented in the next section show that the Dickey—
Fuller test is relevant, as this argument suggests, for finding
evidence against rational bubbles.
     Table 2 reports OLS estimates of equation (10) for real
stock prices, real dividends, and their first—differences. The
first few observations on each series have been dropped to adjust
sample size to 100 because Fuller (1976, p. 373) tabulates the
critical values of the test statistic for a sample of this
size. For each series, the lag length k was selected by
choosing the appropriate AR(k) model for its first—differenes
on the basis of Box—Jenkins identification procedures.
       For the undifferenced stock price and dividend time series,
OLS estimates of the parameter p are below unity. However, the
OLS estimator of this parameter is biased towards zero under the
null hypothesis p = 1——see, for example, Nelson and Plosser's
Table 1. The test statistic r(p), reported in the last row of
Table 2 below, is calculated as the conventional t—ratio for
testing p = 1, i.e.,    t(p) = (p—1)/S. Its 5% critical value,
for a sample of 100 observations, is —3.45, with the rejection
region given by smaller values of r( p). Since the values of
this statistic for both undifferenced series are larger than the

ratio for testing p = 1, i.e.,    T(p) = (p—1)/S, but is not t—
distributed under the null hypothesis. Its empirical percentiles
are tabulated in Fuller (1976). The 0.05 critical value is —3.45,
with the rejection region given by smaller values of  t( p).
                             — 16 —



critical value, we cannot reject the hypothesis   p = 1   for
either time series.

     For the differenced time series of stock prices and
dividends, estimates of p are not significantly different from
zero. Moreover, values of T( p) are well below the critical
value of —3.45 (i.e., in the rejection region). Therefore, for
both of these time series we can comfortably reject p = 1 in
favor of  p < 1.

     The results of Dickey—Fuller tests for the original and
differenced time series confirm the conclusion based on
inspection of sample autocorrelations. The mean of real stock
prices exhibits nonstationarity, but we can explain this
nonstationarity without invoking rational bubbles because real
dividends also possess a nonstationary mean. First—differences
of real dividends are stationary and so are first—differences of
real stock prices——contrary to what the existence of rational
bubbles would imply.

     We can also study the stationarity properties of the
relevant time series by analyzing the data in the frequency
domain. Although estimation of the spectrum presumes a
stationary mean, estimated spectra are, in practice, helpful for
detecting non—stationarity——see, for example, Jenkins and Watts
(1968, pp. 7—8). working with estimated spectra, rather than
sample auto—correlations, avoids the potential problem that
correlation among neighboring values can distort the sample
autocorrelation function. In contrast, the estimated spectrum
would isolate the effects of a nonstationary mean at the low
frequencies——suggesting the presence of a "spike" at the zero
frequency. In other words, the estimated spectrum rises sharply
as it approaches the low frequencies and stays flat over a band
near the zero frequency.
                              — 17 —



      Figures 1 to 4 depict the logarithms of the estimated
spectra of real stock prices, dividends, and their first—
differences. The reported spectra were estimated with 128
ordinates and a tent window of width 11. Variations of the
number of ordinates and the type (i.e., tent or flat) and width
of the window did not appear to have a major effect on the
features of estimated spectra that are discussed below.
     For both stock prices and dividends, the spectra of the
undifferenced series suggest the presence of a spike at the zero
frequency (corresponding to cycles with infinite periodicity) but
the spectra of first—differenced series do not. (The differenced
time series of stock prices seems to exhibit a spike at the
periodicity of 3.88 years——presumably associated with business
cycles——but not at the zero frequency. As was pointed out above,
the relevant features of the spectrum, as far as stationarity of
the mean is concerned, are concentrated around the zero
frequency.)

     The frequency domain results warrant the same inferences as
the time domain results discussed above. The nonstationary mean
of the undifferenced time series of stock prices seems
attributable to market fundamentals. The stationary mean of the
differenced time series of stock prices suggests that rationa.
bubbles do not exist.

4.   Stationarity Properties of Simulated Rational Bubbles

     This section presents evidence that the time domain tests
discussed in the preceding section have power against the no—
bubbles hypothesis when that hypothesis is, by construction,
false. The tests applied to real stock price and real dividend
time series are applied to 50 simulated time series, containing
109 observations each, of rational bubbles.

        In the simulations the bubble innovations, z in equation
(7) ,   are assumed to have the standard normal distribution, and
B0 is set equal to zero. Since interest at this point is
focused on stationarity properties of time series of rational
bubbles, the simulations ignore the theoretical impossibility of
negative bubbles and questions related to inception of rational
bubbles. The simulations require an assumption about the value
of r, the ex ante required real rate of return from holding
equity. This assumption is important because, as inspection of
equation (11) reveals, first—differenced time series of rational
bubbles can be empirically indistinguishable from white noise
if r is close to zero. The mean of the ex post real rate of
return for the data discussed in the preceding section is
0.081. However, to emphasize the ability of the tests to detect
rational bubbles for lower values of r, the simulations set
this parameter equal to 0.05, which is the value assumed by
Shiller (1981).
        For each simulated time series of rational bubbles and its
first—difference, autocorrelation coefficients, for one through
ten lags, were calculated. The first few observations on each
untransformed and first—differenced series were then dropped to
adjust the number of observations to 100, equation (10) was
estimated, and for the simulations with p < 1, the T( p)
statistic (discussed in the preceding section) was evaluated.
The lag length k was set equal to zero when estimating equation
(10) for undifferenced series. For the differenced series, the
autoregressive approximation given by equation (12) is not
finite. The lag length k suggested by t—ratios of estimated
coefficients ranged between three and six in most cases. Because
leaving out relevant terms could bias the results, whereas
inclusion of irrelevant ones would only reduce efficiency,     k

was set equal to six for all of the different series.
                              — 19 —


      The results for the undifferenced series are not of much
 interest and are, therefore, not reported. The sample auto—
 correlations dropped off very slowly in all cases. Point
 estimates of the parameter p in equation (10) were in all cases
 above unity, making the Dickey—Fuller test redundant.
     Table 3 reports the results for first—differences of
simulated rational bubbles. The patterns of autocorrelation
coefficients in all but six cases (simulations numbered 10, 14,
21, 29, 33 and 35) strongly suggest nonstationarity. The
autocorrelation function starts at a value of 0.8 or higher and
drops off very slowly. For simulations 10, 14, 21, 29, and 35
the starting values are lower, hut the autocorrelation functions
still drop off slowly. (Wichern's results indicate that the
latter criterion is a more reliable sign of nonstationarity.)
Only for simulation number 33 does the pattern of
autocorrelatfons resemble those of differenced time series of
stock prices and dividends reported in Table 1 above.
     Point estimates of p are below unity for simulations
numbered 10, 14, 21, 29, 33, and 35. However, the test statistic
t(p) in all six cases is above the 0.05 critical value of —3.45,
and the hypothesis p = 1 cannot be rejected in favor of
p < 1.  Point estimates of p are above unity in the remaining
44 cases, making the Dickey—Fuller test unnecessary.

     Overall, the simulations strongly suggest that the pattern
of autocorrelations and the Dickey—Fuller test have power to
detect the nonstationary mean of first—differenced rational
bubble series. Therefore, the results presented in the preceding
section, that the first—differenced time series of real stock
prices does not exhibit this type of nonstationarity is relevant
evidence against the existence of rational bubbles in stock
prices.

 5.   Summary and Conclusions

     Ignoring the possibility of a positive rational bubble that
started at the inception of the stock market and vanished shortly
after (relative to sample size), the existence of rational
bubbles would imply nonstationarity of the means of (differenced)
time series of stock prices. The empirical analysis looked for
such nonstationarity. To avoid problems of drawing inferences
from time series obtained by differencing stock prices an
arbitrary number of times, we used two inferential strategies.
First, if rational bubbles exist, stock prices should exhibit
higher order nonstationarity than observable variables in their
market fundamentals——e.g., dividends. Second, if rational
bubbles do not exist, stock prices should exhibit lower order
nonstationarity than time series of simulated rational bubbles.

     Inferences about stationarity of means were based on
inspection of sample autocorrelations and estimated spectra of
the relevant time series and on Dickey—Fuller tests for unit
roots in their autoregressive representations. The results
strongly suggest that stationarity properties of aggregate real
stock prices accord with those of aggregate real dividends. Roth
time series appear nonstationary in levels but stationary in
first—differences. Moreover, first—differenced time series of
simulated rational bubbles exhibit clear signs of
nonstationarity——implying that the tests have power to detect
rational bubbles if they existed in stock prices. These findings
indicate that rational bubbles do not exist in stock prices.
