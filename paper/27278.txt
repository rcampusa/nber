                                        ABSTRACT

We develop a unified theory with endogenous technology choice in human/knowledge capital
accumulation to establish a rich array of equilibrium development paradigms, including poverty
trap, middle income trap and flying geese growth. We then generalize the baseline structure and
establish conditions for different development paradigms to arise. By calibrating the general
model to fit the data from several representative economies with different income and growth
patterns, we identify various prolonged flying geese episodes and middle income traps. By
performing growth accounting, we find that improving human capital accumulation efficacy and
mitigating barriers to human capital accumulation are most rewarding for advancing the economy
and avoiding the middle income trap.

1         Introduction

During the post WWII era, one has witnessed a widening world income disparity with
the per capita real income ratio of the richest to poorest 10% rising from below 20 in
1960 to above 50 since the turn of the new millennium. This further promotes the study
of poverty trap to better understand why the poorest countries failed to advance. Not
until recently, more development economists have recognized the presence of broadly
defined "middle income trap" in which many previously fast growing middle income and
even some more advanced countries have suffered sluggish growth. This is not only a
concern to those trapped countries but a worldwide issue because many of them have
been primary forces for advancing global growth.
        To motivate our study, we show cross-country income mobilities over the past four
decades. In Table 1, the proportion of countries transiting from the ith quintile (denoted
Qi) in year t to the j th quintile (Qj) in year t + 20 over two thirty-year windows (1971-
2001 and 1981-2011). The high persistence in Q1-Q1 transition is consistent with the
conventional argument of poverty trap. Moreover, countries in Q3 and Q4 face high
probabilities, ranging from 15 to 30%, to fall back by a quintile. During 1981-2011, in
particular, such a probability for countries in Q4 to fall back is particularly high (28%);
even for those in Q2 such a probability also exceeds 20%. This observation is consistent
with the possibility of middle income trap. More systematic empirical evidence for
the existence of middle income trap has been provided by Eichengreen, Park and Shin
(2013) among others. In their work, middle income trap is identified as a substantive
fall (2% or more) in per capita real income growth of a previously fast growing (3.5% or
higher) middle income country (with per capita real income exceeding US$10, 000 in 2005
constant PPP prices) for a considerable duration (7 year before and after the structural
break). Under these criteria in conjunction with Chow tests, they find many such traps
in Asian, European and Latin American countries in different years depending on their
stages of development.1 More interestingly, upon checking a number of possible drivers,
    1
        Cases identified include: (i) in the 1970s, Greece (1972), Finland (1974), Japan (1974), Venezuela

                                                      1
they find that more educated at secondary and higher education levels is a robust factor
leading to lower likelihood for a country to fall into the middle income trap.

    Two natural questions arise. First, can one establish a unified theory under which
not only a poverty trap but a middle income trap may also exist? Second, can human
capital, or, more generally knowledge capital, play a key role affecting the presence of
the middle income trap to support the aforementioned empirical finding? In this paper,
we will address both questions within an optimal growth framework with endogenous
technology choice. More specifically, we consider a representative agent to maximize her
lifetime utility subject to periodic budget constraints that allocate income to consump-
tion and investments in physical and human or knowledge capital. While investment
in physical capital directly contribute to its stock one for one, investment in human
(1974), Ireland (1978), (ii) in the 1980s, Singapore (1980), Mexico (1981), Puerto Rico (1988), Cyprus
(1989), Korea (1989), and, (iii) in the 1990s, Portugal (1990), Hong Kong (1993), Taiwan (1995).

                                                  2
capital depends crucially on the knowledge accumulation technology. The knowledge
accumulation technology exhibits an important feature: while better technology is more
productive, it is associated with higher scale barrier. As a result of this trade-off, only
those with higher existing stock of human capital may adopt better technology.
   In this otherwise simple growth model, we are able to establish conditions under
which a poverty trap and at least one middle income trap coexist. We find that a middle
income trap is more likely to arise when the productivity of the prevailing technology is
not too large, the scale barrier of the prevailing technology is sufficiently high and the
productivity jump to the better technology is sufficiently big. But what happens if an
economy is not mired in such middle income trap? We establish the conditions under
which the economy features a flying geese development paradigm `
                                                               a la Akamatsu (1962),
with continual technology upgrading in human/knowledge accumulation over time. We
also show that with negligible productivity upgrading an economy can be permanently
trap in poverty and that with negligible increase in technology scale barrier an economy
can grow rapidly into an advanced society.
   We then generalize our baseline model to permit employment variations over time
and to relax the ranking assumption on the knowledge capital accumulation technology.
By applying our modified conditions for flying geese paradigm and middle income trap
to a representative set of 14 countries/economies using data from Penn World Table
(PWT9.0), we find that even in the four developed countries and four fast growing
Asian Tigers where they have experienced flying geese at prolonged periods, there still
exist occasions of traps. In the three emerging growing economies, such traps become
more often, but still less frequent than flying geese. In the three development laggards
featuring chopped and slower growth paths, on the contrary, they are trapped as much as
flying. Although with different sample of countries, we are able to compare our findings
with those in the literature by focusing on common samples. We find that several, but
not all, traps identified in our paper are in line with those in previous studies.
   Overall, the results suggest that large drops in human capital technology efficacy are

                                             3
overwhelmingly the primary force for a country to fall into a middle income trap. Large
increases in barriers to human capital accumulation are also important, playing a partic-
ularly bigger role in emerging growing countries. By contrast, total factor productivity
TFP slowdowns are only essential occasionally. By performing growth accounting, we
find that human capital technology upgrading and human capital barrier reduction are
crucial, contributing to 37-55% of economic growth on average. In contrast to conven-
tional growth accounting studies, TFP turns out to be largely inconsequential. Notably,
in more than half of the episodes considered in our study (15 out of 28 episodes in 14
countries), human capital technology upgrading and human capital barrier reduction
jointly account for more than 50% of economic growth. While human capital technology
upgrading is more important in advanced and fast-growing countries, human capital bar-
rier reduction is more crucial for emerging growing countries and development laggards.
   The main message delivered by this paper is that human capital upgrading and
barrier reduction can play a key role in economic development, determining whether a
country may be flying or trapped. Our quantitative analysis yields an important policy
implication: public policy toward improving human or knowledge capital accumulation
efficacy or mitigating barriers to human or knowledge capital accumulation is likely more
rewarding than that directly toward advancing the TFP.

Literature
   There is a sizable literature showing the existence of a poverty trap. The argument
is based on multiple steady states: coexistence of degenerate low equilibrium (trap) and
a high equilibrium (see a comprehensive survey by Azariadis and Stachurski 2005). By
limiting our attention to human capital related studies, poverty trap may arise due to
human capital threshold externality (Azariadis and Drazen 1990; Redding 1996), moral
hazard problem associated with human capital investment (Tssidon 1992), or barrier to
investment in children's human capital (Galor and Weil 2000). Yet their frameworks
cannot be used to generate middle income trap.
   There is a small body of research on the flying geese paradigm with micro-founded

                                           4
theory. In particular, the flying geese paradigm may arise as a result of product up-
grading (Matsuyama 2002), industry upgrading (Wang and Xie 2004; Ju, Lin and Wang
2015) or staged assimilation of global technologies (Wang, Wong and Yip 2018). None
of these papers fully characterizes the local and global dynamics of the model.
    In Wang, Wong and Yip (2018), the possibility of middle income trap via assimilation
of global technologies is established. Specifically, technology assimilation in a country
is more effective if its factor endowment gap from the technology source country is
small. When a country accumulates the disadvantage capital to reduce such a gap in
the process of assimilation, the mismatch is mitigated and output grows faster. But
a country may over-accumulate eventually, causing more serious mismatch and growth
slowdown and yielding a middle income trap. By contrast, not only we propose a very
different mechanism, but we also fully establish the explicit conditions for a middle
income trap and fully characterize the dynamics to ensure stability property of such a
trap.



2       The Model

Consider a discrete-time model with time indexed by t. The economy consists of identical
infinitely lived agents. There is a single general good that can be used for consumption
or investment purposes. In addition to labor, there are two capital inputs: physical
and human capital. The key feature of the model is that the human capital updating
technology is endogenously determined by discrete choice with costly barriers.


2.1     The environment

A representative agent at period t produces general goods Yt by applying a Cobb-Douglas
                                       
production technology Yt = AHt-1 Kt-1 Lt (, ,   (0, 1),  +  +  = 1), the inputs

of which are physical capital Kt-1 , labor Lt , and human capital Ht-1 ­ which should
be taken more generally to include knowledge capital and know-how. Note that the

                                           5
production of general goods takes one gestation period in which the human capital, Ht-1 ,
and the physical capital, Kt-1 , are prepared one period before the production occurs
(time-to-build). A is the total factor productivity (TFP) of the production technology.2
The general goods are consumed or used for investments by the representative agent.
The aggregate budget constraint is given by


                                             
                                 AHt                   h    k
                                    -1 Kt-1 Lt = Ct + It + It ,                                  (1)


where Ct is aggregate consumption, and Ith and Itk are investments for production of
human capital and physical capital, respectively. The per worker budget constraint is
obtained from Eq. (1) as follows:


                                              
                                 yt := Ah                 h    k
                                         t-1 kt-1 = ct + it + it ,                               (2)


where ht-1 := Ht-1 /Lt , kt-1 := Kt-1 /Lt , ct := Ct /Lt , ih     h            k     k
                                                            t := It /Lt , and it := It /Lt are

per worker variables. Although the growth in labor force is introduced in the quantitative
analysis in section 5, the population of labor force is normalized to Lt = 1 for all t  0
in the theoretical analysis up to section 4.


2.2     Optimization Problem

Let us first specify a representative agent's optimization problem by maximizing her
lifetime utility subject to three constraints in addition to the typical nonnegativity con-
straints on investments:
                                              
                                        max           -t ln c
                                               =t

   2
    In the quantitative analysis in section 5 where we generalize the basic model, A is allowed to be
time-variant.

for   t, where   (0, 1) is the subjective discount factor. In Eqs. (3)-(5), both
physical and human capital depreciates entirely in one period. The representative agent
is endowed with two types of investment projects: one is to produce physical capital
and the other is to produce human capital. In the first investment project, a one-for-one
simple linear technology produces capital from general goods. That is, in Eq. (4), the
production function for physical capital, g (ik
                                               ), is given by




                                         g0 (ik     k
                                               ) = i .                                (6)


    In Eq. (5), gm (ih  ¯
                      ; h -1 , y
                               ¯ ) is a production function for human capital when the
representative agent applies the mth technology. Human capital is produced from the
general goods where the human capital formation is subject to technology choice: the
representative agent chooses the best technology among a number of M technologies for
the human capital formation.
    Throughout the analysis, we shall begin by analyzing the case in which there are
three technologies, subsequently followed by generalization with M technologies. In
each period, the agent chooses the best technology for human (or knowledge) capital
formation and solves her maximization problem, exogenously given the externalities
                                       ¯  -1 , and the (average) current-period output,
from the (average) past human capital, h
y
¯ , in the economy. We impose Assumption 1 below for regulating the functional form
of gm (ih  ¯

Assumption 1-(i) guarantees the positive marginal product of human capital investment,
ih
  . Assumption 1-(ii) implies that the past knowledge accumulation, which is condensed

                                      ¯  -1 , has a positive external effect on the marginal
into the past human capital formation h
product promoting the human capital formation. However, from Assumption 1-(iii), the
effect of the positive externality diminishes as the past knowledge more accumulates.
Assumption 1-(iv) mitigates the scale effect of human capital externality. Since as the
                  ¯  -1 and y
economy develops, h         ¯ continue to rise, so this assumption limits the scale of
knowledge spillovers.
      Under Assumption 1, the representative agent chooses the best technology depending
upon the human capital accumulation. If the productivity with respect to a certain
technology becomes small, another suitable technology may be chosen as noted from the
max operator in the right-hand side of Eq. (5).
      To make the following analysis concrete, we specify gm (ih  ¯
                                                                ; h -1 , y

and m  [0, ).3 Thus, human or knowledge capital accumulation depends on the
society's existing stock in the spirit of the knowledge spillovers in Romer (1986) and
                                                                      ¯  -1 is effective
human capital spillovers in Lucas (1988). However, the externality of h
only when it exceeds a certain border, m . Thus, one may view the presence of m as
a result of scale barrier in knowledge accumulation. The scale barrier in human capital
considered here also captures the argument in Buera and Kaboski (2012) where higher
skill is required for production of goods with greater complexity. Our scale barrier
setup generates similar implication to the appropriate technology model in Caselli and
Coleman (2006) where skilled labor abundant rich countries tend to choose technologies
  3                                                   ¯  -1 is always positive.

barrier, m .

Assumption 2. (i) 1 = 1 < 2 < · · · < M and (ii) 0 = 1 < 2 < · · · < M .

Assumption 2 implies that human capital accumulation needs to exceed the higher border

after the highest technology M , the economy will be on a perpetual balanced growth

3     Equilibrium

We are now prepared to define and establish the dynamic competitive equilibrium and
to characterize the dynamics. A key strategy is to reduce the dynamical system to the
two states ­ physical and human capital ­ and the values of these two capitals. This
strategy greatly simplifies the analysis because the two capital values are proportional
and their limits are governed by the transversality conditions.
                                                    ¯ t-1 , y
    From Eqs. (9) and (10), it follows that ht = (b(h       ¯t )/ )kt . From this equation
and Eqs. (4)-(7), we obtain ik    h
                             t + it = kt (1 -  )/ . These two equations allow us to

rewrite the flow budget constraint (3) as

                        ct +    kt = A                              kt -1 ,              (12)
                                                  

                                                 ¯ t-1 , y
for all t  1. Additionally, substituting ht = (b(h       ¯t )/ )kt into Eq. (9) yields

                                                             -1

Multiplying t to both sides of Eq. (12) leads to

                                                   ¯ t-2 , y

Applying Eqs. (8) and (13) to the left-hand and right-hand sides of Eq. (14) respectively,
we obtain

from Eq. (11) and kt = (/(b(h                      k

where qt := ph

govern the dynamics of the values of the two capitals recursively, independent of other
states or controls or technology choice.
   From Eqs. (10) and (11), it follows that pk       k
                                             t yt = qt-1 /( ). The use of this equation,

   We can now define a dynamic competitive equilibrium as a sequence, {qt , qt , ht , kt },
for t  0 that satisfies Eqs. (15)-(18) and the transversality condition, given h0  0
and k0  0. In so far, we have, however, not yet analyzed the technology choice,
maxm {Bm (ht-1 )}, in Eq. (17), to which we now turn.


3.1    Technology choice

We now consider technology choice maxm {Bm (ht-1 )} in Eq. (17). Given the trade-off
under Assumption 2, the key is to determine the cutoff human capital scales between
each pair of technologies. Define such cutoffs as v1 and v2 so that B1 (v1 ) = B2 (v1 )
and B2 (v2 ) = B3 (v2 ). Note that v1 is the cutoff of h between the first and the second
technologies whereas v2 is the cutoff between the second and the third technologies. It



                                               11
is straightforward to show that v1 and v2 satisfy, respectively,


                                         
                                        v1 = 2 (v1 - 2 )                                   (19)

Lemma 1. Under Assumption 2, the following hold.


     · If 2  ht-1 < v1 (resp. ht-1 > v1 ), it holds that B1 (ht-1 ) > B2 (ht-1 ) (resp.
       B1 (ht-1 ) < B2 (ht-1 )).

     · If 3  ht-1 < v2 (resp. ht-1 > v2 ), it holds that B2 (ht-1 ) > B3 (ht-1 ) (resp.
       B2 (ht-1 ) < B3 (ht-1 )).


Proof. See the Appendix.

Proposition 1. Suppose that Assumption 2 holds. Suppose also that v1 < v2 . Then, in
maxm {Bm (ht-1 )}, the representative agent optimally chooses the first technology (m = 1)
if 0  ht-1 < v1 , the second technology (m = 2) if v1 < ht-1 < v2 , and the third
technology (m = 3) if v2 < ht-1 .

Proof. See the Appendix.
Note that if ht-1 = v1 , the choice between the first and second technologies is indifferent.
In this case, it is assumed that the second technology is chosen over the first technology.
Likewise, if ht-1 = v2 , the choice between the second and third technologies is indifferent
and it is assumed that the third technology is chosen over the second technology in
this case. It is clear that Proposition 1 can be readily generalized to M technologies.

3.2     Steady states

The steady states can be solved in a recursive manner by solving the capital values
first. Eqs. (15)-(18) form the dynamical system in equilibrium, which we recite in the
following:

         
           h          1              
         
          qt =           qh
                    (1- ) t-1
                                -   1-
         
                                     
           k          1
          qt =           qk     -
         
                    (1- ) t-1       1-
                                                                                                 (21)
                                   1                       1              k
         
          ht =  maxm {Bm (ht-1 )} 1- 
                                      -            1-     k
                                                         qt
                                                                  =: J1 (qt -1 , ht-1 , kt-1 )
                                                            -1
         
          k = Ah k         1            1                       k
                 t-1 t-1 1- - 1-
         
           t                          qk
                                                        =: J2 (qt -1 , ht-1 , kt-1 ).
                                                 t-1




As a result of the recursive property mentioned above, the values of human and physical
capital in the steady state, q h and q k , are independent of human and physical capital
and the technology choice

                                                           
                        q h =                and q k =              .                            (22)
                                1 -  (1 -  )           1 -  (1 -  )

   In contrast, physical capital and human capital in the steady state depend crucially
on the technology choice. Suppose that the j th technology in human capital production
is optimally chosen, i.e., maxm {Bm (ht-1 )} = Bj (ht-1 ) (j = 1, 2 or 3). Since Bj (ht-1 ) is
concave, we can "potentially" obtain at most two steady states, say, h         
                                                                      j,1 and hj,2 , from

the technology. From (21), it follows that


                                         h          
                                          j,s = j (hj,s - j )
                                                             
                                                                                                 (23)


                                      
                                     kj,s = A(h       
                                               j,s ) (kj,s ) ,                                   (24)

for s = 1, 2. Assuming that h                       h k                        h k            
                             j,1 < hj,2 , we call (q , q , hj,1 , kj,1 ) and (q , q , hj,2 , kj,2 )

                                                  13
the low steady state and the high steady state, respectively.
   From Eq. (23), the potential two steady states of human capital, h         
                                                                     j,1 and hj,2 , satisfy

the following equation:

                                   1              1           1
                          j (h) := h  - (j )  h + (j )  j = 0.                        (25)

                                             1
                            ^ j :=  1-
Because j (h) is convex and h           ( ) 1- gives a minimum of  (h), there exist
                                         j                        j

                                                                 ^ j ) < 0. Formally, we
two distinct real number solutions of Eq. (25) if and only if j (h
have Lemma 2 below.

Lemma 2. There exist two distinct real number solutions of Eq. (25) if and only if

                                                   1
                              j -  1- (j ) 1- (1 -  ) < 0.                            (26)


Proof. The claim of Lemma 2 follows from the fact that j (h) is convex, j (0) > 0, and
   ^ ) < 0  Eq. (26).
j (h
   In what follows, we derive conditions that each technology actually has two steady
states (including the trivial one) in the dynamical system.


3.2.1    First technology: j = 1

Note that under Assumption 2, Eq. (25) with j = 1 has two solutions, h1,1 = 0 and



                                                       1
                                       h1,2 := ()
                                                  1- ,                                (27)


From Eq. (24), we have
                                                   1       
                                             1- (h ) 1- .
                                k1 ,2 := (A)      1,2                                 (28)

Proposition 2. Under Assumption 2, suppose that the following parameter condition
holds:
                                              1
                                          () 1- < 2 .                                 (29)


                                              14
Then, a non-trivial steady state, (q h , q k , h       
                                                1,2 , k1,2 ), associated with the first technology

exists in the dynamical system.

Proof. It suffices to show that h                                         
                                 1,2 < v1 . From Eq. (29), it holds that h1,2 < 2 < v1 ,

                    
and Eq. (28) gives k1 ,2 . Then, the desired conclusion holds.



3.2.2    Second technology: j = 2

We next turn to the case with j = 2 under which there are still two steady states
prevailed.

Proposition 3. Under Assumption 2, suppose that the following parameter conditions
hold:

                                  1                                 1
                            () 1- < 2 < (1 -  ) 1- (2 ) 1-                                    (30)
                                       1
                            (2 ) 1- < 3 .                                                     (31)


Then, two steady states, (q h , q k , h                   h k            
                                       2,1 , k2,1 ) and (q , q , h2,2 , k2,2 ), associated with the

second technology exist in the dynamical system.

Proof. See the Appendix.


3.2.3    Third technology: j = 3

When the highest technology is chosen (j = 3), it once again features two steady states.

Proposition 4. Under Assumption 2, suppose that the following parameter condition
holds:
                                   1                                 1
                          (2 ) 1- < 3 < (1 -  ) 1- (3 ) 1- .                                  (32)

Then, two steady states, (q h , q k , h                   h k            
                                       3,1 , k3,1 ) and (q , q , h3,2 , k3,2 ), associated with the

third technology exist in the dynamical system.

Proof. See the Appendix.

                                                15
3.2.4   Summary

Propositions 2-4 imply that six steady states (including a trivial one) exist in the dy-
namical system if the following inequalities hold:

                                      1                                        1

                           (2 ) 1- < 3 < (1 -  ) 1- (3 ) 1- ,                                         (34)


in which each technology yields two steady states.
   It is straightforward to extend the analysis to the case in which the number of
technologies is M with 1 = 1 < · · · < M and 0 = 1 < · · · < M . In this case, 2M
steady states appear if the following inequalities hold:

                                 1                                         1

                        (2 ) 1- < 3 < (1 -  ) 1- (3 ) 1-
                                              .
                                              .
                                              .
                                          1                                            1
                        (M -1 ) 1- < M < (1 -  ) 1- (M ) 1- .



3.3     Local dynamics

Suppose that the j th technology has two steady states: a lower one, (q h , q k , h       
                                                                                   j,1 , kj,1 ),

and a higher one, (q h , q k , h                            
                                j,2 , kj,2 ), where hj,1 < hj,2 . Linearization of the dynamical

system (21) with the j th technology around one of the steady states, (q h , q k , h       
                                                                                    j,s , kj,s )

(s = 1 or 2), implies

where Jn,qk (q k , h, k ) := Jn (q k , h, k )/q k and Jn,h (, h, k ) := Jn (, h, k )/h for n = 1, 2.
The eigenvalues of this dynamical system are given by 1 := 1/( (1 -  )), 2 := 1/( (1 -
 )), 3 := Bj (hj,s ), and 4 =  .

   In the dynamical system (21), whereas ht and kt are state variables that cannot jump
                                h      k
being predetermined variables, qt and qt can jump, which are determined by expecta-
tions. Due to the recursive property, the dynamical system can be fully characterized.
In particular, since 1 , 2 > 1 and 0 < 4 < 1, the property of the local dynamics
depends entirely on Bj (hj,s ).


Lemma 3. Under Assumption 2, suppose that inequalities (33) and (34) are satisfied.
Then, for any j , it holds that Bj (h                       
                                     j,1 ) > 1 and 0 < Bj (hj,2 ) < 1.


Proof. See the Appendix.
   It is seen from Lemma 3 that in the linearized dynamical system around the lower
steady state, (q h , q k , h       
                            j,1 , kj,1 ), the three eigenvalues are greater than one and the

absolute value of the one eigenvalue is less than one. Therefore, no equilibrium se-
          h k
quence, {qt , qt , ht , kt }, exists that converges to the lower steady state.          Also from
Lemma 3, one can see that in the linearized dynamical system around the higher steady
           , qt , h
         h k
state, (qt                
                   j,2 , kj,2 ), the two eigenvalues are greater than one and the absolute val-

ues of the two eigenvalues are less than one. Therefore, a unique equilibrium sequence,
  h k
{qt , qt , ht , kt }, exists around the higher steady state that converges to this steady state.
We summarize these results in Proposition 5 below.

Proposition 5. Under Assumption 2, suppose that inequalities (33) and (34) are sat-
isfied. Consider the j th technology. Then, the following hold:

                                             h k
   · There exists no equilibrium sequence, {qt , qt , ht , kt }, around the lower steady state,
      (q h , q k , h       
                    j,1 , kj,1 ), that converges to this steady state.


                                                   h k
   · There exists a unique equilibrium sequence, {qt , qt , ht , kt }, around the higher steady
      state, (q h , q k , h       
                           j,2 , kj,2 ), that converges to this steady state.


                                                  17
Proof. The discussion just before Proposition 5 proves the claims.



4      Global Analysis

In the previous section, we analyzed the local dynamic property. In the analysis, it is still
unclear whether an equilibrium sequence exists around the lower steady state. Moreover,
even if an equilibrium sequence exists around the lower steady state, the analysis of local
dynamics does not clarify where it goes. In this section, we address these questions.

                                                       h      k
In Eq. (21), the difference equations with respect to qt and qt , i.e., Eqs. (15) and (16),
are independent of ht and kt , and they are solvable analytically. Solving Eqs. (15) and
(16) forward, we obtain


                 k                                                           u-1
                qt = [ (1 -  )]u qt
                                  k
                                    +u +  +  [ (1 -  )] + · · · +  [ (1 -  )]           (36)


                 h                                                           u-1
                qt = [ (1 -  )]u qt
                                  h
                                    +u +  +  [ (1 -  )] + · · · +  [ (1 -  )]    .      (37)

It follows from the transversality condition, limu  u qt
                                                       k           u h
                                                         +u = limu  qt+u = 0, that

limu [ (1 -  )]u qt
                  k                     u h
                    +u = limu [ (1 -  )] qt+u = 0. Therefore, Eqs. (36) and (37) yield

 k                        h
qt = /(1 -  (1 -  )) and qt = /(1 -  (1 -  )), respectively, which implies that
                               k h                                                k h
the equilibrium sequences of {qt , qt } are uniquely determined, being equal to {qt , qt } =
{q k , q h }.
    Suppose that v1 < v2 with Assumption 2. Then, from Proposition 1, Eqs. (17) and
(18) become
                       
                        ht-1 = B1 (ht-1 )          if 0  ht-1 < v1
                       
                  ht =  2 (ht-1 - 2 ) = B2 (ht-1 ) if v1  ht-1 < v2                     (38)
                       
                        3 (ht-1 - 3 ) = B3 (ht-1 ) if v2  ht-1

4.2    Take-off and flying geese
                                                                        ¯ t-1 )/y
If the productivity of human capital formation for each technology, Bm (h       ¯t , is
high, the economy does not fall in the low- or middle-income traps. Proposition 6 below
provides a condition that the economy does not fall in the low- or middle-income traps
and converges to the high steady state of the third technology even if the initial human
capital is very low.




Proposition 6. Suppose that Assumption 2 holds. Then, there exist only two steady
                                          20
states in the dynamical system, which are a trivial one and the high steady state of the
third technology, if the following parameter condition holds:

                                        1
                                () 1- > max{1 , 2 },                               (40)

                       i :=     1   1           1        1            
                                                                         .

                                               (i+1 - i ) 1-

Proof. See the Appendix.
Figure 3 provides the phase diagram of Eq. (38) when inequality (40) holds under
Assumption 2.
   The outcome of Proposition 6 can be extended to the case in which the number
of technologies is M . Under Assumption 2, there exist two steady states: one is a
trivial one and the other is the high steady state of the M th technology if and only
        1
if () 1- > max{1 , . . . , M -1 }. When this inequality holds, the economy develops
from a low human capital state to a high human capital state proceeding along the M
technologies.
   By examining this inequality, one can see that if either changes in i or changes in
i becomes negligible (but not both), then i tends to be larger and the flying geese
paradigm is less likely to arise. The two polar cases are actually different. When the
barrier to human capital technology upgrading is essentially unchanged, the development
pattern exhibits immediate upgrading to the highest technology M as soon as the level
of human capital exceeds the barrier. On the contrary, when the productivity gain from
upgrading is nil, the economy is trapped in the lowest technology.


4.3     Middle income trap
                                                                                   1
What if a certain j at an intermediate technology j breaks the inequality () 1- >
max{1 , . . . , M -1 } stated in the previous subsection? In this case, the economy can

                                                    21
fall into a trap with the j th technology. More precisely, if there is a j such that
            1
j > () 1- > max{1 , . . . , j -1 , j +1 , . . . , M -1 } and if vj -1 < vj < vj +1 , then the
economy converges to the high steady state of the j th technology if the economy starts
with low human capital. This phenomenon is depicted in Figure 4.
   While the trivial equilibrium is frequently referred to as the low income trap, the
equilibrium at the j th technology can be called a middle income trap. In general,
there can be more than one technology at which a middle income country may be
trapped. To establish this main result, define the set of all globally available technologies
as T := {1, · · · , M } and the set of "interior" technologies as I := {2, · · · , M - 1}.
Generically, it is conveniently summarized below.

Proposition 7. Suppose that Assumption 2 holds. Then, there can exist nontrivial
steady states in the dynamical system, featuring middle income trap at various technolo-
gies in J  I if the following parameter conditions holds:

                                                   1
                            min{j } > () 1- > max {m },                                 (41)
                            j J                           mT J



                                     vi-1 < vi for all i  I.                            (42)

Proof. See the Appendix.
   We next turn to characterizing under what circumstances a middle income trap is
more likely to arise. From the first inequality of (41), j of the j th technology in J
satisfies the following inequality:

                                                           1
                                      1            1      1-
                                     j +1 j +1 - j j
                                                   
                                                                                1
                 j :=      1     1        1    1                      
                                                                          > () 1- .     (43)
                          1-    1-
                        j      j +1 j +1 - j
                                               
                                                       (j +1 - j )   1-




It is straightforward to show that inequality (42) holds for i = j, j + 1 if

                                      1                    1
                                  j (j +1 - j ) > j-1 j +1                              (44)


                                               22

                                  1                    1
                                j+1 (j +2 - j +1 ) > j j +2 .                             (45)

   Let gj = j +1 /j and gj = j +1 /j capture, respectively, the productivity gap and
the barrier gap between the j +1th and the j th technologies under inequalities (44) and
(45). Then, inequality (43) reduces to

                                              1
                               (j )1- (gj )  gj - 1
                                              1-               > .                        (46)
                                       1                    
                           j gj (gj ) - 1
                                                   gj - 1


It is straightforward to show that the left-hand side of this inequality is strictly decreasing
in j and strictly increasing in j . Thus, other things being equal, a middle income trap
of the j th technology for 1 < j < M is likely to arise if the productivity of the j th
technology is not too large and the scale barrier of the j th technology is sufficiently
high.
   While we have established a sufficient condition given by (41) and (42) for broadly
defined middle income trap to arise, one may inquire whether our model may support
a more restricted middle income trap, such as to satisfy the conditions outlined by
Eichengreen, Park and Shin (2013). We will elaborate on this issue using Figure 5.
First of all, our technology choice allows for a sustained flying geese paradigm that may
even feature jumps from, for example, the ith technology to the j th technology (j >
i+1). Continual technology upgrading in conjunction with some technology leap frogging
(jumps) would ensure that the country under consideration experiences fast growth,
thus satisfying the growth condition (say, at least 3.5% annually). However, when the
conditions stated by (41) and (42) hold at the j th technology, a country is stuck therein.
When barriers to the next generations of technologies are high and the corresponding
productivity gaps are big, there could be several generations of technologies not worth
adopting (such as Bj , j < j , j ). As a result, the country may stay at the j th technology
for years before pulling out (to the j +1th technology), thus causing relatively low growth
(say, at least 2% lower than the pre-trap era). Of course, given appropriate values of

                                              24
Bj and the country's factor endowments (k, h) prevailing, it is not difficult to satisfy the
middle income condition (say, at least US$10,000 in 2005 constant PPP prices). That
is, our model may support more narrowly defined middle income trap.
    Finally, we note that it is possible for a country to experience multiple traps at
different points of time and that technology downgrading may arise when TFP falls and
physical capital decumulates. We shall illustrate all such possibilities in the quantitative
analysis to which we now turn.



5     Generalization and Applications

Before conducting quantitative analysis, we would like to note that adequate general-
ization is needed in order to apply the bare-bone theoretical model to the real world.
In this section, we will discuss how to generalize the setup, modifying the conditions for
flying geese and middle income trap paradigms and then perform quantitative analysis.


5.1    Modified conditions for flying geese and middle income

       trap

Whereas it has been assumed that the population of labor force L is equal to one in the
theoretical analysis, the growth in labor force is observed in the actual data. Introducing
it into the model, we generically obtain the law of motion of human/knowledge capital
when the j th technology is adopted as follows:

                              j
                       ht =        (ht-1 - j ) if vj -1  ht-1 < vj ,                   (47)
                              nt+1

where nt+1 := Lt+1 /Lt . The derivation of Eq. (47) is demonstrated in the Appendix.
    If Assumption 2 is actually satisfied and there is no population growth of workers,
the condition for trap at the j th technology is given by Eqs. (41) and (42) with J1 = {j }.
However, the calibrated pairs of  and  do not necessarily satisfy Assumption 2. There

                                             25
are various patterns of the calibrated  and  that lead a country to traps. Technically
speaking, if the condition for flying geese growth does not hold in switching technologies,
it is highly likely that a country falls in a trap. We consider this in the following.
   Suppose that a country switches technologies from technology j to technology j + 1
at period T + 1. In this case, from Eq. (47), the transitional dynamics of ht from T to
T + 2 is given by             
                               hT = j (hT -1 - j )
                              
                                     nT +1
                                                                                         (48)
                               hT +1 = j+1 (hT - j +1 ) .
                              
                                         nT +2


To investigate the flying-geese condition, we define functions such that fj (x) := (j /nT +1 )(x-
j ) and fj +1 (x) := (j +1 /nT +2 )(x - j +1 ) , which are the right-hand sides of (48).
We also define z that denotes a potential intersection of the transition equations in (48)
such that fj (z ) = fj +1 (z ) or equivalently

                                              1                          1
                                      j +1                     j         
                                      nT +2
                                                  j +1 -     nT +1
                                                                             j
                              z :=                 1                 1           .       (49)
                                          j +1                 j     
                                          nT +2
                                                        -   nT +1



Furthermore, we define zj and zj +1 such that fj (zj ) = fj +1 (zj +1 ) = 1 or equivalently

                                                                    1
                                                       j           1-
                                     zj := j +                                           (50)
                                                       nT +1

and
                                                                      1
                                                        j +1         1-
                               zj +1 := j +1 +                               .           (51)
                                                        nT +2

The flying-geese condition is categorized into three patterns as illustrated in Figure 6. In
the first case, whereas it holds that j +1 > j as in Assumption 2, it may not necessarily
hold that j +1 > j . In the second (the third case), it holds (may hold) that j +1 < j ,
which contradicts Assumption 2.




                                                   26
First case

It follows from Figure 6 that the parameter condition for the first case is given by
j < j +1 < z and fj (z ) > z . From Eq. (49), these inequalities can be transformed into


 j < j +1
 
  j +1

       > nT j
            +1
         1                       1                                                        1               1   1-
   j +1                  j                      j           j +1                  j +1             j      
                                                                              
           j +1 -                    j <                            (j +1 - j )               -                    .
 nT   +2               nT +1                   nT +1        nT +2                 nT +2           nT +1

                                                                                                          (52)


Second case

As illustrated in Figure 6, the second flying-geese condition is given by j +1 < j < z ,
fj (z ) < z , and fj +1 (zj +1 ) > zj +1 . Eqs. (49)-(51) rewrite these inequalities as follows:


 j +1 < j
 j +1     
       < nT j
 nT +2      +1
            1                1                                                            1               1   1-
    j           j +1                            j           j +1                   j              j +1    

  nT +1
         j - n T  +2
                                 j +1 >        nT +1        nT +2
                                                                    (j - j +1 )   nT +1
                                                                                              -   nT +2
                                       1
          
                                      1-
                             j +1
 j +1 <  1- (1 -  )
                                           .
                             nT +2
                                                                                                          (53)


Third case

We obtain the necessary condition for the third case such that (i) j +1 < j and z < j ,
which is consistent with fj +1 (x)'s solid line in Figure 6, or (ii) j +1 > j and z > j ,
which is consistent with fj +1 (x)'s dotted line, ignoring the case in which j +1 = j . The
conditions (i) and (ii) are unified as (j +1 - j )(z - j ) > 0. In addition to this condition,
z < zj , and zj +1 < f (zj +1 ) are essential for the third case. Eqs. (49)-(51) rewrite these




                                                       27

5.1.1      Summary

Thus, it is said that a country experiences the flying geese if and only if inequalities
(52), (53), or (54) hold. If inequalities (52), (53), and (54) all fail to hold and if human
capital technology fails to advance ( stagnating and/or  rising too much relative to
the technology prevailed) and/or the TFP is stalled (the TFP falling), it is said that
a country falls in a middle income trap.4 Again, the terminology of middle income is
used more generally for any level of development before reaching a perpetually growing
balanced growth path (that is, for all m < M ).
  4
      We will relegate the detailed criteria for a middle income trap to section 5.3.2.




                                                        28
5.2    Quantitative analysis

To begin, we illustrate the basis of our country selection. First, we consider four groups
based on development patterns: (i) advanced countries, (ii) fast growing economies, (iii)
emerging economies with decent development speed and (iv) development laggards with
frequent growth slowdowns despite earlier development. Second, countries chosen are
with long time series starting no later than early 1960s. Third, all countries are qualified
as middle-low, middle-high or high income countries by mid-1980s (the middle year of
our sample). Finally, we try to balance between continents, namely, Asia, Europe, North
America and South America. The representative 14 countries from the four groups are
as follows (see the Appendix for a summary of key average growth rates of each country):


(i) advanced countries: the U.S., the U.K., Germany, and Japan, with relatively stable
      growth ranging from 1.7% per year (the U.S.) to 3.6% (Japan);

(ii) fast growing economies: Hong Kong, S. Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, the so-called
      Asian Tigers, all growing at more than double of the speed of the U.S., ranging
      from 3.6% (Singapore) to 4.9% (Taiwan);

(iii) emerging growing economies: China, Greece, and Malaysia, all growing faster than
      3.1% but slower than fast growing economies;

(iv) development laggards: Argentina, Mexico, and Philippines, featuring chopped
      growth paths with coefficient of variation all exceeding one and at slower speed
      than emerging growing economies.


As also observed by Wang, Wong and Yip (2018), most countries have decent physical
capital growth but sluggish year-of-schooling-based human capital growth. Moreover,
regarding the "standard" TFP, while advanced and fast growing countries have experi-
enced decent TFP growth no lower than 1.1% annually, the TFP growth in the three
development laggards have been mediocre at rates below 0.87%.


                                            29
      To apply the theoretical model to the real world by means of calibration, we allow the
TFP, A, in Eq. (2) to be time-variant such that yt = At h                  ~         
                                                         t-1 kt-1 . Define At := At ht-1 .

                                           ~t kt
Then, the production function becomes yt = A   
                                                 -1 . Once we obtain the data for yt and

                        ~t = yt /kt
kt-1 with  being fixed, A                              5
                                    -1 can be computed. As noted from the formation

   ~t , it is composed of the TFP, At , and human/knowledge capital, ht-1 . We assume
of A
                                                                                  1/
that the quality of institution affects the TFP in our analysis. Then, At              is assumed
                                                                            1/
to be a function of the institutional quality index, dt , such that At           = exp(dt ). As
explained in the next section, the data for the institutional quality index are quoted
from the Economic Freedom of the World 2019. Additionally, human/knowledge capital
                                                                     ^ t-1 , such that
is assumed to be a function of the human capital (per capita) index, h
         ^ t-1 ), the data of which are quoted form the Penn World Table, version 9.0
ht-1 =  (h
                                                                ~t := At h
(PWT9.0), again as explained in the next section.6 Accordingly, A         t-1 can be

rewritten as
                                         1
                                       ~t = 
                                    ln A       ^ t-1 ) + dt ,
                                            ~ (h                                             (55)

where    ^ t-1 ) = ln  (h
      ~ (h              ^ t-1 ). We estimate Eq. (55) with  =  =  = 1/3 (Mankiw,

Romer and Weil 1992) by a semi-parametric method.


5.2.1     Data

We draw all the data from PWT9.0 (Feenstra et al. 2015), except the institutional
quality index. We assemble the annual data of the 14 countries over the period 1950­
2014 although starting year varies a bit based on data availability. To obtain the per
worker output, y , and the per worker physical capital, k , we use the real GDP at constant
2011 national prices (rgdpna), the capital stock at constant 2011 national prices (rkna),
                                                              ~t = yt /kt
and the number of persons engaged (emp) in PWT9.0. We compute A         
                                                                          -1 from

                                                               ^ , we use the human
the per worker output and the per worker physical capital. For h
capital index, based on years of schooling and returns to education (hc) in PWT9.0. To
  5
    One notes that A~t is the TFP in the "standard" growth accounting.
  6
    We assume that these functional forms are stationary throughout the periods to be analyzed and
no other time-variant endogenous variables affect these relationships.
                                               30
eliminate short-run movements, we take three-year moving average of each variable.
       The data on the index of institutional quality, d, are based on the Economic Freedom
of the World 2019 (Gwartney et al. 2019). Specifically, we use the index of the Economic
Freedom of the World (EFW), which is a comprehensive measure of the consistency of
institutions and policies with economic freedom in a country. The EFW index consists
of five dimensions: (i) Size of Government, (ii) Legal System and Property Rights, (iii)
Sound Money, (iv) Freedom to Trade Internationally, and (v) Regulation of credit, labor
and business. The index data are available in five-year intervals from 1950 to 2000 and
in annual frequency from 2000 to 2017.7
       Table 2 shows  estimated from Eq. (55) with a semi-parametric method for each
country. In all cases,  is positive and significant at the conventional significance level,
which means that the improvement of institutional quality enhances the TFP. Once 
is estimated, At = exp(dt ) is obtained, and accordingly, we have human/knowledge
                          ~t /exp(dt )]1/ , which is used for the calibration of human
capital such that ht-1 = [A
capital technology parameters.


5.2.2      Calibrating human capital technology parameters

Suppose that the j th technology is adopted from period t to period t + 1. Then, we can
update Eq. (47) by one period and obtain

                                              j
                                     ht+1 =        (ht - j ) .                                   (56)
                                              nt+2

       It is standard in growth models to set  = 0.95. Regarding  , we consider three
plausible values:   {0.4, 0.5, 0.6}, and choose one to yield best fit to actual output.
For a given value of  , we apply human/knowledge capital obtained in the previous
subsection to Eqs. (47) and (56) to calibrate j and j . Accordingly, we have two
equations with respect to two unknowns: j and j . However, we note that, when
   7
     The index from 1950 to 1965 does not reflect the regulation dimension. See Gwartney et al. (2019)
for the detail.

computing j by applying human/knowledge capital, one must set its minimum at 0.
Additionally, if the computed value of j becomes such that ht-1 -j  0 when computing
j , we set j = j -1 , i.e., no upgrading. More concretely, the calibration procedure is as
follows:


   · By using Eqs. (47) and (56) and taking into account j 's minimum setting, we
      compute
                                        1        1               1       1+

                          ~j = max           1       1       1       1        ,0 .   (57)

   · If ht-1 - ~j > 0, we set j = ~j and compute j by using Eq. (47) as follows:

                                              nt+1 ht
                                     j =                   .                         (58)
                                             (ht-1 -  ~j )


   · If ht-1 - ~j  0, we set j = j -1 and compute j by using Eq. (47) and taking
      into account j 's minimum setting as follows:

                                                                     1
                                                         nt+1 ht     
                             j = max ht-1 -                              ,0 .        (59)

   Two remarks are in order. First, although in calibrating the values of {j , j }, we
have incorporated the information from the TFP and the formation of human capital,
we have not accounted from any sources of slowdown due to capital or trade barriers.
As a result, we, on the one hand, may miss some capital or trade-led traps and, on
the other, may find that in some of our human capital-based traps, output may not
grow slowly. Second, in practice, outputs fluctuate, partly driven by short-run shocks
which are unrelated to the consideration of middle income traps. Thus, some smoothing
strategies must be adopted. To do so, as explained in the previous section, we first
take three-year moving average of each of time series to remove uninteresting short-
run movements. We then compute the values of {j , j } in non-overlapped five-year
intervals (for brevity, called episodes) for each of the 14 economies, assuming that an

                                             33
economy employs a certain technology for each five-year interval. Because the data of
human/knowledge capital for three sequential years are necessary to compute one set
of {j , j }, we can have three sets of {j , j } for each non-overlapped five-year episode.
Hence, we choose a best fit to the time series of human/knowledge capital among the
three sets of {j , j } for each five-year episode by solving the following minimization
problem:
                                            4
                                                              j
                     
                    j , j   = arg min            ht +s+1 -           (ht +s - j ) ,
                                 {j ,j }
                                           s=0
                                                             nt +s+2

where t is a starting year of a certain episode.


5.2.3     Fitness

                                
From Eq. (47) and yt = At ht-1 kt-1 , it follows that



                                                                        
        ln yt =  ln( ) +  ln kt-1 -  ln nt + ln At +  ln j +  ln(ht-2 - j ).          (60)


                                  
By using calibrated A, h, j , and j and actual k and n, the fitted value of the right-hand
side of Eq. (60) can be obtained. Table 3 provides the coefficients of determination for
the cases of  = 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6. As previously explained, the best fit one is chosen
for the following analysis (marked in boldface in Table 3). As noted from the table, all
the coefficients of determination except that of Argentina are greater than 0.99, whereas
that of Argentina is still high at 0.969. Thus, the fitness of the simulated time series of
ln y is viewed good. Figures 7-10 plot the time series of the fitted and actual values of
ln y for the 14 countries when a best fit  is given in each country.


5.2.4     Flying or trapped: a unified quantitative framework

Our primary task is to identify potential traps and prolong periods of flying geese in
the first three categories: advanced countries, fast growing economies, and emerging
growing economies. For the cases of traps, we will also pin down the drivers of traps,
possibly due to upgrading technology slowdown, technology barriers rising, or TFP

slowdown. This enables us to compare our findings with those in Eichengreen, Park and
Shin (2013) where traps are identified by empirical structural breaks and with those in
Wang, Wong and Yip (2018) where traps are caused by factor endowment reversal under
mismatch in technology assimilation. Of course, due to different samples of countries,
such comparison would be restricted to common samples only. Tables 4-7 summarize our
quantitative results of advanced countries, fast growing economies, emerging growing
economies, and development laggards, respectively. If either one of inequalities (52),
(53), or (54) is satisfied in a period, we assign "1" to that period and judge that the
country experiences flying (denoted by      ). If inequalities (52), (53), and (54) all fail

                                       =
and if large technology downgrading with  falling by more than 5%, large increases
in barriers with  rising by more than 5%, and/or TFP slowdowns with negative TFP
growth are observed, then "-1" is assigned and we diagnose that the country falls in a
middle income trap (denoted by       ). Otherwise, "0" is assigned, which means that the
                                 =




country may not experience flying but not necessarily trapped (denoted by ).
   It is clearly seen in Tables 4 and 5 that most of the advanced countries and fast
growing economies have experienced prolonged periods of flying geese paradigm with
lower frequencies in traps with an exception of Japan. In these two groups of countries,
Eichengreen, Park and Shin (2013) identify several middle income traps in the cases of
Hong Kong in 1993, Japan in 1974, Korea in 1989, Singapore in 1980, Taiwan in 1995,
and U.K. in 1988 and 2002. Wang, Wong and Yip (2018) find traps in the cases of Hong
Kong in 1984 and Taiwan in 1999. Different from their works, we do not restrict the
sample to fall into the World Bank ranges of middle income group. By comparison, we
learn that:


   · Hong Kong: flying in early 1980s and early 1990s (inconsistent with Eichengreen
     et al. and Wang et al.), but trapped in late 1990s and early 2000s around the
     Asian financial crises;

   · Japan: trapped in early 1970s (consistent with Eichengreen et al.), and most

                                           38
     certainly trapped in early 1980s during the second oil crisis;

   · Korea: trapped in early 1990s (not far from 1989 identified by Eichengreen et al.)
     and early 2000s around the Asian financial crises;

   · Singapore: trapped in early 1980s (consistent with Eichengreen et al.), and cer-
     tainly trapped in early 2000s around the Asian financial crises;

   · Taiwan: flying in 1990s (inconsistent with Eichengreen et al. and Wang et al.),
     but trapped in late 2000s during the Great Recession (which is beyond the sample
     period used by Eichengreen et al.);

   · U.K.: trapped in late 1980s (consistent with Eichengreen et al.) and late 2000s
     during the Great Recession (again, which is beyond the sample period used by
     Eichengreen et al.).


   Turning to the third group where Greece is the only sample in common, both Eichen-
green et al. and Wang et al. identify a single trap in 1972, while traps from late 1970s
to late 1980s are observed in our case. Relative to the first two groups, more traps are
identified in the third group. For example, there are earlier traps in China through 1960s
and in late 1970s when its human capital upgrading was stalled by the Great Leap For-
ward policy and the Cultural Revolution. Finally, moving to the last group with Mexico
as the only common sample, five traps are identified in our paper. Although a trap in
1981 is identified by Eichengreen et al., a trap in late 1980s is found in our paper. We
find four traps in Argentina and eight traps in Philippines.
   To gain further insight, we summarize the appearance of flying, inconclusive and
trapped episodes in each country in Table 8. We find that advanced and fast growing
economies experienced flying paradigm more than 70% of the time while being trapped
only in 25% of these episodes. On the contrary, although development laggards ex-
perienced 44% flying geese but suffered 50% of the time in trapped paradigm. For
illustrative purposes, let us construct a development score by assigning 1 to each of the

flying episodes, 0 to inconclusive and -1 to trapped as indicated in Table 8. We can
thus compute the average development scores for each country and the group average:
by definition, the score must fall between -1 and 1. Our results suggest that advanced
and fast growing economies have a decent average score greater than 0.477 whereas
development laggards feature an average score of -0.059.
   One may then inquire what are the main reasons behind the above results. In
particular, in Table 9, we summarize whether (i) large technology downgrading with
 falling by more than 5%, (ii) large increase in barriers with  rising by more than
5%, or (iii) TFP slowdowns with negative TFP growth. These are significant downward
deviations from their respective trends in the 14-country panel.
   Overall, the results suggest that large drops in human capital technology efficacy
are overwhelmingly the primary force for a country to fall into a middle income trap.
Large increases in barriers to human capital accumulation are also important, playing a
bigger role in emerging growing countries. In all the countries, TFP slowdowns are only
occasionally important to lead to traps. By looking into more details, we gain further
insights below:


   · In advanced countries, slowdown in TFP plays a small role relative to large tech-
     nology downgrading in the occasional traps identified.

   · In fast growing economies, large drops in human capital technology efficacy are
     important for their explaining their occasional traps.

   · In emerging growing economies, all three factors play nonnegligible roles.

   · In all three development laggards, all three factors also play nonnegligible roles.
     While their roles are comparable in the cases of Argentina and Philippines, slow-
     down in TFP plays a lesser role in the case of Mexico.

5.2.5     Growth accounting

To this end, we conduct growth accounting analysis to examine the long-run quantitative
importance of human capital technology and barriers played in economic growth. Taking
time-difference of Eq. (60) yields


                                                                                      
          ln yt =      ln kt-1 -     ln nt +    ln At +      ln j +         ln ht-2 - j ,


which can be rewritten as

                                                                                   
                     ln kt-1     ln nt         ln At       ln j          ln ht-2 - j
          1=                 -         +             +           +                   .        (61)
                      ln yt      ln yt         ln yt       ln yt             ln yt

This is our growth accounting basis: the five components represent growth effects of
capital accumulation, employment growth, TFP advancement, human capital technol-
ogy upgrading, and human capital barrier reduction (conditional on human capital ac-
cumulation). All logged differences can be measured by growth rates of the variables.
In our growth accounting, we consider the growth rate for thirty years to investigate a
relatively longer structural growth effect of each variable. One notes from Eq. (61) that
each term in the right-hand side measures a percentage contribution of each variable
corresponding to a percentage change in yt . Table 10 presents the growth accounting
results of the two thirty-year episodes.8
      In advanced countries, human/knowledge capital technology and human/knowledge
capital barriers are overwhelmingly more important drivers than physical capital accu-
mulation (and other variables) with an exception of Japan. The second thirty years in
Japan represent an unusual case in which human/knowledge capital technology and hu-
man/knowledge capital barriers have negative contributions to economic growth whereas
the contribution of physical capital accumulation exceeds 100%. This outcome might
reflect the stagnation in the Japanese economy after the era of high economic growth.

     In conducting the growth accounting with Eq. (61), we have an error term as seen in the last
column of Table 10. In Table 10, we choose ones that have minimum errors among the initial and last
five sets of the thirty-year growth accounting.

As seen in Figure 7, Japan experiences a similar growth process to those of the other
three advanced countries; however, the main drivers for growth in Japan appear quite
different from those of the other three countries. On average in advanced countries, hu-
man capital technology upgrading and human capital barrier reduction account for 51%
of economic growth during the first thirty-year window and for 38% during the second.
   In the fast growing economies except Korea, human/knowledge capital technology
and human/knowledge capital barriers are more important drivers than other variables,
as in advanced countries. Whereas Korea experiences the high rate of growth in both
periods, physical capital accumulation is the main driver of growth although its growth
process is similar to the other three fast growing economies (see in Figure 8). Human
capital technology upgrading and human capital barrier reduction, on average in the fast
growing economies, contribute to 55% and 45%, respectively, over the two thirty-year
windows.
   Regarding emerging growing economies, human/knowledge capital technology and
human/knowledge capital barriers continue to play relatively important roles in the
second thirty-year window in China, and are more important roles than physical capital
(and other variables) in the first thirty-year window in Greece and in both thirty-year
windows in Malaysia. Over the two thirty-year windows, on average, human capital
technology upgrading and human capital barrier reduction account for 42% and 37%,
respectively, of economic growth.
   Among the development laggards, in the first thiry-year window, human/knowledge
capital technology and human/knowledge capital barriers are more important drivers
than other variables in Mexico and remain quite important in the other two countries
contributing to more than 40% of their economic growth. Over the second thiry-year
window when growth rates in Argentina and Mexico turn out to be too close to zero,
growth accounting results in large percentage contributions. By excluding those im-
precise accounting estimates, human capital technology upgrading and human capital
barrier reduction on average contribute to 52% and 41% of economic growth over the

                                          47
two thirty-year windows.
    On the whole, in more than half of the episodes (15 out of 28 thirty-year episodes
in 14 countries), human capital technology upgrading and human capital barrier reduc-
tion account for more than half of economic growth. By eliminating the two imprecise
accounting estimates during the second episode, human capital technology upgrading
and human capital barrier reduction contribute to 51% and 37% of economic growth,
averaging over the remaining 26 episodes. In short, an interesting message we have
learned from the growth accounting results is that omitting the roles played by human
capital technology upgrading and human capital barrier reduction could lead to biased
outcomes by a noticeable margin.



6     Concluding Remarks

We have constructed a simple growth model with endogenous technology choice in hu-
man/knowledge capital accumulation in which we are able to establish a rich array of
equilibrium development paradigms, including poverty trap, middle income trap and fly-
ing geese growth. We have identified the productivity of the prevailing technology, the
productivity jump of technology upgrading and the hike in technology scale barrier as
the key drivers for different paradigms to arise in equilibrium. Different combination of
these factors in conjunction of the TFP help understand different development patterns
facing different countries.
    Along these lines, an interesting avenue of future research is to introduce limitation to
knowledge formation. This would allow for growing over cycles rooted on human capital.
As such, it would complement the R&D based theory of growth and cycles pioneered
by Matsuyama (1999) and Jovanovic (2009). Another interesting line of extension is to
incorporate trade into the current framework to see how the interactions between trade
and global talent flows may result in different development patterns, particularly for
those economies with high trade dependence. Finally, it is also interesting to consider

                                             48
multiple dimensions of technology choice with physical and human capital upgrading and
barriers. In so doing, one may separate different sources of traps into physical capital
and human capital based. Of course, to accomplish any of these would require further
simplification of the basic structure and more restrictive assumptions. These are beyond
the scope of the present paper and left for future research.

Appendix

In the Appendix, we provide proofs of various Lemmas and Propositions.


Proof of Lemma 1

To prove the first claim, define 1 (h) := B1 (h) - B2 (h) for h  2 . Then, we have


                               1 (h) = h - 2 (h - 2 )                              (A.1)


and
                            (h) =  [h-1 - 2 (h - 2 )-1 ].                          (A.2)

Since 1 (h) <  [(h - 2 )-1 - 2 (h - 2 )-1 ] < 0 under Assumption 2, 1 (h) is a decreas-
ing function for h  2 . Additionally, it follows that 1 (2 ) > 0 and limh 1 (h) =
limh h (1 - 2 (1 - 2 /h) ) = -. Therefore, the first claim of Lemma 1 holds. To
prove the second claim, define 2 (h) := B2 (h) - B3 (h) for h  3 . Then, we have


                           2 (h) = 2 (h - 2 ) - 3 (h - 3 )                         (A.3)


and
                       2 (h) = 2  (h - 2 )-1 - 3  (h - 3 )-1 .                     (A.4)

Since 2 (h) <  [2 (h-3 )-1 -3 (h-3 )-1 ] < 0 under Assumption 2, 2 (h) is a decreas-
ing function for h  3 . Additionally, it follows that 2 (3 ) > 0 and limh 2 (h) =
limh 2 (h - 2 ) [1 - (3 /2 )[(h - 3 )/(h - 2 )] ] = -.Therefore, the second claim
of Lemma 1 holds.


Proof of Proposition 1

From Lemma 1, it follows that B3 (ht-1 ) > B2 (ht-1 ) if ht-1 > v2 . Thus, if ht-1 > v2 ,
the third technology is preferred to the second technology. From Lemma 1, it follows

                                           51
that B2 (ht-1 ) > B3 (ht-1 ) if 3  ht-1 < v2 . Moreover, if 2  ht-1 < 3 , the third
technology is not applicable. Thus, if 2  ht-1 < v2 , the second technology is preferred
to the third technology. Likewise, from Lemma 1, it follows that B2 (ht-1 ) > B1 (ht-1 ) if
ht-1 > v1 . Thus, if ht-1 > v1 , the second technology is preferred to the first technology.
From Lemma 1, it follows that B1 (ht-1 ) > B2 (ht-1 ) if 2  ht-1 < v1 . Moreover, if
0  ht-1 < 2 , the second technology is not applicable. Thus, if 0  ht-1 < v1 , the first
technology is preferred to the second technology. Then, we have a desired conclusion.




Proof of Proposition 3
                                       
From the convexity of 2 (h) and since k2 ,s is obtained from Eq. (24), it suffices to show

the following three claims: Claim 1 : Eq. (25) with j = 2 has two distinct real number
                          ^ 2 < v2 , and Claim 3 : 2 (v1 ) > 0 and 2 (v2 ) > 0.
solutions, Claim 2 : v1 < h


Claim 1

The second inequality of (30) is equivalent to inequality (26) with j = 2. From Lemma
2, Claim 1 is proven.


Claim 2

Under Assumption 2, it follows from inequalities (30) that 2 > 1/  , or equivalently,

                                                1

                                                          1
                                            1       <       .                         (B.1)

                                                         1-


From inequality (B.1) and the second inequality of (30), we obtain

                                       1
                                  2

                                                                ^ 2.
                           v1 =    1            <  1- (2 ) 1- = h                     (B.2)

                                                    52
Under Assumption 2, inequality (31) yields

                                                                      1           1

                                                                           2

Claim 2 is proven by inequalities (B.2) and (B.3).


Claim 3
                                       1
From Eq. (19), it holds that v1 = 2
                                  
                                    (v1 - 2 ). Therefore, it follows that

                                                     1-           1
                                2 (v1 ) = v1 (v1  - ()  ).                                     (B.4)


Since 2 < v1 , from Eq. (B.4) and the first inequality of (30), we obtain

                                  1-             1            1-              1
                  2 (v1 ) = v1 (v1  - ()  ) > v1 (2  - ()  ) > 0.                              (B.5)


From Claim 1, it follows that
                                               ^ 2 ) < 0.
                                            2 (h                                               (B.6)

                              ^ 2 < 3 and
From inequality (31), we have h

                                       1-                 1               1
                    2 (3 ) := 3 (3  - (2 )  ) + (2 )  2 > 0.                                   (B.7)


From inequalities (B.6), (B.7), and 3 < v2 with the convexity of 2 (h), it holds that


                                            2 (v2 ) > 0.                                       (B.8)


Claim 3 is proven by inequalities (B.5) and (B.8).




                                                 53
Proof of Proposition 4
                                       
From the convexity of 3 (h) and since k3 ,s is obtained from Eq. (24), it suffices show

the following three claims: Claim 1 : Eq. (25) with j = 3 has two distinct real number
                          ^ 3 , and Claim 3 : 3 (v2 ) > 0.
solutions, Claim 2 : v2 < h


Claim 1

The second inequality of (32) is equivalent to inequality (26) with j = 3. From Lemma
2, Claim 1 is proven.


Claim 2
                                                                                    1           1
Under Assumption 2, it follows from inequalities (32) that 2
                                                           
                                                             /3
                                                              
                                                                <  , or equivalently,

                                                  1
                                                  3
                                                  
                                                                          1
                                              1             1    <          .                           (C.1)
                                              3 - 2
                                                                         1-


From inequality (C.1) and the second inequality of (32), we obtain

                          1               1                 1

which is Claim 2.


Claim 3
                                      1                              1
From Eq. (20), it holds that 2
                             
                               (v2 - 2 ) = 3
                                           
                                             (v2 - 3 ). Therefore, it follows that

                                               1-                         1                 1

Since 3 < v2 , from Eq. (C.3) and the first inequality of (32), we obtain

Proof of Lemma 3

Eq. (23) rewrites Bj (hj,s ) as

                               1
Since h      ^     1- ( ) 1- < h , the use of Eq. (D.1) yields

Inequalities (D.2) and (D.3) are desired conclusions.


Proof of Proposition 6

From Eq. (23) and the definitions of v1 and v2 , it suffices to show that vi < i+1 (vi -
                                                                           1
i+1 ) for i = 1, 2. vi < i+1 (vi - i+1 ) is equivalent to ( ) 1- > i . From the last
inequality, we obtain the desired conclusion.


Proof of Proposition 7

For any j  J , from the first inequality of (41), it follows that Bj (vj ) < vj . Addition-
ally, from the second inequality of (41), it follows that v1 < B1 (v1 ). By technology
choice, the equation for the transitional dynamics with respect to ht (i.e., Eq. (38) ex-
tended to the case of M technologies) is continuous. Therefore, there can be more than
one steady state with multiple technologies in J that feature middle income trap.

Derivation of Eq. (47)

When the growth in labor force is introduced into the model, Eqs. (4) and (5) are
changed into
                                       k = g0 (ik
                                                 )/n +1                              (F.1)

and
                          h =      max {gm (ih  ¯      ¯ )}/n +1 ,
                                              ; h -1 , y                             (F.2)
                                 m=1,2,...,M


where n +1 = L +1 /L whereas Eq. (3) remains the same. Then, the first-order condi-
tions are obtained as follows:

                                  1
                              t =    ,                                               (F.3)
                                  ct
                                     b(h  ¯ t-1 , y
                                                  ¯t )yt+1
                              t =                            t+1 ,                   (F.4)
                                           nt+1 ht
                                     yt+1
                              t =               t+1 ,                                (F.5)
                                     nt+1 kt
                              nt+1 t = pk     ¯      ¯t )ph
                                        t = b(ht-1 , y    t.                         (F.6)


The same manipulations as those in section 3 yield exactly the same equations with
            k
respect to qt = pk         h    h
                 t kt and qt = pt ht as Eqs. (15) and (16), respectively. Additionally,

with respect to ht and kt , it follows that

                           maxm {Bm (ht-1 )}  1                          1
                   ht =                         -                        k
                                                                                 ,   (F.7)
                               nt+1          1- 1-                      qt -1



and
                                   
                            Aht-1 kt-1  1                        1
                       kt =               -                      k
                                                                             .       (F.8)
                             nt+1      1- 1-                    qt -1

Again, from the same manipulations as those in section 4, we obtain the law of motion
of human/knowledge capital when j = arg maxm {Bm (ht-1 )} as follows:

                              j
                       ht =        (ht-1 - j ) if vj -1  ht-1 < vj
                              nt+1

                                               56
which is Eq. (47).

Notes. Output per worker (y ) and physical capital per worker (k ) are directly computed
by using the data of PWT9.0. Human/knowledge capital per worker (h) and TFP (A)
                                          ~ is the TFP in the standard growth accounting,
are obtained as indicated in section 5.2. A
which is computed from y and k .
