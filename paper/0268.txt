                                 Abstract



        This paper describes both the theory and a computer program

designed to calculate the present value of an asset's uncertain future

cash flows. In this model expected flows may vary in each of "t" future

periods. Flows are adjusted to a certainty equivalent by a correction

factor derived from a covariance matrix of the flows and market returns.

The flows are discounted by a full specification of the term structure

of the risk—free Interest rate. The specific model illustrated In the

paper is that of expected cash flows from a mortgage portfolio.

        The computer program calculates the expected cash flow, the

uncertainty correction, and the term structure of Interest rates.

Algorithms to solve for each of these factors are included.   Alternatively,

options are included to input the factors frm exogenous forecasts or

projections. In addition to calculating the present values under each

specification for the factors, the program compares the present values

derived from each particular specification.

     This paper explains the application of a multiperiod uncertainty

model whose theory has been discussed in previous articles. The model

makes it possible to calculate the present value of uncertain future

cash flows generated by any asset. The approach may be applied to a

wide variety of asset classes. However, the paper uses as an example an

actual computer program designed to calculate the present value of a

mortgage portfolio and comments on how such a program could be modified

and applied to other types of assets.

     For the purpose of illustration, the approach is applied to mort-

gage portfolio data obtained from the Federal Home Loan Bank Board for

18 savings and loan associations in the San Francisco SMSA.

     The usefulness of this approach to multiperiod valuation under un-

certainty stems from its similarity to the comon certainty formulation,

which may be written as:

                      x            x                       x


                    (l+r)        (l+r)                    (l+r)


                =    I

                    t=l
                            x

                          (1+r)t

     where:

          PV =      present     value of the income stream.

                =   certain     cash flow received in period t.

              r =   the   risk free interest rate.




                                             1
The equation (1) approach of discounting certain future cash flows by a

rate which is the same for each period in the future should be familiar

to the reader.

      A similar simple closed fonii equation for discounting uncertain

future cash flows is as follows:


                                      COV(X ,_R_b)
                                  -
(2)        PV               t
                                         E(R_b
                     tl                   '
                                            mt
                                       RFt
      where:

           PV =      present    value of the income stream.

           X. =      the uncertain cash flow in period t.
                =    the future value of a dollar invested for t periods in
                     the market portfolio.

          RFt =      the future value of a dollar invested for t periods in
                     risk free bonds.

               b =   level of proportional risk aversion which will be assumed
                     equal to one.


      Since the theoretical development behind this model has been dis-

cussed in previous papers, attention in this paper will be focused on

application of equation (2).

      In order to understand the application, it is important to note

both the similarities and the differences of equations (1) and (2). The

two formulations are similar in that both have cash inflows in the

numerator, and both discount the cash flows for time value in the deno-

minator. However, there are three important differences in the two

equations. First, equation (2) uses expected cash inflows in the nume-

rator (E(Xt)) instead of the single point certainty cash flows of equa-

tion (1). Second, equation (2) has a term in the numerator which


                                             2
adjusts the expected cash flows for uncertainty. While this tern ap-

pears complex, it may be thought of as simply a dollar amount which,

when subtracted from the expected cash flows, supplies a certainty

equivalent in place of the expected value. Third, the denominator in

equation (2) employs a full specification of the tern structure in place

of the single level rate assumption of equation (1).

    As suggested by the differences between equations (1) and (2),

equation (2) is the conceptual basis for a much richer approach to the

valuation of financial instruments. In addition to the obvious allow-

ance for uncertainty, equation (2) allows for the cash flow in each

period to be discounted by the risk free discount factor appropriate to

that period and thus uses all the information available in the tern

structure. Also, the approach is extremely useful in dealing with the

question of interest sensitivity since equation (2) makes a provision

for specifying differences in the response of short and long rates and

allows computation of the resulting impact on valuation.

    Because the approach affords important insights into the impact of

interest rate changes on valuation, it is important at the outset to

specify how interest rate changes must be incorporated in the analysis.

Interest rate changes have three separate effects. First, they may ef-

fect the expected future cash flows. In the mortgage application, for

example, the impact of rate changes on future prepayments and defaults

may alter considerably the expected cash flows. Second, a change in

interest rates obviously changes the discount factors in the denomina-

tor. Third, and potentially the most troublesome, is the impact of

interest rate change on the risk premium. The risk premium may be

effected a) because of changes in aggregate risk tolerance, or b)


                                 3
through changes in the systematic riskiness of the asset that reflects a

change in the joint distribution of asset cash flows and market returns.

To obtain maximum usefulness from the model, specific equations linking

each of these three areas to interest rate change need to be incorpo-

rated into the analysis.

     The process of applying equation (2) consists of four steps for any

type of asset:


1.   Determination of the expected cash flows for the asset.

            This may be easy or more difficult depending on the nature of

     the instrument and the distribution of the cash flows. Mortgages,

     for example, require specification of future contract payments,

     future prepayments, and some estimate of defaults.    In addition,

     time series or cross sectional data is necessary to give some in-

     sight into the distribution.


 2. Specification of the risk free term structure.

            There are several ways to determine the necessary term struc-

     tures: a) present or past term structures may be calculated from

     risk free government securities, b) future term structures may be

     obtained from i) macro models such as the Penn-MIT model, ii)

     systematic adjustments of forward rates obtained from present term

     structures, iii) arbitrary specifications.


 3. Calculation of the uncertainty adjustment term.

            In order to calculate the uncertainty term, it is necessary to

     make assumptions which allow the computations to be done in the

     form

     where:

          Ut =      uncertainty   adjustment for period t.

         COR        coefficient of correlation.

         Std =      standard   deviation.

              E =   expectation   operator.

          rm =      the one period return on the market.

     The correlation, standard deviations and expectation must be calcu-

     lated from time series or cross sectional data obtained for asset

     cash flows and market returns.


4.   Computation of the present value.

          The respective elements of equation (2) are combined by the

     computer program into the calculated present value.


     The remainder of the paper will be divided into two sections. Sec-

tion I will explain the basic calculations in steps one through four and

apply them to the question of valuing a mortgage portfolio, and Section

II will demonstrate the computer program operations and give sample in-

puts and outputs.


                                      SECTION I


               STEP 1: Determining the Expected Cash Flows

     The cash flows from a mortgage portfolio are made up of regular

mortgage payments (including principal plus interest) and of mortgage

prepayments. For the typical mortgage, the contract rate and maturity

are fixed at the time of origination. The combination of rate and

maturity specify a. fixed payment cash inflow that the mortgage promises

                                       5
to generate at each point in the future. The payment is made up of

principal plus interest and follows a prescribed amortization schedule

depending on the rate and maturity. Because in the typical situation

the promised individual mortgage payments are fixed, the promised port-

folio cash inflow is fixed. Therefore, in general the value of the

portfolio varies inversely with fluctuating market rates.

      The difficulty that financial institutions have with fixed rate in-

struments is a well-known problem, and a recent attempt has been made by

some mortgage-granting institutions to solve the problem by issuing

variable rate mortgages. A variable rate mortgage allows the institu-

tion to raise (or lower) the mortgage contract rate according to the

rise or fall of an index of appropriately constructed market rates.

This kind of mortgage has some advantages to the institution, especially

in times of rising interest rates. Variable rate mortgages have become

popular with selected institutions and are being increasingly issued,

especially by California institutions. However, the trend toward vari-

able rate mortgages is relatively recent. Since the data gathered for

this application are from portfolios formed in 1975 or before, they are

made up almost wholly of fixed rate mortgages; and, for this reason, the

analysis in the paper will concentrate on their behavior.

      There are two factors that substantially complicate the cash in-

flows that are generated by a mortgage portfolio. The first of these is

the   prepayment option. Although the contract payments are spoken of as
fixed, the mortgagee has the option to prepay part or   all   of the princi-
pal in.   conjunction with the refinancing or sale of the mortgaged pro-

perty. Because of the mobility of many home owners, the option to

prepay is often exercised, and the resulting prepayment cash flows are a


                                   6
substantial factor in analyzing the total cash flows from   the   mortgage

portfolio. The second factor concerns mortgage defaults. The payments

spoken of as fixed are only fixed in the sense that they are promises to

pay. In the case of default, these promised payments are not realized

by the mortgage granting institution.


                                      Fixed Payments

     The basic element of mortgage portfolio cash flows is derived from

the fixed mortgage payment. The standard parameters of the fixed pay-

ment, self-amortizing mortgage, are straight forward. The regular

monthly payment is determined as a function of the principle amount,

contract rate, and term to maturity and may be computed by applying the

following simple payment algorithm:


                          Principle
                                  1
             payment=l -
                               (1 +    r)t
        where:

             r =   contract   rate on monthly basis.

             t =   term to maturity in months.

These fixed payment amounts must be adjusted in each period to take into

effect foreclosures or prepayments which occurred in prior periods. The

impact of the foreclosure or prepayment is to eliminate loans from the

portfolio and therefore reduce the fixed payment portion of the cash

flow.



                                        P repaents

        Since mortgage holders have the option to pay down their mortgage

by amounts in excess of the scheduled amortization, mortgage portfolios


                                             7
have cash flows which may in any period substantially exceed the pre-

scribed fixed payments for the period. It is important to consider

these prepayments, since their timing may greatly impact the value of

the mortgage portfolio. There are several ways to include prepayments

in the analysis. It is possible, for example, to use an arbitrary set

of prepayment data in the form of annual mortgage termination rates.

Termination rates are defined as a fraction of the portfolio balance

that would be paid off in any year. The rates may be stated as a frac-

tion of the original portfolio amount (fixed basis) or as a fraction of

the remaining portfolio amount (current basis). Typical termination

patterns are available from FHA data.

       Another more interesting alternative is available for dealing with

prepayments and illustrates the concept of linking cash flows to inter-

est rate changes. The approach is based on a model developed by Curley

and Guttentag (1972). The model explains mortgage termination rates as

a function of policy year, maturity, the relationship between the cur-

rent mortgage contract rate and original contract rate, and the discount

points charged in the specified year. Their results are contained in a

single equation of the following form:'


     1The numerator of the valuation equation requires expected cash
flows. The prepayment cash flows are determined by finding the prepay-
ment function (TR) which is the analog of the Log TRt equation. It is
clear that E(x)  exp[E(ln(x))]; but it can be shown that the difference
is small. One approach is to suppose the generalized function g(x) =
a + bx + cx2 + dx3 + .... Both ln(x) and eX meet this criterion.
Expanding g(x + ) and taking the expectation (E[q(x + c)]) gives
x0 +   E(c) plus the expectation of higher order term of        ,   i.e.,
E[O(c)2]. In the same fashion, g[E(x)] =   g[x   +   E()]   =   x   + E(E) plus
higher order terms of the square of the expectation, i.e., O[E(E)]

              =   discount    in year t

          C =     original    contract rate

      The termination rate in year t (TRt) is defined as a function of

the portfolio balance that will be paid off in that year.                  The prepay-

ment equation estimates current basis termination rates, but these may

easily be converted to fixed basis rates if desired. The prepayment

equation was estimated using FRA annual data covering the period 1951-67

 for 20-, 25-, and 30-year mortgages. The absolute level of both long-

 and short-term interest rates was generally lower during this period

 than during subsequent periods for which the equation may be applied.

 However, the variables in the prepayment equation which would be ef-

 fected, namely the original contract rate and the mortgage rate in year

 t, enter the equation in the form of a yield differential.                    Since rela-

 tive differentials or spreads have approximately the same range in

 subsequent periods as in the estimation period, the prepayment equation

 should retain its usefulness when applied to more recent data.


 If            2 is very small, so E[0()2]     0; and E[€:] is small, so
         is2small, 0. This leaves the constant  and first order terms
 0(E[c]) is also
 the same; arid with only small differences in the second order terms, it
 appears safe to use the analog of the log TRt equation in place of the
 expectation.
                                               9
     The prepayment equation makes it possible to calculate prepayments

and add them to the fixed mortgage payments for each period in the fu-

ture. However, because the equation uses projected future mortgage

rates, it is necessary to supply these rates in some fashion. This may

be done arbitrarily or, since other numerator and denominator changes

are driven by changes in short-term rates, it may be done by attempting

to link future mortgage rates to future short-term interest rates.

     As an illustration of an attempt to determine the nature of the

relationship between mortgage rates and short-term rates, a monthly

mortgage rate series from December of 1969 through December of 1975 was

analyzed in conjunction with three month treasury bill rates over the

same period. The most notable feature of these two series is the ex-

tremely high level of serial correlation that exists in each. For

example, a regression of the spread between the mortgage rate and the

treasury bill rate against the treasury bill rate yields the following

equation:

            MRT - TBRT     =   6.11    -   0.579   TBRT + e

                =   0.60       (.34) (.056)           D.W. =   0.1398
              n = 73

     where     MRT = mortgage rate,

              TBRT =     treasury     bill rate,

              D.W. = Durbin Watson statistic,

              and the figures in parentheses are standard errors. The
              resulting t-statistics are significant at the 99% level.

The Durbin Watson statistic of 0.1398 shows the high level of serial

correlation in the residuals. This could be anticipated since the mech-

anism described by several practitioners for mortgage rate determination


                                           10
Is to set the current period mortgage rate equal to the previous peri-

od's rate and adjust slightly upward or downward, depending on short-

term rate movements. The autocorrelation is strong enough to require

second-order autocorrelation correction, which yields the following

results:


             MRT - TBRT   =   8.77   -   1.03 TBRT + 1.65 RHO1 - 0.69 RHO2

                              (.45) (.03)             (.085)     (0.087)

                                 D.W. =        1.83
                                          =    0.98
                                         n = 73

     The resulting t-statistics are again significant at the 99% level.

However, there is a difficulty involved in using the above equation to

predict future mortgage rates in the current setting. The prepayment

algorithm requires a pattern of future mortgage rates over a thirty-year

period in order to computea thirty-year pattern of prepayments and the

resulting pattern of cash flows. When the equation is used to predict

beyond five to ten periods, the predicted mortgage rates diverge rapidly

from the average relationship that has existed in the past between mort-

gage rates and short-term treasury bill rates.             This average spread was

computed for 1961 through 1975 and was found to be approximately 210

 basis points. Using the 210 basis point average spread to predict

 future mortgage rates was found to produce more reasonable prepayment

 patterns than those developed from the autocorrelation corrected

 equation.

                               Defaults


     While it is possible to relate the question of prepayments and in-

terest rate changes in a fashion sympathetic to the overall approach,

the problem of defaults is not so easily handled. The numerator related

concern is essentially a question of how the expected value of cash

flows are effected by defaults. Since it is reasonable to assume that

short-term interest rates either directly or as a proxy may have some

influence on default, it should be possible in principle to link rate

changes through defaults to the expected cash flows. However, because

default data were not available for the portfolios in the data sample,

it was not possible to examine the linkage between rate changes and

defaults. Nevertheless, the computer program written to do the calcula-

tion allows for the possibility of arbitrarily varying the default rates

by year for each association. For example, the first year foreclosure

rate could be determined as 2 percent, meaning that 2 percent of the

book value of the portfolio would be eliminated for all subsequent

periods. However, the program allows the user to specify an average

percentage of the foreclosed amount to be recovered, and the recovered

amount is added to the normal payment and prepayment cash flows for the

period. The foreclosed mortgages are subtracted from the portfolio, and

future cash flows from both regular payments and prepayments are appro-

priately reduced.


        STEP 2: Specification of the Risk Free Term Structure

     As suggested previously, there are several ways to obtain the

necessary risk free interest rates that make up the denominator of

equation (2). To examine the question of how changes in rates effect



                                12
the resulting present values, it is useful to have both present and

projected future term structures that can be used to discount the pro-

jected cash flows.

     Current estimates of the term structure may be obtained from an es-

timation of the discount function accomplished by a computer program

developed by J. Houston McCulloch [1975]. The basic concept is to fit a

discount function to the observed prices of U.S. Government treasury ob-

ligations. The program uses as inputs the bid and ask prices of bill,

note and bond quotes for a given date and applies an instrumental

      The current term structure may be used as a basis for obtaining

 future term structures through a technique developed by Morrison [1977].

 The technique employs a distributed lead to shift the whole term struc-

 ture as a function of changes in short-term rates.        Note that the impact

 of an interest rate change on a term structure with identical rates in

 each period, such as in equation (1), is to shift the term structure

 uniformly higher or lower. In other words, in such a case the response

 of both long- and short-term rates is assumed to be identical. However,

  by using the distributed lead, it is possible to capture in some measure

  the empirically observed differential response of short— and long-term

  rates to short-term rate changes.

                 Fk                 Fl                     1




        where:

            rr1 =          real      one period rate.

            RFk =          1    +   the    k-period risk free nominal compound rate.

                   =
                           one-period         inflationary expectation.
                   =
             Ii            1+11.
             r1 =          rr1+i1.
                 A =       difference         operator.

                 k =       time period in months.

As an example of how the function works, suppose:


             r1 = .06

            rr1=.03
               = .03

           Arr1 = .01
                   = .03


        Since t,rk =
                                rk_rk,      it is possible to find a new value of the k
                                                           41-.14k             4-.09k -

For k + 4 and rk =                  .07,

             rk* =             (1.07) 1-9-6e97 +          j—e77      +   .07

                       =       .0883

Each period's rate making up the term structure may be shifted in the

same manner.

                                                    15
     Table 1 contains an example of a shifted teni structure which has

been computed using equation (3) and the shift parameters shown in the

table. As an alternative, it is possible to choose arbitrary term

structures and employ them as the denominator of equation (2). An

example of such an arbitrary designated tern structure is also shown in

Table 1. Figure 1 shows the shapes of the January 2, 1976, revised and

arbitrary term structures. Each of these three term structures will

subsequently be used to discount mortgage portfolio cash flows. Of

course, the method used for determining the term structure will restrict

what may or may not be said concerning the resulting present values.


          STEP 3: Calculation of the Uncertainty Adjustment Tern


     As will be recalled from equation (2), the uncertainty adjustment

term takes the form:


     u=       COv(x,_rçb)
                   t    t

                    E(R)
     where:


          Rm.t
                    the one plus compound return on the market portfolio in
                    period t.

           X. = cash flow in period t.

              b =   the level of proportional risk aversion.

In order to calculate a value for the term, it is necessary to make the

following assumptions:


     1.    The level of proportional risk aversion (b) is set equal to

           one.

     2.    The returns on the maket portfolio are serially uncorrelated

           and the variance of market returns is constant.

               returns.

       4.      The correlation between current period cash flows and market

               returns is not a function of time or interest rates.

       The above assumptions allow the covariance between the cash flow

(X) and the product of market returns (Rmt) to be factored into the

expectation of a product term and the covariance of a simpler term that

       As suggested previously, the risk premium may be effected through

either changes in aggregate risk tolerance or through changes in the

joint distribution of mortage cash flows andmarket returns. Setting

b —   —1    is theoretically justified (see Hakansson [1971], Rubinstein

[1973]), and in this context it essentially means that interest rate

changes are assumed not to effect the risk premium through any impact on

aggregate risk tolerance.

       The second effect, namely the impact of interest rate change on the

joint distribution of portfolio cash flows and market returns, can be

seen quite clearly from equation (4). Equation (4) contains terms for


                                          18
the mean and standard deviation of the reciprocal of market returns, the

standard deviation of cash flows, and the correlation between the cash

flows and the reciprocal of market returns. Fortunately, it is possible

to say something about how expected market returns vary with short-tenii

interest rates as will be shown subsequently.

     It is also possible that interest rate changes effect the correla-

tion of cash flows with market returns and/or the standard deviation of

cash flows. For example, in the case where investor expectations con-

cerning interest rates impact on the distribution of cash flows through

defaults, both the correlation and the standard deviation of cash flows

would be effected. To measure the effect requires cross sectional data,

including a number of observations of portfolio cash flows at each of

several different interest rates. Because this data is not available,

and since it is still useful to calculate the correlation coefficient,

it is necessary to assume that the correlation is not a function of in-

terest rates, and it can then be calculated from the available time

series observations. For the same reason, the standard deviations of

both the cash flows (STD[Xt]) and the reciprocal of market returns

(Std[----]) are assumed to be invariant with respect to time and interest
      mt
rates. It is useful to note that the data used to calculate both the

correlations and standard deviations of cash flows is actual savings and

loan mortgage portfolio data, which includes the impact of defaults, and

therefore the correlations and standard deviation may be thought of as

 including average default characteristics.

     Thus, under the stated assumptions, interest rate changes do impact

 on the risk premium, but only through an effect on the expected market

 return. It is difficult to estimate the size or nature of the bias that


                                 19
may be introduced by the above assumptions. When risk prémia are stated

in terms of yield differentials, the suspicion is that they exhibit

sizable changes. For example, the yield spread between long-term go-

vernment bonds and mortgage rates ranged from 145 to 375 basis points

over the time period of study. However, it is important to note that a

"yield" calculation assumes that interest rates are level through time

and that contract rates or coupon rates represent certain cash flows.

Therefore, any adjustments in expected cash flows, in the term structure

or in strict risk premium changes, are thrown together into the reported

"yield". Since the above analysis does incorporate interest rate

changes into the term structure, the expected cash flows and the risk

premium, it is difficult to estimate how much of the difference in

observed yield spreads may be unaccounted for.

     To incorporate the uncertainty adjustment term in the analysis,

values for each of the four terms of equation (4) must be estimated.

Consider first the term E(rmt) which is the expected one plus return on

the market portfolio. In this application the return is assumed to be a

function of the level of risk-free interest rates. Since the uncer-

tainty adjustment is done on a quarterly basis the appropriate relation-

ship is between the quarterly return on the market and the three-month

treasury bill yield. This relationship was estimated for the 25 quar-

ters from 1969 IV to 1975 IV. Table 2 gives the results:

One way of obtaining a series of future three month spot rates needed as

the independent variable is to obtain from the term structure the li-

quidity adjusted three month forward rates. (Assuming that the liqui-

dity adjusted three month forward rates are unbiased projection of

future three month spot rates.) These forward rates can be computed

from the term structure by using the relationship

Before the calculated forward rate (rt) can be used as a spot rate

projection, it must be adjusted by subtracting off a liquidity premium

the three-month liquidity premia estimated by McCulloch [1975] are shown

in Table 3.

     Calculation of the correlation coefficient, COR(x4—) requires cash

flow data from the mortgage portfolio and a corresponding series of mar-

ket returns. For this application, the data employed were six years of

quarterly cash flows from a savings and loan association mortgage port-

folio and market return data for the same period from the CRSP tapes.

Since the mortgage portfolio cash flows were separated into interest and

principle payments, three separate correlation coefficients were calcu-

lated. p1 is the correlation between the interest payments and the

reciprocal of market returns, p2 is the correlation between principle

payments and the reciprocal of market returns and p_ is the correlation

between the combined cash flows and the reciprocal of market returns.

Table 4 shows the results of the calculations for a typical savings as-

sociation1s mortgage portfolio.

     When examining the results, it should be noted that the sign of the

uncertainty adjustment term in equation (4) is positive. This may seem

counter-intuitive, since the usual notion is to subtract from the expec-

ted cash flow a term that reflects the undesirability of highly corre-

lated cash flows. However, because the correlation calculated here is

between a cash flow and the reciprocal of the market return, the signs

will be opposite those normally expected. Since the sign of the corre-

lation may be either positive or negative, the sign of the whole adjust-

ment term may be either positive or negative. Thus, the sign of the

correlation coefficient determines whether the mortgage portfolio's

value is increased or decreased when held in a portfolio with other as-

sets. For the above example, the combined cash flows have a positive

correlation with the reciprocal of market returns (meaning the correla-

tion betweem cash flows and regular market returns would be negative)

and, therefore, the value of the mortgages is increased when held in

conjunction with the market portfolio.

     To complete the risk adjustment term, it is necessary to calculate

the standard deviation of both the reciprocal of market returns and of

the portfolio cash flows. From the CRSP data, the standard deviation of

the reciprocal of the one-plus market return was computed to be 0.0882

for the sample time period. For the portfolio cash flows, the quarterly

standard deviation was calculated to be 1,708 dollars.

     It should be noted that for cash flows that are serially uncorre-

lated and have a growth rate with a stationary mean, the standard devia-

tion can be computed as:


               Std(X) = x0 [(o +     2)t]l/2

                                24
where       X = cash        flow at time t

             g =   1    +   rate   of growth of cash flows

             a =   standard deviation of the growth rate

             p = mean of the growth rate

However, the cash flows from a mortgage portfolio do not fit this pat-

tern because they do not grow over time. Since regular payments are

fixed, any variation in the cash flows results from variation in the

prepayment or foreclosure rates. It is generally assumed that as a

portfolio ages, the absolute number of foreclosures and prepayments de-

crease. Consequently, the standard deviation of cash flows ought to

also decrease with time. However, because analysis of how the standard

deviation of cash flows behaves as a function of foreclosure rates, pre-

payments, and time was not possible, the program assumes for this appli-

cation that the standard deviation is constant over time.


                       Step 4: Calculation of the Present Value

        Calculation of the present value requires that each of the previ-

 ously described steps be combined in the appropriate relationship

 according to equation (2). The computer program developed to do the

 calculations performs essentially five operations; four operations are

 related to the numerator and one to the denominator. These operations

 are discussed relative to the mortgage portfolio application and may

 need to be altered slightly for use in other contexts. They are essen-

 ially a review of steps one through three.

        With respect to the numerator, the program first takes the indivi-

 dual mortgage data for each mortgage in the portfolio and calculates the

 future fixed monthly payments. Second, it calculates a series of future



                                             25
mortgage rates based on a specified term structure and uses them in con-

junction with the prepayment algorithm to calculate the dollar amount of

prepayinents in each period. The program then applies an arbitrarily

determined set of foreclosure rates to the portfolio. The foreclosure

rates can be varied at will but are not included as a function of any

other endogeneous or exogeneous parameters. At this point, the program

combines the fixed payments, prepayments and foreclosures for each loan

into a specified quarterly cash flow for the entire portfolio. As a

fourth step, the parameters of the uncertainty adjustment term are com-

puted and added to or subtracted from the expected cash flow for each

period.

       The denominator calculation consists of taking the series of for-

ward   rates describing the term structure and forming the appropriate
discount factor for each period. The discounted, uncertainty adjusted
cash flows are summed over the total number of periods, and the sum is

the resulting present value.

       Tables 5 and 6 show the results of applying the approach to 18 San

Francisco SMSA savings, and loan association portfolios. The results in

Table 5 have been calculated assuming uncertainty, no foreclosures and

the term structure and revision discussed in Step 2. Note that the

portfolio values as of January 2, 1976, exceeded the book values in

every case. This is because the rates represented by the January 2,

1976, term structure were lower than the average mortgage portfolio con-

tract rates. Note also that even when the portfolio cash flows were

valued using the revised downward sloping term structure, the present

values remained above book value. This occurred because the portfolio

cash flows are received over a very long period of time; and, even

though the tenTi structure was shifted upward, the nature of the shift

was such as to leave long term rates relatively unchanged.

     Table 6 shows the impact of discounting the expected mortgage cash

flows by the arbitrarily designated term structure described previously.

As seen most clearly from Figure 1, the main difference between the re-

vised and arbitrary term structures is that the arbitrary term structure

exhibits higher long term rates. Discounting by this term structure de-

creases the mortgage portfolio values by more than 6 percent in every

case.


                                SECTION II

              PROGRAM OPERATION AND SAMPLE INPUTS AND OUTPUTS


        This section contains more specific information and description

concerning the computer program discussed previously. The first part of

the section describes the real time program requests and the nature of

the inputs requested. The second part contains a sample of the program

 output. A listing of the program and sample input data files are con-

 tained in Appendices A and B respectively.

        The program is currently set to run on a Dec 10 computer system;

 however, only slight modifications of certain control statements would

 be required to make it compatible with other similar time shared sys-

 tems. The input steps correspond with the previous discussion on pro-

 jecting cash flows, adjusting for uncertainty, etc. Table 7 contains a

 sample of the program statements and inputs and should be referred to in

 conjunction with the description of program steps.

        After logging in and receiving the prompt character, the user types

 RUN FLO, and the computer responds with the first input requested.

                         Projecting Cash Flows

     Items 1-12 allow for the calculatior of cash flows for a savings

and loan mortgage portfolio. These items could be modified to accept

coupon bond data or any other data representing cash flows from finan-

cial instruments.


1.   ENTER THE SAVINGS & LOAN DOCKET NO. AND THE NUMBER OF LOANS.

          The user must input two numbers separated by a coma. The

          first number is simply a number that identifies the run. This

          number will appear in the heading of the output. The second

          number indicates how many separate loans will be entered for

          analysis. After the second number, the user enters a carriage

          return which tells the computer to go to the next step.

2.   WHEN DO YOU WANT THE CASH FLOWS TO START PRINTING?

          User enters a two digit number (i.e., 76) that specifies the

          first year the output will begin to appear.

3.   IS THE LOAN DATA ON DISK?

          If the user inputs Y11 meaning yes, the computer responds with

          statement 4.   If the user inputs "N", the computer responds

          with statement 3A.

3A. WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CALL THE FILE?

          The user inputs a file name to which the loan data will be

          assigned.

3B. ENTER 1 - THE YEAR LOAN HAD THAT AMOUNT.

           2 - THE YEAR LOAN HAD THAT AMOUNT

            3 - THE CONTRACT RATE




                                    33
           4 - THE NUMBER OF MONTHS LEFT TO MATURITY

           5 — THE AGE (IN MONTHS) OF LOAN

     see Appendix B and file LOAN.A2 for an example of data input.

4.   WHAT FILE IS IT IN?

          The response to this statement must be the name of a data file

          in which the loan data has previously been put. Loan data

          must include for each loan the four items described in 3B. A

          typical file for 6 loans would appear as shown in file LOAN.A2

          (Appendix B).

5.   IS THE PREPAYMENT DATA ON "DISK" TO BE "HAND" ENTERED OR TO BE
     "CALCULATED"?

          The user may respond with "D", "H", or "C".

          A "D" response means that the user has previously placed in a

          disk file the fraction of mortgages in the specified year that

          will be terminated. A typical data file would contain thirty

          decimal fractions similar to those that appear on the output

          for each loan under "has the following prepayment experience".


         An "H" response means the user is prepared to input the deci-

         mal fractions at the terminal one at a time separated by

         commas.


         A "C" response means the user wishes the computer to calculate

         the prepayment fractions based on the algorithm described in

         the text. The calculated fractions are printed out for each

          loan on the output. A "C" response invokes statement 6.

6.   DO YOU WANT IT CALCULATED FROM "ARBITRARY MORTGAGE RATES" OR THE
     TERM STRUCTURE DETERMINED MORTGAGE RATES?

         The user may respond with an "A" or     "1". The "A" response

         means the user wants to specify a set     future annual mort-

                                34
        gage rates which will be used in the prepayment algorithm to

        calculate the prepayment fractions. This allows the user to

        uncouple the prepayment fractions from the term structure and

        have them calculated from arbitrarily determined future mort-

        gage rates. After an "A" response, the computer will come

        back and ask for the file name in which the future mortgage

        rates have been stored.


        The "T" response instructs the computer to calculate the for-

        ward rates from the term structure and use the forward rates

        to calculate the future mortgage rates that are to be used to

        determine the prepayment fractions.

7. You NEED X PAST MORTGAGE RATES AND DISCOUNT POINTS, WHAT FILE ARE
    THEY IN?

        The program has been written so that prepayment fractions

        would be applied to loans which were closed in previous years.

        In order to calculate the prepayment experience, the computer

        uses the prepayment algorithm and requires as inputs the past

        mortgage rates and discount points. These need to be placed

        in a data file. See file MORT PSI.

8. WHERE ARE THE LIQUIDITY PREMIUMS?

        The user responds with the file name. The file may specify

        the McCollough liquidity premium or any arbitrarily chosen

        set. See file L.DT.

9. WHAT SPREAD DO YOU PROJECT FOR THE MORTGAGE RATE OVER THE TREASURY
    BILL RATE? (I.E. 0.021)

         The user inputs a decimal fraction. For example, the .021

         adds 2.1 percent to an 8.0 percent forward rate to give a 10.1

         percent mortgage rate.

                                  35
10. WHERE ARE THE EXPECTED FORECLOSURE RATES FOUND?

          The user inputs a file name. See, for example, FORC.RAT.

11. WHAT PERCENT OF FORECLOSURES DO YOU EXPECT TO RECOVER?

          The user inputs a number such as 50 (50 percent) or 100 (100

          percent), which specifies the percent of the value of fore-

          closed property that will be realized.

12. HOW MANY MONTHS INTEREST WILL BE CHARGED FOR THE PREPAYMENT PENALTY
     (ENTER 100 FOR THE FHLMC METHOD)?

          User enters a number like 6 (6 months) or 0 (no months inte-

          rest penalty).


             Specification of the Risk Free Term Structure

     Items 13-15 relate to the development of discount factors which

make up the denominator of equation (2).


13. WHERE ARE THE K's FOUND?

          User enters a file name. See for example K.DT. The K's are

          the quarterly rates (on annual basis) obtained from the

         McCollough program that specify the term structure.

14. DO YOU WANT TO ARBITRARILY SHIFT THE TERM STRUCTURE?

         User responds with "V" or "N". A "Y" response means the user

         does not wish to have the term structure shifted by using the

         compulational algorithm but prefers to arbitrarily designate a

         new shifted term structure. The computer requests the file

         name of the shifted term structure. See for example file

         AK.DT.


         A "N" response means the user wishes to use the algorithm for

         shifting the term structure, and the computer responds with

         statement 15.

                                36
15. ENTER RR, RR-HAT, II, AND IT-HAT

         The user enters four decimals separated by commas. RR and II

         are respectively the real rate and rate of inflation compo-

         nents that make up the nominal short term (3 month) rate. RR-

         HAT and IT-HAT are the real and inflationary rate components

         that are projected to make up the short term nominal rate in

         the shifted term structure.


                    The_Uncertaiy_juStmeflt_Term
     Items 16 and 17 allow for the computation of the uncertainty ad-

justment term as previously described.

                                                                               d
16. DO YOU WISH TO ADJUST FOR UNCERTAINTY?

          User enters "V'1 or "N". An "N" response sets the uncertainty

          adjustment term to zero. If the user responds in the affirma-

          tive, the computer proceeds to statement 17.

17. ENTER 1 - THE CORRELATION BETWEEN CASH FLOWS AND RETURN ON THE
               MARKET.

           2 - THE MEAN OF (1 + THE GROWTH RATE OF THE CASH FLOWS).

           3 - THE STANDARD DEVIATION.

          Two separate versions of the uncertainty adjustment term are

          available in the program. Both use the correlation coeffi-

          cient, which is entered as the first input. The first version

          for uncertainty adjustment uses the mean arid standard devia-

           tion of the 1 + growth rates of cash flows. These data would

           be entered, for example, as p   = 1.05,   a =   .06.   The second

           version of uncertainty adjustment uses only the standard devi-

           ation of the cash flows themselves, in which case the mean is




                                   37
          entered as zero and the standard deviation is entered as a

         whole number.


                    calculation of the Present Value

     In addition to the present value, which is automatically provided

by the program, it is possible to specify more detailed output such as

described by items 18 and 19.


18. DO YOU WANT THE MONTHLY CASH FLOWS PRINTED OUT?

          This option allows the user to obtain cash flow figures by

         month for the whole portfolio for interest, principal, princi-

         pal repayments and total cash flow.

19. DO YOU WANT DETAILED PREPAYMENTS, ETC?

         An affirmative response for this option gives the user a de-

         tailed print out of cash flows by month for each individual

         loan in the portfolio.




                                  38
                             Sample Outp
     An example of the abbreviated program output appears as Table 8.

The more detailed outputs are much longer and, therefore, examples have

not been included. The output firsts lists the assumptions that have

been used in the particular run called for. Since many of the data

files are extensive, only the file names are referred to in the assump.-

tions. The output then details each of the loans in the portfolio and

prints the termination fractions that are assumed for the loan prepay-.

ments. The program then prints a present value and book value based on

the initially specified term structure. The output then presents a

second present value calculation, both of which are based on the revised

or arbitrary term structure as specified. The percentage change in

present value is calculated as the concluding data item.

LISTING OF DATA INPUT FILES
     The computer program allows the user to set up input files which

contain data needed for performing the various calculations. The user

simply references the file name at the appropriate place in the program,

and all the data in the file is made available automatically. The fol-

lowing pages contain examples of exact data with the name of each data

file in capital letters preceeding the data. The nature of the data in

each of the files has been discussed previously at the beginning of

Section II.
