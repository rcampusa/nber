Is Government Spending at the Zero Lower Bound Desirable?

                                              ABSTRACT

Government spending at the zero lower bound (ZLB) is not necessarily welfare enhancing, even when
its output multiplier is large. We illustrate this point in the context of a standard New Keynesian model.
In that model, when government spending provides direct utility to the household, its optimal level
is at most 0.5-1 percent of GDP for recessions of -4 percent; the numbers are higher for deeper recessions.
When spending does not provide direct utility, it is generically welfare-detrimental: it should be kept
unchanged at a long run-optimal value.

1     Introduction
A series of recent papers have argued that, once an economy faces a binding zero lower
bound (ZLB) constraint on the nominal interest rate, government spending as a stabi-
lization tool is particularly e¤ective. This is the message of Christiano, Eichenbaum and
Rebelo (2011) (CER 2011 henceforth), Eggertsson (2010), Werning (2011), and Woodford
(2011), among others. The key reason it that, at the ZLB, the output multiplier of gov-
ernment spending can be much larger than in normal times. In a model with sticky prices,
if the nominal interest rate is constrained by the ZLB, a persistent increase in government
spending raises labor demand and therefore the real marginal cost; this translates into
higher expected in‡ation, hence into a negative real interest rate (given a zero nominal
interest rate), inducing a substitution from future into current consumption, which raises
output.
    The academic literature on the ZLB has focused on the case of government spending
that provides direct utility to the representative agent. A frequently heard interpretation
of this literature (although one that has not been formalized yet) is that, precisely because
government spending has a very large multiplier, even wasteful government spending
might have a positive welfare e¤ect at the ZLB by reducing the output gap.1
    In this paper, we ask three questions. First, does a large output multiplier translate
into a large positive welfare e¤ect? Second, is the optimal government spending increase at
the ZLB large? Third, can even wasteful government spending be bene…cial at the ZLB?
We address these questions across several possible speci…cations and solution methods of
the standard New Keynesian model, and the answer we reach is consistently "no".
    A standard approach to answering these questions is to vary the parameter con…gu-
ration - in particular, the size of the discount rate shock that takes the economy into a
recession and to the ZLB, its persistence, and the degree of price stickiness - and show
that, for some con…gurations, the optimal government spending increase can be very large.
However, in general such con…gurations also deliver declines in GDP that can be several
times the decline of a typical recession. Thus, our strategy is to …x the decline in GDP
at the ZLB at 4 percent - a sizeable recession - and to study the optimal increase in
government spending across di¤erent speci…cations and solution methods.
    We start with the same speci…cation and the same calibration as CER (2011), which
   1
     In a di¤erent setup, not speci…c to the ZLB, Galí (2014) shows that an increase in wasteful government
spending, …nanced with money creation, can increase welfare.

features a stochastic duration of the discount rate shock and assumes that government
spending provides direct utility to the representative agent. In the loglinearized version
of this model ("LS model" henceforth), we …nd, like many others, that the consumption
multiplier of government spending is quite large, at about 2; still, the optimal increase
in government spending in a 4 percent recession is just .5 percent of steady state GDP.
Also, it is enough to reduce slightly the persistence of the ZLB shock or the slope of the
Phillips curve (the latter to values more consistent with most of the existing empirical
literature) for the optimal government spending increase to be arbitrarily close to zero.
    Larger values of optimal spending at the ZLB obtain only for parameter values that
imply otherwise unreasonably large recessions. The key intuition is that, as the recession
gets larger and the economy approaches the starvation point (the point where private
consumption is zero), there are two important consequences. First, the marginal utility
of consumption is very high. Second, the multiplier of government spending on private
consumption is also very high, and can indeed become unboundedly large, as already
emphasized in other contributions (see e.g. CER, 2011; Woodford, 2012 or Eggertsson,
2009). The welfare e¤ect in this extreme parameter region is driven entirely by this
explosive behavior: government spending is very e¤ective in boosting private consumption,
and at the same time consumption is highly valued because the recession is deep.
    The explosive behavior of multipliers observed in the LS model does not arise in a
model with deterministic duration of the ZLB (Carlstrom, Fuerst and Paustian, 2013),
nor in a stochastic model when solved nonlinearly (Braun, Körber, and Waki, 2013; Chris-
tiano and Eichenbaum, 2013). In addition, loglinearization of the model, whether with
stochastic or deterministic duration of the ZLB, is likely to provide a poor approximation
to the true solution because the underlying shock is quite large. Thus, we compare the LS
model both with the nonlinear solution of the same model ("NLS model" henceforth) and
with the loglinearized solution of the deterministic duration model ("LD model" hence-
forth). Essentially the same conclusions apply: at the ZLB associated with a 4 percent
recession, the optimal increase in government spending at the ZLB is modest, between
1.1 percent in the LD model and .8 percent in the NLS model.
    We next address the third question, namely whether even wasteful government spend-
ing can be bene…cial at the ZLB, simply because it reduces a large (negative) output gap
that cannot by de…nition be reduced using monetary policy at the ZLB: To formalize this
notion, we assume that the increase in government spending that occurs at the ZLB is


                                            2
pure waste, while the steady state amount of government spending still delivers utility
as before. We now …nd that, at the baseline parameter values, the optimal increase in
government spending at the ZLB is zero in all models and solutions, despite the fact that
the multiplier can still be very large. The optimal increase in wasteful government spend-
ing is positive on an extreme, and very small, range of parameter values in the stochastic
duration models, where once again the result is driven by the explosive behavior near the
starvation point discussed above.
     In a model with useful government spending, Woodford (2011) has argued that the
case for welfare enhancing government spending at the ZLB can be made only for large
shocks that induce a recession of the magnitude observed under the Great Depression.
Thus, we next use Woodford’s approach to replicate stylized facts of the Great Depression,
i.e., a 28.8 per cent fall in GDP and a 10 per cent annual de‡ation. In the LS version
of this model with useful spending, like Woodford (2011), we …nd that there is a large
welfare scope for increasing government spending at the ZLB: the optimal value is about
14:5 per cent of GDP. When we assume that spending is wasteful (unlike Woodford 2011),
we still …nd an optimal increase in spending of 13:5 percent of GDP.
     We show, however, that these …ndings hinge upon two features of the calibration:
…rst, the economy is close to the starvation point, where it exhibits the explosive behavior
emphasized earlier; second, and in order to replicate the de‡ation evidence, the Phillips
curve must be extremely ‡at, implying a very large degree of price stickiness (translated
in Calvo terms, a price duration of 20 quarters). The latter feature implies that the
welfare cost of the ZLB, stemming from the negative output gap, is very high.2 In fact,
in both the LD and the NLS models, we …nd, conditional on the same Great Depression
calibration, that once again the optimal level of wasteful government spending is zero.
     The outline of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents the model. In section 3 we
solve the loglinearized version of the stochastic duration model. Section 4 discusses the
welfare e¤ects of government spending at the ZLB, optimal government spending, and
robustness to variations in the three key parameters described above. Section 5 presents
the nonlinear solution of the stochastic duration model, and the loglinearized solution of
   2
    We de…ne GDP as output net of the price adjustment cost; this distinction is relevant only in the
nonlinear model, insofar as the price adjustment cost is quadratic in in‡ation (and hence drops out when
taking a linear approximation). The large di¤erence between output and GDP here occurs precisely
because the price adjustment cost needed to …t de‡ation numbers is so high–an issue discussed also by
Braun, Körber, and Waki (2013) when analyzing the Great Depression in a nonlinear model.

calibration that delivers a decline of GDP as in the Great Depression. Section 7 concludes.


2       The model
To facilitate comparison with what is now a standard model in the literature on the ZLB,
we start from exactly the same speci…cation as CER (2011).3 We present its main features
here, leaving the full solution to Appendix A.
    A representative household maximizes the expected discounted value of momentary
           P      Qt
utility, E0 1 t=0   j=0 j U (Ct ; Nt ; Gt ); where Ct is consumption, Nt is hours worked and
Gt is government spending on goods produced by the private sector. The discount factor
is j = 1 for j = 0 and j = (1 + j ) 1 for j 1; the discount rate j varies exogenously,
in a way speci…ed below (if j were a constant, the cumulative discount factor would
           Q
simply be tj=0 j = t ). Preferences are non-separable in consumption and hours:
                                         h                        i1
                                                             1
                                             Ct (1   Nt )                1       G1t   1
                   U (Ct ; Nt ; Gt ) =                                       + G           ,        (1)

    In (1), Ct is a basket of a continuum of individual varieties indexed by z, with constant

    Each di¤erentiated good is produced by a di¤erent monopolistically competitive …rm,
with a linear production function: Yt (z) = Nt (z). Each …rm chooses its price subject
to a convex adjustment cost (as in Rotemberg 1982) in order to maximize the present
discounted value of its pro…ts. The government purchases a basket of the consumption
goods Gt with the same composition as the private consumption basket and levies lump-
sum taxes to …nance this spending.
    3
     The only di¤erence is that, as in Christiano and Eichenbaum (2012), we use Rotemberg pricing
rather than Calvo pricing. That is because we also solve the nonlinear model and, as it is by now well
understood, the Rotemberg model is much easier to solve nonlinearly–because it has an explicit nonlinear
Phillips curve, and it does not introduce any extra state variable. This di¤erence is immaterial insofar
as the solution of the linearized model is concerned.

     Notice that in the case = 1, the utility in (1) reduces to a separable log-log spe…cation.

   There is a constant sales subsidy that corrects the markup distortion in steady-state
and makes steady-state pro…ts equal to zero by inducing marginal cost pricing.

Useful vs. wasteful spending. We study two cases: useful and wasteful government
spending. This distinction pertains only to the spending occurring at the ZLB. In both
cases, and in the steady state away from the ZLB, government spending is determined
optimally by the typical Samuelson condition for e¢ cient public good provision:

                                     UC (Y       G) = UG (G) ;                                  (2)

where a variable without time subscript denotes a steady-state value. Condition (2) states
that the marginal utilities of private and public expenditure should be equalized.
   This condition implies the following expression for the utility weight of government
spending (see Appendix A):
                                                   (1   ) 1               (1   )(1   )
                               G             G                1       N
                      G   =            1                                                 :      (3)
                               Y             Y                    N

Assuming G=Y = :2 (in line with the average US postwar experience), together with the
other parameters in the baseline calibration described below, gives us a value for G .
    In the useful government spending case, the extra government spending at the ZLB
yields utility in precisely the same way as in the steady state away from the ZLB. In other
words, the utility weight in (1) is given by (3). In the wasteful government spending
case, the extra spending at the ZLB yields no direct utility: hence, the last term in (1)
becomes G (G1          1) = (1    ). Note that if we assumed that in the wasteful government
spending case G is zero even outside the ZLB, optimal government spending in steady
state would be zero.
    We call (steady-state) G "structural" government spending, and the extra government
spending that might occur at the ZLB "cyclical" government spending.5 Thus, our distinc-
tion between useful and wasteful spending allows for the possibility, often discussed both
in theory and in the policy debate, that government spending in the recession occurring
at the ZLB might be of a di¤erent nature than in "normal" times.6

    See Werning (2012) for a related decomposition.

    In the wasteful spending case, what the government does at the ZLB is similar to "…ll(ing) old
bottles with bank-notes (and) bury(ing) them at suitable depths in disused coal-mines" (J.M. Keynes,
The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (London: Macmillan, 1936), p. 129). The

3     The loglinearized stochastic model
In order to obtain analytical results, we start from a loglinear approximation of the
equilibrium conditions around the steady state. With a slight abuse of terminology, we
label this the "LS model", to distinguish it from other solutions of the same model and
from other models, that we introduce below. Let a lower case letter indicate a log deviation
from the steady state. The exceptions are t and it ; which are already in percentage points
and are expressed here in levels (steady-state in‡ation is zero). We obtain the following
expressions for the consumption Euler equation and for the Phillips-curve:

                                             (1      ) (1           ) N
                        ct = Et ct+1                                      (nt         Et nt+1 )         (4)
                                              1      (1            ) 1 N
                                                    1
                              [1        (1        )] (it           Et t+1  t)


                                                       N       Y       G              N       G
                   t   = Et   t+1   +        1+                            ct +                   gt    (5)
                                                   1       N       Y              1       N   Y
where N are steady state hours,         (" 1)= , and is the convex price adjustment
cost parameter (the higher ; the higher the degree of price stickiness).7 The two equa-
tions above describe the dynamics of the economy for arbitrary exogenous (stochastic or
deterministic, see below for more details) processes t and gt :

The discount rate To model the ZLB in a tractable form, we make the same Markovian
assumption as CER (2011), Woodford (2011), and several others: if the discount rate t
takes the negative value L < 0, with probability p it will be L in period t + 1 as well;
with probability 1 p it will revert to the steady state value ; once it returns to the
steady state, it remains there. We assume that the steady state value of the discount rate
metaphor is not exactly right because in our model the government taxes people in order to buy a good
produced by the private sector that has a positive marginal cost, but provides no utility once purchased
by the government. A better analogy is with cars bought by the government for the police. In our model,
these cars are useful up to the point where the Samuelson condition holds. Extra cars beyond that point
have zero utility. However, the metaphor is still useful in that buying these extra cars in our model does
reduce the output gap.

     The log-linear Phillips curve of the convex adjustment cost model is isomorphic to that obtained using
                                                                                         1
a Calvo-Yun setup; in the latter case, the slope of the Phillips curve would read =        (1    ) (1     ),
where is the probability that the price remains …xed in any given quarter.

is   =       1 = :01 in the benchmark case. Formally:
                              Prf   t+1   =   Lj t      =    Lg   = p;                     (6)
                              Prf   t+1   = j   t   =       Lg   =1        p;
                              Prf   t+1   =   Lj t      = g = 0:
Similarly, the process for gt can either take the values gL > 0 (in the liquidity trap state)
or 0 (in the steady state); since the process is perfectly correlated with the discount rate
shock generating the ZLB, it inherits the same transition matrix (transition probabilities
p and 1 p; with the steady state as an absorbing state).
    At this stage, it is useful to review the intuition of why a negative shock to the discount
rate can take the economy to the ZLB, and why government spending can have a large
multiplier at the ZLB. When the discount rate falls (the discount factor increases), the
agent would like to save more, hence to reduce current consumption. In equilibrium,
savings must be zero. With ‡exible prices, the real interest rate would become negative,
so as to convince the agent to make zero savings; as the real interest rate tracks the
natural interest rate, the output gap would also be zero.
    When prices are sticky, however, the slack in the economy generates expected de‡ation,
and this induces an increase in the real interest rate. Hence, it is the nominal interest
rate that bears all the downward adjustment on the real interest rate, so as to reduce
savings. Thus, the nominal interest rate falls as much as it can, to zero. If the fall in the
discount rate is su¢ ciently large, this is not enough to reduce savings to zero; the rest of
the adjustment is borne by income, which falls until net savings is zero. Thus, a discount
rate shock causes the economy to enter a recession and the nominal interest rate to reach
the ZLB.
    In this situation, a persistent increase in government spending raises labor demand and
therefore the real marginal cost; this translates into higher expected in‡ation, hence into a
negative real interest rate (given a zero nominal interest rate). Thus, government spending
has a particularly large multiplier because, by reducing the real interest rate, it tilts the
Euler equation towards today’s private consumption; this raises private consumption and
output today.

Monetary authority The monetary authority sets the short-term nominal interest
rate according to the feedback rule:
                                    it = max ( t +                t ; 0)                   (7)

                                                    7
We assume that the intercept is            t   = .

Solution The solution of the model consists of time-invariant equilibrium responses of
consumption and in‡ation that apply as long as the ZLB is binding. Their expressions
are

Bifurcation point The economy has two steady states: one is the zero in‡ation steady
state, and the other the ZLB. We assume the economy starts from the former. When > 0
the economy only visits the ZLB for a while because the zero in‡ation steady state is the
absorbing state of the Markov process. When < 0 the economy is subject to sunspot-
driven ‡uctuations, i.e., it can be driven into the liquidity trap state by pure sunspot
shocks with persistence p; even when L = > 0.9 Hence, = 0 is a bifurcation point
and, in the loglinearized model, an asymptote: the elasticities of endogenous variables to
shocks tend to in…nity.10 We will focus on the more standard case > 0, where liquidity
traps occur because of fundamental, rather than sunspot changes. Ceteris paribus, this
restriction is satis…ed, under both utility speci…cations, when shocks have small persistence
(p low), and prices are sticky ( low). We show below that the value of , and therefore
of the multipliers, is highly sensitive to the values of several parameters of the model.

Starvation point. Another restriction on parameters obtains by imposing non-negativity
of private consumption at the ZLB (CL > 0; or 1 + cL > 0), with no …scal policy inter-
vention (GL = G). From the expression for cL in (8), this condition boils down to
1 + (1     p) 1 L > 0: Thus, since L < 0; the economy reaches the starvation point as
it approaches (and before it reaches) the bifurcation point, since lim !0 cL = 1.

Calibration. We start with the same parameter values as CER (2011). In particular,
we assume L = 0:0025, implying a natural interest rate at the ZLB of 1 percent per
annum. In turn, this implies that output falls by 4 percent per annum, regardless of the
value of . Table 1 describes the main parameter values in this baseline case.

    To put things in a "Calvo probability" perspective, = 0:028 corresponds, in a lin-
earized equilibrium and conditional on a price elasticity of demand of 6, to a probability
of not being able to reset the price of 0:85; or an average price duration of 6:7 quarters.
Finally, given N = 1=3, G=Y = 0:2 and the optimal steady state subsidy, we have that
  = 0:2857 (see Appendix A for details). Notice that, under the baseline calibration de-
scribed above, the starvation point is reached at p = 0:82319 while the bifurcation point
is p = 0:82435.11

    The same thresholds for the Phillips curve slope are (given p = 0:8)    = 0:03669 and   = 0:03716 for
the starvation and bifurcation points, respectively.

4     Welfare and optimal spending in the loglinearized
      stochastic model
We now turn to the central theme of our analysis, the welfare implication of government
spending at the ZLB. We de…ne the welfare gap U~L as:
                                             UL (gL ) UL (0)
                             U~L (gL ) = 100                 ;                          (9)
                                                  jUL (0)j
where UL is the present discounted value of the household’s utility conditional on the
economy being at the the ZLB. Hence the welfare gap is the percentage variation in
utility between a scenario where spending increases at the ZLB, UL (gL ); and a scenario
where spending is kept constant at its steady-state value G, UL (0). See Appendix B for
a formal derivation of UL .

4.1    Approximation method
As a large literature dealing with optimal monetary policy has recognized in the context of
welfare analyses using a second order approximation to the utility function (see Woodford,
2003 Ch. 6 and Woodford, 2012 in a ZLB context), second order terms in the equilibrium
conditions are important in sticky price models for capturing the welfare costs of in‡ation.
The in‡ation distortion (be it through a real resource cost, as in the Rotemberg model, or
through relative price dispersion, as in the Calvo model) has second order e¤ects through
the resource constraint, and hence it matters for welfare, although it is negligible to …rst
order when approximated about a zero in‡ation steady-state. In particular, in our model
the resource constraint of the economy reads:
                                                Nt           Yt
                                 Ct + Gt =               =                             (10)
                                                     t        t

                        1
where t       1 2 t2        1 represents the distortion coming from in‡ation costs, and
the second equality uses the production function. A second order approximation of the
resource constraint about zero in‡ation gives:
                                        Y       G          G      1   2
                            yL = nL =               cL +     gL +     L                (11)
                                            Y              Y      2
To capture the distortion associated with imperfect price adjustment, and the way in
which government spending can alleviate it, we use (11) in the nonlinear utility function

                                                10
in order to evaluate welfare.12 We call this the "second order" approximation of the LS
model.
    In contrast, CER (2011) evaluate welfare by replacing the …rst order approximation
of the resource constraint (10),

                                                   C     G
                                            yL =     cL + g L ;                                         (12)
                                                   Y     Y
into the nonlinear utility function. To keep the comparison with CER clear, we also study
this approximation method, which we label "…rst order" approximation of the LS model.

4.2     Welfare analytics
In this section we clarify the channels through which government spending a¤ects welfare
at the ZLB. Therefore, we study the e¤ect on welfare of an increase in GL ; conditional on
being at the ZLB.
    Welfare at the ZLB is:

                                       L     [U (CL ; NL ) + v (GL )] ;

                1+ L
where      L   1+ L p
                      .   The derivative of welfare with respect to GL (ignore            L   as is invariant
to GL ):
                                           dCL                 dNL
                          UC (CL ; NL )        + UN (CL ; NL )     + v 0 (GL )                          (13)
                                           dGL                 dGL
The intratemporal optimality condition UN (CL ; NL ) = WL UC (CL ; NL ) implies that WL
is the marginal rate of substitution (MRS) of leisure for consumption, i.e., the number
of consumption units the household is willing to give up in order to have one extra hour
of leisure. From the resource constraint, CL = NL = L ; where 1= L is the marginal rate
of transformation (MRT ) of leisure into consumption, i.e., the number of units of the
good the economy must give up in order to have one more hour of leisure and stay on the
production possibility frontier. Replacing these equilibrium conditions into the derivative
  12
    Di¤erently from Woodford (2012), we use the nonlinear utility function rather than taking a second-
order approximation of the utility function; in other words, our approach captures terms of order three or
higher in utility, although these are likely to be negligible. Below, we also solve the full nonlinear model.

For simplicity, we just consider the "wasteful" case, corresponding to the terms in square
brackets (i.e., we ignore the last additive term v 0 (GL ) which is positive anyway).
    The term labeled "multiplier channel" implies a positive e¤ect on welfare if the term
(WL L ) 1 1 and the nonlinear multiplier dCL =dGL have the same sign. If the multiplier
is positive, the e¤ect is positive if and only if (WL L ) 1 > 1: The left-hand side of this
inequality, (WL L ) 1 ; is the ratio of the MRT to the MRS as de…ned above. In a steady
state without an optimal subsidy, and due to the monopolistic competition distortion,
this term exceeds one.13 At the ZLB, with a large negative output gap, the same term
widens, due to the countercyclicality of markups.14 More precisely, (WL L ) 1 is higher
when WL is low –because that is when the relative price of leisure in consumption units is
low –, and when the distortion L is low –because this is when the household gets more
consumption out of one unit of extra labor (the marginal rate of transformation is high).
The right-hand side of the inequality (WL L ) 1 > 1 captures the idea that producing
consumption requires extra work, which is costly to the household –thus representing a
negative e¤ect on welfare associated with an increase in consumption.
    To summarize, the multiplier channel implies a positive e¤ect on welfare when the
MRT exceeds the MRS, and is increasing in the multiplier. As emphasized above, a
positive consumption multiplier is a de…ning feature of the ZLB. Hence, in the presence
of a negative output gap, the multiplier channel has a generally positive contribution to
welfare at the ZLB.
    In the ZLB equilibrium, whether the MRT exceeds the MRS will depend on the equi-
librium value of in‡ation. Indeed, replacing the ZLB equilibrium value of WL as a function
of in‡ation (from the ZLB Phillips curve), one can derive a threshold value for in‡ation
(de‡ation) such that this condition holds and the e¤ect of the multiplier channel on welfare
   13
      Note that, in the steady state and under an optimal subsidy, we have W = = 1; and this channel
is shut o¤.
   14                                                                                     1
      In other words, and for a given non-linear consumption multiplier, the term (WL L )   captures
movements in the so called "labor wedge".


                                                     12
is positive (as long as the multiplier itself is positive).15 The intuition is as follows. When
de‡ation is larger than this threshold (in absolute value), the MRT (marginal product of
labor, i.e., L 1 ) still increases; but the real wage (marginal cost) increases too, and does
so by more than the marginal product of labor (MRT). That is because in the NKPC
there is a term that is linear in in‡ation, and one that is quadratic. At "low" values of
de‡ation the …rst, linear term dominates and the marginal cost goes down when in‡ation
goes down. But for large enough de‡ations, the second quadratic term dominates, and
the marginal cost increases when in‡ation falls. Of course this logic is not captured in
the linearized model because in a small neighborhood of the steady state only the linear
term matters.
    The term labeled "income e¤ect" is simply the negative income e¤ect of taxation, or
the crowding out e¤ect of government spending. This term is independent of being at the
ZLB or not, and is indeed independent of whether prices are sticky or not.
    The term labeled "in‡ation distortion" captures the ine¢ ciency stemming from move-
ments in in‡ation in a sticky price environment. That term is positive as long as the
derivative of the distortion L with respect to GL is negative (i.e., an increase in spending
                                                             d L
reduces the distortion). Note that d L =dGL = L 2L dG          L
                                                                 and, since L < 0, government
spending at the ZLB reduces the distortion and increases welfare if it is in‡ationary. In-
tuitively, creating in‡ation alleviates the de‡ation occurring at the ZLB and allows more
resources to be allocated to consumption rather than paying the adjustment cost. The
stickier prices, the larger , and the stronger this channel. This alleviation of the in‡ation
distortion through the in‡ationary e¤ect of a government spending increase constitutes
a de facto e¢ ciency gain because it expands the production possibility frontier: Notice
that the "in‡ation distortion" term is not captured in a simple …rst-order approximation
of the model, because it is of order two. Thus, a …rst-order approximation of L around

4.3     Welfare and optimal spending in the baseline scenario
Figure 1 plots the welfare gap as a function of the increase in government spending, for
a domain such that the ZLB keeps binding.16 Notice that government spending at the
ZLB is measured in units of steady state output. The left-hand and right-hand panels
display the cases of useful and wasteful government spending, respectively, for the two
approximations. In each panel, the di¤erence between the two curves is hence a measure
of the welfare e¤ect of ZLB government spending due exclusively to the second order
in‡ation distortion term.
    Two results are worth emphasizing. First, in the useful spending case, the optimal
increase in government spending at the ZLB is just 0:5 percent of steady state output in
both approximations. This value is much lower than the one in CER (2011), who report a
value of optimal government spending of 30 percent of its own steady state, which in turn
corresponds to 6 percent of steady state GDP. The main reason for this di¤erence lies in
the calculation of the optimal utility weight of government spending G from (3). The
erratum by CER (2013) provides simulation results in line with those in the left panel of
Figure 1.17
    Second, when government spending is wasteful, utility is monotonically decreasing at a
very fast rate in the …rst order approximation; as a result, the level of gL that maximizes
welfare under useful spending - 0:5 percent of GDP - would cause a decline in welfare
by 300 percent under wasteful spending.18 Utility changes much less in the second order
approximation: the optimal level of wasteful ZLB spending is 0.12 percent of GDP. The
intuition for the di¤erence between the two approximation methods is that de‡ation at
the ZLB causes a positive loss due to the quadratic term; increasing government spending
at the ZLB reduces de‡ation and therefore the utility loss. This di¤erence is particularly
noticeable in the wasteful spending case, while in the useful spending case the …rst order
  16
      The domain over which the ZLB keeps binding is determined by the condition +             L < 0; which
(upon replacing the equilibrium value of L from (8)) implies a threshold for gL .
   17
      There is still a small residual di¤erence, in that the value of optimal spending obtained by CER
(2013) is slightly higher, 0:8 percent of steady-state output. The reason is the same slight di¤erence
in the value of the Phillips curve slope        (0028 versus 0:03) that we highlighted in the Introduc-
tion. This tiny di¤erence also will play a role in sections 4.3 and 4.5. CER (2013) is available at
http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~lchrist/research/cer_gov/erratum.pdf
   18
      Notice that, because of our distinction between structural and cyclical spending, an argument for
cutting government spending cannot be made in the wasteful case. Our …nding merely implies that, if
cyclical spending is wasteful, its optimal value is zero, while structural, steady-state spending is kept at
its optimal value dictated by the Samuelson principle.

direct increase in utility brought about by government spending dominates the second
order e¤ect on utility through the in‡ation distortion.


4.4    The role of the ZLB persistence and of price rigidity
We now study how the optimal government spending depends on three key parameters:
the ZLB persistence p; the slope of the Phillips curve ; and the ZLB discount rate
 L : Recall that p measures the probability that, conditional on the economy being in
the liquidity trap in a given period, it will remain in that state in the following period.
Hence 1=(1 p) measures the expected duration of the trap and also, given the perfect
correlation between the discount rate shock and the government spending shock, the


                                                    15
expected duration of the increase in government spending: A higher p therefore means a
higher expected present value of government spending at the ZLB, hence higher expected
in‡ation (or lower expected de‡ation) and a larger decline in the real interest rate. Thus,
the multiplier is increasing in p:
    It is by now well known that in the LS model the relation between the consumption
multiplier and p is also highly non-linear: as the value of p approaches the bifurcation
point, the multiplier increases sharply.19 This is illustrated in Figure 2 (obviously this
…gure applies to both approximation methods). From this …gure, it is also clear that the
value of p = 0:8 of the baseline calibration (highlighted by a vertical dotted line) is a point
at which a marginal increase in p generates a very large increase in the multiplier, and
a huge decline in private consumption (the latter becomes exactly zero at the starvation
point p = 0:82319); both the multiplier and consumption at the ZLB are very steep
functions of p.
    We now show that not only the multiplier, but also the optimal increase in government
spending is highly nonlinear in p. The …rst panel of Figure 3 plots gL = arg max U     eL , i.e.,
the optimal increase in government spending at the ZLB (expressed in percentage points
of steady-state GDP) as a function of p. The domain for p is limited to the left by
the requirement that the ZLB be binding,20 and to the right by the starvation point
(p = 0:82319 in the baseline scenario).21 Optimal government spending at the ZLB
increases with p, to reach a maximum of 1:9 percent of GDP in the useful spending case.
The picture for the wasteful spending case is similar, except that the optimal increase
in government spending starts being positive for a slightly higher value of p. In the …rst
order approximation (second panel) the optimal increase in wasteful government spending
is 0 except when approaching the starvation point, i.e. at p = 0:816 in our grid. Thus,
using the original linearization method of CER (2011) would reinforce our conclusion,
that the optimal increase in wasteful government spending is zero except on a very small
range, and at very high declines of GDP.
    The third panel of Figure 3 displays the decline in GDP when the economy enters the
ZLB, also as a function of p. This decline too is highly nonlinear in p: as the economy
  19
     See, e.g., CER (2011) and Woodford (2011). A similar discussion applies to the nonlinearity in ;
the slope of the Phillips curve.
  20
     Formally, the lower limit is obtained by replacing the equilibrium value of in‡ation at the ZLB into
the Taylor rule: +          1 + 1 NN Y Y G    1
                                                 L < 0: For the baseline calibration, this requires p > 0:79:
  21
     Since the size of the discount rate shock is given and the fall in GDP/consumption is not otherwise
limited here, the non-starvation condition binds.

Figure 3: Optimal increase in government spending at the ZLB and decline in GDP as
a function of p: LS model:


approaches the starvation point, GDP falls by a dramatic 70 percent.
    Thus, the larger values of optimal government spending occur when the decline in
GDP and consumption is particularly high, and much higher than in any "normal" reces-
sion. The intuition is that government spending has a very large multiplier exactly when
consumption is low as a consequence of the discount rate shock, and the marginal utility
of consumption is very large. In the limit, as consumption at the ZLB is particularly
low and close to starvation, it becomes irrelevant what type of government spending is
pursued (whether it provides direct utility or not), only its multiplier matters.
    A nearly identical pattern is displayed in Figure 4, which plots the optimal increase in
government spending and the decline in GDP as a function of ; the slope of the Phillips


                                                              18
curve when expressed in terms of real marginal cost; thus, is inversely related to the
degree of price rigidity. As increases the economy gets closer to the starvation point,
implying a larger multiplier, a higher optimal increase in government spending, and a
larger decline in GDP when the economy enters the ZLB.
    Like in the case of p; the domain of in Figure 4 is dictated, respectively, by the
condition that the ZLB constraint is binding and that the economy remains below the
starvation point. In our baseline calibration, the admissible range of is between about
0:0253 and 0:0367. The range of empirical estimates of is typically between 0:002 and
0:03; thus, our baseline value of 0:028 would be at the upper end of this range.22


4.5     Holding constant the decline in GDP
Because the fall in GDP depends strongly on p and ; the exercise we have performed so far
- studying the optimal increase in government spending as a function of p and ; holding
constant L = :0025 - can lead to misleading conclusions. For instance, when p is at
its maximum admissible level, we …nd that the optimal increase in government spending
is about 1:9 percent of steady state GDP, or 6:3 percent of actual GDP. However, GDP
has declined by 70 percent from its steady state; this makes this case not particularly
interesting, and di¢ cult to evaluate.
    To address this problem, we calculate the optimal increase in spending as a function
of p and ; respectively, but at the same time varying L so that the annual decline in
GDP remains constant at its baseline value, 4 percent. We do not have a feel for the
appropriate value of the discount rate shock (which we interpret as a shortcut for whatever
causes the economy to hit the ZLB), while a 4 percent GDP decline is a reasonable
de…nition of a sizeable recession.
    Figure 5 displays the optimal increase in government spending as a function of p (as
usual, the increase in spending is expressed in units of steady state GDP); the implied
  22
     For instance, in the classic study of Galí and Gertler (1999) for the US, the estimate of the Phillips
curve slope coe¢ cient on the real marginal cost, in a speci…cation with no lagged term on in‡ation, as ours,
is 0:023. In our setup, that would imply a value of optimal government spending of nearly zero (provided
that the ZLB is binding). In general, values of for which, in our simulations, optimal government
spending exceeds 1 percent of steady state GDP are well above available empirical estimates. See also
Erceg and Linde (2013) on this point. Braun, Körber, and Waki (2013) …nd a posterior mode estimate of
the Rotemberg adjustment cost parameter of 458:4. Given their value for " = 7:67, this implies a value
of = 0:0214 in their case (and a value of = 0:0109 in our case, given " = 6).

absolute values of the discount rate are plotted in the bottom panel, in annualized terms.23
Two …ndings emerge. In the useful spending case, the optimal increase in government
spending is low for most of the domain, reaching a maximum value of about 0:6 percent
of steady-state GDP at p = 0:78. However, as p increases further and approaches the
bifurcation point p = 0:824, the optimal ZLB spending falls sharply back to zero.24
     In the wasteful spending case, on the other hand, optimal ZLB spending is identically
zero except for values of p between about 0:80 and 0:82. Once again, in the …rst order
approximation the range over which the optimal increase in wasteful government spending
is positive is even smaller: in our grid search, from 0:821 to 0:823. Near the bifurcation,
optimal government spending is small because, as the multiplier is so large, the discount
rate shock required to achieve a 4 percent decline in GDP is minuscule; as a consequence,
the ZLB stops binding at low values of government spending. In the same region, optimal
government spending is identical in the useful and wasteful spending cases, because the
extremely large multipliers - of both spending itself and of the discount rate shock - make
the welfare e¤ect of spending through boosting private consumption dominate the direct
utility e¤ect, which becomes irrelevant.
     Figure 6 plots the optimal increase in government spending at the ZLB as a function
of . Again, as varies we vary also L so that the decline in GDP is constant at 4
percent per annum. The pattern is the same as in Figure 5. The largest value of the
optimal spending in the useful spending case is just 0:5 percent of steady state GDP, and
it is achieved around the point corresponding to the baseline calibration = 0:028; as we
approach the bifurcation region, optimal spending at the ZLB decreases abruptly. Like
before, in the wasteful spending case the optimal increase in spending is zero on a larger
range in the second order approximation than in the …rst order approximation.
     This last result for wasteful spending is in apparent contradiction with that of CER
(2013), who argue that utility is increasing in government spending even when the latter
is wasteful. However, CER (2013) depart from the baseline calibration previously used
in CER (2011) (the …rst order approximation in our paper) in two respects. First, they
assume = 0:03 instead of = 0:028. Second, they assume a larger value for the discount
  23
     Note that very low values of p require somewhat implausibly large values of the discount factor shock
in order to deliver a 4 percent fall in GDP: e.g. 9 percent per annum when p = 0:5.
  24
     Since the fall in GDP (and implicitly, consumption) is limited to 4 percent here, starvation never
occurs. Therefore, all …gures which are plotted for a given fall in GDP have a domain for p or that goes
arbitrarily close to the bifurcation point. Since multipliers become arbitrarily large when approaching
bifurcation, the discount rate shock becomes arbitrarily small.

rate shock, L = 0:01 rather than L = 0:0025. These two seemingly small di¤erences
generate radically di¤erent welfare conclusions.
    The left panel of Figure 7 illustrates this point by plotting optimal wasteful spending
at the ZLB as a function of , for the two values of the shock mentioned above and for
the …rst order approximation only (in the case of L = 0:0025, this replicates the middle
panel of Figure 4). The right panel plots the implied fall in GDP, in percentage points.
When L = 0:0025, optimal spending at the ZLB is zero for = 0:03; and indeed for any
  < 0:034. When L = 0:01; optimal spending at the ZLB is 1 percent of steady-state
GDP precisely at = 0:03: However, this latter calibration also implies a very large fall in
output of 20 percent - larger than any peacetime recession experienced in the developed
world in modern history, except for the Great Depression. In fact, recall from Figure
6 that when the size of the fall in GDP is …xed at 4 percent, optimal spending in the
wasteful case is generally zero under this approximation method.


5      Alternative models and solution methods
There are two reasons why the conclusions from the LS model might not hold with gen-
erality. First, the nonlinearity of the model: the shock that makes the ZLB bind might
be too large for the loglinear approximation to be su¢ ciently accurate. Indeed, Braun,
Körber, and Waki (2012) and Christiano and Eichenbaum (2013) have shown that, when
solving the full nonlinear stochastic model, the multiplier does not explode when reaching
the bifurcation point. To address this concern, we next derive the full nonlinear solution
of the stochastic model. We label this case NLS model.25
    Second, the bifurcation issue arises only in models with stochastic duration of the ZLB.
Carlstrom, Fuerst and Paustian (2013) have shown that, when both the shock generating
the liquidity trap and government spending follow deterministic processes with a given
duration, the multiplier is much smaller than in the stochastic case; in addition, no
bifurcation occurs, and the multiplier is monotonically increasing in the duration. We
label the loglinearized version of such a model the "linear deterministic" model, or LD
model. In the baseline case, we assume that the duration of the liquidity trap is TL = 5,
  25
    The results reported below for the NLS model are derived under the assumption that there is no
steady state optimal subsidy (the steady state is ine¢ cient). As emphasized by Benigno and Woodford
(2003), when the steady state is distorted government spending acts like a cost-push shock, so it has an
additional welfare-damaging e¤ect not captured by the model when linearized around an e¢ cient steady
state. Results for the NLS model under an optimal subsidy are, however, qualitatively similar.

5.1                       The nonlinear stochastic model
In the NLS model, the multiplier (not shown) is e¤ectively almost a linear function of p; in
particular, now it does not explode close to the bifurcation point. Despite this di¤erence,
the optimal increase in government spending at the ZLB does not di¤er substantially from
what we have seen in the LS case. Figures 8 and 9 are the analogues of Figures 5 and 6
respectively, but for the NLS model instead of the LS model.

    Now the maximum optimal increase in government spending for any given p or is
slightly higher than in the LS model; due to the approximation error in the latter. On the
other hand, in the wasteful spending case, the increase in government spending is positive
only on a much smaller region than in the second-order approximation of the LS model.

5.2     The linear deterministic model
The results from the LD model are displayed in Figures 10 and 11.26 In the useful
spending case solved with the …rst order approximation method (middle panels), the
optimal increase in government spending is around 0:4 percent of steady state output for
values of TL 5 (Figure 10) and for values of in the range considered previously (Figure
11).27 For higher values of TL , which in the LS model would take the economy to the
sunspot region, the optimal spending in the useful case increases to values as high as 0:7
percent (Figure 10); the same result applies for higher values of (Figure 11). Lastly,
when the LD model is solved with the second order approximation method (top panels),
optimal ZLB spending in the useful case is higher, for reasons that are by now clear.
    Nevertheless, in the wasteful case, optimal spending at the ZLB is uniformly zero,
for both the …rst- and second-order approximations, on the whole admissible ranges of
p and . This reinforces the point that the positive values of optimal wasteful ZLB
spending found with the previous solution methods (and in a very small and extreme
range of parameter values) are speci…c to the stochastic setting. Note also that, in the
LD model, the shock needed to achieve a 4 percent decline in GDP is much larger than in
the stochastic model. The main reason is that, in the LD model, the e¤ects of a decline
in L are signi…cantly smaller.

5.3     Summary of results
Table 2 provides a summary of the results. We consider two experiments for each solution
method. In the …rst (column 1), the discount rate at the ZLB is kept constant at L =
 :0025 (1 percent per annum); in the second (column 2), L is such that the resulting
  26
      In this deterministic environment, we consider a slightly di¤erent monetary policy rule. The intercept
is now given by the time varying discount rate rather than the discount rate in the steady state : t = t
in (7). This ensures that the duration of the ZLB, which is now endogenous, coincides with the exogenous
duration of the shock. Carlstrom, Fuerst and Paustian (2013) use the same speci…cation.
   27
      Nakata (2013) also argues that, at least under commitment, optimal government spending at the
ZLB is higher in a stochastic environment than in a deterministic one.

    In the NLS model, consumption is a non-linear function of government spending, so the multiplier
is not constant with respect to the level of spending. The range of cyclical spending is dictated by the
requirement that the ZLB binds.


                                                                                               31
    Two conclusions stand out. First, in the useful spending case the optimal increase in
government spending varies between 0.0 and 1.1 when L = 0:0025 (column 7), but it
is a modest 0.5 percent in the relevant case, that of the NLS model; it varies between 0.0
and 0.8 when the decline in GDP is kept constant at 4 percent (column 8), but it is a very
small 0.1 percent in the NLS model. Second, in the wasteful case, the optimal government
spending increase is always zero in all models and in all scenarios except in the second
order approximation of the LS model„where it is again a very small 0.1 percent.


6     Optimal spending in a Great Depression
Our analysis thus far has focused mostly on recessions that, while substantial, are still
moderate in size when compared to the Great Depression. An argument could be made
that government spending at the ZLB is particularly desirable when the ensuing recession
is exceptionally deep. In our analysis, several alternative calibrations could deliver a GDP
collapse of 28.8%, which is in line with the Great Depression data; with such calibrations,
optimal ZLB spending would be higher, of the order of 2 to 4-5percent of steady-state
output.29 However, the issue with replicating a Great Depression with this calibration
is that it implies movements in de‡ation that are unrealistically large, i.e. annualized
de‡ations of about 32 to 40 percent, while annualized de‡ation during that period has
been 10 percent.

6.1     The Great Depression in the LS model
To address these concerns, in Appendix D we study a slightly di¤erent setup, similar
to Woodford (2011), with a calibration that can deliver a Great Depression along both
dimensions: GDP collapse of 28.8 percent and de‡ation of 10 percent, both in annualized
terms. This is due chie‡y to the value of two key parameters: the Phillips curve is much
‡atter, = 0:003147 (i.e., consistent with a su¢ ciently high degree of price stickiness in
order to avoid too large a collapse in in‡ation), and the persistence of the shock is higher,
p = 0:903. This calibration has important implications for the welfare results that we
  29
     For instance, start by looking at Figures 3, 4, and 7. A calibration such that GDP falls by 28.8
percent implies p = 0:821 in Figure 3 or = 0:0359 in Figure 4 . Optimal ZLB spending in the useful
case is around 1:7 percent of GDP while in the wasteful case it is about 1:5 percent. When L = 0:01
as in Figure 7, = 0:032 delivers a Great Depression and optimal ZLB spending in the wasteful case of
almost 4 percent (see Figure 7) while in the useful case it is 5:5 percent (not shown).


                                                 32
describe next.
    Table 3 mirrors Table 2 in presenting the main results for the Great Depression envi-
ronment. Note that the second row, headed "LS, second order", replicates the results of
Woodford (2011).30 The optimal increase in useful government spending at the ZLB is
large, 11:5 percent of steady state GDP in the …rst order approximation and 14:5 in the
second order approximation. When we assume that spending is wasteful, we still …nd a
sizeable optimal increase of 5:5 percent for the …rst order and 13:5 percent for the second
order approximation, respectively. The reason why these numbers are so high is twofold.

cause the Great Depression calibration is very close to the bifurcation point. To illustrate
this, Figure 12 plots (like Figure 2) the multiplier and the level of consumption at the ZLB
as a function of persistence p. It is clear from the picture that the value p = 0:903 is a
point at which an arbitrarily small increase in p leads to an explosive multiplier and brings
the economy arbitrarily close to the starvation point (consumption becomes exactly zero
at p = 0:91346).31 In other words, both the multiplier and ZLB consumption are almost
vertical at p = 0:903:
    Second, in order to replicate the de‡ation data associated with the Great Depression,
we had to assume an extremely large degree of price rigidity, implying a value of =
  31
    A similar picture holds with the Phillips curve slop on the x-axis: starvation occurs at                          = 0:004; so
given an increase in of merely 0:0008 from the calibrated value.


                                                                 34
0:003147. The Rotemberg price adjustment cost parameter consistent with this value of
  is = 1588. Translated in the Calvo framework, this implies a 0:95 probability of not
adjusting the price in any given quarter, or an expected price duration of 20 quarters (…ve
years).32
    This extreme price stickiness translates into an enormous welfare cost of the output
gap –the more so, when the shock is large (as it is here, L = :01) and hence the output
gap itself is large. This large welfare cost of the ZLB explains why, in this framework,
there is scope for increasing government spending at the ZLB even when it is wasteful.

6.2     The Great Depression in the NLS and LD models
The LS model of the Great Depression displays a more extreme version of the usual
problems: since the calibrations are so close to the bifurcation point, an arbitrarily small
change in one of the parameters can generate very large changes in the conclusions, making
any welfare inference unreliable. In addition, the large size of the shock necessary to obtain
a large fall in GDP renders the loglinear approximation potentially inaccurate. Thus, like
before, we now turn to the NLS and the LD models.
    In the NLS model we still …nd a very large optimal increase in government spending
in the useful case, by 25.5 percent of GDP. Strikingly, however, as Table 3 shows the
optimal increase in wasteful spending is still zero. The reason is that now the output gap
falls by much less than GDP. To see this, note that GDP = C + G, while output is GDP
net of the price adjustment cost, Yt = (Ct + Gt ) = 1 2 t2 : In the LS case, the price
adjustment cost is loglinearized around the zero in‡ation steady state, hence it is always
zero: output falls by as much as GDP, 28.8 percent. In the NLS case, the price adjustment
cost is positive because of the large de‡ation; hence, after the discount rate shock output
must be larger then GDP. In fact, output now falls by only 8.5 percent, implying a smaller
output gap than in the LS case. This explains why at the ZLB spending in the wasteful
case is still zero.
  32
    It is important to note that these calculations are based on the standard New Keynesian model with
homogeneous labor types, as used in our case and, e.g., in Woodford (2011). Eggertsson (2009), from
which the calibration in Woodford (2011) is taken, uses a model of the labor market with di¤ erentiated
labor types, hence obtaining (by standard arguments pertaining to real rigidities) the same value of the
Phillips curve parameter with a lower degree of price stickiness. However, Eggertsson (2009) does not
study welfare. We use the same model and calibration as Woodford (2011) in order to facilitate the
comparison.




                                                  35
    However, in order to generate the Great Depression, the LD model requires a phe-
nomenally large discount rate shock of 22 percent per annum, more than …ve times the
shock required in the LS model to generate the same decline in GDP. Still, the optimal
increase in useful spending is less than in the LS model, 9:5 percent of steady state GDP in
the linear approximation and 10 percent in the second order approximation, against 11:5
percent and 14:5 percent in the LS model, respectively. This illustrates once more how
the LS model ampli…es the value of optimal spending, simply because of the stochastic
nature of the model.
    Like in the NLS model, the optimal increase in wasteful government spending in the LD
case is still zero, in both approximations. Put di¤erently, the LS model delivers positive
ZLB spending in the wasteful case both because it is linear and because it is stochastic.
Dropping either of those two features eliminates the scope for wasteful spending–even
when the welfare distortion associated with the ZLB is large.
    On the other hand, it is true that in the Great Depression case we …nd very large
optimal increases in government spending in the useful case, even in a deterministic setup
and even more so in a nonlinear setup (which accounts for the distortions fully). But
these large values stem from extremely high welfare distortions associated with the zero
lower bound, coming from what one might view as an implausibly high degree of price
rigidity–a feature which is necessary, to start with, for the model’s ability to replicate the
de‡ation observed during the Great Depression.


7     Conclusion
For sizeable recessions, and in the context of a standard New Keynesian model, the optimal
increase in government spending at the ZLB is small, or zero. At the benchmark values of
the parameters of the model that have typically been used in the literature, the optimal
increase in government spending in a 4 percent recession is just 0.8 percent. Larger
optimal increases in (useful) government spending obtain only at parameter values that
imply extremely large output declines, in the range observed during the Great Depression
- and even in these cases, the model requires a somewhat extreme degree of price rigidity
to generate the combination of output decline and (relatively small) de‡ation observed in
that historical episode.
    Perhaps more importantly, we have shown that when cyclical government spending
does not provide direct utility, the optimal increase in government spending at the ZLB

                                             36
is zero in all versions of our model - stochastic or deterministic, even in a scenario like
the Great Depression where output falls by almost 30 percent. Thus, this simple model
does not provide support for the often heard notion that anything that reduces the output
gap and prevents de‡ation - including wasteful government spending - should be used at
the ZLB. This is a particularly surprising result, for it suggests that within the class of
models typically used to analyze the aggregate implications of liquidity traps (mostly New
Keynesian models) the welfare cost of being at the ZLB is of second-order relative to the
(…rst-order) welfare cost of increasing government spending and, therefore, taxation.
    Our results suggest that for higher government spending to be welfare enhancing
at the ZLB the underlying model economy must be able to generate signi…cant welfare
costs of being at the ZLB. Promising examples in this vein are models with equilibrium
unemployment and imperfect consumption insurance, such as Christiano, Walentin and
Trabandt (2012), Rendahl (2013) and Michaillat (2012); and/or models where the main
nominal stickiness is some form of downward rigidity in wages, such as Schmitt-Grohe
and Uribe (2013).
    Finally, despite government spending not being welfare-improving in a certain eco-
nomic environment, other …scal instruments may well be. In a companion paper (Bilbiie,
Monacelli and Perotti, 2014) we study the e¤ects of tax cuts …nanced by public debt at
the ZLB, as a form of implicit transfer from unconstrained savers to constrained borrow-
ers. In that framework, a uniform tax cut …nanced by public debt is Pareto improving
because it alleviates the constraint on private debt for borrowers and allows savers to
frontload their savings, something that is prevented by the presence of the ZLB. That
paper substantiates a claim often made in policy circles that if a liquidity trap is due to
excess savings, there are potential bene…ts for the government to step in and borrow via
a tax cut.

The setup is a standard New Keynesian model along the lines of Woodford (2003) and
CER (2011), except for the assumption of convex costs of price adjustment (as opposed to
Calvo pricing). There is a representative household;with period utility given in the text,
who solves the intertemporal problem:

                                                    P1
                                         max E0      t=0 t U   (Ct ; Nt ; Gt )
                                        fCt ;Nt g

subject to the period-by-period budget constraint:
                                                    1 + It 1
                                     Ct + Bt+1               Bt + Wt Nt           t;                  (A.1)
                                                     1+ t
where Wt is the real wage, 1 + t      Pt =Pt 1 is the gross in‡ation rate, Bt is a portfolio
of one-period bonds issued in t 1 on which the household receives nominal interest It 1
(in equilibrium the net supply of these bonds is nil), and t are lump-sum taxes.
    Under the assumption that U (Ct ; Nt ; Gt ) is as in (1), the intratemporal optimality
condition and Euler equation for bond holdings are respectively:33

Each individual good is produced by a monopolistic competitive …rm, indexed by z, using
a technology given by: Yt (z) = Nt (z). Cost minimization taking the wage as given,
implies that real marginal cost is Wt =Pt : The problem of producer z is to maximize the
present value of future pro…ts, discounted using the stochastic discount factor of their
shareholders, the households:

Since Ricardian equivalence holds, we assume without loss of generality that the budget

A monetary authority sets the nominal interest rate subject to a zero lower bound, as
described in (7) and/or (A.7). In an equilibrium of this economy, all agents take as given
prices (with the exception of monopolists who reset their good’s price in a given period),
as well as the evolution of exogenous processes. A rational expectations equilibrium is
then as usual a sequence of processes for all prices and quantities introduced above such
that the optimality conditions hold for all agents and all markets clear at any given time
t. Speci…cally, labor market clearing requires that labor demand equal total labor supply,

   Steady state and loglinearized equilibrium As described in text, we solve the
model by loglinearizing the equilibrium conditions around the steady state, with = 0.
Letting a capital letter without a time subscript indicate a steady state value, we have
                                                                      "       1

We calibrate G = 0:2Y and Y = N = 1=3; implying that the second equation pins down
the value of :

Note that s is the subsidy that takes values between 0 and (" 1) 1 : We solve the
loglinearized model assuming that there is a constant subsidy that induces marginal cost
pricing in steady state and makes pro…ts equal to zero, s = (" 1) 1 and W = 1:
    A loglinear approximation of the Phillips curve (A.5) around a zero-in‡ation steady
state delivers:


                                        t   = Et         t+1     + wt :
where wt denotes deviations of the real wage (or real marginal cost) from the deterministic
steady state. Loglinearizing labor supply (A.2) we have: 1 NN nt = wt ct , where which
combined with the production function yt = nt and a …rst-order approximation of the
economy resource constraint (A.6), yt = (1 GY ) ct + GY gt gives

Replacing this in the loglinearized Phillips curve, we obtain the Phillips curve used in
text. Finally, we calibrate     (" 1)= and we obtain by using the calibrated value

B     Appendix B: Utility at the zero lower bound
In this Appendix we derive the analytical expression for the present discounted value of
utility conditional upon being at the ZLB used for the welfare calculations in text. Utility
at the ZLB is, in the "useful G" case (recall that in the "wasteful" case we simply replace
GL by G) reads:

where L 1+1+L L p : In the text we presented log-linearized model solutions, where lower-

Next, we rewrite utility in order to have the percentage deviations as arguments. This
yields:
        8h                                         i1                               9

                                           N
                                                          1       G1 (1 + gL )1
UL = L                                                      + G                        :
        >
        :                        1                                       1          >
                                                                                    ;

We can simplify this further by replacing the steady-state optimality conditions. First,
under the optimal subsidy that makes real wage (markup) equal to one in steady state,
we have that:
                                                       1
                                        1 N Y
                                 = 1+                    < 1:
                                          N Y G
Second, the Samuelson condition for public goods provision requires that the marginal
utilities of private and public expenditure be equal. This implies that, in steady state:
                                h             i1
                                  C (1 N )1
                                                   = GG :
                                        C
                                                 43
Solving for     G   yields:

                                                         (1       ) 1                   (1   )(1       )
                                       G             G                      1       N
                         G    =                 1                                                          :

We use the above expression to simplify the welfare function, abstracting from a constant
additive term (which anyway disappears when we look at percentage deviations of welfare,
as we do):

state value G, UL (0).
    When using the "linearized" approximation method, we replace yL in the nonlinear
utility (B.1) by using the …rst-order approximation of the resource constraint (12). When
using the "second-order in‡ation cost" approximation method, we replace yL in the non-
linear utility (B.1) by using the second-order approximation of the resource constraint
(11).

linear stochastic (NLS) and linearized deterministic (LD).

C.1        Nonlinear stochastic model
In this case, we solve directly for the nonlinear equations from Appendix A assuming
the same Markov structure for shocks as in the linearized model34 . The steady state is
solved as previously, with = 0, namely (A.8) and C = Y G: In all simulations for the
nonlinear model, we assume that there is no subsidy, i.e., s = 0:
    The liquidity trap state is, like in the linearized model, a time-invariant solution, but
in this case to the nonlinear system, holding as long as ZLB binds: Denoting with L
subscript the value of a variable in the liquidity trap state, the equilibrium is determined
by the system (note that in the regular steady state is zero, which simpli…es considerably
the Phillips curve):

    Note that discount factor shocks a¤ect the Phillips curve too (see also Braun et al. 2013 and Chris-
tiano and Eichenbaum 2013). This was not the case in the linearized model because loglinearization
around a zero-in‡ation steady state implies that discount factor shocks have no …rst-order e¤ects on the
Phillips curve.

C.2     Linearized deterministic model

shocks take the values t = L and gt = gL from 1 to an arbitrary time T; and zero
thereafter. Note that T is a parameter. For t from 1 to T , we need to solve the system

The solution holds as long as the zero lower bound binds–which is dictated by the Taylor
rule. As already mentioned in text, the policy rule we use in this setup is (as in Carlstrom,
Fuerst and Paustian, 2013) with t = t in (7). This rule ensures that the now endogenous
duration of the ZLB coincides with the duration of the exogenous shock T (in other words,
when using instead of t the ZLB stops binding earlier than T ).

D      Appendix D: Government spending at the ZLB

In this Appendix, we study optimal government spending in a slightly di¤erent setup
that has been analyzed in Woodford (2011); this setup and the calibration studied below
deliver a ZLB-driven recession that is of the size of the Great Depression. The utility
speci…cation — indicated with a superscript S — is separable in consumption and hours:

    To facilitate comparison with Woodford (2011) who assumes optimal monetary policy,
we assume that the monetary policy rule takes the form: it = max (rt ; 0) ; where rt
is the ‡exible-price natural interest rate35 . In particular, rt is calculated as follows.
From the Phillips curve (D.3), the natural level of consumption under separable utility
                                   1 G
reads: ct = ' ' 1 YG +                 g . Replacing this in the Euler equation (D.2), and
                                     Y t
simplifying, yields the following expression for the natural interest rate :

    The Great Depression calibration
    We …rst describe how the calibration of Woodford (2011), which delivers a Great
Depression, is obtained in our model. The utility function used by Woodford is: u (C) +
g (G) v (N ) ;with elasticities

                                             u00 Y                          g 00 Y                   v 00 Y
                                 u   =             ;           g   =               ;         v   =
                                              u0                              g0                      v0
  35
    We abstract from well-understood local determinacy issues associated with the equilibrium outside
the ZLB, since our focus is on the ZLB equilibrium.


                                                                       48
For our utility function in (D.1) the mapping is hence:

                                                  Y                        Y
                                  u   =                   ;    g   =         ;      v   ='
                                              Y       G                    G
Note that since G=Y = 0:2 and we have the same curvature for utility in G and C, we
can only consider one of the cases considered by Woodford (2011) in his Figure 4, namely
case B in which g = 4 u :The parameters calibrated by Woodford are:


                                      u
                                                  = 0:425
                                  u   +       v
                                 (1               ) (1        )
                                                                   (   u   +   v)   = 0:00859
                                          1
                                 ( u)         = 0:862

In terms of our parameters, this can be expressed (replacing the mapping found above)
as:

                                                              G
                                                                       = 0:425

                                              1       Y
                                                                  G
                                                          1       Y
                                                                       = 0:862;

which given G=Y (= 0:2) can be solved easily to deliver:

                              = 0:928 07;                = 0:0031469; ' = 1:5695

Lastly, given = 0:997; the value of implies, in the Calvo model with homogenous
labor as in Woodford (2011), a probability of not adjusting the price of = 0:946 82; or
an average price duration of 20 quarters.36
  36
     It is important to note that these calculations are based on the standard New Keynesian model with
homogeneous labor types, as used in our case and, e.g., in Woodford (2012). Eggertsson (2009), from
which the calibration in Woodford (2012) is taken, uses a model of the labor market with di¤ erentiated
labor types, hence obtaining (by standard arguments pertaining to real rigidities) the same value of the
Phillips curve parameter with a lower degree of price stickiness. However, Eggertsson (2009) does not
study welfare. We use the same model and calibration as Woodford (2012) in order to facilitate the
comparison.

Using the Samuelson condition combined with the resource constraint, we therefore obtain:

which, for GY = 0:2, delivers a unique G . Finally, the weight of labor in utility =
N ('+ ) (1 (G=Y )) can be chosen to match steady-state hours worked.

   Notice that we are constrained in our choice of the size of the shock. Considering even larger shocks,
under the Great Depression, leads easily to a violation of the non-negativity constraint on consumption.

delivers a contraction in output of 28:8 percent (in annualized terms), in line with
the Great Depression data— se the row labelled "LS" in Table 5. In the case of useful
spending, the optimal increase in government spending is 11:5 percent of GDP. In the
wasteful government spending case, the optimal increase in government spending is 5:5
percent of GDP. Importantly, this is the only case across all our experiments (including
di¤erent solution methods for this same calibration— see below) in which we …nd that
government spending can increase welfare at the ZLB under the assumption of wasteful
spending.
    The optimal increase in government spending under the Great Depression calibration
is large because prices are now extremely sticky (an expected duration of 20 quarters),
implying that the welfare cost of de‡ation is also extremely large; hence the rationale
for using government spending in order to close the gap with respect to the ‡exible-
price equilibrium is at its strongest. In addition, the shock is very persistent (p = :903),
implying a very large output collapse, but also a large government spending multiplier,
hence a large incentive to use government spending as a stabilization tool. In other words,
the economy is very close to the bifurcation point that we discussed above; in fact, the
parameter ; is now 0:0028.
    However, the results are once again extremely sensitive to the expected duration of
the liquidity trap. Table 5 below summarizes the e¤ect of varying, ceteris paribus, the
conditional probability pon the optimal size of government spending at the ZLB when
all remaining parameters are kept equal to their values under the Great Depression cali-
bration. If p is reduced from p = 0:903 to p = 0:8 (i.e., the value under the benchmark
calibration), or to p = 0:7; the optimal increase in government spending plunges, in the
case of useful spending, from 11:5 percent to 1:5 percent and 0:8percent, respectively; while
for the rest of the domain for which the ZLB keeps binding (up to around 30 respectively
40 percent of GDP under these calibrations), utility decreases abruptly. Moreover, in the
case of wasteful spending, utility is sharply decreasing in government spending. Already
for p = 0:8 the optimal increase in government spending is zero.

    It is worth noticing that the size of the shock under the Great Depression calibration
is rather extreme. This raises some concern about the accuracy of the …rst order approxi-
mation, especially in an equilibrium where the policy function, in principle, should exhibit
a kink due to the presence of a ZLB constraint. We turn to these considerations next. As
for the baseline calibration, we study the implications of solving the model for the Great
Depression calibration using the other two approaches: nonlinear stochastic (NLS), and
linearized deterministic (LD). Detail of the solution methods parallel those outlines above
for the benchmark model. The results are presented in Table 3 in text, following the same
structure as in Table 2. For the linear deterministic model, we assume that the duration
of the liquidity trap is TL = 10, to make it comparable with the expected duration in the
stochastic trap case, which is 1=(1 0:903) = 10:3:
    As with the baseline calibration, the multiplier is smaller in the NLS model and one
order of magnitude smaller in the deterministic model. Likewise, the output collapse is
smaller in the NLS model and several times smaller in the deterministic models. When
cyclical spending provides a direct utility bene…t, optimal spending is one order of mag-
nitude smaller in the deterministic model than in the stochastic models, which (as usual)
are plagued by the bifurcation issue discussed above.38 Finally, even under this extreme
calibration optimal cyclical spending in the wasteful case is zero in all cases, except for
the linearized stochastic case.

    Note that in the NLS model, as in the loglin stochastic case, when we decrease the probability p to
0:7 optimal spending in the useful case is much smaller, about 1 percent of steady state output.
