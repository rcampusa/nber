                                              ABSTRACT

We study the effect of birth weight on long-run outcomes, including permanent income, income across
various stages of the lifecycle, education, social benefits take-up, and adult mortality. For this purpose,
we have linked a unique dataset on nearly all Swedish twins born between 1926- 1958, containing
information on birth weight, to administrative records spanning nearly entire life time lab or market
histories. We find that birth weight positively affects permanent income and income across large parts
of the life cycle, although there is some evidence of a fade out after age 50. Our results indicate that
lower birth weight children are more likely to avail of social insurance programs such as unemployment
and sickness insurance and that birth weight matters for adult mortality. We supplement our main
analysis with more recent data, which enables us to study how the impact of birth weight on income
and education of young adults has changed across cohorts born almost 50 years apart.

1        Introduction
     Economic research in the last decade has shown considerable consensus on

the importance of early childhood health in determining various short and long

term outcomes (Almond and Currie 2011; Heckman 2007). Birth outcomes, and

in particular birth weight, has been shown to matter for educational achieve-

ment in school, completed years of education, IQ and labor market outcomes

such as employment and earnings. Not only have the economic outcomes ex-

amined been numerous, but the settings just as varied, with studies using data

from developed countries like the United States, Canada, and Norway to mid-

dle income countries like Chile, China and Taiwan and even in less developed

countries like South Africa.
                                   1

     One of the key reasons to examine the role of birth weight over the life cycle

is to answer questions about the persistence of health inequalities at birth.

However, despite the rich number of studies and geographical settings, data

limitations have largely prevented an examination of the role of birth weight

in determining long-term outcomes, such as permanent income, income across

each point in the life-cycle, take up of various social assistance programs, and

adult mortality.
                     2 For example, the income dierences due to birth weight found

by Black, Devereux, and Salvanes (2007) are measured around age 30; while

this is an important result, it is also useful to examine whether these dierences

persist, increase, or fade with age. The recent literature on in utero assaults (see

Almond (2006), Almond and Mazumder (2011) and Roseboom et al (2001)) has

found persistent long run impacts of harm to the fetal environment.
                                                                                   3

     Our paper adds to this important literature by addressing the long term

eects of low birth weight. First, we study the impact of birth weight on per-

manent income. Previous studies have been limited to studying the eect of

    1A   sample of these studies in Economics include: Almond, Chay, and Lee (2005), Royer
(2009), Black, Devereux, and Salvanes (2007), Behrman and Rosenzweig (2004), Oreopoulos,
Stabile, Walld, and Roos (2008), Bharadwaj, Eberhard, and Neilson (2014), Lin and Liu
(2009), Cooper and Sandler (1997) and more recently Figlio, Guryan, Karbownik, and Roth
(2015). The literature in medicine and public health on the links between birth weight and
short and long term outcomes is also equally large. Relevant to our study however, it appears
that this literature has not been able to examine birth weight and old age outcomes within a
causal framework.
    2 While   other birth outcomes such as gestational age are extremely important in this con-
text, we only examine birth weight in this study since a natural experiment providing us with
arguably exogenous variation in gestational age is not possible in this setting.
    3 There   are many more papers that look at long run eects of in utero assaults. A small
sampling of other papers of interest in this area are: Almond, Edlund, and Palme (2009),
Mazumder, Almond, Park, Crimmins, and Finch (2010), Lin and Liu (2012) and Van Ewijk
(2011).




                                                2
birth weight on income at relatively young adult ages.
                                                                   4

       Second, our data allows us to study the impact of birth weight on income

at dierent stages of the lifecycle. In the fetal origins literature, poor early life

environment, as reected by low birth weight, aects long-run health through

programming changes (Almond and Currie 2011). These changes makes people

more susceptible to heart disease and metabolic syndrome and since these out-

comes often occur later in life one can expect a stronger eect of birth weight on

labor productivity as people age.
                                          5 With our data, we can study if the impact

of birth weight increases by age due to the fetal origins eect.

       Third, we study the eect of birth weight on social assistance takeup. By

doing so, we provide yet another way of quantifying the long term benets of

programs that are aimed at improving birth outcomes (for example see Bitler

and Currie (2005)).
                           6   Recent work has suggested that social assistance pro-

grams not directly intended to improve early childhood health appear to have

important spillovers (Hoynes, Schanzenbach, and Almond 2012); hence, under-

standing whether better infant health itself leads to lower social assistance take

up is important.

       Fourth, we study the eect of birth weight on adult mortality. While there

are many studies in epidemiology that address the link between birth weight and

adult mortality, these studies largely compute correlations rather than causal

estimates.
               7 Particularly in the instance of examining birth weight and mortality,

we know from studies like Almond, Chay, and Lee (2005) that ordinary least

squares estimates tend to be severely overestimated.

   4 For    example, Black, Devereux, and Salvanes (2007) examine the relationship between
birth weight and income for people in the age range of 25-35 years, Behrman and Rosenzweig
(2004) use income as observed around age 45 and only for women and Oreopoulos, Stabile,
Walld, and Roos (2008) examine the take up of social assistance between the ages of 18-22. A
recent paper by Bhuller, Mogstad, and Salvanes (2011) suggests that life cycle bias in returns
to education is minimized around age 32 in Norway. Hence, the paper by Black, Devereux,
and Salvanes (2007) is fairly consistent with life cycle earnings estimates.     Specic to our
context in Sweden, BÃ¶hlmark and Lindquist (2006) show that life cycle bias is an issue when
analyzing Swedish earnings data.
   5 It   is also possible that there are latent eects on productivity that manifest themselves
before the actual health shock occurs.
   6 Although    in the Swedish context the term assistance" refers exclusively to welfare, we
use it interchangeably with benets" to imply take up of unemployment insurance, welfare
etc.
   7A     recent meta-analysis of the relationship between birth weight and adult mortality found
that birth weight mattered for mortality, and particularly so for mortality due to cardiovascular
reasons (Risnes et al 2011).      However, none of the studies discussed in this meta-analysis
can claim to get close to causal estimates.       However, the upside to these studies is that
they analyze large population based samples, whereas studies in Economics (and this paper
included) examine this question using twins who constitute a smaller fraction of overall births.




                                                 3
   Finally, we supplement our main analysis (which uses cohorts born between

1926-1958) with more recent data (cohorts born 1973-1982, similar to that used

by Black et al (2007)). Hence, we are able to study how the impact of birth

weight on income and education of young adults has changed across cohorts

born almost 50 years apart. In so doing, we are also able to conrm the ndings

of Black et al. (2007) in a dierent context.

   To deal with the endogeneity of birth weight, the predominant solution in

Economics has been to use twins based estimates, taking as random the variation

in birth weight within twin pairs (Almond, Chay, and Lee 2005, Royer 2009,

Black, Devereux, and Salvanes 2007, Behrman and Rosenzweig 2004). We follow

the same strategy in this paper. To answer the main questions we posed earlier,

we need outcomes collected over a very long period of time to allow us to observe

mortality outcomes and life time income, but also a data set that allows us to

use empirical strategies such as twins xed eects to obtain arguably causal

estimates.

   Our unique data allows us to do precisely this. Our database contains birth

records matched with mortality and yearly income records (including income

by source) at the individual level for a vast majority of all twins born between

1926-1958 in Sweden. On average, we have 35 years of labor market data for

each twin. The average age of these twins by 2010 (the last year for which we

have mortality records) is 68; the oldest alive twin pairs are 84 and the youngest

alive twin pairs are 54. Since life expectancy in 2010 was around 80 for the entire

population (presumably it was less for the cohorts we examine), we expect a

moderate level of mortality in our sample; indeed we observe approximately

11% mortality in this sample.

   In line with Black, Devereux, and Salvanes (2007) and others who have

examined the relationship between birth weight and income in early adulthood,

we nd birth weight to have a positive and statistically signicant eect on

income. We nd positive eects on both permanent income as well as on income

over large parts of the life cycle.   After age 50, however, the eect seems to

fade out. Interestingly, we nd that the impact of birth weight on income has

remained rather constant across cohorts born almost 50 years apart.

   In terms of social assistance program take up and mortality, our results show

that lower birth weight twins are more likely to avail of social insurance programs

like unemployment insurance and and sickness pay.       The eects are strongest

during the ages at which the income eects are the largest, suggesting that the

income losses partly works through unemployment and sickness episodes. We



                                         4
nd a signicant eect of birth weight in mortality among males but not among

females. Males with higher birth weight are less likely to die at each period of

time.

     We next introduce our empirical strategy. In Section 3, we describe the data

used for our empirical analysis and Section 4 presents the results.                     Section 5

concludes.


2       Empirical Strategy
     The empirical strategy used in this paper is a straightforward application of

the traditional twins xed eects approach used in prior work. What is dierent

is that in some regressions we use repeated observations over time to obtain a

birth weight eect" at dierent ages. Our baseline specication is as follows:




                           Yijt = Î²t BWij + Âµj + Î³t Xij + ijt                                   (1)



Yijt   is log income of individual i, belonging to twin pair         j   at time t;   Xij   are time

invariant individual specic characteristics like education or sex. The coecient

of interest is    Î²t   which is the birth weight eect at time           t.   The above equation

is estimated at dierent ages (t's) providing us with the life cycle pattern of

the birth weight eect. The key empirical strategy is the inclusion of the twin

pair xed eect (Âµj ). Including this xed eect controls for all twin-pair specic

factors that might be relevant for birth weight formation as well as income, such

as family background, parental income during pregnancy, nutritional intake of

the mother etc. To see this more clearly, we can express Equation 1 in terms of

within twin dierences (where the other twin is              i0 ):

        Yijt â Yi0 jt = Î²t (BWij â BWi0 j ) + Î³t (Xij â Xi0 j ) + (ijt â i0 jt )               (2)



The operating assumption for              Î²t to be interpreted as the birth weight eect         at

a given point in time       t   is that   BWij â BWi0 j is uncorrelated with ijt â i0 jt .     In

some regressions, we replace the birth weight variable with a dummy variable

taking the value of 1 if the twin's birth weight is less than certain treshold

values.
            8 In our main specications, we only include birth weight indicators as

controls but in subsequent regressions, we add education and income as controls

    8 For   this, we use some of the common classications of birth weight, such as low birth
weight (below 2500 grams) and very low birth weight (below 1500 grams).




                                                   5
in some specications. In our regressions, the standard errors are clustered at

the twin pair level.

    The question of whether parents react to birth weight or initial endowments

is a subject of recent research (for a recent review see see Almond and Mazumder

(2012)).
          9 In the framework of Bharadwaj, Eberhard, and Neilson (2014) and

Conti, Heckman, Yi, and Zhang (2010) (both these papers explicitly use a frame-

work that involves twins), the bias in OLS estimates arise largely from parental

investments that compensate or reinforce initial health dierences. Under their

framework, OLS estimates will tend to overstate initial dierences if parents

act in reinforcing ways, and understate the role of initial dierences if parents

act in compensating ways. To the extent that parents in developed countries

like Sweden might act in more compensatory ways, we interpret our estimates

of the long run eects of birth weight that arise despite parents' best eorts to

compensate.
                10


3      Data
    We use two dierent sets of data in our empirical analyses. Our most impor-

tant source of data, BIRTH, originates from the Swedish Twin Registry. BIRTH

is part of a project where researchers at the twin registry in Sweden went out

to get the birth records of all twins born in Sweden between 1926-1958. These

birth records were kept in paper form at local delivery archives around Sweden.

Collecting and preserving birth information is/was enforced by law and people

at the twin registry set out to digitize them. The BIRTH sample only includes

twins that survived up to 1972. In 1972, there was a large twin survey conducted

for the twin cohorts born 1926-1958, which formed the basis for the collection of

birth data. Unfortunately we do not have access to the universe of twins used

to obtain the sample interviewed in 1972.              Hence we are unable to construct

weights or assess attrition in any systematic manner. The information we have

on twins interviewed in 1972 include information on birth weight, sex, year of

birth and year of death (if after 1972).
                                                11

    9 Some   papers that tackle this issue are: Aizer and Cunha (2012), Conti, Heckman, Yi,
and Zhang (2010), Adhvaryu and Nyshadham (2014), and Bharadwaj, Eberhard, and Neilson
(2014).
  10 Another   underlying aspect of twins xed eects estimates is the role of sibling peer eects
or how one twin can aect the other twin's choices. We recognize this as something that might
be occurring in the background, but we are not aware of papers that explicitly address this
issue or how this might drive our results.
  11 Since   we only capture twins where both were alive as of 1972, we expect to nd fewer
twins from the 1930's as compared to twins from the 1950's.         As a fraction of overall live




                                                 6
    Our second data source on birth outcomes is the Swedish medical birth

register.     From this, we get information on birth outcomes for cohorts born

1973 and onwards. The register was founded in 1973 and includes data on the

universe of deliveries in Sweden. The information in the register is collected from

medical records from prenatal, delivery, and neonatal care units. Evaluations

have shown the register to be of high quality; attrition through the period range

between 0.5-3 percent (Socialstyrelsen 2014).           The register covers information

such as weight and height at birth, duration of pregnancy, APGAR score, mode

of delivery, infant diagoses, infant mortality, and maternal diagnoses and lifestyle

factors. By exploiting information on the mothers ID in the register, we are able

to link children born to the same mothers. Since we also have information on

the month and year of birth, we can also identify twins.

    It should be noted that prior to 1973, there exists no digitized birth register

in Sweden. The BIRTH sample is an exception, where researchers went out to

collect birth data on twins. Since the BIRTH data only includes data on twins,

and since no other digitized birth data exists prior to 1973, we can only run

analyses on singletons and siblings for the cohorts born 1973 and onwards.

    We use the data from the medical birth register for two purposes. First, with

these data, we can check to what extent the eect of birth weight on outcomes

such as education and income have changed across cohorts born many years

apart. By combining the BIRTH sample with the data from the medical birth

register, we are in a unique situation to study changes across cohorts born as

far apart as 1926-1982.        Second, we can replicate the ndings in Black et al.

(2007) for Norway. While the Swedish medical birth register does not entirely

overlap with its Norweigan counterpart, which starts in 1967, it is close enough

to make for an interesting replication.

    For both the young and older cohorts, we merge data on individual years of

schooling from the education register (utbildningsregistret, UREG) from 1990 or

2007, where years of schooling has been imputed based on obtained degree.
                                                                                       12 For

the overwhelming majority of people, we thus have register-based information

births we certainly capture fewer twins than perhaps expected from earlier cohorts.       The
fraction of twins (compared to total live births) observed in the data stabilizes around 1940.
Unfortunately, since we do not observe the original universe of twins, it is dicult the assess
the degree to which the earlier cohorts suer from selective survival. As robustness checks,
we test if there have been important changes in the impact of birth weight across early and
late cohorts.
  12 If   the information diers between 1990 and 2007, we use the information on highest
attained schooling.   Few individuals change their highest obtained schooling between those
years, however.




                                              7
on schooling. If the person died before 1990, schooling information was taken

from the census of 1970.

    Income records at the individual level are available starting in 1968 and

ending in 2007. The income records come from the equivalent of W2 records in

the United States, in that the income is reported by employers and is not based

on self reports. For people with multiple jobs, only the total income is reported.

This same data source also provides information on income by source, such as

unemployment benets, sickness pay and welfare pay. All of our income data is

adjusted by 2007 CPI measures to make them comparable.
                                                                       13

    While we have income data for the BIRTH sample from 1968-2007, there

have been some changes in what is included in our main income measure. Dif-

ferent income sources (labor income, income from social safety nets etc) exist

in the register because they are taxable.           Fortunately, starting in 1974, most

income sources, including the various social benets, were taxable and are in-

cluded separately in the data. Between 1968-1974 we only have access to income

from labor market participation and self employment.
                                                                 14

    The main income measure we use in this paper is a measure that includes sev-

eral sources of income. For total income, we use the denition by Statistics Swe-

den, where it consists of income from work and income from self-employment.

Income from work includes, besides wage income, income from pensions, sick-

ness benets, and other taxable benets. As previously mentioned, this means

that the income measure before and after 1974 are not strictly comparable, as

the pre-1974 period excludes benets. Even though many benets became tax-

able in 1974, most are not separately shown until later.               Pensions are shown

from 1974, unemployment benets from 1978 and sickness insurance benets

from 1981.
                15

    It should be noted that it seems common to include social safety net income

in the total income measure in papers using Scandinavian data.
                                                                                 16   It is also

  13 For   the cohorts we examine, there does not appear to be much by way of changing
variances in income over time.
  14 Recent   work by Bjorklund, Jantti, and Lindquist (2009) suggests that this change in
denition is not of primary concern for our analysis since benets constituted less than 5
percent of total earnings in years prior to 1974.   In any case, we can reproduce our main
analysis restricting the sample to years after 1974 and the basic pattern of results remains
unchanged.
  15 Sickness   benets reporting underwent a large change in 1992.     Starting in 1992, only
sickness benets where sick leave was taken for more than 2 weeks were reported in the tax
registry. Hence, for the analysis of sickness benets, we restrict our analysis to the 1992-2005
period.
  16 See   for instance Black et al. (2007) and BÃ¶hlmark and Lindqvist (2006).




                                               8
important to understand that most benets are related to having worked and

to one's earnings. Sickness benets and unemployment benets are related to

one's labor income and typically 80-90 percent of one's labor earnings are paid

out, although with a cap at some level, which has varied over time. So in some

sense, labor income plus benets paid out will better reect one's contracted

labor earnings that year compared to a measure that only includes labor income.

   As an alternative income measure, we focus on pure labor income as an

outcome in some regressions, consisting only of wage income from work or self-

employment, i.e.        net of taxable benets.        It can be of interest to contrast

the ndings using total income with those using labor income, since the latter

does not include compensation paid by the welfare state. If birth weight has

a negative eect on productivity and labor supply, we expect to see a stronger

eect of birth weight when using pure labor income as an outcome.
                                                                                   17

   In some of our main analyses, we will use a measure of permanent income as

an outcome. This is dened as average earnings across ages 35-45. We base this

on the paper by BÃ¶hlmark and Lindquist (2006), where they show that average

income across these ages is a good proxy for permanent income.

   The income data was matched to all twins in the BIRTH sample who were

contacted and alive during the 1972-73 survey. Since the data from the medical

birth register comes from a separate database, the linkage to income is also

slightly dierent. Here, we have the same type of income data as for the BIRTH

sample, but this time from 1990 and onwards. The more limited time period is

not of concern, however, since the oldest cohorts in the medical birth register

would still only be 17 years of age in 1990. We lose less than 1% of the data

due to matching issues across the vital statistics and income registries.

   In order to study the eect of birth weight on mortality, we use data from

the Swedish causes of death register. The register started in 1961 and covers all

deaths among individuals who were permanently residing in Sweden, irrespective

of whether the death took place in or outside Sweden.                  The register includes

information on the date and cause of death, as well as information on where the

death took place.

   For our replication of Black et al. (2007), we follow them as closely as possi-

ble when we construct our outcome measures. We dene high school completion

as having at least 12 years of schooling and require that the person was at least

 17 While   the benets received in general are related to a person's labor earnings, it is not a
perfect relationship. The cap in unemployment and sickness benets means that high-earners
lose more than low-earners.




                                                9
twenty-one when measured, meaning that we include the cohorts born 1973 to

1982, since the last year of measurement of education is 2003. For income, we

have data until 2006 for the medical birth register sample. The closest we can

get to the analysis in Black et al. (2007), where income at the age range 25-

35 is used, is thus to use the age range 25-33, born between 1973-1981.      The

yearly earnings measure used by Black et al.     (2007) includes labor earnings,

unemployment insurance payments, sickness benets, parental leave benets,

and pensions. The measure of yearly earnings we use includes labor earnings,

unemployment benets, sickness benets, but does not include parental benets

and pensions. Black et al. (200) also restrict their analysis to full-time employ-

ees, based on register information. The Swedish registers do not contain such

information and we are thus unable to impose the same restriction.

   The other outcomes we study in our replication are infant mortality and

ve-minute APGAR scores.      The former is measured as mortality during the

rst year of life and is taken directly from the birth register. The APGAR score

is a summary measure of health at birth, ranging from 0-10, including measures

of activity, pulse, grimace, appearance, and respiration (Black et al. 2007). For

the analyses of infant mortality and APGAR we use data for the entire birth

cohorts 1973-2007.

   Table 1 provides the essential statistics on the BIRTH sample and the sample

from the medical birth register. For the BIRTH sample, we have 12,888 male

twins and 13,266 female twins in complete twin pairs with non-missing data on

birth weight and education. Note that the number of observations used in the

regressions will dier according to the outcome studied and the ages considered.

Since the income register starts in 1968, we cannot study earnings between ages

35-45 for cohorts born earlier than 1933, for instance.   For some of our main

outcomes, we will show results both for unbalanced and balanced panels. The

statistics in the table are shown for the samples used in studying education as

an outcome, where we need to put no restrictions on the cohorts included. From

the medical birth register, we observe 4,992 and 5,050 male and female twins,

respectively, born between 1973-1982.

   From Table 1, we learn that the average birth weight of twins has remained

rather constant over time. The average is slightly higher for the older cohorts,

which reects the fact that the fraction born with very low birth weight has more

than doubled in the younger cohorts. This has occurred due to improvements in

the medical technology to treat low-birth infants. We can also observe that twins

on average have lower birth weight than singletons. The dierence amounts to



                                        10
almost 1 kilogram on average and is consistent with data from other countries

(Black et al. 2007). The average discordance in birth weight among twins has

decreased somewhat over time but the dierence is quite small.        The average

birth weight and discordance across the cohorts born 1926-1958 and 1973-1982

are also illustrated in Figure 1. Figure 2 illustrates the life expectancy at birth

for our cohorts. The average life expectancy increased from 63 to 76 between

1926 and 1982 and the gap between males and females appears to have widened

across cohorts.

    Since we are using birth weight data from a time when measurement meth-

ods were perhaps less rened, it is likely that birth weight and subsequently

birth weight dierences are measured with more error for the earlier cohorts

than for later cohorts. While we have no direct way of assessing the extent to

which measurement error plays a role, we can use rounding as a proxy for poor

measurement. We do this by examining the fraction of births that are rounded

to 50 gram intervals in Figure 3.   The rst panel shows very clearly that the

number of children where birth weight was a multiple of 50 has reduced consid-

erably between 1926-1982. This is likely due to improvements in birth weight

measurements over time. In addition, the second panel shows that in the early

1930's a much larger fraction of twins were noted to have the same birth weight.

This number falls from around 6-8% in the early 1930's to around 2% in the

1940's and 1% in later cohorts. Because of these dierences across cohorts, we

will check the robustness of some of our main results when rounding all the

birth weight data. In general, we nd no dierence in results when we conduct

these robustness checks.

    Table 1 shows that we observe about 14 percent and 10 percent of males and

females in the BIRTH sample dying during the sample period.         Among those

observed to die, the average age of death is about 60.


4    Results
4.1 Replication
    We start our empirical analysis by studying the eect of birth weight on

short- and medium-run outcomes for the young cohorts born 1973 and on-

wards. We then compare some of these estimates with those obtained for the

cohorts born 1926-1958. These analyses serve as a replication of the results in

Black et al. (2007) but also allows us to study to what extent the impact of




                                        11
birth weight have changed across cohorts. For the purpose of the replication,

we closely follow Black et al. (2007) and include both male and female twins

(and both same-sex and mixed-sex pairs) in the regressions and control for gen-

der. The estimates are shown in Table 2, where each coecient represents an

estimate from a separate regression. For the young cohorts, we show results for

both singletons and twins and run both OLS and family xed eects regres-

sions. For the sibling xed eects regressions, we also show estimates when we

restrict the birth weight range to be the same as in the twin sample.                  In the

OLS regressions, we control for year and month of birth, mother's education,

mother's year of birth, birth order, and sex of the child.                In the sibling xed

eects regressions, we use the same controls except for mother's education and

mother's year of birth, which do not vary across siblings. The twin xed eects

regressions only control for birth weight and sex of the child.
                                                                           18

    We present our analyses in chronological order and rst examine short-term

outcomes for the young cohorts, including infant mortality and ve-minute AP-

GAR scores. We focus rst on our sample of main interest, the twins, and as

also found in Black et al. (2007) our pooled twins estimates of -180 in Panel A

suggest that higher birth weight decreases infant mortality. The estimates for

one-year mortality are interpreted as a reduction in the number of deaths per

1000 and the magnitude of the eect means that a 10 percent increase in birth

weight would lead to 18 fewer deaths per 1000 births.                   The twin xed eect

estimate is substantially smaller, at -55, but is statistically signicant and not

far from the estimate of -41 in Black et al. (2007).

    For APGAR scores, our pooled twins and xed eects estimates of 1.53

and 0.47 are also quite similar to those of Black et al.                (1.46 and 0.35).   The

estimates are signicant, again suggesting that higher birth weight leads to

improved health outcomes in the short-term.

    Moving on to educational outcomes, we nd that birth weight is positively

related to the probability of high school completition, meaning having at least

12 years of schooling.       Like Black et al.     (2007), we nd that the twin xed

eects estimates are somewhat greater in magnitude compared to the pooled

OLS twins estimates. The former estimate implies that a 10 percent increase in

birth weight increases the probability of high school completion by 7 percentage

  18 We   do not include the birth order of the twins in the regressions, since we lack this
information for the older cohorts and since we want to have comparable results. When we
include the birth order of twins as a control variable in the regressions on the young cohorts,
the results are practically unchanged (results available on request).




                                              12
points, which is similar to Black et al's estimate of 9 percentage points.

   For income at ages 25-33 our twin FE estimates are substantially greater in

magnitude, around 9 percent, compared to the pooled twins estimates, which

are not signicant. Our twin FE estimate is close to the one obtained for ages

25-35 in Black et al. (2007) and they also found the FE estimate to be greater

in magnitude than the OLS estimate, although the dierence in estimates was

smaller in their case.    As our OLS estimate is rather imprecise, however, we

cannot reject that the estimates are in fact the same.

   In Appendix Tables A and B, we show the estimates broken down by gender.

Note that the sum of the observations in the male and female samples of siblings

and twins do not add upp to the numbers in Table 2, since mixed-sex siblings

and twins are now not included. For most of the outcomes, the estimates are

similar across genders.    The estimate for log earnings increase somewhat to

0.12 and 0.14 for males and females, respectively, whereas the estimate for high

school completion stays roughly the same.

   Overall, our results are similar to those obtained by Black et al. (2007). This

should not come as a surprise since the countries share many characteristics

and since we use roughly the same birth cohorts.      As in their case, our twin

xed eects estimates are smaller than the corresponding OLS estimates for

short-term outcomes, while the estimates are more similar for the medium-run

outcomes. The dierence in the patterns across short and medium-run results

may reect that compensating parental investments by birth weight aect the

medium-run estimates but not the short-run estimates.

4.1.1   Comparison with singletons


   Table 2 also shows the corresponding estimates for our sample of singletons,

with and without controlling for family xed eects. The rst thing to note is

that for our short-term measures, the pooled OLS estimates for the twin sample

are substantially greater in magnitude that the corresponding estimates for the

singleton sample. Second, for the same outcomes, the sibling FE are greater in

magnitude than the twin FE estimates. Both these patterns were obtained in

Black et al. (2007) as well.

   For high school completion and income, our OLS estimates on the siblings

and twins sample are much more similar. Moreover, the twin FE estimates are

in this case greater in magnitude than the corresponding sibling FE estimates.

Again, the same pattern was found in Black et al. (2007).

   Summing up, the siblings FE estimates are greater for short-term outcomes



                                        13
whereas the twin FE estimates are greater for our medium- and long-outcomes.

4.1.2        Results for the BIRTH cohorts: education and income


      We next move back in time and analyze the eect of birth weight on various

outcomes for our sample of main interest; the cohorts born 1926-1958. We focus

rst on education and income as outcomes, as these are the outcomes we are

able to measure for both the old and young cohorts.

      Panel B of Table 2 shows the eect of birth weight on educational outcomes

and Panel B ofTables A and B in the Appendix show the same results by

gender.
           19 For the sake of replicating Black et al. (2007), we show results for

mixed-sex couples in Table 2, but the results are similar when including only

same-sex pairs (results available on request).

      The estimates suggest that higher birth weight has a positive eect on high

school completion, where a ten percent increase increases the probability of

high school completion by 10 percentage points.                 This estimate is somewhat

larger than that of the younger cohorts, where the corresponding number was 7

percentage points. The estimate is also quite similar across genders.

      Table 2 also includes estimates for years of schooling. Although this outcome

was not included when we ran regressions on the young cohorts, it is of interest

to include for the old cohorts, as we can be quite sure that they have completed

their schooling at the ages when we measure it, which was not the case for

the young cohorts. In addition, in our analyses of income, welfare-takeup, and

mortality, we will run specications including years of schooling as a control

variable. Our estimates for the pooled sample suggest that a 10-percent increase

in birth weight leads to 0.67 additional years of schooling and the estimate is

similar for males and females.

4.1.3        Income


      In Panel B of Table 2, we also report results for income between ages 25-

33.
   20      The estimated twin FE eect of birth weight on income during these

  19 In   the OLS regressions for the old cohorts, we control for the sex of the child and birth
year.     The reason is that we lack information on parents' education, month of birth, birth
order, and mothers' year of birth.
  20 Since   the income register starts in 1968, the analyses on income use dierent cohorts than
the ones we use for educational outcomes. For the analyis of income between ages 25-33, the
analyses was restricted to cohorts born 1943 and onwards and for permanent income, analyzed
in section 4.2, the corresponding restriction was those born 1933 and onwards.          We have
checked if the estimates for education are the same when using the same cohort restrictions.
We found this to be the case; in the analysis when we pool same-sex male and female twin
pairs, the eect of birth on years of schooling is 0.60 for the cohort born 1943 and onwards




                                                14
ages, 0.09, is remarkably similar to the estimate we obtained for the younger

cohorts. It thus appears that the impact of birth weight on earnings as a young

adult is rather constant across cohorts born almost 50 years apart. As we show

in Appendix Tables A and B, the estimate is similar across genders, although

less precisely measured for females.          We again nd the OLS estimate to be

insignicant and smaller in magnitude compared to the FE estimate. There is

no statistically signicant dierence between the estimates, however


4.2 Permanent income
   We next turn to our measure of permanent income, i.e average income be-

tween ages 35-45.     As shown in the second column of Table 3, the twin FE

estimate for this outcome is more or less the same as the ones we obtained in

our earlier analysis on the young and old cohorts, the estimate suggesting that

a 10 percent increase in birth weight leads to a 1 percent increase in permanent

income. The estimate is quite similar between genders and is robust to instead

using labor income as an outcome, as shown in Panel B of Table 3. Controlling

for years of schooling only slightly reduces the magnitude of the estimate. The

corresponding OLS estimates are about half in magnitude but the dierences

are again not statistically signicant.

   While using the log of birth weight in our income regressions allows for

some non-linearity in the eect, we can also employ more exible specications.

Figures 4 and 5 plot estimates from specications where we have constructed 100

grams bins of birth weight. We then run OLS and FE regressions including these

bins as dummy variables, the reference category being twins with a birth weight

below 1500 grams. For males, the graph shows an increase in permanent income

by birth weight up until roughly 2500 grams after which the curve attens out.

The corresponding graph for females shows a similar pattern.        Note that the

estimates at the end-points of the graph are quite noisy, which reects that

fewer observations are found at those levels of birth weight.

   Another way to explore potential non-linearities is to replace our birth weight

measure with various birth weight tresholds, as shown in Table C in the Ap-

pendix.   Here, the coecients displayed are from separate regressions, using

various tresholds. Some of these point estimates are quite large where, for in-

stance, being below 2500 grams results in 2.5 percent reduction in perment

income. The estimates for weighting less than 1500 grams are sometimes large

and 0.59 for cohorts born 1933 and onwards.




                                              15
but suer from low precision.          The estimates are quite similar for permanent

income and permanent labor income.

   We can also study if the eect of birth weight on permanent income changes

across cohorts in the BIRTH sample. For this, we divided the data into three

groups, twins born 1933-1939, 1940-1949, and 1950-1958 and interacted the

birth weight variable with the cohort indicators. To gain sucient power, and

since results were fairly similar across genders, we pool males and females. The

results, shown in Table D in the Appendix, show that there are no signicant

dierences in the eect across cohorts. The point estimate for the oldest cohort

suggests a smaller eect that could perhaps reect more measurement error in

the data for the oldest cohorts. To investigate this, the third and fourth columns

show results where we rounded the birth weight measure to the nearest 50 gram

bin.
    21 This does not aect the estimates in any important way, showing that

the more prominent rounding of the birth weight measure in the older cohorts

is not a problem.


4.3 Income across the lifecycle
   We next ask whether the eect of birth weight on income varies across the

lifecycle. This would for instance be suggested by the Barker hypothesis, where

poor early life environment leads to programming changes that makes people

more susceptible to heart disease and metabolic syndrome as people age.

   Figures 6 and 7 show the estimates of the relationship between log birth

weight and log income at each point in the life cycle using both xed eects

and OLS estimation methodologies. The coecients can be interpreted as the

eect on 4 year moving averages since at each age, we use 4 years of data to

smooth the graphs. To be precise, the coecient shown for age 50 uses data

from ages 50-53, the coecient for age 51 uses data from ages 51-54 and so

on. These regressions control for calendar year of observation and nothing else.

In addition, the gures show the dierence in OLS and FE estimates and the

associated condence intervals around this dierence.

   For males, the gure suggests that higher birth weight seems to lead to higher

income early in the life cycle, but that the eect declines at older ages. In panel

A of Table 4, we show regression estimates for an unbalanced sample of male

twins where the outcome is 5-year average earnings.
                                                                22 The coecient for age

 21 Recall   that part of the reason for more measurement error in the data for the old cohorts
was that such rounding was more prominent.
 22 The reason that the number of observations change across specications is that the income




                                               16
30, for instance, shows the impact of birth weight on average earnings between

28-32.
          23 At these ages, a 10 percent increase in birth weight (approximately

250 grams) leads to a 1.25 percent increase in total income among males. These

estimates are quite similar to our earlier estimates on permament income and

to the ones in Black, Devereux, and Salvanes (2007). This birth weight eect

seems to last until around age 40-50 after which it appears to fade out.                    For

parsimony, these regressions do not control for schooling but the results are

similar when doing so.

    In order to check if the change in results across the lifecycle reects changes

in the sample compostion, we can restrict the analysis to a balanced sample, as

in Table E. While the point estimates at higher ages are reduced in magnitude,

the precision is also lower due to the smaller sample size and we cannot rule out

that there are large eects also at high ages. The results do not provide any

evidence, however, that the impact of birth weight on income increase by age

due to the fetal programming eect.

    The fact that the birth weight eect appears to fade out after age 50 is

perhaps unexpected if we believe that initial labor market dierences tend to

persist. Many studies have found that labor market conditions at the time of

entry are incredibly important for long term outcomes (see for example Kahn

(2010) and Beaudry and DiNardo (1991)). The declining result is not a feature

of the sample itself changing since the results from the balanced panel for ages

30-55 in Table E showed a remarkable decline in the birth weight eect by age

50 and nearly disappearing at older ages. Examining just the results for income

earned from labor market activity, shown in Panels B and D of Table 4 results

in similar results where, if anything, the point estimates at ages 50 an above are

smaller in magnitude.

    For females, the patterns across the lifecycle are quite dierent.                Figure 7

suggests that birth weight has a positive eect early on and late during the

lifecycle.     This is also suggested in Table 4, where the eects are largest at

ages 30-35 and 50-60. These results hold up less well when running the same

register starts in 1968 and ends in 2007 and that our cohorts are born 1926-1958. For income
at age 30, for instance, we can only include cohorts born 1938 and onwards. The number of
observations increase until age 45 after which it declines again. The reason is that at age 50
and onwards fewer and fewer of the younger cohorts can be included. At age 55, for instance,
the youngest cohorts included are born in 1952.
  23 In   these regressions, we require that both twins are present for the same number of years
when calculating the average. If income is available only for a subset of the years of the 5-year
intervals, we base the calculation on those years. The number of observations in the table is
the number of unique individuals.

regression on the balanced panel. The estimates at ages 30 and 35 increase in

magnitude but at older ages the estimates become smaller and imprecise.

   Tables F and G explore non-linearity in the birth weight-income relation-

ship across the lifecycle, where the dierent rows show estimates from separate

regressions with dierent tresholds indicated and where Table F show results

for total income and Table G for labor income. While most coecients in these

tables are not signicant, the general pattern suggests some non-linearity in the

birth weight - income relationship.    The coecients on very low birth weight

(VLBW) tend to be larger than the eects for higher thresholds, although the

coecients are rarely statistically signicant.


4.4 Social Benets
   Having established that birth weight aects both permanent income and

income at dierent stages of the lifecycle, we next set out to understand the

eect of birth weight on the uptake of various social benets.     Table 5 show

regressions where the dependent variable is the fraction of time spent earning

income from social assistance sources (we examine these in 10 year intervals).

The results suggest that a 10 percent decrease in birth weight is associated with

a 0.0065 increase in the fraction of time between the ages of 35-45 that males

spent on sickness pay. Given a base of 0.22, this suggests an increase of nearly

3 percent. Likewise, between the ages of 45-55, a 10 percent decrease in birth

weight can lead to an increase in unemployment insurance take up of 0.003 -

which translates to a 3.6 percent increase in the fraction of time spent on UI.

These estimates are almost unchanged when we control for education.         Note

that we do not show specications controlling for income here, as the level of

the benets is mechanically related to one's earnings.

   Among females, few of the point estimates show up as signicant and most

are small in magnitude. The exception is time spent on sickness benets during

ages 55-65, where higher birth weight leads to signicant and rather strong

decline in the uptake of sickness benets.

   We can relate our ndings on social benets to our earlier ndings on income.

Among males, birth weight is signicantly related to the use of sickness benets

during the same ages at which we obtained signicant eects on permanent

income, i.e.   at ages 35-45.   This suggests that part of the negative eect on

permanent income works through increased use of sickness benets.       This, in

turn, suggests that some of the eect of birth weight on income works through

health-related problems. The fading out of the eect on social benets by age



                                        18
is also consistent with the fading out of the income eect.
                                                                        24

    Among females, our ndings on social benets do not explain the eect

on permanent income to the same degree.                 Looking at the lifecycle patterns,

however, we found strong income eects late in the lifecycle, which is also where

we found that birth weight aects sickness benets, i.e. at ages 55-65. It thus

appears that part of the late-life income eect works through poor health, as

expressed through being on sick-leave.


4.5 Mortality
    Given the negative eects of birth weight on economic outcomes that we

have found so far, it is natural to ask if this these eects also translate into

reduced longevity. In Figure 8 we illustrate such potential patterns by plotting

the mortality hazard rates of light versus heavy twins, while allowing for the

censoring in the data. These Kaplan-Meier estimates show greater hazard rates

for the lighter twin, suggesting a possible mortality gradient in birth weight.

The pattern is most pronouced for males, where the dierence in hazard rates

start already in the 40s.

    In order to obtain more precise estimates of the mortality gradient, we run

Cox proportional hazard models, where we account for twin xed eects by

allowing for twin-pair specic baseline hazards. These models account for the

censoring in mortality and exploit dierences in the timing of death within twin

pairs.     In Table 6, we rst show the Cox estimates with only birth weight as

control and we then subsequently add education and income. These regressions

are based on the entire cohorts born 1926-1958.

    For males, we obtain a signicant hazard ratio, where higher birth weight

leads to lower mortality. The hazard rate is 0.51, suggesting that a 10 percent

increase in birth weight halves the instantaneous hazard of dying. The estimate

does not change much when we add education and average income at ages 38-

42 to the regression, suggesting that income and education are not important

mechanisms through which the eect of birth weight on mortality arises.
                                                                                            25 , 26

  24 In   order to shed more light on the reasons for the fading out of the income eect by age,
we have checked if individuals with higher birth weight retire earlier. This would be the case
if such individuals hold more attractive jobs that allow for earlier retirement. We found the
opposite though; birth weight was negatively and signicantly related to the probability of
being retired at ages 50, 55, 60, and 65. These results are available on request.
  25 We    chose the age range 38-42 for income in order to maximize the sample size. Including
incomes at other ages, or permanent income, leads to smaller sample size but similar results.
  26 We    also ran regressions including controls for welfare use at the dierent age ranges used
in Table 5. This did not change the birth weight coecient in any meaningful way. Welfare
use was in itself linked to increased mortality. We also investigated if the birth weight eect




                                                 19
In contrast to the results for males, we nd no signicant eects of birth weight

on mortality for females.

    In order to shed more light on what variation across the birth weight dis-

tribution that is generating the signicant results for males, Table 6 also shows

specications using birth weight cutos.            Here, the coecients shown are ob-

tained from separate regressions. From these, we see that the hazard ratio for

males is largest for the specication using the 1500 gram cuto, although the

estimate is only signicant at the 10 percent level.               At the bottom row, we

also show results comparing the lighter twin to his heavier counterpart.                   The

results mirror those in Figure 8 and show that the hazard of dying signicantly

increases by between 15 to 18 percent for the lighter twin, depending on the

covariates included. Again, we obtain no signicant estimates for females.
                                                                                          27


5     Conclusion
    This paper adds to the emerging literature on the long lasting impacts of

birth outcomes by examining the relationship between birth weight and long-run

outcomes, including permanent income, income across the lifecycle, education,

social benets take-up, and adult mortality. Moreover, we add to the literature

by examining how the impact of birth weight has changed across cohorts born

almost 50 years apart and by replicating ndings from another Scandinavian

country.     We nd that birth weight is a predictor of permanent income and

that most of the eects on income appear concentrated in early adulthood. Our

results indicate that lower birth weight children are more likely to avail of social

insurance programs such as unemployment and sickness insurance. We also nd

important eects on longevity among males but not among females. The eects

on income and education at young adulthood are surprisingly constant across

cohorts and similar to the eects found in a previous study in Norway.

    Our results are important in highlighting how inequalities at birth play out

over the life cycle and support the idea that part of the health-income gradient

on mortality was dierent for people that used welfare. The interaction between birth weight
and welfare use at dierent age ranges was always insignicant however.       These results are
available on request.
  27 We   have also ran linear probability regressions on the eect of birth weight on the prob-
ability of dying rst within a twin pair (on the subsample of twin pairs where we observe at
least one twin dying). For males, a ten percent increase in birth weight lowered the proba-
bility of dying rst by 44 percentage points. The estimate was signicant at the 5 percent
level and did not change much when adding education and income to the regressions. Among
females, the corresponding estimate was 28 percentage points but it did not reach statistical
signicance.

in adulthood can be explained by health in childhood (Case, Lubotsky, and

Paxson 2001). The extent to which policies or parental investments can remedy

initial deciencies is an important question for researchers to tackle.    A rst

step towards this goal is to understand whether initial dierences have long

lasting impacts and then to examine intermediary channels that might drive

the long run results. We recognize that dierences in early childhood can lead

to dierences in the medium/long term for various reasons and pinning down

which one of these intermediary channels best explains the long run results is

beyond the scope of this paper. We therefore view our results as arising from a

combination of health deciencies at birth and subsequent behavioral responses

that might be aimed at mitigating or exacerbating these initial dierences.

   We acknowledge that twins form a small fraction of the overall population

and hence are sympathetic to concerns about the generalizability of these nd-

ings. However, because twins are smaller at birth than singletons, if there are

non-linearities in the true eect of birth weight on various outcomes, then we

can take some comfort in that our eects are over the relevant range of birth

weight. Indeed, as Bharadwaj, Eberhard and Neilson (2014) show, the eects

of birth weight on test scores at least, are quite similar across twins and sib-

ling xed eects for siblings close together in age. In related work, Oreopoulos,

Stabile, Walld, and Roos (2008) examine the eects of birth weight using both

sibling and twin xed eects models; while for social assistance take up it ap-

pears that twins and siblings estimates are quite dierent, the eects of birth

weight appear quite similar for schooling related outcomes. Since we lack data

on siblings for our main sample, we are unable to make such comparisons with

our own data.    We do not wish to claim that variation in twin birth weight

is generalizable to the larger population, but rather that there is at least some

indication that this variation might be useful for making broader inferences. Ul-

timately, variation in birth weight using twins xed eects is the closest we have

to randomly assigned birth weight; however, the extent to which this variation

in relevant for policy is still an open question.

Notes: The table shows descriptive statistics for (1) the old cohorts born 1926-1958 and (2)

the young cohorts born 1973 and onwards. The statistics are for the twin sample in the old

cohorts and for the twin and sibling samples in the young cohorts. In the old sample, the

statistics for birth weight, education outcomes, and mortality are based on the entire cohorts

born 1926-1958. For permanent income, welfare use, and unemployment benets, and sickness

benets, the sample size and the cohorts included vary, depending on the data available for the

dierent outcomes, see data section for details. The sample sizes are as follows for males and

females, respectively: Permanent income: 5,607 and 5,687. Unemployment benets: 12,250

and 12,802. Welfare use: 11,842 and 12,366. Sickness benets: 10,060 and 10404. * Measured

as the the fraction of time during ages 45-55 using the benet. ** The statistics for age at

death are for those who are observed to die during the sample period.        Permanent income

is measured as average earnings during ages 35-45. High school completion is measured as

having 12 or more years of schooling. For the siblings sample, the average dierence in birth

weight is based on the dierence in birth weight between the two observed youngest siblings

of the same gender in a family. The statistics for the young cohorts are based on individuals

born between 1973-1982.

Notes:   The table shows regressions on the relationship between birth weight and selected

outcomes for the cohorts born 1973 and onwards and for cohorts born 1926-1958. The number

of cohorts included depend on the outcome studied, see data section for detailed information.

In the OLS regresssions for cohorts born 1973 and onwards, we control for year and month of

birth, mother's education, birth order, mother's year of birth, and sex of the child. Sibling xed

eect regressions control for all of the above except for mother's year of birth and mother's

education. Twin xed eect regressions control for sex. In the OLS regressions for the cohorts

born 1926-1958, we control sex of the child and birth cohort. The third column shows sibling

xed eect results when restricting the birth weight range to that in the corresponding twin

sample. Clustered standard errors in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

Notes: This table shows regressions on birth weight and permanent income for the cohorts

born 1933-1958. Columns (1) to (3) show results for the pooled sample of males and females.

Columns (4) and (5) show results for males and columns (6) and (7) for females.                   The co-

ecients in columns (2) to (7) are from twin xed eects models, whereas the coecient in

column (1) is from an OLS regression. Panel A show reults for permanent total income and

Panel B show results for permanent labor income. Income is dened as labor income from

employment and self-employment plus taxable benets, whereas labor income excludes the

latter. Permanent income is calculated as the average income between the ages 35 and 45.

Years of schooling is included in columns (3), (5), and (7) and is controlled for using discrete

categories. The regressions on permanent income include cohorts born 1933-1958. â                p < 0.10,

     Notes: This table shows regressions on birth weight and use of social benets across the lifecycle for the cohorts born 1926-1958. All coecients are

     from twin xed eects models. The regressions show the eect of birth weight on the fraction of time spend using dierent social insurance systems

     in 10-year intervals. Years of schooling is controlled for using discrete categories. The cohorts included in the regressions vary, see the text for details.

of cohorts included depend on the outcome studied, see data section for detailed information.

In the OLS regresssions, we control for year and month of birth, mother's education, birth

order, mother's year of birth, and sex of the child. Sibling xed eect regressions control for

all of the above except for mother's year of birth and mother's education. Twin xed eect

the birth weight range to that in the corresponding twin sample. In the OLS regressions for

the cohorts born 1926-1958, we control sex of the child and birth cohort. Clustered standard

Notes: This table shows regressions on the eect of having a birth weight below dierent

tresholds on permanent income for cohorts born 1933-1958. Columns (1) to (2) show results

for the pooled sample of males and females. Columns (3) and (4) show results for males and

columns (5) and (6) for females. All coecients are from twin FE models. Panel A show reults

for permanent total income and Panel B show results for permanent labor income. Income is

dened as labor income from employment and self-employment plus taxable benets, whereas

labor income excludes the latter.         Permanent income is calculated as the average income

between the ages 35 and 45. Years of schooling is included in columns (2), (4), and (6) and is

controlled for using discrete categories. The regressions on permanent income include cohorts

born 1933-1958. â   p < 0.10,   ââ   p < 0.05,   âââ   p < 0.01.

Notes: This table shows regressions on the eect of log birth weight on permanent income

(ages 35-45) across cohorts born 1933-1939, 1940-1949, and 1950-1958. All coecients are from

twin xed eects models. Permanent income is calculated as the average income between the

ages 35 and 45. Column 1 shows the estimate for the combined sample of men and women.

Column 2 interacts birth weight with the birth cohort categories. Column 3 and 4 repeats

the analysis in Column 1 and 2, but recodes the birth weight data into 50g bins, i.e., analyzes

whether measurement error matters. â    p < 0.10,   ââ   p < 0.05,   âââ   p < 0.01.

Notes: This table shows regressions for a balanced panel on birth weight and income across

the lifecycle for the cohorts born 1926-1958. All coecients are from twin xed eects models.

Panels A and B show regressions on average 5-year income and average 5-year labor income

among males.      Panels C and D shows the corresponding regressions for females.                   Income is

dened as labor income from employment and self-employment plus taxable benets, whereas

labor income excludes the latter. The ages in the table refer to the midpoints of the 5-year

averages. No controls for schooling. The cohorts included in the regressions vary, see the text

Notes: This graph plots estimates from OLS and twin xed eects regressions
on the eect of birth weight on permanent income among males, where birth
weight is measured in 100 grams bins. The reference category is weighting below
1500 grams. Permanent income is calculated as the average income between the
ages 35 and 45. Cohorts born 1933-1958 are included in the regressions.

Notes: This graph plots estimates from OLS and twin xed eects regressions
on the eect of birth weight on permanent income among females, where birth
weight is measured in 100 grams bins. The reference category is weighting below
1500 grams. Permanent income is calculated as the average income between the
ages 35 and 45. Cohorts born 1933-1958 are included in the regressions.
