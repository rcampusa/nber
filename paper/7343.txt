Work, Welfare, and Child Maltreatment

JEL No. I3
                                                 ABSTRACT

        This paper examines how child maltreatment is affected by the economic circumstances of parents.
“Child maltreatment” encompasses a wide range of behaviors that adversely affect children. It includes
neglect, physical abuse, sexual abuse, and other forms of abuse or neglect. Using state-level panel data
on the numbers of reports and substantiated cases of maltreatment, we examine whether socioeconomic
factors play different roles for these different types of maltreatment. A key finding is that the economic
circumstances of parents matter: increases in the fractions of children with absent fathers and working
mothers are related to increases in many of the measures of maltreatment, as are increases in the share of
families with two non-working parents, and those with incomes below 75 percent of the poverty line. We
also examine the links between family structure, welfare benefits, and child maltreatment. Welfare programs
affect the incentives of women and men to work and to live in single or dual-parent families. By changing
the family structure and work behavior of parents as well as their incomes, welfare reforms can be expected
to affect the incidence of child maltreatment. Although is too early to accurately determine what the effects
of the recent reforms will be, our analysis indicates that: 1) consistent with other research, the characteristics
of state’s welfare systems have affected the work behavior and structure of families during the 1977-1996
time period; 2) decreases in a state’s welfare benefit levels are associated with large increases in child
neglect, and with small decreases in physical abuse.

I. Introduction
Child maltreatment is a large and growing problem in the United States. In 1996, over 3 million

cases of child abuse and neglect—nearly 50 cases per thousand children—were reported to state

child protective services (CPS) agencies, about a fivefold increase over the number and rate just

twenty years earlier (Waldfogel, 1998). Although there is debate about how much of this increase

in reports represents a real deterioration in the quality of care that children receive, and how much

reflects a growing awareness of child maltreatment, the effect has been to heighten interest in

identifying the determinants of abuse and neglect.

       This paper is concerned with the links between socioeconomic status—in particular,

poverty, employment, and family structure—and child maltreatment. We use state-level panel data

on numbers of reports and substantiated cases of child maltreatment, together with state-level

measures of the economic status of children’s families constructed from Current Population

Survey data, to estimate the relationship between family income, family structure (specifically the

absence of fathers), and parental work status and maltreatment outcomes. We find strong evidence

that these socioeconomic factors influence maltreatment. We also examine the effects of states’

welfare (AFDC and Food Stamp) benefit levels on child abuse and neglect. Since welfare benefit

levels influence parental employment, family income, and family structure, changes in welfare

benefits may affect maltreatment. Our evidence indicates that decreases in welfare benefit levels

are associated with increases in child neglect, and with small declines in physical abuse. We

conclude with a discussion of the likely effects of the current welfare reforms on child

maltreatment.

       Economists have long been concerned with determinants of children’s well-being, and

how the economic circumstances of families affect children’s health, their academic performance,

educational attainment, and ultimately their labor market performance as adults. However, there is

relatively little research that examines how economic circumstances are related to abuse and

neglect. And, there are several reasons why it should be a topic of interest to economists.
                                                                                                        2

       First, a better understanding of the determinants of child abuse and neglect contributes to

the literature that links socioeconomic circumstances to children’s performance, in school, on

cognitive tests, and later in life as adults. A large body of evidence indicates that children from

families with lower incomes, and children from single-parent families, perform more poorly on

standardized tests and are more likely to leave school early, and to be poor as adults (see, for

example, Corcoran et.al (1992), Hill and Duncan (1987), Brooks-Gunn and Duncan (1997),

Mayer (1997), and Shea (1999)). However, the mechanisms through which these effects operate

are not well-understood. Child maltreatment is one possible avenue through which socioeconomic

factors may affect children’s outcomes. The research presented in this paper indicates that

increases in poverty and single-parenthood result in higher levels of abuse and neglect. And, child

neglect and abuse have been shown to result in poorer academic performance, greater delinquency

and substance abuse, and other behavioral problems that may result in poor labor market

outcomes later in life (Widom, 1989; Starr and Wolfe, 1991). In addition, children who are abused

may be more likely to abuse their own children (Kaufman and Zigler, 1987; Widom, 1989).

        Second, a prerequisite for studying the determinants of children’s well-being is having

measures of children’s well-being. Measuring the welfare of children—or of people of any age

group within a household—is not an easy task. Given the data that are typically available from

household surveys, it is difficult to measure what children consume: they share their homes with

adults, many of the goods they consume fall into the category of “public goods,” and survey data

rarely provide breakdowns of how private goods are allocated within households. Furthermore,

the quality of care that children receive is likely to be as important a determinant of their welfare

as the quantities of goods and services they consume, and measuring the quality of care is

difficult. Measures of child neglect and abuse are very useful indicators of the quality of life of

children, in that they provide information on the numbers of children who receive extremely poor

care, both in terms of material deprivation and the treatment they receive by their parents.
                                                                                                       3

       Third, our research is related to work on the effects of economic fluctuations on health

outcomes, much of which is concerned with the links between economic fluctuations and the

mental and physical health of adults. Goldsmith, Veum and Darity (1996) present evidence that

adults who become unemployed are more likely to become depressed and to suffer from loss of

self-esteem. Ruhm (1999) examines the relationship between recessions and mortality, and argues

that recessions are actually good for adult health—recessions are associated with fewer deaths

from coronary disease, accidents, and a variety of other causes. However, Ruhm’s work also

indicates that adult mental health suffers during recessions: of the ten categories of death

examined, death by suicide is the only one that is countercyclical. This research is relevant to the

study of child maltreatment, because the mental health of adults is an important determinant of

their children’s well-being. Previous work indicates that parental depression and stress are

associated with more child maltreatment (Cicchetti and Carlson, 1989). If so, the effects of

parental unemployment on maltreatment may operate directly, through effects on family income,

but also indirectly through their effects on the mental health of parents.

       Although the empirical work in this paper is largely descriptive, it is useful to consider the

types of models that result in links between economic factors and child maltreatment. A good

starting place is a simple model of expenditure on “children’s goods,” defined broadly to include

parental time as well as goods and services, in which parents make choices by maximizing their

welfare (which, with altruism, will also be a function of their children’s welfare), given prices and

their endowments of time and money. In this case, the basket of goods that children consume, as

well as children’s welfare, will be a function of parental endowments, parental preferences, and

prices. Child maltreatment can be defined to occur when a child’s welfare falls below a threshold

level. In this simple framework, increases in income and reductions in the prices of “children’s

goods” will result in less maltreatment.

       This simple framework ignores several important aspects of child maltreatment. First,

abuse is often the result of inappropriate behaviors by parents toward their children, rather than
                                                                                                          4

inadequate allocations of goods or services. Because emotional and physical cruelty are not terms

that enter budget constraints, they are more difficult to model, and economic factors may operate

on them in different ways. For example, it may be that (some) parents derive pleasure from

maltreating their children, but that maltreatment will, if detected, result in a penalty. In this case,

economic factors enter a parent’s maltreatment decisions by affecting the opportunity cost of

detection relative to the value of being abusive. In theory, since the cost of detection relative to the

value of maltreatment could rise or fall with income, maltreatment could decrease or increase with

income. Second, factors such as stress and depression affect the likelihood that parents maltreat

their children, and these factors may themselves be affected by economic circumstances. For

example, the loss of self esteem or depression that accompany unemployment may result in

greater levels of child maltreatment, over and above effects that operate more directly through the

budget constraint. Likewise, single parenthood may result in greater maltreatment not only

because single-parent households tend to be poor, but also because of the stress associated with

raising children alone. Given the state-level data we use in this study, it is not possible to

disentangle the effects of changes in economic conditions that work directly through budget

constraints from those that operate through changes in parental attitudes and behaviors. Our intent

is to establish whether economic conditions affect child maltreatment; a more precise

understanding of how these effects operate requires micro-level data.

        A final important issue is that unobserved parental characteristics that result in abuse and

neglect may be correlated with factors that affect labor market outcomes and family structure. For

example, an emotionally unstable mother may be less likely to work, less likely to live with her

child’s father, and more likely to abuse or neglect her child. A finding that unemployment or

single parenthood is positively related to maltreatment does not provide information on the

underlying structural mechanisms that drive the relationship. This general issue is also important

(and hotly debated) in the research on socioeconomic factors and cognitive and academic

achievement. For example, Mayer (1997), Blau (1999), and Shea (1999) argue that parental
                                                                                                      5

factors, such as education and the overall quality of the family (i.e. “family background”) are far

more important determinants of children’s success than is current income. Other studies, however,

contend that economic deprivation in childhood does have direct and profound consequences for

children. For example, Brooks-Gunn and Duncan (1997) argue that income deprivation leads to

lower achievement by undermining the quality of parenting and the availability of educational

resources in the home. This is a difficult issue to settle. However, the results we present on the

negative effects of state’s welfare benefit levels on child neglect lends support to the latter

position.

       The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we provide background information on

the child protective service systems that are in place in all US states and the District of Columbia.

Data and empirical methods are discussed in Section III. Section IV presents evidence on the

relationships between poverty, parental employment, and family structure on child maltreatment.

In an earlier paper (Paxson and Waldfogel, 1999), we presented preliminary evidence that

fluctuations in these socioeconomic factors are associated with large changes in rates of child

maltreatment. The work presented in this section expands on these results. We trace through the

effects of economic factors on reports of child maltreatment, substantiation rates, and on final

numbers of substantiated cases of physical abuse, neglect, sexual abuse, and other forms of abuse.

We also examine the relationship between cocaine use and maltreatment, and the effects of

socioeconomic factors on flows of children into the foster care system.

       Section V turns to the links between family structure, welfare benefits, and child

maltreatment. Welfare programs affect the incentives of women and men to work and to live in

single or dual-parent families. By changing the family structure and work behavior of parents as

well as their incomes, welfare reforms can be expected to affect the incidence of child

maltreatment. Our analysis indicates that decreases in a state’s welfare benefit levels result in

sizeable increases in child neglect, and small decreases in physical abuse. We conclude with a

(cautious) discussion of the effects of current welfare reforms on child maltreatment.

II. Child Maltreatment and Child Protective Services
        All fifty states and the District of Columbia have legislation defining child maltreatment

and specifying under what circumstances it should be reported and by whom; they also have

systems in place to receive reports of suspected child maltreatment, to determine whether or not

reports should be substantiated, and to decide what actions, including removal of children to

foster care or some other form of substitute care, should be taken to protect children from further

harm. The most common type of maltreatment reported to child protective services (CPS) is

neglect, which constitutes about 58% of all reports. Physical abuse makes up 22% of reports.

Sexual abuse, emotional maltreatment, and other categories together account for the remaining

20% (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1998). Reports may be made by so-called

“mandated reporters”, usually individuals such as doctors or teachers who work with children and

who are required by law to report suspected cases of maltreatment, or by voluntary reporters, such

as family members, friends and neighbors, or the children themselves. About 40% of reports are

substantiated upon investigation by CPS, and just under 30% are kept open for ongoing

intervention, which may involve removing the child from home or monitoring the child’s safety at

home (Waldfogel, 1998).

       The system of child protective services in the US has expanded greatly over the past four

decades, along with a growing awareness of and concern about child maltreatment. It was not

until 1968 that all states had mandatory reporting laws. There was little federal involvement in

the area of child maltreatment until 1974, when the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act

(CAPTA) was enacted. CAPTA established standards for identification of and response to child

maltreatment, created the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect (NCCAN), and allocated

small amounts of Federal money to states that created adequate child protective service agencies.

One result of Federal involvement has been the creation of a state-level data base on child

maltreatment. Since 1988, NCCAN has been charged with collecting and publishing data on the

incidence of maltreatment. Every year since 1990, state child protection agencies have been asked
                                                                                                       7

to provide data on the number of reports of child maltreatment, the disposition of reports, and the

breakdown of substantiated cases by type of abuse, as well as by other categories (such as the type

of perpetrator, and the age and ethnicity of victims).

       Although these data are extremely useful, they must be treated with some caution, since

states differ in how their child protective service systems operate. Each state has its own laws

against child maltreatment, and their definitions of physical abuse, sexual abuse, neglect, and

other forms of maltreatment are not identical. However, there are common elements in the

definitions in different states. Physical and sexual abuse have the most clear-cut definitions.

Physical abuse consists of a physical injury, or threatened injury, inflicted by a person responsible

for the child’s care on the child other than by accidental means. Where states differ is in how

severe a physical injury must be to qualify as abuse. Some states simply state that physical injury

constitutes abuse. Other states specify that the injury has to result in long-term or severe harm to

the child. Some states explicitly exempt spanking. Sexual abuse usually covers any sexual contact

between a child and a person responsible for the child’s care. Variations in the definition of sexual

abuse across states are usually due to differences in the definition of who qualifies as a “person

responsible for care.”

       Neglect is the most difficult form of maltreatment to define, and is often split into sub-

components that relate to physical, medical, and educational neglect. The elements that are

common to most definitions of neglect include: 1) the failure by an adult responsible for a child to

supply the child with necessary food, clothing and shelter, 2) the failure to supply necessary

medical care; and 3) the failure to send a child to school in accordance with state law. Some laws

explicitly state that leaving children unattended or in inadequate care is a form of neglect. An

important point to note is that neglect is not necessarily a mechanical result of poverty. Instead, an

assessment of neglect is often conditioned on the resources of the child’s parents or guardians.

Some statutes make this explicit, by specifying that only care-givers who fail to provide children

with basic needs and who are capable of doing so are guilty of neglect (see, for example, Minn.
                                                                                                            8

Stat. §626.556.)1 The idea that neglect should be assessed in light of the family’s economic

circumstances also appears in literature on the assessment of neglect. For example, Gaudin (1993)

writes that the “assessment of the adequacy of ... housing and household furniture and appliances

must be considered in the context of the limited housing options that conditions of poverty allow

many families of color. The unavailability of adequate low-rent housing becomes a question of

community neglect, rather than child neglect on the part of parents who are denied access to more

adequate housing by reason of economics or discrimination.” A legal guide for physicians,

Richards and Rathbun (1999) states that “If the parents have the resources to care for a child

properly but choose not to, they are neglecting that child” (italics added.) Implicitly or explicitly,

children are often counted as being neglected only if they do not receive care or resources that

their parents or care-givers should have been able to provide given their resources.

        There are several other important differences across states in their laws regarding abuse

and neglect. First, states differ in their definitions of mandated reporters. For example, in some

states only professionals who come into contact with children (physicians, teachers, etc.) are

required to report suspected child maltreatment. In other states, everyone is a mandated reporter.

Second, states differ in the level of evidence required to substantiate a report of maltreatment:

some require “some credible evidence”, while others require “a preponderance of evidence.”

These differences, combined with varying definitions of maltreatment, may be responsible for

some of the variation across states (including the District of Columbia) in the report rates and

substantiation rates of child maltreatment—and these cross-state differences are large. For

example, in Washington D.C. in 1994, 13,369 children, or 11.2% of the children under the age of

18, were the subject of a investigation by CPS, and 5635, or 42%, of these cases were

substantiated. In Pennsylvania, a state with one of the most stringent definitions of child abuse in

        1
          Other states exempt parents from responsibility due to lack of resources only in special cases.
For example, Arizona law specifies that neglect is the “inability or unwillingness” of a care-taker to
provide adequate resources, except in cases where care to a child with a disability or chronic illness is the
result of “unavailability of reasonable services.” (A.R.S. §8-201(21).)
                                                                                                        9

the country, only 0.8% of children were the subject of an investigation in 1994, and the

substantiation rate was 30% (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1996). Although

differences in the socioeconomic circumstances of children in these two locations may account for

some of the difference in rates, a major source is likely to be institutional and legal differences.

For this reason, it is important that our analysis adequately accounts for heterogeneity across states

in their laws and in the ways their CPS systems operate.



III. Data and Methods
A. Data

       The data for our analysis come from a variety of sources. First, the state-level information

on child maltreatment from 1990 to 1996 comes from the NCCAN data base. This data base

contains information on the numbers of reports of child maltreatment, and the numbers of

substantiated cases of physical abuse, neglect, sexual abuse, and other types of abuse. This

information can be used to calculate each state’s substantiation rate. We also use information on

reports from 1977 to 1988, collected by the American Humane Association (from 1977 to 1987)

and the National Committee for the Prevention of Child Abuse (in 1988). No consistent

information on substantiated cases is available prior to 1990, and we have no state-level

information on reports or victims of maltreatment in 1989.

       A few details of our measures of abuse and neglect require discussion. First, “reports” are

usually recorded by states on a family basis (i.e. number of families reported for maltreatment) but

are also sometimes reported on a child basis (i.e. number of children suspected to be victims of

maltreatment.) We converted all reports to a “family” basis by multiplying “child-based” reports

by the average ratio of family-based to child-based reports in states that produced both figures.

Our results do not appear to be sensitive to how this conversion is done, and we obtain similar

results if we restrict the sample to states that use family-based reports. Second, states vary in how

reports of maltreatment are disposed of after investigation. Most reports are deemed to be
                                                                                                   10

substantiated or unsubstantiated, although in some cases there may be no finding (if, for example,

the child protective service agency is unable to locate the family.) In addition, some states have a

category of “indicated,” which means that although there is evidence of maltreatment it does not

rise to the level required by state law for substantiation. Our measures of the numbers of victims

of child maltreatment include both indicated and substantiated cases. Third, some states report

medical neglect as a category separate from neglect, but many do not. To make the data more

consistent across states, we combine the two categories into one. Fourth, we report results for the

category of “other.” This category includes a variety of types of maltreatment, and is the least

likely of all measures to be defined the same way across states. For most states it includes

emotional maltreatment. Other types of maltreatment that are commonly included in “other” are

abandonment and contributing to the delinquency of a child. In addition, many states include

newborns exposed to controlled substances (usually cocaine) in this category—this is important to

keep in mind when we examine the relationship between drug use and maltreatment. Fifth, our

measure of the total number of victims is the sum of victims in each of the categories (physical

abuse, neglect, sexual abuse, and other.) In some states, children who are victims of more than one

type of maltreatment are included in the victim totals of each type of maltreatment they were

exposed to. In these cases, our measure of “total victims” is overstated. This is unlikely to bias our

results since we include state fixed effects in our models.

       The state-level data on the socioeconomic characteristics of children’s families come from

the 1977-1996 March Current Population Surveys. These variables were defined to reflect the

living conditions of children within each state and each year, rather than the living conditions of

the entire population. For each year, we selected records for all children under the age of 18,

constructed socioeconomic variables for each child, and then computed estimates of state-level

means across children, using the appropriate individual-level survey weights. Each year of the

March Current Population Survey contains information on approximately 40,000 to 50,000

children. However, even with samples of these sizes, there are some state-year cells with small
                                                                                                       11

numbers of children. The median number of children per state-year was 562, with a range from

150 (District of Columbia) to 4,210 (California). The state-level statistics include the average of

the logarithm of the child’s household per capita income, the fraction of children with family

income less than 75% of the poverty line, the fraction of children living in urban areas, the

fraction of children who are white, black, or of another race, the fraction of children whose mother

has less than a high-school diploma, the fraction of children with an employed mother, the

fraction with a non-working father, and the fraction with no father in the household. (Few children

live in households with no mother, and we excluded these cases.) We also constructed more

detailed measures of family structure and employment status. These show the fraction of children

in each of six categories, which represent all the combinations of the mother’s work status with

the father’s status. In cases where both a mother and father are present, the possible categories are

two working parents, two non-working parents, a working father and non-working mother, or a

non-working father and working mother. When only a mother is present, children may be

classified as having an absent father and working mother, or an absent father and non-working

mother.

       Our definitions of “mother” and “father” require discussion. A child’s mother is identified

in the Current Population Survey by her record number, and we selected only children with

mothers present. We do not know whether the mother is biological, adoptive, or step. We defined

“father” more broadly, to include biological, step and adoptive fathers, as well as adult men living

in the household who are not relatives of the child and are not explicitly identified as the child’s

father. (Men in this last category are referred to here as “imputed” fathers.) Ideally, we would like

to distinguish between children who live with biological and non-biological parents. This is

potentially important, given evidence that non-biological parents – step-parents or co-habitants of

the parent – are more likely to abuse children (Daly and Wilson, 1996). However, the Current

Population Survey does not permit such fine distinctions. We do know that “imputed” fathers are

unlikely to be biological fathers, but we do not know whether or not the people identified as
                                                                                                               12

fathers (and mothers) are biological. We examined whether increases in the fractions of children

with “imputed” fathers resulted in more maltreatment. These estimated effects of imputed fathers

on maltreatment were not statistically different from zero, with large standard errors.

        State-level information on drug arrests was drawn from various years of the “FBI Uniform

Crime Reports.” State-level information on the number of children in foster care from 1983 to

1996 was obtained from the American Public Welfare Association’s Voluntary Cooperative

Information System. Finally, estimates of the numbers of adults and children in different age

categories in each state and year were obtained from the web site of the US Census Bureau. Our

final data set consists of 920 state-year observations for the years 1977 to 1996 (except 1989). For

much of our analysis we make use of a smaller sample of 320 state-year observations that covers

the 1990-1996 period, for which information on the numbers of victims of maltreatment is

available. Appendix Table A1 provides descriptive statistics on the variables used in our analysis.



B. Methods

        The models we estimate are straightforward. For each of the measures of maltreatment, we

estimate equations of the form:

                                      ln ( yst ) '   s   %   t   % XNst % est ,                                (1)
where ln ( yst ) is the logarithm of reports, the logarithm of the substantiation rate, or the logarithm

of the number of victims of maltreatment for state s in year t. The term          s   denotes a set of state

fixed effects, and the term   t   denotes a set of year effects. The vector Xst contains a set of controls

for the logarithm of the state’s population, the logarithm of the number of children in the state,

and the fraction of children in different age categories. It also contains other controls (such as the

fraction of children who live in urban areas, the fraction of children in different ethnic groups, and

the fraction of children whose mothers do not have a high-school degree), as well as measures of

the economic circumstances and family structure of children in the state.
                                                                                                      13

       The use of state and year fixed effects is important. A major concern is that the state-level

socioeconomic factors in Xst may be correlated with unobserved state-specific factors that

influence child maltreatment, producing biased parameter estimates. These factors could include

things such as (unobserved) parental attitudes or the cost of child care, that genuinely affect the

way that children are treated, as well as differences across states in how maltreatment is defined

and how strenuously the state enforces its child maltreatment laws. To the extent that these factors

are fixed over time, the bias can be eliminated by the inclusion of state fixed effects. Another

concern is that the large upward trend in reports of child maltreatment over the 1970s and 1980s

will be spuriously correlated with trends in other variables, such as female labor force

participation. The inclusion of year effects will sweep out these factors, at least to the extent that

they are common across states.

       An important issue is measurement error in the right-hand-side variables. A subset of the

variables in Xst are computed as state-level averages using data from the March Current

Population Survey, and these averages are imprecise measures of the true state averages. Without

correcting for sampling error in the right-hand-side variables, the estimates of (1) will be biased.

Furthermore, the inclusion of fixed effects is likely to make the biases associated with

measurement error worse. However, this form of bias due to measurement error is straightforward

to fix. As shown in Deaton (1985), the bias in the parameter estimates is a function of the

variances and covariances of the state-level means constructed from the Current Population

Survey. These variances and covariances can be estimated from the micro data, and used to adjust

the parameter estimates for bias. Specifically, let Zst denote the vector of state dummies, year

dummies, and all elements of Xst that are on the right-hand-side of (1), and     denote the vector of

coefficients including the fixed effects and , so that equation (1) can be expressed as:

                                       ln ( yst ) ' ZNst % est ,                                      (2)
Only a subset of the elements in Zst, were calculated from the Current Population Survey, and
assume that only these variables are subject to sampling error. (Although the Census Bureau’s
                                                                                                     14

inter-censal population estimates are measured with some error, we do not have the information

necessary to correct for any resulting biases.) Assume that the observed values of ln ( yst ) and Zst

are jointly normally distributed with means equal to their true values:

                                    ln(yst)    ln(yst)(     0
                                            -N     (    , 0   .                                     (3)
                                      Zst        Zst     0
The term   0   is the error variance of the dependent variable, and G is the variance-covariance

matrix of Z . The appropriate rows and columns of G are set to zero for the elements of Z that are

assumed to be measured without error (i.e. the fixed effects and the independent variables not

calculated from the Current Population Survey.) A consistent estimator of       is:
                                   -
                                       ' ( ZNZ & N G )&1 ZNln(y) ,                                 (4)


where N is the number of observations, and G is replaced by its estimate from the micro data.

Deaton (1985) contains the relevant formula for G and for the standard errors of the estimates. As

we shall see below, these corrections for bias due to sampling error typically had very large

effects, often increasing the size of fixed-effects estimates by more than 50%.



IV. Poverty, Parental Employment, Family Structure and Maltreatment
       The first question we address is whether reports of maltreatment are associated with the

economic conditions of children’s families. Regression results based on data from 1977 to 1996

(excluding 1989) are in Table 1. We use these results to illustrate the importance of including

state fixed-effects and adjusting for bias due to sampling error.

       The first column of Table 1 reports parameter estimates from a regression that does not

include state fixed-effects (although year effects are included), and does not adjust for bias due to

sampling error. These results indicate large and significant effects of socioeconomic factors on

reports. The fractions of children who are black and from other non-white (mostly Hispanic)

ethnic backgrounds have negative effects on reports. These effects are large: they imply that an
                                                                                                         15

increase in the fraction of children who are black from 0.05 to 0.10 would reduce reports of child

maltreatment by about 5.5%. Increases in average incomes reduce reports—although contrary to

other research on reports of child maltreatment, the fraction of children in extreme poverty is

negatively related to reports. There are also large, positive, and significant effects of the fraction

of children living in families with working mothers (relative to those with non-working mothers),

and with absent fathers or unemployed fathers (relative to working fathers). The effects of fathers’

status are especially large: an increase in the fraction of children with absent or non-working

fathers of 0.05 is estimated to produce an increase in reports of over 11%.

       How does bias adjustment and the inclusion state fixed-effects affect the results? The

second column continues to exclude state fixed effects, but shows bias-adjusted parameter

estimates. Bias adjustment generally increases the coefficients (in absolute value), sometimes by

as much as 30%. The t-values are largely unchanged. Adding state fixed effects (third column)

and then fixed effects with bias adjustment (fourth column) has additional effects. First, the

introduction of state fixed effects eliminates the negative effect of “fraction of children who are

black” on reports of maltreatment: although states with larger fractions of black children have

fewer reports of maltreatment, within-state changes in the fraction of children who are black have

positive but insignificant effects on reports. Second, the formerly large and significant effects of

absent father and non-working fathers also vanish with the introduction of state fixed effects. In

the fourth column, the only socioeconomic variables (other than the variables that measure the age

structure of the population) that are significant are average income, which continues to have a

negative effect on reports, and mother’s employment, which has a positive effect. Third, the bias

adjustments have even larger effects when fixed effects are included, increasing some coefficients

(in absolute value) by more than 50%.

       In general, our results without fixed effects are largely consistent with previous work on

the determinants of reports of maltreatment, whereas our fixed effects results are not. Previous

research, based largely on small cross-sections of data on individual children, has concluded that
                                                                                                     16

children who are poor, have unemployed fathers, or live with single mothers are more likely than

others to be reported to their states’ child protective service agencies (see, for instance, Gil, 1970;

Hampton and Newburger, 1985; Lindsey, 1994; Zellman, 1992). There is also evidence from

community studies that children living in poor areas are more likely to be reported to CPS, as are

children from communities with higher levels of unemployment or lone parenthood (see Ards,

1989; Coulton, Korbin, Su, and Chow, 1995; Drake and Pandey, 1996; Garbarino, 1976;

Garbarino and Kostelny, 1992; Garbarino and Sherman, 1980; Spearly and Lauderdale, 1983; and

Steinberg, Catalano, and Dooley, 1981). However, our results indicate that these relationships in

cross-sectional or community studies do not hold up in a national sample observed over the time

period during which many of these studies were conducted.

       Reports of maltreatment may be quite inaccurate measures of true maltreatment. Numbers

of reports are subject to changes in reporting requirements, and to changes in public awareness of

child maltreatment. Given that around 60% of reports are not substantiated, it is quite possible

that socioeconomic factors that are not associated with reports may be associated with the number

of substantiated victims of maltreatment. In Table 2, we use data from 1990-1996 to trace through

the effects of socioeconomic factors on reports, substantiation rates, and the number of victims of

different types of maltreatment. The top panel of Table 2 shows results from regressions with a

specification identical to that in the last column of Table 1 (i.e. fixed effects are included, and bias

adjustments are made throughout.)

       The first point to note is that the relationships between income, poverty, and parental

status and reports of maltreatment for 1990-1996 are different than they were for the 1977-1996

period. The effect of income on reports is no longer significant, although increases in extreme

poverty are now positively and marginally significantly associated with more reports. The fraction

of children with working mothers no longer has a large and significant effect on reports, whereas

the fraction of children with non-working fathers now does. There are several possible reasons for

these changes. First, it may be that the factors that influence reports of maltreatment have changed
                                                                                                      17

over time. For example, mothers who worked might have been perceived to be more neglectful in

the 1970s and early 1980s, when work was less common, but that an increased acceptance of

working mothers has reduced this effect. It could also be that the development of after-school

programs and other child-care programs designed to help working parents has genuinely reduced

the amount of maltreatment formerly produced by mothers’ employment. Second, the system of

child protective services was rapidly expanding and evolving during the 1970s and 1980s. It is

possible that the factors that prompted changes in state laws that resulted in greater reports were

correlated with variables such as women’s labor force participation or single-parenthood,

producing biased parameter estimates. By 1990, the systems of child protective services in most

states had stabilized, and the large increase in report rates that marked the 1970s and 1980s was

essentially complete. The evidence from the 1990-1996 period is much less likely to suffer from

bias due to correlation of changes in laws and practices regarding child maltreatment with changes

in states’ economic and demographic structure.

        The second and third columns of the top panel of Table 2 indicate that the socioeconomic

characteristics of families do affect the substantiation rate, and that several of the factors that are

not significantly related to reports are significantly related to the number of victims. (Note that the

marginal effect of any variable on the logarithm of victims must be equal to the sum of its effects

on the logarithm of reports and the logarithm of the substantiation rate.) Increases in average per

capita incomes and in the fraction of children in extreme poverty are positively related to the

substantiation rate and the number of victims. That higher average incomes (holding the poverty

rate fixed) result in higher substantiation rates may reflect the fact that states can afford to

substantiate more cases during good economic times. The effects of poverty on victims is large:

an increase in the fraction of children in extreme poverty from 0.10 to 0.15 increases the numbers

of victims by 22%. Increases in the fractions of children with absent and non-working fathers are

also associated with large and significant increases in the numbers of victims.
                                                                                                    18

       The final four columns of Table 2 (top panel) break the numbers of victims into specific

types of maltreatment. The general pattern—that increases in poverty, absent fathers, and

unemployed fathers are associated with more maltreatment—is true for most of the individual

types of maltreatment. However, there are some important differences. As might be expected,

poverty has a bigger impact on neglect than on physical abuse. “Absent fathers” have larger

effects on physical abuse than neglect. The greater impact of “absent fathers” on physical abuse

could be due to a variety of factors: single mothers could be more likely to physically abuse their

children, or children with single mothers could be more often left in the care of others who

physically abuse them. We cannot distinguish between these alternative interpretations without

breakdowns of the sex of perpetrators and their relationship to the victim by the type of

maltreatment—information states do not include in their summary data reports to NCCAN. The

largest effects of poverty, absent fathers, and unemployed fathers are for the rather uninformative

category of “other” types of maltreatment. Since “other” includes, for many states, substance-

exposed newborns, we examine below whether drug use in a state accounts for these results.

       It is likely that the status of fathers and mothers operate jointly to influence child

maltreatment. For example, the effects of absent fathers may be different when mothers do or do

not work. In the bottom panel of Table 2 we include measures of the fractions of children in each

of five categories that represent different combinations of the mother’s and father’s status. The

sixth, omitted, category is the fraction of children with working fathers and non-working mothers.

Using this more complete specification yields the following results:

       First, the effects of poverty on all types of maltreatment become larger, and the difference

between the effects of poverty on neglect and physical abuse increases.

       Second, the positive effects of higher shares of children living in an absent-father families

on physical abuse and neglect are apparent only when single mothers work, but not when they stay

at home. This finding is consistent with working single mothers being more neglectful or abusive,

or with the children of working single mothers being left in inadequate care. The estimated effect
                                                                                                          19

of moving a single mother from non-work to work is quite large. For example, the results imply

that a shift of one percent of children from the category of “absent father, non-working mother” to

“absent father, working mother” is associated with an increase in substantiated cases of physical

abuse of 6.6%, and an increase in neglect of 12.6%.

        Third, higher fractions of children with non-working fathers and working mothers are not

associated with more maltreatment of any type, although higher fractions of children with two

unemployed parents have large effects on all types of maltreatment. To the extent that the fraction

of children in extreme poverty and average per capita income do not adequately control for family

income, this result could be due to the lower income of children with two non-working parents.

Alternatively, families with two non-working parents could be subject to more stress that results

in more maltreatment, or could have other problems (such as mental illness or substance abuse)

that are related both to unemployment and maltreatment.

        Finally, the relationship between parental status and numbers of victims in the category

“other” are quite different from the relationships for other types of victims. For example, greater

fractions of children with absent fathers and non-working mothers are associated with large

increases in victims of “other” types of maltreatment.

        The rise in maltreatment in the 1980s has often been attributed to drug use, and in

particular to the rise in the use of crack cocaine. In many states, newborns found to be exposed to

cocaine were automatically counted as substantiated victims of child maltreatment (and usually

classified in the category “other”). Parental drug use may also result in worse parenting of older

children. Furthermore, it may be that some of the family characteristics we are interested in may

be correlated with drug use, and it is useful to examine whether controlling for drug use changes

our previous results. Ideally, we would include controls for the fraction of children whose parents

use illegal drugs, or even better for the prices of illegal drugs, but this information is difficult to
                                                                                                       20

obtain.2 Instead, we include measures of the logarithm of the numbers of adult men and adult

women who were arrested and charged with cocaine possession. (We also experimented with

controlling for arrests for possession of any type of drugs, with similar results.)

        The results in Table 3 show mixed support for the hypothesis of a link between cocaine

use and maltreatment. When state fixed effects are not included, there is a positive and significant

relationship between female cocaine possession and all types of maltreatment except for sexual

abuse. Male cocaine possession has a negative effect, but it is not significant for any category

except “other.” However, the relationship between female cocaine possession and maltreatment

disappears with the inclusion of state fixed effects, for all categories except “other.” The fact that

female cocaine use remains positively related to “other” forms of maltreatment makes sense,

given the often mechanical link between substance exposure for newborns and substantiation.

        The change in results when state fixed effects are included could be due to several factors.

It is possible that a state’s arrests for female cocaine possession is related to (fixed) state

characteristics that are positively related to maltreatment. Under this interpretation, the positive

relationship between female cocaine use and maltreatment when fixed effects are not included is

spurious, and cocaine use actually has no effect on physical abuse, sexual abuse, or neglect.

However, it is also possible that the number of female cocaine arrests is a noisy measure of true

maternal cocaine use, and adding state fixed effects may exacerbate attenuation bias due to

measurement error. In either case, however, controlling for cocaine arrests does not account for

the large effects of non-working mothers and absent fathers, and two non-working parents, on

“other” types of maltreatment.

        The most extreme cases of child maltreatment result in removal of children from their

homes, usually to foster care. Using data from 1983 to 1996, we examine whether the factors that


        2
        Markowitz and Grossman (1998) present evidence that states that have higher alcohol
prices have greater rates of physical child abuse, and with prices of illegal drugs a similar
analysis could be conducted here.
                                                                                                      21

influence child maltreatment have similar effects on changes in the number of children in foster

care. The results of regressions of the logarithm of the number of children in foster care on the

same variables included in previous regressions are in Table 4, with and without controls for

cocaine possession. These results indicate that, although higher poverty is positively associated

with higher net flows into foster care, the effects of family characteristics on foster care differ

from their effects on the various measures of maltreatment. For example, the effect of moving

children from the omitted category of “working father and non-working mother” to the category

“absent father and non-working mother” is to reduce the number of children in foster care. And,

although the presence of two working parents was not associated with less maltreatment, it is

associated with smaller numbers in foster care. Still, some of the earlier patterns appear here:

moving the mothers of children with absent fathers from non-work to work increases foster care,

just as it increases maltreatment.

       One possible reason for the negative relationship between the fraction of children with

absent fathers and non-working mothers and foster care is that foster care may serve as a

substitute for welfare. Foster care is often provided by relatives of the child (and in fact states are

currently required to give priority to placement with relatives), and these foster families may

receive payments as foster families that exceed the welfare benefits the mother could have

qualified for had she retained the child in her own care—providing families in states with low

welfare benefits with incentives to place children in foster care in relative’s homes.3 In columns

(3) and (4), we control for the logarithm of the state’s maximum AFDC and Food Stamp benefit

for a family of four. Although the benefit level has a negative effect on foster care, the effect is not

significant, and its inclusion does not alter the previous results. Nor do the results change when




       3
         Although they do not look at foster care per se, studies by Brandon (1999) and Brandon
and Fisher (1999), using the SIPP, find that children living in states with low welfare benefits are
more likely to be living away from their parents.
                                                                                                        22

we control for cocaine arrests (in column 4) or when we restrict our sample to the 1990-1996 time

period used in Tables 2 and 3 (in column 5).

       There are two other explanations for the differences in the results for foster care and for

other types of maltreatment One is that the placement of children into foster care requires the

availability of a host foster family, and the number of host families may be influenced by family

structure within a state. In addition, children are placed into foster care for a variety of reasons.

Only about 50% of placements occur for protective service reasons; the remainder involve

delinquency, a child’s disability, or other reasons (APWA, 1996). These other types of placements

may respond differently to socioeconomic factors than placements due to maltreatment.



V. Welfare, Welfare Reform, and Child Maltreatment
       In this section we examine how the structure and generosity of states’ welfare systems has

influenced child maltreatment in the past, and assess how the recent welfare reforms may affect

child maltreatment in the future. Given the profile of families who are most likely to come to the

attention of CPS—poor, single parent, or two-parent with an unemployed father—it is perhaps not

surprising that there is a great deal of overlap between families who are on welfare and families

who are involved with the child welfare system. About half of families referred to CPS are

receiving welfare at the time of the referral, and more than half have received welfare in the past

(American Association for the Protection of Children, 1987; Lindsey, 1994; Pelton, 1994). The

share of foster children who come from families on welfare is high as well. A recent study in

Illinois found that about 40 percent of children placed into foster care came from families that

were on welfare at the time of the placement, with a further 20 percent from families that had been

on welfare recently, a much higher share than might be expected given that only about 15 percent

of children in Illinois lived in families that were receiving welfare (Shook, 1998). At any moment

in time, though, the percentage of families on welfare who are referred to CPS or have children

placed into foster care is much lower. A recent Chicago study, for instance, found that only 4
                                                                                                      23

percent of families on welfare became involved with the child welfare system over a sixteen-

month period, with an additional 24 percent having been involved with child welfare in the past

(Shook, 1999).

       How should the size and structure of welfare programs affect child maltreatment? We first

consider the effects of decreases in a state’s benefit level. Holding family structure and parental

employment status fixed, decreases in a state’s welfare benefits should increase poverty among

children—and our previous results indicate that increases in poverty increase maltreatment.

However, the generosity of welfare benefits may also affect the labor supply decisions of parents

(and hence the incomes of children’s families), change the fractions of children whose parents do

and do not work, and alter the decisions of parents to live with or without a partner. The effects of

changes in benefits on maltreatment will depend on how large the different incentive effects are,

something that is the topic of a great deal of research. A summary by Hoynes (1996) concludes

that the welfare system in the US has produced modest work disincentives, accounting for about

half of the difference in work effort between recipients and non-recipients of welfare, but has had

very small effects on family structure and fertility decisions (see also Moffitt, 1998, on this latter

point). However, even if the only effects of changes in benefit levels are to change work

incentives, the predicted effects of changes in benefits on maltreatment (given our previous

results) is still ambiguous. Lower benefits will decrease the incomes of those already on welfare,

but could result in higher incomes for families whose work effort increases in response to the

decrease in generosity. The net result could be an increase or decrease in the fractions of children

in poverty. Lower benefits may move single mothers into employment (predicted to increase

maltreatment, holding income constant) but may also result in fewer children with two non-

working parents (predicted to decrease maltreatment.)

       Changes in eligibility rules for welfare may also affect maltreatment. The effects of

changes in eligibility are of special interest given the recent reforms in the US welfare system. At

the federal level, the passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation
                                                                                                   24

Act (PRWORA) in 1996 imposed a five-year lifetime time limit on families’ eligibility for

federally funded cash assistance, replacing the previously open-ended Aid to Families with

Dependent Children program (AFDC) with the tellingly named Temporary Assistance to Needy

Families program (TANF). The federal law also required many single mothers to work as a

condition of receiving welfare. Reforms at the state level, which in many instances preceded the

federal reforms in 1996,4 may impose even shorter time limits and tighter work requirements, and

families who do not comply with work or other program requirements may be “sanctioned”, i.e.,

may lose all or part of their cash benefits. As a result, child welfare analysts have raised concerns

about the potential impacts of both the federal and state reforms on referrals to CPS (see, for

instance, Besharov, 1997; Courtney, 1997; and Waldfogel, 1998). Waivers that have the effect of

forcing people off of AFDC and into employment could in principle increase or reduce

maltreatment. Depending on what jobs former welfare recipients find, incomes could rise or fall.

In addition, we might expect to find positive effects for a child if the mother was happy with her

job, had a more stable source of income, and a more extensive social network. However, there

might also be negative effects, if the mother was stressed by her job, had more difficulty making

ends meet due to work expenses, and had less energy available for the child at the end of the day.

The effect on the child would also depend on the quality and stability of the setting where the

child was cared for while the mother was at work.

       There is some evidence that work requirements and time limits adopted between 1992 and

1996, prior to the PRWORA, have had effects. Recent work by Moffitt (1999) indicates that states

that adopted stricter work requirements and time limits also experienced increases in the labor

supply of women, especially those with low levels of education. However, these results should be



       4
          States were allowed to implement reforms prior to the passage of the new federal law, if
they obtained a “waiver” from the federal government. In 1992, six states had obtained one or
more waivers related to work requirements, time limits, work incentives, or child support
enforcement; by 1996, all but six had (Ziliak et al, 1997).
                                                                                                      25

treated with some caution: in work on the effects of waivers on AFDC caseloads, Blank (1997)

presents evidence that the adoption of waivers was correlated with other (unobserved) factors that

affected caseloads. For example, caseloads appear to decline prior to the implementation of

waivers. Although we control for waiver adoption in the results that follow, a persuasive analysis

of the effects of waivers on maltreatment will require a long span of data from the post-PRWORA

period.

          To analyze the relationship between welfare and maltreatment, we combined state-level

information on maltreatment up to 1996 with information on welfare benefit levels (we use the

logarithm of the maximum welfare benefit including cash and Food Stamps for a family of four),

and with information on whether the state had an AFDC-UP program, and whether it had received

any type of waiver allowing it to impose stronger work requirements, work incentives, or time

limits for the receipt of AFDC in the years prior to 1996. These data are used to establish that the

characteristics of states’ welfare systems do in fact influence the types of families in which

children live, and to assess the effects of states’ welfare systems on child maltreatment.

          First, we establish that the characteristics of welfare programs have an effect on

employment and living arrangements of children’s parents. The top panel of Table 5 uses data

from 1977 to 1996, and examines the relationships between welfare program characteristics, the

fraction of children living in different types of families, and the fraction of children in extreme

poverty. The dependent variable for the first five columns is the logarithm of the fraction of

children in the specified family type minus the logarithm of the fraction in the omitted category (a

working father and non-working mother.) Besides the welfare measures, we also include controls

for a variety of children’s characteristics (ethnicity, urbanization, mother’s education, etc.) that are

plausibly not affected by the welfare system, and a set of year and state dummies. The welfare

measures are all lagged one year, on the theory that behavioral responses to changes in the welfare

system take time to occur.
                                                                                                       26

        The results confirm that characteristics of state welfare systems affect the distribution of

children across families of different types, in ways that make sense. Higher benefit levels increase

the fraction of children in “absent father/non-working mother” households, relative to the omitted

category as well as relative to the “absent father/working mother” category. (The coefficients on

the logarithm of benefits in the first and second column are significantly different from each other,

with a t-statistics of 3.37). States that adopted AFDC-UP programs experienced declines in the

fractions of children living in households with non-working fathers and working mothers relative

to those with two non-working parents. Although no state had a waiver to impose stronger work

requirements or time limits prior to 1992, there is weak evidence that waivers are associated with

work behavior. States that adopted waivers experienced increases in the fractions of children with

absent fathers and working mothers. However, the evidence that the mothers of children with

absent fathers have switched from non-work to work is less strong. Although the difference in the

coefficient on “any waiver” between column 1 (father absent/mother works) and column 2 (father

absent/mother home) is .078, the hypothesis that this difference is zero cannot be rejected, with a

t-statistic of only 1.07.

        The effects of welfare on extreme poverty are in the last column. The benefit level and

waiver measures are not significantly related to poverty. However, the adoption of AFDC-UP

programs is associated with a significant increase in poverty. Although this is possible in theory

(if AFDC-UP provides incentives to leave work) it may also be that states with more serious child

poverty problems were more likely to adopt AFDC-UP programs early. Several other studies have

reported “perverse” effects of the presence of an AFDC-UP program (see, for instance, Hoynes,

1997; Blau, Kahn, and Waldfogel, 1999).

        How have the characteristics of states’ welfare systems affected maltreatment? To answer

this question, we use data from the 1990-1996 time period, for which information on substantiated

victims is available. The results are in the bottom panel of Table 5, which show regressions of the

logarithm of reports, victims, and victims of different types of maltreatment on the welfare benefit
                                                                                                        27

level and whether the state had a waiver, plus state effects, year effects, and other controls listed in

Table 5. (The variable AFDC-UP is excluded because all states had these programs by 1990.) The

major result is that welfare benefit levels are negatively related to neglect and to foster care, and

these effects are large and significant. A ten-percent increase in the maximum welfare benefit for

a family of four is predicted to reduce neglect by thirty-nine percent, and to decrease the foster

care population by nearly twenty percent. The results of the top panel indicate that these effect do

not work through reductions in the fraction of children in poverty: higher welfare benefits do not

appear to produce poverty declines. However, increases in welfare benefits do result in increases

in the fractions of children with absent fathers and non-working mothers relative to those with

absent fathers and working mothers, and our previous results indicate this will reduce neglect and

foster care. The negative relationship between benefit levels and neglect and foster care do not

appear for the other types of maltreatment. Benefit levels are positively related to physical and

sexual abuse, although these effects are smaller and are not precisely estimated.

       The results indicate that the adoption of waivers has been associated with declines in

maltreatment. These effects are large and significant for physical abuse (8.8% decline) and sexual

abuse (13.0% decline).This is somewhat surprising, given that the waivers appear to be positively

related to movements of children into families with absent fathers and working mothers, which

based on our previous analysis should have worsened these types of abuse. Furthermore, waivers

were not associated with decreases in poverty. Again, it is possible that (unobserved) factors

within states that prompted the early adoption of waivers are correlated with maltreatment

outcomes. Until we have data for more years in which waivers have been in effect, we cannot

place much faith in the negative effect of waivers on maltreatment.



VI. Conclusion
       Using state-level panel data, we find that socioeconomic circumstances, in particular

income, parental work status, and single parenthood, affect the incidence of child maltreatment.
                                                                                                    28

States with higher fractions of children living below 75% of poverty have higher rates of child

maltreatment, as do states with higher shares of children with absent fathers, especially those with

absent fathers and working mothers, or higher shares of non-working fathers.

       Our result that cuts in state’s welfare benefits increase child neglect is particularly

troubling, in light of the recent reforms in the US welfare system. The TANF provisions in many

states call for reductions in benefit levels for recipients who do not work, or who have additional

children. The children of mothers who receive these cuts will be at a heightened risk of neglect.

Whether the time limits of welfare will increase or reduce maltreatment is still unknown: the

children of women who manage to find good jobs and high-quality child care may see

improvements. Yet, our result that, holding income fixed, the children of women who work are at

greater risk of maltreatment than those who do not suggests that moving women off of welfare

rolls into jobs that do not pay more than welfare could harm children.

       Although the well-being of children is the primary concern, attention must also be paid to

the stresses that welfare reform may place on the child welfare system. Increases in reports of

maltreatment will require that more resources be put into Child Protective Services if the quality

level of services is to be maintained. Furthermore, there is concern that CPS will become

overburdened as it takes up some of the functions of the welfare system. CPS has a history of

serving as a resource provider of last resort: Linda Gordon (1988) notes in her analysis of child

welfare agency records from the late 1800s and early 1900s that poor mothers often referred

themselves to child protection as a way of getting help, and it is still the case today that CPS acts

in some areas as the gateway to financial or other forms of assistance that poor families might

need to keep their family together. The fact that children voluntarily given up to foster care can be

placed with relatives, thereby providing the extended family with resources in the form of foster-

care payments, may provide additional incentives for self-reporting. Further strains on the child

welfare system may appear if families who are sanctioned for failing to comply with work or other

program requirements are automatically reported to CPS for neglect on the grounds that they have
                                                                                                    29

not taken the steps necessary to provide an adequate source of income for the children. Douglas

Besharov (1997) argues that states and local welfare agencies may adopt such polices, because

having become aware of parents’ inability to comply with requirements, they will be unable to

ignore it. Although it is too early to determine whether any or all of these effects will materialize,

assessments of the success of the TANF program should include analyses of spillover effects on

the child welfare system.

Note: Dependent variable is ln(number of children in foster care.) Absolute t–statistics in parentheses. Year and state dummies included in all
equations. All other variables listed in Table 1 are included in regressions. The sample for columns (1) to (4) includes years 1983–1996 except
1989. The lower number of observations in columns (2) and (4) is due to missing information on drug arrests. Column (5) is for 1990-1996.

Notes: The dependent variables in columns 1-5 of the top panel equal the log of the proportion of children in the type of family listed, minus the
log of the proportion of children in the “base” category of father works, mother home. All equations include state and year effects, and controls for
ln(population), ln(number of kids), fractions of children in age categories 2-4, 5-13, and 14-17, fraction of children urban, black, and other non-
white race, and fraction of children whose mother has no high-school diploma. The variable ln(welfare) is the logarithm of maximum welfare
benefits for a family of four. The variable AFDC-UP equals 1 if the state has an AFDC-UP program. The variable “any waiver” equals 1 if the
state had any waiver that allowed it to increase work requirements, set time limits to welfare, or change work incentives. The top panel covers the
years 1977-1996, except 1989. The bottom panel covers 1990-1996. The variable AFDC-UP is not included in the bottom panel because, by 1990,
all states had AFDC-UP programs.

Note: The foster care measure is available only for 1982-1988 and 1990-1996. For most states and years,
reports are given as the number of families reported for abuse. This was converted to reports per child by
assuming 1.6 reported children per reported family (1.6 is the average reported children per reported
family in states that provide the information both ways.)
