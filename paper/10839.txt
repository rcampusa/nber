                                            ABSTRACT

Erceg et al. (2000) show that when both wages and prices are sticky, maximization of expected
utility is equivalent to minimizing a loss function with three terms, involving measures of the
variability of wage inflation, price inflation and the output gap respectively. Here we generalize their
analysis, most importantly by not assuming the existence of output and employment subsidies that
eliminate the distortions resulting from market power in goods and labor markets, so that the
equilibrium level of output under flexible wages and prices would not necessarily be optimal. We
show that a quadratic loss function can still be justified that involves the same three terms, albeit
with different relative weights and a different definition of the output gap. Many conclusions of
Erceg et al. are thus found to apply more generally. However, we argue that in the presence of

significant steady-state distortions, simple rules of the kind that they examine are likely to

approximate optimal policy less closely than is suggested by their numerical results.

    In a seminal paper, Chris Erceg, Dale Henderson, and Andy Levin (2000) analyzed
the consequences for optimal monetary policy of the stickiness of both wages and
prices. A key contribution of their paper was the demonstration that the expected
utility of the representative household in their model could be approximated by an
objective with three terms, involving measures of the variability of wage inflation,
price inflation and the output gap respectively. While wage-inflation stabilization
has not commonly been included among the assumed objectives of monetary policy
in studies that lack welfare-theoretic foundations, Erceg et al. showed that in the
context of their model (with Calvo-style staggering of both wage- and price-setting
decisions), such an objective is appropriate in the case that wages as well as prices
are sticky. This is because variability of the rate of growth of nominal wages implies
misalignment of wages that are adjusted at different times, and hence inefficient
utilization of different types of labor. They showed furthermore that the existence of
this additional stabilization objective implies that a policy aimed solely at inflation
stabilization (a strict inflation target) is not generally optimal, and may be quite
undesirable. Instead, their numerical analysis suggests that one can do quite well by
targeting an appropriately chosen weighted average of wage and price inflation, with
a greater relative weight on wage inflation the greater the relative stickiness of wages.
    Here we reexamine the issues raised by Erceg et al. in a slightly more general
setting. Following Rotemberg and Woodford (1997), Erceg et al. assume the exis-
tence of an output subsidy in order to eliminate the distortion resulting from the
market power of the suppliers of differentiated goods, and a similar employment sub-
sidy to eliminate the distortion resulting from the market power of the suppliers of
differentiated forms of labor.1 As a result, the equilibrium allocation of resources
would be optimal in their model, in the case that both wages and prices were fully
flexible. This is an important simplification, for it implies, even in the model with
sticky wages and prices, that the steady state level of output under a policy that
maintains stable prices is efficient, and hence that (to first order) an increase in the
average level of output would neither raise nor lower welfare. Hence in a quadratic
approximation to expected utility, obtained as a Taylor series expansion around the
allocation associated with this steady state, there is no linear term in the expected
level of output. This allows Erceg et al. to obtain a purely quadratic loss function,
   1
    In fact, as we show below, there is no need for two distinct subsidies to achieve the result that
they seek. The presence of a linear term in the quadratic approximation to utility depends only on
the overall index Φ of the degree of inefficiency of steady-state output, introduced below.



                                                1
just as Rotemberg and Woodford (1997) do in the case that only prices are sticky.
Hence they obtain a welfare measure that can be evaluated, to second order in the
amplitude of the exogenous disturbances, using only an approximate solution for the
equilibrium resulting from a given policy rule that is accurate to first order, i.e., a
log-linear approximation to the model structural relations.
    While this feature of their results makes the analysis much more tractable in the
case that they consider, the assumption of output and employment subsidies (rather
than positive tax rates on sales, payrolls, and wage income) is clearly unrealistic. Fur-
thermore, there is reason to fear that such an analysis may miss an important aspect
of the welfare consequences of stabilization policy. As Henderson and Kim (2003),
among others, have stressed, in exact models of optimal wage- and price-setting one
typically finds that stabilization policy affects the average levels of equilibrium output
and employment, and not simply their variability. In the welfare analysis of Erceg
et al., such effects may be neglected, because a change in the average level of output
that is only of second order in the amplitude of the disturbances has no second-order
effect on welfare; but this result depends on the fact that (owing to the assumed
subsidies) the steady-state level of output is optimal. Under more realistic assump-
tions, the steady-state level of output would be judged to be inefficiently low, owing
to tax distortions as well as market power in both the goods and labor markets; but
this would mean that a second-order effect of stabilization policy on average output
would make a second-order contribution to welfare, that might be as important (even
in the case of arbitrarily small disturbances) as the second-order welfare effects of
stabilization policy considered by Erceg et al.
    Here we show how the analysis of Erceg et al. can be extended to take account of
such effects, and hence to allow a correct welfare analysis (to second-order accuracy)
even in the presence of substantial steady-state distortions. One approach to dealing
with such effects that has recently become popular involves solving for equilibrium
under alternative policy rules to second-order accuracy, using a second-order Taylor
series expansion of the model structural relations. Here we show instead that, even
in the case of a distorted steady state, it is possible to obtain a purely quadratic loss
function, similar to the one obtained by Erceg et al., which can then be evaluated to
second-order accuracy using only log-linear approximations to both the policy rule
and the model structural relations. This requires that we substitute out the linear
terms in the Taylor series expansion for expected utility in terms of purely quadratic


                                          2
terms, using the method employed by Benigno and Woodford (2004) in the case of
an economy with staggered price-setting but flexible wages. (Essentially, the effects
of stabilization policy on the average level of output are used to replace a welfare
measure that involves the average level of output by one that is purely quadratic.)
In this way, we are able to show that results similar to those of Erceg et al. continue
to obtain in the case of a distorted steady state, though the size of the steady-state
distortions matters for one’s quantitative conclusions regarding the nature of optimal
policy.
    We generalize the analysis of Erceg et al. other respects as well. Erceg et al.
consider only policies with the property that in the absence of exogenous disturbances,
the equilibrium will correspond to the efficient steady state. (This means policies
under which both wages and prices will be constant, in the absence of exogenous
disturbances.) This allows them to obtain an approximate welfare measure that
involves only the variances of macroeconomic variables. We drop this assumption,
and so obtain an approximate welfare measure that also allows one to compare policies
under which the average inflation rate is not exactly zero. It turns out that in the kind
of model considered here, optimal policy does involve a zero average inflation rate; but
this result can be derived from our evaluation of alternative rules using the quadratic
loss function, rather than having to be assumed from the start.2 Finally, Erceg
et al. restrict attention to time-invariant policy rules, and evaluate unconditional
expected utility in the stationary equilibrium associated with such a rule. We show
instead how it is possible to evaluate discounted expected utility conditional upon
some initial state, though we propose a criterion for optimality (“optimality from a
timeless perspective”) under which optimal policy can be shown (rather than being
assumed) to be time-invariant.


   2
     The conclusion is not an obvious one, in the case that the steady state with zero inflation is no
longer assumed to involve an efficient level of output, since the model is one in which the average
inflation rate affects the average level of output.

1     Monetary Stabilization Policy: Welfare-Theoretic
      Foundations
Here we describe our assumptions about the economic environment and pose the
optimization problem that a monetary stabilization policy is intended to solve. The
approximation method that we use to characterize the solution to this problem is then
presented in the following section. Further details of the derivation of the structural
equations of our model of nominal price and wage rigidities can be found in Erceg et
al. (2000) and Woodford (2003, chapter 3).


1.1    Objective and Constraints
In our model, there is a continuum of measure one of households. Household of type
j seeks to maximize

                    Ut0 ≡ Et0    β t−t0 ũ(Ctj ; ξ t ) − v(ht (j); ξ t ) ,    (1.1)
                               t=t0

where Ct is a Dixit-Stiglitz aggregate of consumption of each of a continuum of
differentiated goods,
                                 ·Z 1       θ p −1
                                                   ¸ θpθ−1

with an elasticity of substitution equal to θp > 1, and ht (j) is the quantity supplied
of labor which is specific to household of type j.
    There is a continuum of measure one of differentiated goods and each household
consumes all the goods. The objective of policy is to maximize the sum of the utilities
of the households at time t0 . We will assume risk-sharing among the households in a
way that they will face the same budget constraint and make the same consumption
choices even if they have different wages. It follows that the objective of policy is to
maximize Ut0 defined as
                             X∞        ·                 Z 1                  ¸

To simplify the algebraic form of our results we shall restrict attention to the case of
isoelastic functional forms,

of the continuum of individual types of labor supplied by the households defined by

units for a random interval of time, as in the model of staggered pricing introduced
by Calvo (1983). We let 0 ≤ αw < 1 be the fraction of wages that remain unchanged

wt (j) to maximize

where ΛT is the representative household’s marginal utility of nominal income in
period T and the dependence of labor demand hT (j) upon the wage is given by (1.6),

     The government is assumed to need to obtain an exogenously given quantity of the Dixit-Stiglitz
aggregate each period, and to obtain this in a cost-minimizing fashion. Hence the government
allocates its purchases across the suppliers of differentiated goods in the same proportion as do
households, and the index of aggregate demand Yt is the same function of the individual quantities
{yt (i)} as Ct is of the individual quantities consumed {ct (i)}, defined in (1.2).

and αTw−t is the probability that a wage chosen in period t will not have been revised
by period T .
   Each of the wage suppliers that revise their wages in period t choose the same
new wage wt∗ , that maximizes (1.14). Note that supplier j’s objective function is
a concave function of the quantity of working hours supplied ht (j), since revenues
                        θ w −1
are proportional to ht θw (j) and hence concave in ht (j), while costs are convex in
ht (j). Moreover, since ht (j) is proportional to wt (j)−θw , the objective function is also
concave in wt (j)−θw . The first-order condition for the optimal choice of the wage
wt (j) is the same as the one with respect to wt (j)−θw ; hence the first-order condition
with respect to wt (i),

The producers for each differentiated good fix the prices of their goods in monetary
units for a random interval of time. We let 0 ≤ αp < 1 be the fraction of prices that
remain unchanged in any period. A supplier that changes its price in period t chooses
its new price pt (i) to maximize
                          (∞                                              )

price index is equal to P and aggregate demand is equal to Y . Here τ t is the propor-
tional tax on sales revenues in period t; we treat {τ t } as an exogenous disturbance

process, taken as given by the monetary policymaker. We assume that τ t fluctuates
over a small interval around a non-zero steady-state level τ̄ ; this is a further reason
for inefficiency of the steady-state level of output, in addition to the market power of
the suppliers of differentiated goods.4 The disturbances τ t and At are also included
as elements of the vector of exogenous disturbances ξ t .
      Each of the suppliers that revise their prices in period t choose the same new price
p∗t , that maximizes (1.21). Note that supplier i’s profits are a concave function of the

in yt (i), while costs are convex in yt (i). Moreover, since yt (i) is proportional to
pt (i)−θp , the profit function is also concave in pt (i)−θp . The first-order condition for
the optimal choice of the price pt (i) is the same as the one with respect to pt (i)−θp ;
hence the first-order condition with respect to pt (i),

    Other types of distorting taxes would have similar consequences, since it is the overall size of
the steady-state inefficiency wedge that is of greatest importance for our analysis, as we show below.
To economize on notation, we assume that the only distorting tax is of this particular kind.

    We assume the existence of a lump-sum source of government revenue (in addi-
tion to the proportional tax τ on sales revenues), and assume that the fiscal authority
ensures intertemporal government solvency regardless of what monetary policy may
be chosen by the monetary authority. This allows us to abstract from the fiscal con-
sequences of alternative monetary policies in our consideration of optimal monetary

stabilization policy, as in Erceg et al. (2000) and much of the literature on monetary
policy rules.
    Finally, we follow Erceg et al. in abstracting from any monetary frictions that
would account for a demand for central-bank liabilities that earn a substandard rate
of return; we nonetheless assume that the central bank can control the riskless short-
term nominal interest rate it , as discussed in Woodford (2003, chapter 2). We also
assume that the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates never binds under the
optimal policies considered below,5 so that we need not introduce any additional
constraint on the possible paths of output and prices associated with a need for
the chosen evolution of prices to be consistent with a non-negative nominal interest
rate. We also note that the ability of the central bank to control it in each period
gives it one degree of freedom each period (in each possible state of the world) with
which to determine equilibrium outcomes. Considering (1.20), (1.28) and (1.29) and
because of the existence of the aggregate-supply relations (1.19), (1.27) as necessary
constraints on the joint evolution of price, wage inflation rates and output, there is
exactly one degree of freedom to be determined each period, in order to determine
particular stochastic processes {Πw,t , Πp,t , Yt } from among the set of possible rational-
expectations equilibria. Hence we shall suppose that the monetary authority can
choose from among the possible processes {Πw,t , Πp,t , Yt } that constitute rational-
expectations equilibria, and consider which equilibrium it is optimal to bring about;
the detail that policy is implemented through the control of a short-term nominal
interest rate will not actually matter to our calculations.


1.2     Optimal Policy from a “Timeless Perspective”
Under the standard (Ramsey) approach to the characterization of an optimal pol-
icy commitment, one chooses among state-contingent paths {Πp,t , Πw,t , Yt , wR,t , ∆p,t ,
∆w,t , Fp,t , Kp,t , Fw,t , Kw,t } from some initial date t0 onward that satisfy (1.16), (1.17),
(1.19), (1.20), (1.23), (1.24), (1.27), (1.28) and (1.29) for each t ≥ t0 , given initial price
and wage dispersions ∆p,t0 −1 , ∆w,t0 −1 and initial real wage wR,t0 −1 , so as to maximize
(1.13). Such a t0 −optimal plan requires commitment, insofar as the correspond-
ing t−optimal plan for some later date t, given the initial conditions ∆p,t−1 , ∆w,t−1
   5
    This can be shown to be true in the case of small enough disturbances, given that the nominal
interest rate is equal to r̄ = β −1 − 1 > 0 under the optimal policy in the absence of disturbances.



                                               11
and wR,t−1 obtaining at that date, will not involve a continuation of the t0 −optimal
plan. This failure of time consistency occurs because the constraints on what can
be achieved at date t0 , consistent with the existence of a rational-expectations equi-
librium, depend on the expected paths of the above set of variables at later dates;
but in the absence of a prior commitment, a planner would have no motive at those
later dates to choose a policy consistent with the anticipations that it was desirable
to create at date t0 .
    However, the degree of advance commitment that is necessary to bring about an
optimal equilibrium is of only a limited sort. Paralleling the analysis of Benigno and
Woodford (2004), it can be shown that the Ramsey problem can be decomposed in
two stages of which the second is fully recursive and of the same form of the Ramsey
problem itself except for an additional constraint on a particular set of variables. In
our case this set Xt is given by Xt ≡ (Fp,t , Kp,t , Fw,t , Kw,t ).
    Our aim here is to characterize policy that solves this constrained optimization
problem in which one chooses among state-contingent paths {xt , Xt }, with xt ≡ {Πp,t ,
Πw,t , Yt , wR,t , ∆p,t , ∆w,t } from some initial date t0 onward that satisfy (1.16), (1.17),
(1.19), (1.20), (1.23), (1.24), (1.27), (1.28) and (1.29) for each t ≥ t0 , given initial
price and wage dispersions ∆p,t0 −1 , ∆w,t0 −1 , real wage wR,t0 −1 and an initial condition
on the set of variables Xt0 , so as to maximize (1.13). Because of the recursive form of
this problem, it is possible for a commitment to a time-invariant policy rule from date
t onward to implement an equilibrium that solves the problem, for some specification
of the initial commitments Xt . A time-invariant policy rule with this property is said
by Woodford (2003, chapter 7) to be “optimal from a timeless perspective.”6 Such
a rule is one that a policymaker that solves a traditional Ramsey problem would be
willing to commit to eventually follow, though the solution to the Ramsey problem
involves different behavior initially, as there is no need to internalize the effects of
prior anticipation of the policy adopted for period t0 . One might also argue that it
is desirable to commit to follow such a rule immediately, even though such a policy
would not solve the (unconstrained) Ramsey problem, as a way of demonstrating
one’s willingness to accept constraints that one wishes the public to believe that one
will accept in the future.

2       A Linear-Quadratic Approximate Problem
In fact, we shall here characterize the solution to this problem (and similarly, derive
optimal time-invariant policy rules) only for initial conditions near certain steady-
state values, allowing us to use local approximations in characterizing optimal policy.
We establish that these steady-state values have the property that if one starts from
initial conditions close enough to the steady state, and exogenous disturbances there-
after are small enough, the optimal policy subject to the initial commitments remains
forever near the steady state. Hence our local characterization describes the long run
character of Ramsey policy, in the event that disturbances are small enough.7 Of
greater interest here, it describes policy that is optimal from a timeless perspective
in the event of small disturbances.
     We first must show the existence of a steady state, i.e., of an optimal policy (under
appropriate initial conditions) that involves constant values of all variables. To this
end we consider the purely deterministic case, in which the exogenous disturbances
C̄t ,Gt ,H̄t ,At , τ t each take constant values C̄, H̄, Ā, τ̄ > 0, Ḡ ≥ 0 for all t ≥ t0 . We
wish to find initial degree of price and wage dispersions ∆p,t0 −1 , ∆w,t0 −1 , an initial
real wage Wt0 −1 /Pt0 −1 , and initial commitments Xt0 = X̄ such that the solution to
the optimal problem involves a constant policy xt = x̄, Xt+1 = X̄ each period, in
which ∆   ¯ p, ∆¯ w and ω̄ R are equal to the initial values for these variables. We show
in the appendix that the first-order conditions for this problem admit a steady-state
solution of this form, and we verify below that (when our parameters satisfy certain
bounds) the second-order conditions for a local optimum are also satisfied.
     We show that Π̄p = Π̄w = 1(zero price and wage inflation), and correspondingly
that ∆  ¯p = ∆    ¯ w = 1(zero price and wage dispersion). We may furthermore assume
without loss of generality that the constant values of C̄ and H̄ are chosen so that in
the optimal steady state, Ct = C̄ and Ht = H̄ each period.8
     We next wish to characterize the optimal responses to small perturbations of
    7
     See Benigno and Woodford (2004) for further discussion. In the simpler model treated there, it is
shown explicitly that Ramsey policy converges asymptotically to the steady state of the constrained
problem, so that the solution to the LQ approximate problem approximates the response to small
shocks under the Ramsey policy, at dates long enough after t0 . A similar result could be established
here using similar reasoning.
   8
     Note that we may assign arbitrary positive values to C̄, H̄ without changing the nature of the
implied preferences, as long as the value of λ is appropriately adjusted.

the initial conditions and small fluctuations in the disturbance processes around the
above values. To do this, we compute a linear-quadratic approximate problem, the
solution to which represents a linear approximation to the solution to the policy
problem defined above. An important advantage of this approach is that it allows
direct comparison of our results with those obtained in other analyses of optimal
monetary stabilization policy. Other advantages are that it makes it straightforward
to verify whether second-order conditions hold that imply that a solution to our first-
order conditions will represent at least a local optimum, and that it provides us with
a welfare measure with which to rank alternative sub-optimal policies, in addition to
allowing computation of the optimal policy.


2.1      A Quadratic Approximate Welfare Measure
We begin by computing a Taylor-series approximation to our welfare measure (1.13),
expanding around the steady-state allocation defined above, in which yt (i) = Ȳ and
ht (j) = H̄ for each good and variety of labor at all times and ξ t = 0 at all times.9 As
a second-order (logarithmic) approximation to this measure, we obtain10

where Ŷt ≡ log(Yt /Ȳ ), ∆                    ˆ w,t ≡ log ∆w,t measure deviations of
aggregate output, price and wage dispersion measured from their steady-state levels,
the term “t.i.p.” collects terms that are independent of policy (constants and func-
tions of exogenous disturbances) and hence irrelevant for ranking alternative policies,
and ||ξ|| is a bound on the amplitude of our perturbations of the steady state.11 Here

      Here the elements of ξ t are assumed to be c̄t ≡ log(C̄t /C̄), h̄t ≡ log(H̄t /H̄), at ≡ log(At /Ā),
Ĝt ≡ (Gt − Ḡ)/Ȳ , and τ̂ t ≡ (τ t − τ̄ )/τ̄ , so that a value of zero for this vector corresponds to the
steady-state values of all disturbances. The perturbation Ĝt is not defined to be logarithmic so that
we do not have to assume positive steady-state value for this variable.
   10
      See the appendix for details. Our calculations here follow closely those of Woodford (2003,
chapter 6) and Benigno and Woodford (2004).

      Specifically, we use the notation O(||ξ||k ) as shorthand for O(||ξ, ∆ˆ 1/2 , ∆ ˆ 1/2 , X̂t ||k ), where
                                                                              p,t0 −1   w,t0 −1  0

write our stabilization objective purely in terms of the evolution of the aggregate
variables {Ŷt , π w,t , π p,t } and the exogenous disturbances.
    We note that when Φ > 0, there is a non-zero linear term in (2.33), which means
that we cannot expect to evaluate this expression to second order using only an
approximate solution for the path of aggregate output that is accurate only to first
order. Thus we cannot determine optimal policy, even up to first order, using this
approximate objective together with approximations to the structural equations that
are accurate only to first order. Erceg et al. (2000) avoid this problem by assuming
because (1.20), (1.28) imply that deviations of the inflation rates from zero of order ² only result
in deviations in the dispersion measures ∆p,t , ∆w,t from one of order ²2 . We are thus entitled to
treat the fluctuations in ∆p,t , ∆w,t as being only of second order in our bound on the amplitude of
disturbances, since if this is true at some initial date it will remain true thereafter.

we wish to relax this assumption. We show here that an alternative way of dealing
with this problem is to use a second-order approximation to the aggregate-supply
relations to eliminate the linear terms in the quadratic welfare measure. We show in

    Here Ŷtn and ω̂ nt represent log-linear approximations to the “natural rate of output
and real wage,” i.e., the flexible-price equilibrium levels of output and real wages
(Woodford, 2003, chap. 3). In terms of this notation, the log-linear aggregate supply
relations (2.35) can be written as

                         π p,t = κp [Ŷt − Ŷtn ] + ξ p [ω̂ R,t − ω̂ nt ] + βEt π p,t+1 ,              (2.43)

                                      ω̂ R,t = ω̂ R,t−1 + π w,t − π p,t ,                              (2.45)

where Vt0 is defined in the appendix.

                                                     17
    Once again, we are interested in characterizing optimal policy from a timeless
perspective. We observe from the form of the structural relations (2.34) and the
definition of Vj,t that the aspects of the expected future evolution of the endogenous
variables that affect the feasible set of values for inflation rates, real wage and out-
put in any period t can be summarized (in our second-order approximation to the
structural relations) by the expected values of Vj,t+1 , Zj,t+1 for j = p, w. Hence the
only commitments regarding future outcomes that can be of value in improving stabi-
lization outcomes in period t can be summarized by commitments at t regarding the
state-contingent values of those two variables in the following period. It follows that
we are interested in characterizing optimal policy from any date t0 onward subject to
the constraint that given values for Vj,t0 , Zj,t0 for j = p, w be satisfied,13 in addition
to the constraints represented by the structural equations.
    But given predetermined values for Vj,t0 the value of the transitory component Tt0
is predetermined. Hence, over the set of admissible policies, higher values of (2.37)
correspond to lower values of
                            ∞
                            X               nq                          qp 2     qw     o
                                                 y
                      Et0          β t−t0            (Ŷt − Ŷt∗ )2 +     π p,t + π 2w,t .     (2.46)
                            t=t0
                                             2                          2         2

It follows that we may rank admissible policies in terms of the implied value of
the discounted quadratic loss function (2.46). Because this loss function is purely
quadratic (i.e., lacking linear terms), it is possible to evaluate it to second order
using only a first-order approximation to the equilibrium evolution of inflation and
output under a given policy. Hence the log-linear approximate structural relations
(2.43), (2.44) and (2.45) are sufficiently accurate for our purposes.
    Similarly, it suffices that we use log-linear approximations to the variables Vj,t0
in describing the initial commitments, which are given by V̂j,t0 = π j,t0 for j = p, w.
Then an optimal policy from a timeless perspective is a policy from date t0 onward
that minimizes the quadratic loss function (2.46) subject to the constraints implied
by the linear structural relation (2.43), (2.44) and (2.45) holding in each period t ≥ t0
given the initial condition ω̂ R,t0 −1 and subject also to the constraints that a certain
predetermined values for V̂p,t0 and V̂w,t0 be achieved.14 This last constraint may
  13
     Note that a specification of initial values for these four variables corresponds, in our quadratic
approximation to the structural equations, to a specification of initial values for the four variables
Fp,t0 , Kp,t0 , Fw,t0 , Kw,t0 in section 1.

equivalently be expressed as a constraint on the initial inflation rates,

                                 π p,t0 = π̄ p,t0        π w,t0 = π̄ w,t0 .                    (2.47)


2.2     Comparison with Erceg, Henderson and Levin
Thus we obtain a quadratic stabilization objective (2.46) similar to the one derived
in Erceg et al. (2000) under the assumption that Φ = 0, but now allowing for an
arbitrary degree of steady-state distortions. As in the analysis of Erceg et al., the loss
function is a sum of three terms, indicating the distortions resulting from variations in
the rate of price inflation, the rate of wage inflation, and the output gap, respectively.
    There are, however, some noteworthy differences between (2.46) and the loss func-
tion of Erceg et al.. One is that the loss function of Erceg et al. is expressed as a
sum of variances of the three variables (price inflation, wage inflation, and the output
gap), whereas our loss function is linear in the expected values of these variables
squared. Our loss function implies (assuming that qy , qp , qw > 0, as discussed below)
that an increase in the variance of any of the variables, holding constant its mean
level, will lower welfare; and indeed our loss function is linear in the variances, holding
constant the expected values of the variables. But we find that there are also losses
associated with an average rate of price or wage inflation different from zero (in either
direction), and similarly with an average output gap different from zero; these effects
are neglected by Erceg et al. by assumption.15
    The loss function (2.46) also differs from the one derived by Erceg et al. in that
it involves expected losses in each of an infinite sequence of periods, with the losses
expected in future periods discounted at the rate β t . The form of loss function derived
by Erceg et al. is instead obtained, following Rotemberg and Woodford (1997), by
evaluating the unconditional expectation of the utility of the representative household
in the stationary equilibrium implied by one stationary policy rule or another; since
  14
     The constraint associated with a predetermined value for Zt0 can be neglected, in a first-order
characterization of optimal policy, because the variable Zt does not appear in the first-order approx-
imation to the aggregate-supply relation.
  15
     Erceg et al. restrict their attention to policies with the property that in the absence of shocks,
the equilibrium obtained will be the optimal steady state. This restriction is innocuous as far as
the characterization of optimal stabilization policy is concerned (since the optimal policy belongs
to the class considered); but the more general form of loss function provides additional insight into
the nature of optimal policy.


                                                    19
the unconditional expectation of the period utility in such an equilibrium is the same
each period, one need only consider the unconditional expectation of the utility flow in
a single period. The alternative (discounted) welfare measure derived here is instead
appropriate if one wishes to characterize optimal policy in the sense described above
(what we have called “optimal policy from a timeless perspective”). One advantage
of defining the policy problem as we have here is that it allows us to use standard
methods for the solution of (discounted) linear-quadratic stochastic control problems
to characterize optimal policy.16
    Apart from these differences in what our loss function measures (and hence in the
form in which we report our results), there are also differences in our conclusions that
result from the fact that we treat the more general case in which Φ (our measure of
the overall severity of steady-state distortions) need not equal zero. First of all, a
non-zero value of Φ affects the quantitative magnitudes of the weights qy , qp , qw on the
different stabilization objectives. In the case that Ḡ = 0 (there are no steady-state
government purchases), each of these weights is proportional to

                                     (ω + σ −1 ) + Φ(1 − σ −1 ).

It then follows that increasing Φ (for given values of the other model parameters) does
not change the relative weights on alternative stabilization objectives, and hence the
relative ranking of alternative equilibria. Even in this case, however, the assumed
value of Φ will affect one’s conclusion about how much the improvement of stabi-
lization policy matters for welfare; in the case that we judge to be most realistic, in
which σ > 1,17 a higher value of Φ implies greater welfare gains from stabilization.
For example, if we calibrate the parameters ω and σ in accordance with the estimates
of Rotemberg and Woodford (1997),18 then an inefficiency wedge of a more realistic
magnitude, Φ = 1/3,19 would increase the expected losses from any given degree
of aggregate volatility by 45 percent, relative to what would be obtained under the
assumption that Φ = 0.
  16
     For further discussion, see Woodford (2003, chap. 7).
  17
     Note that in this model, σ is the intertemporal elasticity of substitution for all private expendi-
ture, and not simply for non-durable consumer expenditure. See Woodford (2003, chaps. 4, 5) for
further discussion.
  18
     These values are ω = .473 and σ −1 = .157.
  19
     This would result, for example, if we assume an elasticity of demand θ = 10, a wage markup of
8 percent, and an average tax rate τ̄ of 20 percent.


                                                20
     In a more realistic parameterization, of course, one should allow for the existence
of a positive average level of government purchases, Ḡ, so that sC < 1. In this
case, increasing Φ does not increase qy by as great a factor as the increase in the
weights qp and qw ; hence the relative weight on the output-stabilization objective
should be somewhat lower in an economy with a distorted steady state than would
be appropriate if Φ = 0. It is not clear, however, how important this qualification
is likely to be in practice. Under the calibration just considered, for example, if we
assume that Ḡ is equal to 20 percent of steady-state output, then increasing Φ from
0 to 1/3 will increase qp and qw by nearly 45 percent, as just discussed, while it will
increase qy by a factor of only 41 percent. However, the value obtained for the relative
weight qy /(qp + qw ) under the assumption that Φ = 0 is exaggerated only by slightly
more than 2 percent.
     Under more extreme assumptions about the share of government purchases in total
demand, the mis-estimation of the appropriate relative weight on output stabilization
could be much greater. In fact, the correct value of qy indicated by (2.38) may actually
be negative, whereas Erceg et al. conclude that the relative weight on the output
stabilization objective is positive (as we also find, if Φ = 0). This failure of convexity
of our welfare-theoretic loss function does not necessarily imply that the second-order
conditions for a local welfare maximum fail to hold, or that randomization of policy
would be welfare-improving, as discussed in Benigno and Woodford (2004). But such
a case would mean that the conclusions of Erceg et al. about the degree to which
one should be willing to accept greater variability of price and wage inflation for the
sake of output-gap stabilization would be quite inaccurate. This will occur, however,
only under fairly extreme assumptions. For example, a sufficient condition for qy to
be positive, regardless of the magnitude of the steady-state distortions, is that
                                      (1 + ω)(ω + σ −1 )
                            sG <                             .                     (2.48)
                                   (1 + ω)(ω + σ −1 ) + σ −1
(Here sG ≡ Ḡ/Ȳ is the steady-state share of government purchases in total demand.)
For moderate values of Φ, the value of sG can be even larger; but even the bound (2.48)
is likely to hold. For example, in the case of the Rotemberg-Woodford parameter
values, this bound holds as long as government purchases are no more than 85 percent
of GDP.
    Allowing for Φ > 0 also changes the definition of the target output level Ŷt∗ in the
welfare-theoretic loss function (2.46). Contrary to what Erceg et al. obtain, Ŷt∗ no

                                          21
longer corresponds in general to the equilibrium level of output under flexible wages
and prices, Ŷtn , as shown by (2.39). We observe that when Φ = 0, ω 1 = 1 and ω 2 = 0,
so that (2.39) implies that Ŷt∗ = Ŷtn , in the absence of fluctuations in the tax rate
(also not considered by Erceg et al.). If, instead, Φ > 0, and in addition sG is positive
(but less than the upper bound (2.48)), then ω 1 > 1. This means that fluctuations
in tastes or technology move Ŷt∗ by more than their effect on Ŷtn .20 This has the
consequence that attempting to stabilize output around trend rather than around
the time-varying target level would be an even greater mistake than is indicated by
an analysis that assumes that Φ = 0.
    Furthermore, when Φ > 0, and sG satisfies (2.48),21 ω 2 > 0 in (2.39). Indeed, one
can show that
                                          σ −1
                                  ω2 >           (ω 1 − 1),
                                        ω + σ −1
from which it follows (also using (2.42)) that an increase in government purchases
increases Ŷt∗ by less than the increase in Ŷtn . This means that it is not desirable
to allow output to increase quite as much in response to an increase in government
purchases as would occur under flexible wages and prices.22
    The fact that the target level of output will move in a somewhat different way than
the flexible-wage-and-price equilibrium level of output (or natural rate of output) has
consequences for the degree to which stabilization of some combination of wages and
prices, without attention to the consequences of policy for aggregate real activity, is
likely to provide a good approximation to optimal policy. As a result, some of the
more suggestive results of Erceg et al. may not be quite so accurate a guide to policy
in the case of significant steady-state distortions.
    We have shown that the policy objective (2.46) can be expressed solely as a
function of the evolution of the inflation rates and the welfare-relevant output gap

                                            xt ≡ Ŷt − Ŷt∗ .

It is useful to write the linear constraints implied by our model’s structural equations
in terms of the welfare-relevant output gap as well. The aggregate-supply relations
  20
      Under the parameter values considered above, for example, one would obtain ω 1 = 1.02.
  21
      In fact, it suffices for this conclusion (and for those of the previous paragraph) that sG be small
enough for qy to be positive.
   22
      For example, under the parameter values considered above, an increase in government purchases
equal to one percent of steady-state output would increase Ŷtn by 0.25 percent, while it would increase
Ŷt∗ by only 0.14 percent.

                                                 22
(2.43) and (2.44) can alternatively be expressed as

                       π p,t = κp xt + ξ p [ω̂ R,t − ω̂ nt ] + βEt π p,t+1 + up,t ,          (2.49)

                      π w,t = κw xt − ξ w [ω̂ R,t − ω̂ nt ] + βEt π w,t+1 + uw,t             (2.50)
where uj,t , for j = p, w are composite “cost-push” terms. In terms of our previous
notation for the exogenous disturbances in the model, these are given by

                         uj,t ≡ κj (Ŷt∗ − Ŷtn )
                               = κj (ω 1 − 1)Ŷtn − κj ω 2 Ĝt + κj ω 3 τ̂ t .

    The presence of these “cost-push” terms23 (not present in the aggregate-supply
relations of Erceg et al.) implies a tension between the goals of wage and price
stabilization, on the one hand, and output-gap stabilization (in the welfare-relevant
sense) on the other. In the case that Φ = 0, then ω 1 = 1, ω 2 = 0, and up,t = uw,t = 0,
except if there are fluctuations in the tax rate. If, instead, Φ > 0, then there are
other reasons for the cost-push terms to be non-zero. As we have just discussed, in
the case of greatest interest, fluctuations in preferences or technology that raise the
natural rate of output will result in positive cost-push terms in both (2.49) and (??),
while increases in government purchases will result in negative cost-push terms in
both equations.
    This makes it even more difficult for all three stabilization goals to be simul-
taneously achieved than is indicated by the analysis of Erceg et al. For example,
Erceg et al. conclude that if either wages or prices are completely flexible (so that
the welfare-theoretic weight on one of the stabilization objectives is zero), then it
should be possible to fully achieve both of the remaining stabilization objectives by
completely stabilizing wage inflation (if only wages are sticky) or price inflation (if
only prices are sticky). In the presence of cost-push terms, this ceases to be the case.
  23
    Here we adopt the terminology of Clarida et al. (1999) for the case of a model with sticky
prices only. A more desirable terminology might be “inefficient supply shocks,” as we are interested
in disturbances to the aggregate-supply relations that are not due to changes in the efficient level
of output. There are variety of reasons for non-zero terms of this kind to appear, which need
not correspond to the specific sorts of disturbances traditionally associated with the “cost-push”
terminology. And it is equally important to recognize that not all disturbances that affect the cost
of supplying output represent “cost-push” shocks in the sense in which we use the term here, since
such disturbances usually imply a change in the efficient level of output.


                                                 23
Even when prices are fully flexible, the presence of the cost-push terms implies that
complete stabilization of wage inflation will not imply complete stabilization of the
welfare-relevant output gap, or vice versa.24
    Erceg et al. find, on the basis of numerical analysis of a calibrated model, that
a simple policy rule that stabilizes an index of wages and prices provides a close
approximation to optimal policy, if the relative weight on wages as opposed to prices
in this index is appropriately chosen.25 However, this result most likely depends
on their having made assumptions under which there are no cost-push terms. For
example, it is easy to see why the result is true, if there are no cost-push terms, in
the case just discussed in which only wages are sticky. (In that case, the appropriate
index to target involves nominal wages only.) But when cost-push terms are present,
as is almost inevitably the case if the steady state is distorted, optimal policy no
longer corresponds to stabilization of the nominal wage; instead, the nominal wage
should be a function of the history of the cost-push terms.26 On the other hand, the
optimal evolution of the real wage (and hence, of goods prices) should depend on the
evolution of the natural real wage ω nt as well. In general, real disturbances will affect
the natural real wage in a different way than they affect the cost-push terms, and so
one cannot expect there to be any linear combination of wages and prices that will
be constant in an optimal equilibrium. Since in this case, the optimal simple rule is
fully optimal when there are no cost-push terms, but can be far from optimal when
Φ is far from zero, one suspects that the same is true when both wages and prices
are sticky.27
    Erceg et al. also find that another class of simple policy rules, in which a weighted
average of price inflation and the output gap is stabilized, also provides a good ap-
proximation to optimal policy when the weights are appropriately chosen. But here
again, it is likely that the result depends on the absence of cost-push terms (in the case
of substantial stickiness of wages). Let us once more consider the simple case of per-
fectly flexible prices but sticky wages. In this case, optimal policy requires complete
  24
     The corresponding result in the case of an economy in which only prices are sticky is established
by Benigno and Woodford (2004).
  25
     See also Woodford (2003, chap. 6) for results in the same vein.
  26
     A method that can be used to characterize the way in which the wage should depend on the
history of disturbances is discussed in the next section.
  27
     The same conclusion is supported by a consideration of the case of “equally sticky” wages and
prices in section 3.1 below.


                                               24
stabilization of the nominal wage when there are no cost-push shocks. Flexibility of
prices means that the pricing relation (2.49) reduces to

                                    ω̂ R,t − ω̂ nt + ω p xt = 0,

if there is no cost-push term. At the same time, (2.50) implies that in the optimal
equilibrium, since wage inflation is always zero,

                                  κw xt − ξ w [ω̂ R,t − ω̂ nt ] = 0,

 if there is no cost-push term. Together, these two relations imply that xt = 0 in the
optimal equilibrium, which is a limiting case of the class of simple rules.
     On the other hand, if Φ > 0, cost-push terms are present in both (2.49) and (2.50).
It is no longer optimal to fully stabilize wage inflation, exactly because this will no
longer imply complete stability of the output gap; instead, the optimal evolution
of both the nominal wage and the output gap will be a function of the history of
cost-push disturbances. At the same time, the optimal evolution of the real wage
(and hence, of goods prices), will depend on the evolution of the natural real wage as
well. Once again, there will in general be no linear combination of price inflation and
the output gap for which these different sorts of dependence on the history of real
disturbances will happen to cancel. And since the family of simple rules ceases to
include an optimal rule even in this special case, it is likely that it ceases to include
any rule that is so close to being optimal as Erceg et al. report, in the case that both
wages and prices are sticky.


3      Optimal Stabilization Policy
We now use our linear-quadratic approximate policy problem to characterize optimal
policy in the event of small enough disturbances. We begin by noting that the first-
order conditions associated with an LQ problem of this kind characterize an optimum
only in the case that certain second-order conditions are satisfied as well. However,
it follows from our results in the previous section that the weights qp , qw > 0. Hence
the loss function (2.46) is convex (and the second-order conditions are necessarily
satisfied) as long as qy > 0 as well.28 A sufficient condition for this, in turn, is that
  28
    This condition is sufficient but not necessary. See further discussion in Benigno and Woodford
(2004).

                                               25
the share of government purchases in total demand satisfy (2.48). As long as this
bound is satisfied, the solution to the first-order conditions will represent an optimum
of the LQ problem. This means that in the even of small enough disturbances, this
same solution will represent a linear approximation to a policy that represents at
least a local welfare optimum in the exact model.


3.1       The Case of “Equally Sticky” Wages and Prices
As stressed by Erceg et al. (2000), it is not in general possible to fully stabilize all
the target variables in the loss function (2.46). However, in the absence of cost-push
shocks, optimal policy still corresponds to complete stabilization of an appropriately
defined index of wages and prices, in at least one special case. Suppose that θw φ−1 =
θp and that κp = κw = κ. (We can think of this special case as one in which wages
and prices are “equally sticky”.) In this case the loss function (2.46) can be written
as
                  X∞         nq         qπ      qp                            o
                                y
              Et0     β t−t0      xt 2 + π̄ 2t + (1 − γ)(ω̂ R,t − ω̂ R,t−1 )2    (3.51)
                  t=t
                              2         2       2
                         0

where π̄ t ≡ γπ p,t + (1 − γ)π w,t is a weighted average of the price and wage inflation
rates, with weight 0 < γ < 1 determined by γ ≡ ω p /(ω + σ −1 ), and where qπ ≡ qp /γ.
Under these conditions, by subtracting (2.50) from (2.49) and using (2.45), we obtain
a difference equation for the evolution of the real wage, from which it follows that the
real wage is independent of policy. Moreover, by taking a weighted average of (2.50)
and (2.49), we obtain
                                 π̄ t = κxt + βEt π̄ t+1 + ut ,                   (3.52)
where ut ≡ γup,t + (1 − γ)uw,t .
    In the case that Φ = 0 and there are no variations in the tax rate, as assumed by
Erceg et al., there are no cost-push terms, and ut = 0 at all times in (3.52). It then
follows that complete stabilization of π̄ t implies complete stabilization of xt as well.
Since the real wage evolves independently of policy in this case, it is then obvious
that (3.51) attains its lowest possible value under such a policy. Hence it is optimal
to completely stabilize a weighted average of price inflation and wage inflation.
    However, even when wages and prices are “equally sticky,” this result fails to
obtain in the case of a distorted steady state.29 When Φ > 0, real disturbances of
 29
      It would also fail if there are variations in tax rates or in market power that would give rise to


                                                 26
any sort will generally result in a non-zero cost-push term ut in (3.52), as discussed
in the previous section. Complete stabilization of π̄ t continues to be possible, but in
this case requires fluctuations in xt , and it will be preferable to allow some degree of
variation in π̄ t for the sake of greater stability of the output gap.
    Since real wages are independent of policy, to characterize the optimal tradeoff one
can simply consider the processes {xt , π̄ t } that maximize (3.51) under the constraint
(3.52) for each t ≥ t0 , given an initial commitment for the value of π̄ t0 . One observes
that the form of this problem is the same — and that the solution is therefore the
same (in the case of a given {ut } process and given values of qπ and qy ) — as in the
Φ = 0 case treated in Woodford (2003, chap. 7).30 We recall here some of the main
results presented there, which directly apply to the present case as well.
    The first-order conditions for the optimization problem just stated are of the form

                                      qπ π̄ t + ϕt − ϕt−1 = 0,                                 (3.53)

                                          qy xt − κϕt = 0,                                     (3.54)
for each t ≥ t0 , where ϕt is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the constraint
(3.52) in period t. Bounded processes {π̄ t , xt , ϕt } that satisfy (3.52) and (3.53) –
(3.54) for each t ≥ t0 and are consistent with the initial condition (2.47) represent an
optimum. Using (3.53) to eliminate π̄ t and (3.54) to eliminate xt ,31 (3.52) becomes
an equation for the evolution of the multiplier

                   βqy Et ϕt+1 − [(1 + β)qy + κ2 qπ ]ϕt + qy ϕt−1 = qπ qy ut .                 (3.55)

The initial condition (2.47) can similarly be expressed as a constraint on the path of
the multipliers
                                ϕt0 − ϕt0 −1 = −qπ π̄ t0 .                      (3.56)
An optimum can then be described by a bounded process {ϕt } for all dates t ≥ t0 − 1
that satisfies (3.55) for each t ≥ t0 and is also consistent with (3.56).
cost-push terms even in the case that Φ = 0.
  30
     See also Clarida, Gali and Gertler (1999) for analysis of an LQ problem of this form.
  31
     Here we assume that both qπ , qy 6= 0. Note that if either qπ or qy happens to equal zero, optimal
policy is easily characterized: it consists simply of the complete stabilization of the variable with
the non-zero weight in the loss function.




                                                27
    Equation (3.55) has a unique bounded solution consistent with (3.56) if and only
if the characteristic equation
                                 ·             ¸
                               2         κ2 qπ
                            βµ − 1 + β +         µ+1=0                        (3.57)
                                          qy

has exactly one root such that |µ| < 1. This requires that the characteristic equation
have real roots, exactly one of which lies in the interval between -1 and 1; this in turn
is true if and only if qπ 6= 0 and

                                           qy       κ2
                                              >−          .                         (3.58)
                                           qπ    2(1 + β)

Note that (3.58) is necessarily satisfied if (2.48) holds, since in that case qπ , qy > 0.
   A characterization of the optimal equilibrium is then obtained by solving (3.53)
and (3.54) for π̄ t and xt respectively, where the multiplier process {ϕt } is specified
recursively by the relation32
                                                    ∞
                                                    X
                                 ϕt = µϕt−1 − qπ           β j µj+1 Et ut+j .       (3.59)
                                                     j=0


Here µ is the root of (3.57) that satisfies −1 < µ < 1, and the initial value ϕt0 −1 is
chosen so that the solution is consistent with the precommitted value for π̄ t0 .
    We note that even in the special case that wages and prices are “equally sticky,”
optimal policy will not involve complete stabilization of any weighted average of wages
and prices. Instead, the optimal evolution of π̄ t will depend on the history of cost-
push disturbances. The optimal evolution of any other index of wages and prices
will depend both on this and the exogenous determinants of real wages, and since
different real disturbances will affect ut and the real wage ω R,t in different ways, there
will not generally be any index of wages and prices that will remain constant in the
optimal equilibrium.

3.2     The General Case
More generally, to derive the optimal policy we can write the Lagrangian as
                ∞
                X               qy 2 qp 2     qw
Lt0 = Et0 {            β t−t0     xt + π p,t + π 2w,t + ϕp,t (π p,t − κp xt − ξ p ω̂ R,t − βπ p,t+1 )
                t=t0
                                2     2        2
          +ϕw,t (π w,t − κw xt + ξ w ω̂ R,t − βπ w,t+1 ) + ϕr,t (ω̂ R,t − ω̂ R,t−1 − π w,t + π p,t ) +
          +ϕ1,t0 −1 π p,t0 + ϕ2,t0 −1 π w,t0 }.

The first-order conditions obtained by differentiation are then

                                       qy xt − κp ϕp,t − κw ϕw,t = 0;                           (3.60)

                                    qp π p,t + ϕp,t − ϕp,t−1 + ϕr,t = 0;                        (3.61)
                                   qw π w,t + ϕw,t − ϕw,t−1 − ϕr,t = 0;                         (3.62)
                                ξ p ϕp,t − ξ w ϕw,t − ϕr,t + βEt ϕr,t+1 = 0,                    (3.63)
for each t ≥ t0 . The first-order conditions (3.60) to (3.63) together with the structural
equations (2.50), (2.49) and (2.45) need to be solve for the optimal path of the
lagrange multipliers {ϕp,t , ϕw,t , ϕr,t } and the variables {xt , π p,t , π w,t , wR,t } given the
initial conditions (2.47). We note that the initial conditions can similarly be expressed
as a constraint on the path of the multipliers

                                    ϕp,t0 − ϕp,t0 −1 + ϕr,t0 = −qp π̄ p,t0 ,

                                   ϕw,t0 − ϕw,t0 −1 − ϕr,t0 = −qw π̄ w,t0 .
   We show in the appendix that we can express the above conditions as a linear
system of the form

The determinacy of the equilibrium depends on the roots of the characteristic equation
associated with the system (A.67)

                                      det(B − µA) = 0.

Rational-expectations equilibrium is determinate if the number of roots µi such that
|µi | < 1 is exactly equal to the number of predetermined variables, which in this case
is three. Under this condition, we show in the appendix that the unique non-explosive
solution is of the form

we can obtain the optimal paths of the variables {xt , π p,t , π w,t , wR,t }.


3.3     Optimal Targeting Rules
Finally, following Giannoni and Woodford (2003), we can use the first-order conditions
to eliminate the three Lagrange multipliers, obtaining a target criterion of the form

 (κw − κp )π asym
             t    + (ξ p + ξ w )qt + (κw − κp ){Et [βqt+1 − qt ] − Et−1 [βqt − qt−1 ]} = 0, (3.66)

where
                                π asym
                                  t    ≡ qp ξ p π p,t − qw ξ w π w,t
is a measure of the asymmetry between price and wage inflation,
                                           qp ξ p π p,t + qw ξ w π w,t

                                                 qp ξ p + qw ξ w
is a average of the rates of price and wage inflation, and
                                        ·                                  ¸

This criterion holds at all times in the optimal equilibrium, and a commitment to use
monetary policy to ensure that it holds ensures that the only non-explosive rational-
expectations equilibrium consistent with the policy will be the optimal one. In the
special case analyzed above in which κw = κp = κ > 0, the optimal target criterion
reduces to qt = 0, or
                                          qy

                                   qp ξ p + qw ξ w
    This again allows us to consider the degree to which simple policy rules of either
of the two kinds discussed by Erceg et al. are likely to provide close approximations
to optimal policy in the general case. In the special case that wages and prices are
“equally sticky”, there is a linear combination of wage inflation, price inflation and
the output gap that it would be optimal to stabilize, given by the optimal target
criterion (3.67). However, all three target variables enter with non-zero weights in
this criterion, and because real disturbances should influence these three variables
in two distinct ways in the optimal equilibrium (both through their effects on the
cost-push terms and through their effects on the natural real wage), as discussed in
the previous section, it will not generally be possible to closely approximate any one
of them by a linear combination of the other two (except for the relation implied
by this target criterion itself). Hence one should not expect optimal policy to be
well-characterized by a rule that stabilizes any linear combination of wage inflation
and price inflation alone, or by a rule that stabilizes a linear combination of price
inflation and the output gap alone. In the more general case, optimal policy cannot
even be characterized by a static relation between all three variables; but there is even
less reason to believe that a good approximation to optimal policy can be obtained
without reference to all three variables.


4    Conclusion
We have shown how to extend the analysis of Erceg et al. to treat the case in which the
steady-state equilibrium level of output under a policy that maintains zero inflation is
suboptimal, due to tax distortions and market power, and in which, as a consequence,
the effects of stabilization policy on the average level of output are important for the
welfare evaluation of such policies. Even in this case, it is possible to approximate
the expected utility of the representative household by a purely quadratic objective,

                                         31
so that welfare can be evaluated, to second-order accuracy, using only a first-order
accurate solution for the equilibrium implied by a given policy rule.
    As in the case of an efficient steady state treated by Erceg et al., the welfare-
theoretic loss function can be expressed as a sum of three quadratic terms, indicating
the distortions due to non-zero levels of wage inflation, price inflation and an appro-
priately defined output gap, respectively. The inefficiency of the steady state does
not change the general form of the loss function, but it does have quantitative im-
plications for both the weights on each of the three stabilization objectives, and for
the definition of the target level of output, deviations from which define the welfare-
relevant output gap. An important consequence of a distorted steady state is that
except under extremely special circumstances, one cannot expect real disturbances
to move the target level of output and the natural rate of output (the equilibrium
output level in the case of flexible wages and prices) to the same extent. This means
that almost any kind of real disturbances will create a tension between the objectives
of stabilizing the welfare-relevant output gap on the one hand and stabilizing wage
and price inflation and the other. As a result, it is likely that neither of the kinds of
simple rules considered by Erceg et al. — rules that stabilize a weighted average of
wage and price inflation with no reference to the output gap, and rules that stabilize
a weighted average of price inflation and the output gap with no reference to wage
inflation — will come as close to approximating fully optimal policy in an economy
with a distorted steady state as in the numerical examples that they consider.
    Nonetheless, the most important of the conclusions of Erceg et al. remain valid.
The stickiness of wages implies that variations in the rate of wage inflation are as
closely related to distortions that monetary policy should seek to mitigate as are
variations in price inflation, and as a consequence, a strict (goods-price) inflation
target will not be optimal. Indeed, we have shown that in the more general model
considered here, optimal policy can be characterized by a targeting rule, but the
optimal target criterion generally involves the projected paths of price inflation, wage
inflation, and the output gap. The welfare gains from adoption of a more sophisticated
form of inflation target may be substantial; and our analysis suggests that they may
be even larger when one takes account of the likely degree of distortion of the steady-
state level of output in a realistic model.

A      Appendix
A.1     The deterministic steady state
Here we show the existence of a steady state, i.e., of an optimal policy (under
appropriate initial conditions) of the recursive policy problem that involves constant
values of all variables. We consider a deterministic problem in which the exogenous
disturbances C̄t , Gt , H̄t , At , τ t each take constant values C̄, H̄, Ā, τ̄ > 0 and Ḡ ≥ 0
for all t ≥ t0 . We wish to find an initial degree of price and wage dispersions ∆p,t0 −1 ,
∆w,t0 −1 , initial real wage wR,t0 −1 ≡ Wt0 −1 /Pt0 −1 and initial commitments Xt0 = X̄
such that the recursive (or “stage two”) problem involves a constant policy xt0 = x̄,
Xt+1 = X̄ each period, in which ∆        ¯ p, ∆
                                              ¯ w and w̄ are equal to the initial values.
    We thus consider the problem of maximizing

    We introduce Lagrange multipliers φ1t through φ9t corresponding to constraints
(A.2) through (A.10) respectively. We also introduce multipliers dated t0 correspond-
ing to the constraints implied by the initial conditions Xt0 = X̄; the latter multipliers
are normalized in such a way that the first-order conditions take the same form at
date t0 as at all later dates. The first-order conditions of the maximization problem

    We search for a solution to these first-order conditions in which Πp,t = Πw,t = Π̄,
∆p,t = ∆  ¯ p , ∆w,t = ∆
                       ¯ w , wR,t = w̄R , Yt = Ȳ at all times. A steady-state solution
of this kind also requires that the Lagrange multipliers take constant values. We
furthermore conjecture the existence of a solution in which Π̄ = 1, as stated in the
text. Note that such a solution implies that ∆    ¯p = ∆¯ w = 1, p(Π̄p ) = 1, p(Π̄w ) = 1,
pπ (Π̄p ) = −(θp − 1)αp /(1 − αp ), pπ (Π̄w ) = −(θw − 1)αw /(1 − αw ) and K̄p = F̄p and
K̄w = F̄w . Using these substitutions, we find that (the steady-state version of) each of
the first-order conditions (A.11) – (A.20) is satisfied if the steady-state values satisfy

These equations can obviously be solved (uniquely) for the steady-state multipliers,
given any value Ȳ > 0 and w̄R > 0.
   Similarly, (the steady-state versions of) the constraints (A.2) – (A.10) are satisfied
if
                              (1 − τ̄ )Ȳ 1−φ = φµp w̄R Ā−φ                      (A.21)

Substituting (A.21) into (A.22) we can obtain

which can be solved for the steady-state value Ȳ . Then either (A.21) or (A.22) can
be solved to obtain the steady-state value w̄R given Ȳ .


A.2     A second-order approximation to utility (equations (2.30)
        and (2.33))
We derive here equations (2.30) and (2.33) in the main text, taking a second-order
approximation to (equation (1.13)) following the treatment in Woodford (2003, chap-
ter 6). We start by approximating the expected discounted value of the sum of the
utilities of the households (the policy-objective function)
                             X∞         ·                Z 1                  ¸

                             t=t0                       0


   First we note that
              Z 1

                                              36
where ∆w,t is the measure of price dispersion defined in the text. We can then write
(A.23) as
                             X∞
                   Ut0 = Et0     β t−t0 [u(Yt ; ξ t ) − v(Ht ; ξ t )∆w,t ] .  (A.24)

sion around the steady state defined in the previous section as

where a bar denotes the steady-state value for each variable, a tilde denotes the
deviation of the variable from its steady-state value (e.g., Ỹt ≡ Yt −Ȳ ), and a hat refers
to the log deviation of the variable from its steady-state value (e.g., Ŷt ≡ ln Yt /Ȳ ).
We use ξ t to refer to the entire vector of exogenous shocks,

in which Ĝt ≡ (Gt − Ḡ)/Y , gt ≡ Ĝt + sC c̄t , ω ≡ (φ − 1) + φν, ωqt ≡ ν h̄t + φ(1 + ν)at ,
τ̂ t ≡ (τ t − τ̄ )/τ̄ , c̄t ≡ ln C̄t /C̄, at ≡ ln At /Ā, h̄t ≡ ln H̄t /H̄. Moreover, we use the
definitions σ −1 ≡ σ̃ −1 s−1  C with sC ≡ C̄/Ȳ . We have used the Taylor expansion

                                                  1
                                Yt /Ȳ = 1 + Ŷt + Ŷt2 + O(||ξ||3 )
                                                  2

to get a relation for Ỹt in terms of Ŷt . Finally the term “t.i.p.” denotes terms that
are independent of policy, and may accordingly be suppressed as far as the welfare
ranking of alternative policies is concerned.

The determinacy of the equilibrium depends on the roots of the characteristic equation
associated with the system (A.67)

                                    det(B − µA) = 0.

Rational-expectations equilibrium is determinate if the number of roots µi such that
|µi | < 1 is exactly equal to the number of predetermined variables which in our case
is three. Under this condition, we can solve the above system in the following way.
Consider as V the matrix of the left eigenvector associated with the roots of the
characteristic polynomial which are above the unit circle. The matrix V has the



                                            51
property that V B = ΦV A, where Φ is a diagonal matrix that contains the roots µi
such that |µi | > 1. By premultiplying (A.67) by V we obtain

                                     Et kt+1 = Φkt + V Cυ t                                    (A.68)

where we have defined kt ≡ V Azt . A unique and stable solution for {zt } can be
obtained by
                                   ∞
                                   X

                                            j=0

We can partition V A as V A = [(V A)1 (V A)2 ] according to the non-predetermined
and predetermined endogenous variables in zt = [z1,t z2,t−1 ] and we can obtain
                                                        ∞

which can be solved (under conditions of invertibility on V A1 ) as

                                                             j=0


We note that we can partition the system (A.67) in the following way
         "         # Ã            ! "           #Ã          ! "      #

We can then substitute (A.69) into the lower block of the above system to obtain
                                                                                  ∞
                                                                                  X
z2,t =   A−1
          4 (B4 −B3 (V   A)−1
                           1 (V   A)2 )z2,t−1 +A−1         −1
                                                4 C2 υ t −A4 B3 (V       A)−1
                                                                           1 Et         Φ−(j+1) V Cυ t+j
                                                                                  j=0
                                                                         (A.70)
Using (A.69) and (A.70) and (A.56), (A.57), (A.58) and (A.62) we can obtain the
optimal path for {xt , π p,t , π w,t , ω̂ R,t }.
