Limitations on the Effectiveness of Monetary Policy Forward Guidance in the Context of
the COVID-19 Pandemic

JEL No. E52,E58

                                         ABSTRACT

We examine the effectiveness of forward guidance at the effective lower bound (ELB) in the
context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Survey evidence underscores the myopia of professional
forecasters at the initial stages of the pandemic and the extraordinary dispersion of their recent
forecasts. Moreover, financial markets are now practically certain that U.S. short-term nominal
interest rates will remain at the ELB for the next several years; consequently, forward guidance
would have to refer to a much longer time horizon than in previous experience. To analyze the
effects of these issues, we consider a canonical New-Keynesian model with three modifications:
(1) expectations formation incorporates the mechanisms that have been proposed for addressing
the forward guidance puzzle; (2) the central bank has imperfect credibility in making longer-
horizon commitments regarding the path of monetary policy; and (3) the central bank may not
have full knowledge of the true structure of the economy. In this framework, providing
substantial near-term monetary stimulus hinges on making promises of relatively extreme
overshooting of output and inflation in subsequent years, and hence forward guidance has only
tenuous net benefits and may even be counterproductive.

1         Introduction
The extraordinary economic crisis precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic has caused historic
declines in output and employment. The Federal Reserve is now holding the target federal funds
rate at the e¤ective lower bound (ELB) and has established an unprecedented range of emergency
credit facilities with the support of the U.S. Treasury. As indicated in recent minutes and other
public communications of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), policymakers are actively
considering the possibility of providing additional monetary stimulus through explicit forward guid-
ance about the future trajectory of the federal funds rate. However, Federal Reserve sta¤ analysis
indicates that the FOMC "would have to maintain highly accommodative …nancial conditions for
many years to quicken meaningfully the recovery from the current severe downturn."1
    In assessing the potential e¤ectiveness of such forward guidance, it is crucial to incorporate key
lessons from the recent academic literature about the "forward guidance puzzle." Researchers have
highlighted the extent to which the e¢ cacy of forward guidance is attenuated by realistic features of
expectations formation, including myopia and disagreement across forecasters, as well as the central
bank’s capacity and credibility in making binding commitments.
    In this paper, we examine the e¤ectiveness of forward guidance at the e¤ective lower bound (ELB)
in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We begin by reviewing the relevant empirical evidence
which underscores the myopia of professional forecasters at the initial stages of the pandemic and
the extraordinary dispersion of their recent forecasts of U.S. GDP. Recent work by Altig et al (2020)
and Coibion, Gorodnichenko and Weber (2020) also documents a large degree of uncertainty during
the Covid-19 crisis. Nonetheless, the latest Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) conducted
by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, released in mid-August 2020, indicates that average
unemployment rate is projected to remain more than a percentage point above the natural rate of
unemployment at least through 2023.
    Consequently, even though the pandemic continues to generate an unprecedented degree of un-
certainty about the U.S. economic outlook, …nancial market participants are practically certain that
U.S. short-term nominal interest rates will remain at the ELB over the next several years. Hence,
forward guidance would have to refer to a much longer time horizon than in the previous experience
of the Federal Reserve or any other central bank. The FOMC meeting transcripts from 2011-12 indi-
cate that policymakers at that time were acutely aware that longer-horizon forward guidance could
be impaired by intrinsic limits on the FOMC’s ability to make credible promises on behalf of future
members.
    To analyze these issues quantitatively, we consider a canonical New-Keynesian model with three
modi…cations: (1) expectations formation incorporates the forms of myopia and imperfect common

knowledge that have been shown to mitigate the forward guidance puzzle; (2) the central bank
has imperfect credibility in making longer-horizon commitments regarding the path of monetary
policy; and (3) the central bank may not have full knowledge of the true structure of the economy. In
particular, we incorporate myopic expectations from Gabaix (2020) and imperfect common knowledge
from Angeletos and Lian (2018). For each of these speci…cations, the optimal monetary policy at the
ELB is markedly more aggressive than in the conventional model with rational expectations: The
initial shortfall of in‡ation is modest and transitory, while the overshooting of in‡ation is substantial
(about one percentage point above target) and persistent (only subsiding after about …ve years).
    Next, we assume that the credibility of a policy commitment depends on the length of time until
that commitment will be implemented. In particular, the central bank announces its commitment in
the initial period when policy becomes constrained by the ELB, but private agents perceive a …xed
probability that in any given period the central bank may renege on that commitment and revert to
the purely discretionary policy, i.e., the likelihood of revocation is represented by a Poisson process
with a constant hazard rate2 . This formulation directly captures the concerns raised in past FOMC
discussions, namely, the extent to which the Committee’s composition evolves gradually over time as
a result of staggered terms, retirements, and other sources of turnover. In our benchmark scenario
where the ELB is binding for about seven years, the private sector initially perceives 50/50 odds
that the central bank will follow through with its commitment to the “lower-for-longer” strategy.
Those perceived odds rise gradually over time as the central bank continues to reiterate its com-
mitment and the time approaches when the commitment will be implemented. Imperfect credibility
induces a marked deterioration in macroeconomic stability, regardless of the particular speci…cation
of expectations formation.
    In our …nal modi…cation, we assume that the policymakers may be hampered by model uncer-
tainty, i.e., their own imperfect knowledge of the dynamic structure of the economy. These insights
are illustrated by varying a single parameter, namely, the slope of the New Keynesian Phillips curve.
If the central bank incorrectly formulates its optimal policy strategy based on a steeper slope, the
misperception results in a dramatic set of policy errors due to the mistaken strong feedback loop
between output gap, the in‡ation rate, and the real interest rate.
    Our analysis revisits the fundamental insights of Campbell, Evans, Fisher, and Justiniano (2012)
regarding the distinction between Delphic vs. Odyssean forward guidance. At present, the FOMC’s
forward guidance is essentially Delphic, that is, …nancial market participants do not expect the
Federal Reserve to raise the federal funds rate for several years due to the bleak economic outlook.
In that context, e¤orts to issue Odyssean forward guidance over longer horizons might well prove
   2
     For simplicity, we assume that the central bank’s commitment becomes fully credible once the ELB is no longer
binding, because from that point onwards private agents can directly observe that the commitment is being carried
out.

to be ine¤ectual or even counterproductive: Such forward guidance could inadvertently reinforce
the private sector’s pessimism about the economic outlook rather than boosting their longer-run
projections. Moreover, if the forward guidance did not in fact provide much near-term monetary
stimulus, the Federal Reserve might be disinclined to follow through with the promised overshooting
down the road. Indeed, such considerations are precisely why such forward guidance might not be
very credible to …nancial markets.
    The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents evidence on myopia and
dispersion in expectations formation. Section 3 presents the small-scale New Keynesian model, and
4 discusses the optimal policy characterization in this model. Imperfect credibility is introduced in
section 5 and preliminary aspects of model uncertainty are discussed in section 6. Section 7 concludes.


2     Evidence on Expectations about the Economy and Policy
The COVID-19 pandemic has led …nancial market participants to expect a very slow economic re-
covery. The nominal term structure of interest rates illustrates this in …gure 1. The 10-year yield
is far lower in July 2020 than at any point during the 2008 …nancial crisis; the 2- and 5-year yields
have fallen very sharply in the last quarter.

   We seek to get a better understanding of how expectations of investors have responded in the
run-up to the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis. To do this, we examine the Federal Reserve Bank
of Philadelphia’s Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and Survey of Primary Dealers (SPD)
conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The SPF has been administered by the

                                                        3
Philadelphia Federal Reserve since 1990, and participants include …nancial market professionals,
academics and other researchers. The survey is conducted on a quarterly basis. The SPD has been
conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York since 2011.3 The respondents belong to primary
dealer …rms, and the survey questions are designed to ascertain expectations about these …rms. The
survey questions are circulated among the respondent groups two weeks before each FOMC meeting,
and the results are made available on the website approximately three weeks after the FOMC meeting.
    We use two aspects of the surveys: …rst, we use the SPF and SPD to examine the myopia and
disagreement about the evolution of the real GDP and unemployment during the 2020 crisis. We
also use the SPF expectations from the 2008 crisis to explore these characteristics about investor
expectations further. As our model below shows, both myopia and disagreement would impede the
e¤ectiveness of forward guidance policy measures. Second, we examine the SPD from 2011 and
2012 to understand whether, and by how much, …nancial market participants were changing their
expectations about a lifto¤ in the Federal Funds rate in response to forward guidance from the
FOMC. As the ELB was reached in December 2008, the FOMC began to o¤er di¤erent variants of
forward guidance at various meetings. We examine the e¤ects of the forward guidance statements
over the ELB period examining the expectations of lifto¤ reported by the primary dealers in the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey, as well as by using changes in nominal and real yields.
    We also examine transcripts of the FOMC meetings in 2011. These discussions of FOMC members
give unique insights into the concerns raised about the impact of market expectations on the e¤ec-
tiveness of forward guidance on …nancial market participants. There are also insightful discussions
related to the formulation of forward guidance over extended periods.


2.1     Expectations about the Economy
Myopia in expectations reported by the SPF participants is evident for the 2020 as well as the 2008
crises. The forecasters are asked to assign probabilities to the annual-average over annual-average
percent change in the level of real chainweighted GDP. These are shown in …gure 2. We consider
surveys in the quarters preceding, and at the start of, the crises of 2008 and 2020.
    The …rst panel of …gure 2 shows the results for the 2008 crisis. The actual annual-average over the
annual-average percent change in the real GDP is indicated by the red line. In the August 2008 SPF,
forecasters placed insigni…cant probabilities of a decline in this growth rate.4 By the next survey, in
November 2008, the mass of probabilities was still concentrated at signi…cantly higher growth rates
than the actual outcome.

    Among the individual forecasters, only one of the 43 forecasters placed any probability of the decline in the growth
rate.

   Note: These are the probabilities assigned by the SPF forecasters to the annual-average over annual-
average percent change in the level of real chainweighted GDP.
   Next, we consider myopia in expectations during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. The July 2020
outlook is from the forecasts of the Conference Board. In the February 2020 survey, forecasters were
very optimistic about the economy; by May 2020, the mass of the distribution had shifted to a much
more pessimistic view.

   Note: These are the probabilities assigned by the SPD forecasters to the Q4-over-Q4 change in the real
GDP. The surveys were conducted in 2020 on the dates indicated.




    Next, we consider the myopia of forecasters of the SPD. We consider three surveys in 2020. In
the March 2020 survey, the forecasters placed an approximately 30% probability that the Q4-over-Q4
growth in the real GDP would be negative. In the April 2020 survey, the mass of the distribution
began to shift to a more pessimistic outlook, but it was only in the June 2020 survey that this view
became more entrenched.
    Dispersion of forecasts among the SPF participants has been historically unprecedented in the
2020 crisis, and this is illustrated in …gure 4. We present the Interquartile Ranges (IQR) of the
one-year ahead forecasts for the log of the real GDP. The left panel in …gure 4 shows the dispersion
in forecasts during the 2008 crisis, and the right panel shows the levels for the 2020 crises. The
non-recession means for the IQRs are also indicated by the green lines. While dispersion doubled
during the 2008 crisis, the 2020 crisis recorded the highest dispersion on record.

with the SPF, we …nd that this dispersion measure was the highest on record for the series. It is also
worth noting that there was strikingly little disagreement among the forecasters in SPD in March
2020, even though the Covid-19 crisis had began to unfold at a rapid pace outside the United States,
and the Federal Reserve has already initiated the 50 b.p. reduction in the Federal Funds Rate5 . The
SPF also indicates the same low level of disagreement in the …rst quarter of 2020, but since that data
is collected primarily in the middle of the quarter, it may be less indicative of the changing economic
situation.

    These …ndings suggest that myopia and forecast dispersion are important characteristics of fore-
caster beliefs. Since these are professional forecasters, and their expectations are considered to be a
gauge for expectations more generally, these are important features to incorporate in an exploration
of the e¤ectiveness of forward guidance.


2.2    Expectations about Forward Guidance
We now turn to examining the evidence from the SPD about how expectations changed in response to
the issuance of speci…c forward guidance. We then analyze the FOMC transcripts. We are considering
the responses of forecasters to forward guidance issued by the Federal Reserve during and in the
aftermath of the 2008 crisis. In December 2008 and March 2009, the statements communicated that
the rates would remain low for "some time" or an "extended period". In August 2011 and January

                                                      8
and September 2012, this was replaced by calendar based guidance. Table 1 in the appendix shows
the highlights of these statements.

2.2.1   Survey Evidence

The responses from the SPD suggest that in response to the forward guidance statements there were
only small changes in the expectations of forecasters regarding the timing of lifto¤ in the federal
funds rate. We use the following question asked by the SPD: "Of the possible outcomes below, please
indicate the percent chance you attach to the timing of the …rst federal funds target rate increase."
The question makes available time periods, and the respondents are required to assign probabilities
of lifto¤ to the di¤erent time periods. The format of a sample question, along with the responses, is
shown in table 2 of the appendix.
    Using this question, we construct a series of the median lifto¤ date reported by the respondents.
The results indicate that the primary dealers shifted their expectations about the lifto¤ dates by
a maximum of two quarters between 2011 and 2012. Thus, while the …nancial market participants
were responding to the forward guidance provided, the e¤ects were quite short-term. This change in
the lifto¤ dates are shown in table 3 of the appendix.
    We also examine the e¤ects of the forward guidance announcements on the nominal and real term
structure of yields. These …ndings con…rm those in the literature: the largest change, across the term
structure for both nominal and real yields occurred around the March 18, 2009 announcement. On
this day, in its post-meeting statement, the FOMC replaced the phrase "for some time" with "for an
extended period" in reference to the ELB range for the Federal Funds Rate. By the time the 2012
forward guidance was being o¤ered, its e¤ects on yield changes were much smaller. The patterns in
the yield changes suggest that the …rst instances of forward guidance had large e¤ects on the term
structure of yields, but calendar-based guidance was less e¤ective. These responses are shown in
table 4 of the appendix.
    These …ndings from the survey expectations, as well as the yield changes, suggest that the forward
guidance o¤ered by the FOMC is able to a¤ect …nancial market expectations at relatively short-term
horizons.

2.2.2   Discussion of Forward Guidance in FOMC Transcripts

The FOMC excerpts highlight the broad concerns of policymakers in using forward guidance, and
of making commitments at long-term horizons. A common characteristic of the forward guidance
o¤ered in 2011 and 2012 was that it referred to horizons of approximately two years. For example, at
the August 9, 2011 meeting, the forward guidance only extended upto "...at least through mid-2013".
However, as a protracted ELB episode would require forward guidance to be o¤ered for a time period


                                                  9
far in the future, it is instructive to examine the transcripts of the FOMC during the time the forward
guidance discussions were taking place. During the FOMC meeting held on August 9, 2011, there
were several concerns raised by the committee members about the nature and period of the forward
guidance which would be o¤ered. For example, President Eric Rosengren, of the Federal Reserve
Bank of Boston, stated:

     I fear that the change in language we have discussed does little to signal further easing.
     It says that exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate are likely to be maintained
     at least through mid-2013, but this matches the path of the federal funds rate that the
     market already expects [...]. A statement that matches current market expectations is
     not likely to have much of an e¤ect on market rates.

   Further discussions also noted the contingent nature of the forward guidance o¤ered. Federal
Reserve Bank of New York President, and the FOMC Vice-President Bill Dudley noted:

     “...making binding commitments might be viewed as potentially reckless in a world where
     the outlook is highly uncertain.”

   Likewise, Janet Yellen (then serving as Federal Reserve Board vice chair) indicated:

     “...we need to be mindful of the intrinsic limits on our ability to make credible promises
     over time horizons that extend beyond several years. We need to follow a pragmatic
     approach for promoting the stability of economic activity and in‡ation, recognizing the
     limits of our understanding of the structure and evolution of the economy and of our
     ability to anticipate or plan for all possible contingencies.”

   During the November 1-2, 2011 meeting, the FOMC participants expressed concern about how
the private sector would view the forward guidance being o¤ered, in the case of Committee decisions
that were not unanimous. Governor Elizabeth Duke stated:

     If we’re going to convince the public that we’re going to act di¤erently in the future,
     especially far into the future, we will …rst need unanimous or near unanimous agreement
     and steadfast conviction that it’s the right course for us to follow [...] Without near
     unanimity and one voice, the public could focus on the potential for the rotation of voters
     to change the path or the potential for the two open seats and the upcoming term endings
     on the Board to bring about a philosophical change or, in the worst case for credibility,
     the political debate could become …xated on e¤ecting such a change through legislation
     or personnel changes.

   We now turn our attention to modeling these concerns in a stylized NK framework.

                                                  10
3       Model Framework
Here we specify the model framework which we use to characterize the …ndings on private sector
expectations. The formulation nests three of the prominent models that were originally put forth to
address the forward guidance puzzle (Del Negro, Giannoni and Patterson, 2012).6 However, each one
presents a plausible way to model expectations as we observe above. Our objective is to characterize
and analyze the optimal policy in model which addresses the forward guidance puzzle, and compare
it with the commitment policy under rational expectations.
    Using the reduced form model, in log-linear representation, these models can be represented in
the following way:

                                                  0
                                 xt =                 fit   !Et   t+1   rtn g + Mc Et xt+1                       (1a)
                                             0
                                  t   =          xt + M f E t     t+1


Here, xt is the output gap, is the intertemporal elasticity of substitution, it is the nominal interest
rate, t is the in‡ation rate and rtn is the natural rate. Additionally, is the discount factor and …rms
update their prices following Calvo pricing, where 2 (0; 1] of the …rms keep their prices unchanged.
Under rational expectations, we have standard representation with ! = 1; 0 = ; Mc = Mf = = 1
and 0 = ; where = + 1 (1 )(1 ) , and is the Frisch elasticity of substitution. The …rst
equation is referred to as the IS curve and the second as the New-Keynesian Phillips curve (NKPC)
in the exposition below.
    Under the imperfect common knowledge assumption of Angeletos and Lian (2018), there is a lack
of common knowledge about news, and about the beliefs and responses of others. This is interpreted
as a form of bounded rationality which is consistent with the rational expectations equilibrium. In
terms of the parameters, ! is the friction in common knowledge, and in the exposition here, this
friction is the same for consumers and …rms. With this assumption, Mc = + (1                ) ! 2 ( ; 1];
Mf = + (1         ) ! 2 ( ; 1]; 0 = ! and 0 = :
    With Gabaix’s (2020) characterization, the optimizing agents are myopic, and do not anticipate
future events perfectly (unlike agents with rational expectations). In this formulation, the parameter
m 2 [0; 1] measures "cognitive discounting", that is the attention to the future7 . With this assump-
tion, the parameters of the reduced form model in (1a) are the following: Mc = Rm r < 1; Mf =
             1
m       +   1    m
                     (1   ) < 1 and    0
                                           = .8
    6
     The nested model, however, is not exhaustive. For example, Hagedorn, Luo, Manovskii, and Mitman (2019)
examine an NK model with incomplete …nancial markets in which the central bank’s forward guidance may be largely
o¤set by shifts in the distribution of taxes, transfers, and corporate dividends.
   7
     Using the cognitive discounting parameter, the expectations operation under bounded rationality E BR (Xt+1 ) =
    RE
mE      (Xt+1 ) ; where E RE is the rational expectations expectations operator for the one-period ahead variable Xt .
   8
     We are considering the version for Gabaix’s model in which the other cogntive discounting factors, such as my for


                                                              11
    McKay, Nakamura and Steinsson (2016) obtain a discounting in the aggregate-level Euler equation
by introducing a combination of heterogeneity and market incompleteness. This implies that some
agents hit their borrowing constraints, thereby violating the individual-level Euler condition. In this
case, Mc ; < 1; Mf = 1; 0 < , and 0 =            ; where < 1: The exact parameter formulations are
shown in the appendix.
    The gist of all these models is that discounting is introduced in the aggregate level Euler equation
and the NKPC. The parameters for the NK model are assigned values usually used in the literature:
  is 4 (Amato and Laubach, 2003), the slope of the Phillips curve is 0:024, and = 0:9975. The
behavioral parameters are set at the values used in the respective papers. In the Angeletos and Lian
(2018) speci…cation, ! = 0:75 and Mf = 0:9; in Gabaix (2020), Mc = Mf = 0:8 and in the McKay,
Nakamura and Steinsson (2016) speci…cation, Mc = 0:97 and = 0:75. The parameter values are
summarized in table 1. We now consider these frameworks for characterizing the central bank’s
policy.

income and mr for the interest rate are set at their rational expectations values of 1. This implies that the individual

4    Optimal Policy with Full Credibility
In the following, we present the results for characterizing optimal policy under discretion and com-
mitment under the zero-lower bound. The natural rate shock is assumed to follow an AR(1) process.
Following the literature, the central bank’s problem is to choose the path of fi0 ; i1 ; :::g to minimize
the loss function Lt = 2t + x2t :
                                                 P
                                                 1
                                                     t
                                              E0       Lt                                             (2)
                                                           t=0

subject to the IS and aggregate supply equations in (1a). Here is the discount factor, and is the
positive parameter denoting the weight assigned by the central bank to output stability.
   In the case where the central bank commits to a course of action, it’s problem is to choose a state
contingent sequence for xt and t to maximize the objective in (2) assuming that equations in (1a)
hold in every period t. As noted by Clarida, Gali and Gertler (1999; CGG henceforth), the central
bank recognizes that the private sector will be forming its expectations based on the evolution of xt
and t , and therefore does not treat them as …xed while solving the optimization problem.
   Under the commitment strategy, the …rst order conditions for the central bank’s problem are:

                           @L              Mc                  0
                                :     1t 1    + ( xt + 1t   2t ) = 0                                         (3a)
                           @xt
                           @L                 !
                                :       1t 1       2t 1 Mf + ( t + 2t ) = 0                                  (3b)
                           @ t
                          it 1t = 0; it 0; 1t 0                                                              (3c)

Assuming initial conditions of 1 1 = 2 1 = 0, the solution to the system is obtained from the above
…rst order conditions, and the the IS and NKPC curves. Here we assume that it is bounded at the
ELB until Tc .
   After Tc , the Lagrange multiplier 1t for t > Tc is zero. For t = Tc + 2; :::; there is a unique
bounded solution, with the dynamic path given by:
                                        " #               "                 #
                                         t                    (1           1)
                                                      =            0              2t 1 ;                      (4)
                                        xt                             1

                                          2t          =       1 2t 1                                          (5)

where   1   is the eigenvalue of the matrix solved for in the appendix. Finally, the path of it is given
by:

                           it =     xt + Mc Et xt+1 + !Et                       t+1   + rtn                   (6)
                                             0
                               =    1            (1       Mc    1)     + ! (1            1)   2t 1   + rtn    (7)


                                                               13
Thus, under commitment, the path of it now depends on the extent to which knowledge is "imperfect".
   For the period during the zero lower bound, we set it = 0 in the IS, aggregate supply and …rst
order conditions. Then,
                                               "          #           "                                                #

    Figure 6 compares these alternative speci…cations under the benchmark assumption that the
central bank’s policy strategy is completely transparent and credible. In particular, we consider a
stylized experiment in which the natural rate of interest drops sharply in the initial period and then
gradually reverts towards its steady-state value. In particular, the natural rate follows an AR(1)
process, rtn = r rtn 1 + "t ; with r = 0:94 and a shock size of 0:01. With these parameters, the
natural rate remains negative for 23 quarters before turning positive. In e¤ect, this shock represents
a scenario involving a large and persistent shortfall in aggregate demand, perhaps roughly similar in
magnitude to the impact of the global …nancial crisis on the U.S. economy.

   Note: These …gures show the responses of the four models (rational expectations, RE; Mckay, Nakamura
and Steinsson, MNS; Angeletos and Lian, AL and Gabaix, Gab) in response to a natural rate shock. The
…gure shows the evolution of the short nominal interest rate, output gap and in‡ation across the various
model speci…cations. Time periods are denoted in quarters. The in‡ation rate is expressed in annual rates
in percent; the interest rate and output gap are expressed in percentage points.




    The optimal monetary policy involves a commitment to a “lower-for-longer”strategy, so that the
actual nominal interest rate is pinned at the ELB for an additional year or two after the natural
rate becomes positive. Even with this policy in place, the initial impact of the shock is severe:
The output gap is about 8%, and in‡ation falls noticeably below target. Nonetheless, the optimal
monetary policy induces a rapid recovery involving a persistent boom in output and an elevated level
of in‡ation over the subsequent half-decade. For each of the model speci…cations, the optimal policy

is markedly more aggressive than a pure make-up strategy.9 In particular, the initial shortfall of
in‡ation is relatively modest and transitory, while the overshooting of in‡ation is substantial (about
one percentage point above target) and persistent (only subsiding after about …ve years).
    A commitment to a more aggressive “lower-for-longer” strategy could be reasonably e¤ective in
mitigating the ELB if such a commitment were fully transparent and credible. Before reaching any
de…nitive conclusions, however, it would be sensible to examine the performance of such strategies in
larger-scale DSGE models that incorporate a range of alternative speci…cations regarding the private
sector’s expectations formation.
    In …gure 7 we consider the extent to which myopia matters for the optimal policy e¤ects. The
benchmark level of the myopia parameter corresponds to the slope of the Phillips curve in (1a) to be
approximately 0:8, which corresponds to Gáli and Gertler (1999). A higher degree of myopia, with
Mf = 0:65, would correspond to the approximate value of the Phillips curve slope found in Fuhrer
                                                                  n
and Rudebusch (2004). We also consider a larger shock, with rshock      = 0:0125 while keeping the
same shock persistence. At this higher degree of myopia, the length of the ELB is extended by more
than a full year compared to the benchmark case.

    Bernanke, Kiley and Roberts (2019) and Reifschneider and Wilcox (2019) performed simulations of FRB/US and
reached similar conclusions about the shortcomings of pure make-up strategies in mitigating the ELB.

    Figure 8 shows the responses of the economy with di¤erent levels of imperfect common knowledge.
The benchmark parameter of ! = 0:75 corresponds to the case where every agent who has heard the
policy announcement believes that another agent failed to believe the policy with a probability of
25%. As Angeletos and Lian (2018) discuss, a greater degree of imperfect common knowledge with
! = 0:5 would align with the evidence of Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2012). This leads to an even
larger shortfall of in‡ation from its target.

the benchmark parameters. The alternative value of considered is taken from Eggertsson and
Woodford (2003). The stabilization properties of the model improve, but the time that the central
bank has to commit to staying at the ELB increases signi…cantly. In case of a more persistent shock

5        Imperfect Credibility
As noted in the FOMC minutes10 , the e¤ectiveness of a make-up strategy would depend on "the
private sector’s understanding of the strategy and on their con…dence that future policymakers would
follow through on promises to keep policy accommodative.” These concerns are ampli…ed in the
downturn of 2020. As noted in the minutes of the April 29, 2020 meeting, "Yields on nominal
Treasury securities declined across the maturity spectrum, with the 10- and 30-year yields ending the
period near all-time lows. A straight read of market quotes suggested that the expected federal funds
rate would remain under 25 basis points through 2022." In …gure 7, we show the term structure of
forward rates for the 2-, 5- and 10-year nominal yields for the July-December 2007 and January-April
2020 periods to illustrate the point that …nancial market expectations are of a prolonged period of
low interest rates.
    Now we turn to scenarios in which the central bank has more limited credibility, especially with
regard to policy commitments that extend over a multi-year timeframe.11 The challenge of imperfect
credibility has been readily apparent from the historical record on disin‡ationary episodes, Indeed,
as emphasized by the landmark study of Bernanke, Laubach, Mishkin, and Posen (2001), the mere
announcement of an in‡ation target had little or no e¤ect on actual in‡ation in several advanced
economies. In such cases, however, the central bank can start gaining credibility immediately by
  10
   FOMC Minutes, September 2019.
  11
   Previous studies of the implications of imperfect credibility for the design of monetary policy at the ELB include
Bodenstein, Hebden, and Nunes (2012), Walsh (2018), and Nakata and Sunakawa (2019).


                                                         19
tightening the stance of monetary policy at the start of the disin‡ation and then easing gradually as
actual and expected in‡ation move downwards towards the target.12
    By contrast, gaining credibility may be particularly di¢ cult when the economy undergoes a
persistent shortfall in aggregate demand that pins the nominal interest rate at the ELB over a
protracted period. In such circumstances, the central bank may emphasize its intention to follow a
“lower-for-longer” strategy once the ELB is no longer binding, but policymakers have no practical
means of earning credibility up-front by taking immediate action to demonstrate their commitment
to the strategy. Indeed, the commitment remains completely vacuous as long as the natural rate of
interest remains below the ELB and cannot be put into practice until the natural rate rises above
that threshold.
    In light of these considerations, we now analyze the optimal monetary policy when its credibility
depends on the length of time over which policy is pinned at the ELB. In particular, we assume that
the private sector perceives a risk that in any given period the central bank may renege on its prior
commitment and revert to a purely discretionary policy, that is, the central bank would simply adjust
the nominal interest rate in line with the natural rate of interest once the ELB was no longer binding.
For simplicity, we assume that the central bank’s commitment is fully credible once the ELB is no
longer a binding constraint, because from that point onwards the private sector can directly observe
that the “lower-for-longer” strategy is being implemented. It should also be noted that the central
bank is fully cognizant of its own imperfect credibility and takes that into account in formulating its
optimal policy strategy.
    The central bank is assumed to understand that the agents perceive it to have imperfect credibility.
From periods t = 0 to T 0 ; the agents assign a positive probability (1    ) to the central bank reneging
its commitment, and following the discretion solution. In this case, the loss function is minimized
with respect to:

                           xt = Mc              Et xt+1 + (1         ) Et xD
                                                                           t+1                      (15a)
                                           0                                            D
                                               it   !   Et     t+1   + (1        ) Et   t+1   rtn   (15b)
                                      0                                                 D
                             t   =        xt + M f      Et     t+1   + (1        ) Et   t+1         (15c)

The additional terms in the IS and aggregate supply equations corresponding to            and (1     )
indicate that the optimizing households only assign a probability of        that the central bank will
actually follow through on its commitment strategy. In the perfect credibility case above, = 1:
    The natural rate shock dissipates in period T 0 . In the following period, once the agents observe
that the central bank has maintained the the uncertainty about the central bank’s commitment to
its strategy of "lower for longer" is resolved.

      See Erceg and Levin (2003) and Bordo, Erceg, Levin, and Michaels (2018).


                                                               20
   From T 0 + 1 onwards, once the agents observes that the central bank has maintained the com-
mitment path, even after the natural rate shock has dissipated, the imperfect credibility is resolved.
Then, the relevant IS and aggregate supply equations are again given by (1a). Lift-o¤ from the
zero-lower bound is assumed to occur in some period T > T 0 + 1. In order to illustrate the model
implications arising from this formulation of imperfect credibility, we show the …rst order conditions
with respect to the output gap here, and the conditions with respect to in‡ation are noted in the
appendix:
   FOCs with respect to xt at t = T 0 + 1 :

              @L       T0                             T 0 +1                                            0
                  =         f2   1T 0   ( Mc )g +               2 xT 0 +1 + 2   1T 0 +1   2   2T 0 +1       =0
              @xt

   FOCs with respect to xt at t = T 0 + 2 :

              @L      T0                              T 0 +1                                            0
                  =         2    1T 0 +1   ( Mc ) +             2 xT 0 +2 + 2   1T 0 +2   2   2T 0 +2       =0
              @xt

As shown in the discretion solution (19) above, since the output gap and in‡ation variables are
functions of the exogenous natural rate, the terms corresponding to the discretion solution do not
appear in the FOCs.
    We calibrate the degree of imperfect credibility so that the probability of reneging is perceived to
be 2.5 percent in any given quarter. Thus, in our benchmark scenario where the ELB is binding for
about seven years, the private sector initially perceives 50=50 odds that the central bank will follow
through with its commitment to the “lower-for-longer”strategy. Those perceived odds rise gradually
over time as the central bank continues to reiterate its commitment and the time approaches when
the commitment will be implemented. This calibration seems broadly consistent with the concerns
‡agged in past FOMC discussions about the extent to which its composition evolves gradually over
time as a result of staggered terms, retirements, and other sources of turnover.
    As shown in …gure 9, the timing of lifto¤ from the ELB under imperfect credibility is roughly
similar to that implied by perfect credibility (as shown previously in …gure 6). Interestingly, the
deterioration in macroeconomic stabilization is most severe in the baseline model with rational ex-
pectations. As emphasized in various studies of the forward guidance puzzle, this model exhibits a
very strong feedback loop: when the nominal interest rate is pinned to the ELB, a decline in in‡ation
raises the ex ante real interest rate, which in turn exerts further downward pressure on real output
and in‡ation. Consequently, when faced with imperfect credibility, the central bank adopts a more
aggressive “lower-for-longer”strategy, inducing a huge economic boom that helps dampen the initial
downturn. In particular, the output gap initially plummets to around 20% and then rebounds to
around +10%, while in‡ation initially drops 5% below target and then surges 5% above target.

   Nonetheless, imperfect credibility induces a marked deterioration in macroeconomic stability,
regardless of the particular speci…cation of expectations formation. For example, in the speci…cation
of Angeletos and Lian (2018), the output gap drops sharply to around 15% and then exhibits a
sustained boom of around 5%, while in‡ation initially falls 2% below target and then overshoots the
target by 2% for several years.
   In table 3, we show the stabilization properties of the di¤erent model for varying degrees of
credibility. Relative to the benchmark case of       = 0:975, a lower value of 0:95 implies that the

probability of reneging rises to 5% in every quarter, so that after …ve years, the economy is only
placing a 35% probability on the central bank following through with its commitment. As can be
seen from the last row of table 4, the stabilization properties are markedly worse in terms of output
stabilization.

6     Model Uncertainty
As in most previous studies of monetary policy at the ELB, the foregoing analysis in this paper
has assumed that policymakers have a complete understanding of the true dynamic structure of the
economy, as captured by a speci…c macroeconomic model. Under this admittedly heroic assumption,
it is reasonably straightforward to determine the monetary policy strategy that provides optimal
stabilization outcomes in that particular model.
         Nonetheless, it has long been recognized that an appropriate monetary policy strategy should
provide robust performance in the face of model uncertainty; see McCallum (1988), Taylor (1993,
1999), and Hansen and Sargent (2001). That literature has underscored the pitfalls of policy strategies
that hinge on the accuracy of longer-horizon forecasts or that are …netuned to the characteristics of


                                                        24
a speci…c model.13
    To illustrate these considerations in the present context, we now focus on a particular aspect of
the NK model that is a subject of ongoing analysis and debate, namely, the speci…cation of the New
Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC). For the analysis shown in the previous …gures, we calibrated the
NKPC slope coe¢ cient using the estimate obtained by Amato and Laubach (2003). Now we consider
the possibility of an even ‡atter NKPC, with a slope coe¢ cient of 0:01 – a bit less than half the
slope of 0:024 in our baseline calibration. For simplicity, we conduct this analysis using the model of
Angeletos and Lian (2018), and we assume that the central bank’s policy strategy is fully transparent
and credible to the private sector. The results are shown in …gure 11.
    If the central bank knows that the NKPC is very ‡at (as denoted by the solid blue line in each
panel), then the optimal policy prescribes a protracted period of about nine years at the ELB, that
is, about two years longer than in the baseline calibration shown in …gure 6. That policy re‡ects
the fact that a ‡atter NKPC attenuates the feedback loop noted above, namely, a shift in the
output gap has muted e¤ects on in‡ation and hence induces a smaller movement in the real interest
rate. Consequently, this optimal policy is associated with a deeper recession of around 15%, a
more modest initial decline in in‡ation, and a shallow but highly persistent phase of overshooting
thereafter.
    Now we consider the scenario in which the NKPC actually has a relatively ‡at slope of 0:01 but
the central bank incorrectly formulates its “optimal”policy strategy based on a steeper slope of 0:024.
In e¤ect, the central bank’s strategy mistakenly embeds a relatively strong feedback loop between the
output gap, the in‡ation rate, and the real interest rate, and that misperception results in a dramatic
set of policy errors: the nominal interest rate remains at the ELB for nearly 50 quarters, inducing a
huge and persistent boom in which the output gap peaks at nearly 10%. The deviation from price
stability is somewhat milder due to the actual ‡atness of the NKPC; nonetheless, the in‡ation rate
is elevated by more than 1% above target for nearly a decade. This is shown in …gure 111.

      Note: These …gures show the responses of the Angeletos and Lian (2018) model, in response to a natural
rate shock, when there is uncertainty about the slope of the Phillips curve. The …gure shows the evolution
of the short nominal interest rate, output gap and in‡ation. Time periods are denoted in quarters. The
in‡ation rate is expressed in annual rates in percent; the interest rate and output gap are expressed in
percentage points.



    Of course, this exercise is merely illustrative, involving a single parameter in a small stylized NK
model. In practice, policymakers face a high degree of uncertainty not only about the determination
of in‡ation but about many other aspects of the economy. Indeed, the minutes of the September
2019 FOMC meeting indicate that a number of participants referred to the sta¤’s analysis of the
FRB/US model and highlighted “the need for more robustness analysis of simulation results along
several dimensions and for further comparison to other alternative strategies.”14

7    Conclusions
Surveys of professional forecasters have exhibited myopia at the early stages of the COVID-19 pan-
demic and the unprecedented dispersion of their recent forecasts of U.S. real GDP and unemployment.
Financial indicators and surveys both indicate that market participants have a high degree of cer-
tainty that short-term nominal interest rates will remain at the ELB for the next several years.
Consequently, forward guidance would have to refer to a much longer time horizon than in the past.
In this framework, we assess the performance of the optimal commitment strategy under a range of
assumptions about the degree of credibility. We …nd that imperfect credibility induces a signi…cant
deterioration in macroeconomic stability, regardless of the particular speci…cation of expectations for-
mation. Consequently, the net bene…ts of forward guidance are much more tenuous than in settings
with rational expectations and perfect credibility.

Appendix
We present the central bank’s problem under the discretion case.

Central Bank’s Problem under Discretion
In order to quantify the gains from its commitment strategy, we present the central bank’s problem
under the discretion case here. In this setting, the central bank chooses (xt ; t ; it ) each period to
minimize the function in (2) subject to the equations in (1a). The central bank takes private sector
expectations as given in the absence of commitment since it is only choosing the values of xt and t
for the current period. Then the central bank’s problem is reduced a series of static optimizations to
minimize:
                                           2      2
                                           t + xt + Ft+1
               P
               1
                     j
where Ft+1 =             Lt+1+j , subject to the IS and aggregate supply equations, taking expectations
               j=0
of future in‡ation as given. NK model is perfectly forward looking - ppolicy maker recognizes that
the choices xt and pit a¤ect the evolution of the problem, but the forward looking model ensures
that these do not enter the problem’s FOCs. The Lagrange multipliers for the IS and the aggregate
supply equations are 1t and 2t respectively. In this case, the implied …rst order conditions are:

                                      @L                                         0
                                           : 2 xt + 2 1t 2 2t                        =0          (16a)
                                      @xt
                                      @L
                                           : 2 t + 2 2t = 0                                      (16b)
                                      @ t
                                     it 1t = 0; it 0; 1t 0                                        (16c)

We note that for the case where 0 =      the …rst order conditions are isomorphic to those from CGG
(1999). The behavioral parameters Mc and Mf do not enter the conditions.
    Given the e¤ective lower bound constraint, the central bank’s problem can be considered in two
phases. Once the natural rate shock has dissipated, the economy enters the lift-o¤ phase in period
Td . Then from t = Td + 1 onwards, 1t = 0. Using the relevant …rst order conditions, the unique
solution is t = 0, xt = 0 and it = rtn :
    During the zero-lower bound phase, t       Td , it = 0. Imposing this condition in the IS and
aggregate supply curve, the solution is:
                                                     0          0                         0
                                          Mf +           !      Mc
                                 A =                               , and a =                      (17)
                                             !                  Mc
                                t          Et t+1
                                    = A            + artn                                         (18)
                               xt          Et xt+1
                                                                    0
Since the terminal condition at Td + 1 is: [     T +1 ; xT +1 ]         = [0; 0]0 ; we get
                                                     Td
                                             t       P          (j t 1)
                                                 =         A              arjn                    (19)

and Td is such that rTnd < 0, and rTnd +1   0: Thus, as for the standard rational expectations case,
the dynamics of in‡ation and output gap are determined by the exogenous natural rate process. The
stability of the system will be determined by the eigenvalues of the A matrix, and these will in turn
depend on the behavioral parameters, in addition to the other model parameters.
