How the Reformulation of OxyContin Ignited the Heroin Epidemic

JEL No. I1,I11

                                         ABSTRACT

We attribute the recent quadrupling of heroin death rates to the August, 2010 reformulation of an
oft-abused prescription opioid, OxyContin. The new abuse-deterrent formulation led many
consumers to substitute to an inexpensive alternative, heroin. Using structural break techniques
and variation in substitution risk, we find that opioid consumption stops rising in August, 2010,
heroin deaths begin climbing the following month, and growth in heroin deaths was greater in
areas with greater pre-reformulation access to heroin and opioids. The reformulation did not
generate a reduction in combined heroin and opioid mortality—each prevented opioid death was
replaced with a heroin death.

I.       Introduction
         Deaths from drug overdoses have steadily increased over the past 15 years and are now at
epidemic levels. Figure 1 shows the national death rate (deaths/100,000) for drug poisonings doubled
from 1999 to 2014. 1 Case and Deaton (2015) argued that this increase was an important contributor
to the unprecedented rise in all-cause mortality for middle-aged non-Hispanic whites. As seen in the
figure, the rise in deaths involving heroin or opioids can account for 75 percent of the overall increase
in deaths from drug poisonings. 2
         Opioids are narcotic pain relievers and are available, legally, only by prescription. When used
as directed, they are an important element of fighting acute and chronic pain. Starting in the mid-
1990s, medical groups argued there was an epidemic of untreated pain and urged for greater use of
opioid pain medicines, especially for those with chronic conditions. The efforts changed prescribing
practices considerably. Between 1991 and 2013, opioid prescriptions increased three-fold. 3 Opioids
are addictive and as their everyday use increased, so did abuse rates. The National Survey on Drug
Use and Health (NSDUH) estimates that in 2014, 4.3 million people aged 12 and over used pain
medicines non-medically (Centers for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2015).
         When taken in large quantities, opioids shut down the respiratory system and can lead to death.
In the bottom two lines of Figure 1, we report separate time series for heroin and opioid death rates. 4
Between 1999 and 2009, opioid death rates were rising rapidly but heroin death rates were much lower
and increasing slowly. In 2010, this changed; over the next four years, heroin death rates increased by
a factor of four while opioid death rates remained fairly flat.
         In this paper, we argue that the rapid rise in the heroin death rate since 2010 is largely due to
the reformulation of OxyContin, an opioid introduced in 1996. OxyContin became popular for
recreational use and abuse because the drug offered much more of the active ingredient, oxycodone,

  Data is taken from the CDC Wonder web page for multiple causes of death which is available here
https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D77. To identify drug poisonings, we use ICD10 codes suggested by
the CDC https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/pdf/pdo_guide_to_icd-9-cm_and_icd-10_codes-a.pdf which include:
Unintentional drugs poisonings (X40-X44) Self-harm and suicide drug poisonings (Xh60-X64), Assault/homicide drug
poisonings (X85), drug poisonings with an undetermined intent (Y10-Y14), drug poisonings that were contributing
causes of death (T36-T50). To ensure consistency across outcomes, we use SEER population data to create rates.
2
  Heroin deaths are identified by the ICD10 code T40.1 while opioid deaths are T40.2 (other opioids), T40.3
(methadone), and T40.4 (synthetic narcotics). Throughout the rest of the paper we will use opioid (heroin) poisoning
mortality and the opioid (heroin) death rate synonymously. Although heroin is an opioid, we use the term opioid to
refer to all opioids except heroin.

  Because multiple drugs can contribute to a single death, the heroin or opioid death rate is less than the sum of the two
individual series.

than other prescription opioids and the pills could easily be manipulated to access the entire store of
the active ingredient. In early August, 2010, the makers of OxyContin, Purdue Pharma, pulled the
existing drug from the market and replaced it with an abuse-deterrent formulation (ADF) that made
it difficult to abuse the drug in this fashion. This made the drug far less appealing to opioid abusers
and led many to shift to a readily-available and cheaper substitute: heroin.
            A large literature in the medical and public health fields has demonstrated that opioid abuse
rates in general, and OxyContin abuse rates in particular, have declined since reformulation (Severtson
et al., 2012; Severtson et al., 2013; Butler et al., 2013; Sessler et al., 2014; Havens et al., 2014; cassidy
et al., 2015; Larochelle et al., 2015; Coplan et al., 2016; Chilcoat et al., 2016). Most of this work uses
interrupted time-series analysis with annual or quarterly data and suggests that outcomes such as
OxyContin prescriptions, deaths from opioids, fatalities reported to the makers of OxyContin, calls
to poison control centers for opioids, and entrance into opioid treatment programs all have flatlined
since the third quarter of 2010. At the same time, there is an equally large literature that suggests there
has been a shift to heroin towards the end of 2010 (Coplan et al., 2013; Cicero et al., 2012; Cicero et
al., 2014; Cicero et al., 2015; and Compton et al., 2016). These papers point to evidence like our Figure
1 or analyze data from surveys of opioid users who have entered substance abuse treatment facilities.
            Our work begins with these findings and, using techniques from the well-established literature
on estimating structural breaks in time series models, 5 pinpoints the timing of the changes to the
reformulation of OxyContin. The results of these analyses are illustrated in Figure 2 where the solid,
black line displays the national, monthly heroin death rate. The vertical dotted line shows the month
that the analysis chose as the most likely month in which a trend break occurred. 6 For the heroin
death rate, this is the month immediately following the OxyContin reformulation. A number of
national time series including shipments of oxycodone (a proxy for consumption), prescriptions for
oxycodone, the fraction of people that use pain medicine recreationally, and health care encounters
for heroin poisonings all show a trend break in August, 2010 or immediately thereafter.
            Although we date the changes to the month following the reformulation of OxyContin, it is
possible that there was some other event in August, 2010 that led to the observed changes in the
heroin and opioid markets. First, we use our structural break analysis to show that none of the seven
other opioids that the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) tracks have a negative trend break
in the third quarter of 2010. This suggests that there was not a different shock at that time reducing

    The dotted line is the F-test on the null that there is no break. We discuss this in more detail later.
                                                                 2
the use of opioids more broadly. Second, we provide additional evidence in favor of the reformulation
causing the increase in heroin deaths that takes advantage of differences in the degree to which the
reformulation would have affected abusers’ home markets. In particular, we note that markets with
greater access to heroin and markets with higher rates of pre-reformulation opioid abuse are likely to
show more substitution away from opioids and towards heroin than markets with less access to heroin
or lower opioid abuse rates. We proxy for the former with whether a state is above or below the
median pre-reformulation per-capita heroin death rate and the latter with whether a state is above or
below the median pre-reformulation per-capita oxycodone consumption. Breaking states into four
groups based on these measures, we estimate pre-reformulation trends, post-reformulation trends,
and test whether there are trend breaks after August, 2010 for each of the groups. We find that the
heroin death rates increased substantially in all groups. In addition, we find that the trend breaks are
largest in states that appear ex-ante to be at the highest risk of substitution. These results are previewed
graphically in Figure 3 where we display the monthly heroin death rate from 2004 through 2014 for
the four groups of states. 7 While trends in heroin death rates are similar across the groups before the
reformulation, afterwards, the groups diverge and the states likely to be at the highest risk of
substitution, those above the median in both pre-reformulation measures, diverge the most.
         We also estimate the models outlined in the previous paragraph using opioid death rates as
well as the combined heroin or opioid death rate as the outcomes of interest. The results from these
models suggest that across all groups, opioid death rates were increasing rapidly before reformulation
but were flat afterwards. When we combine heroin and opioid deaths together, we find no evidence
that total heroin and opioid deaths fell at all after the reformulation—there appears to have been one-
for-one substitution of heroin deaths for opioid deaths. Thus it appears that the intent behind the
abuse-deterrent reformulation of OxyContin was completely undone by changes in consumer
behavior, reminiscent of the unintended consequences phenomenon pointed out in Peltzman (1975).
         Our results indicate the potential limitation of this type of supply response to the opioid
epidemic. As the abuse rates of pharmaceutical opioids have increased, governments at all levels have
looked for technological, medical, and legal solutions to this problem. One of the more popular
innovations has been the design of ADFs of drugs. Currently, there are seven drugs on the market
with ADFs, five of them opioids (FDA, 2016). As of September, 2014, there were 129 pharmaceutical



7
 There are gaps in the series because months in which there were fewer than 10 heroin deaths have been suppressed per
CDC reporting requirements.

products with an abuse-deterrent formulation in some stage of development. 8 The Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) has promoted the development of abuse-deterrent opioids to pharmaceutical
companies (FDA, 2015) and worked with manufacturers to bring these products to market as quickly
as possible (FDA, 2016).       Recently, the FDA listed the development of ADFs a national policy
priority, 9 five states have adopted laws requiring insurance companies to cover ADFs, and similar laws
have been proposed in 15 other states. 10 Despite the enthusiasm for ADFs, our results suggest that
the benefits of the reformulation are easily undone when there are readily-available substitutes.
        We also present evidence that a number of alternative explanations do not appear capable of
generating the patterns found in the data. The adoption of prescription drug monitoring programs
and the rise of the potent synthetic opioid fentanyl likely have important effects on the markets for
opioids and heroin, but do not seem to be the driving force behind the abrupt growth in heroin death
rates starting in 2010. We also explore the impacts of the crackdown on pill mills in Florida.
        Our work is most closely related to the concurrent work of Alpert, Powell, and Pacula
(forthcoming) who also examined the increase in heroin deaths. Using a panel of annual, state-level
data, the authors hypothesized that the switch to other narcotics after the reformulation of OxyContin
should be larger in states with higher pre-reformulation abuse rates of OxyContin. The authors
constructed a pre-reformulation measure of OxyContin abuse rates at the state level and interact that
with a dummy variable for the post-reformulation period. The authors found that outcomes such as
heroin death rates increased more after reformulation in states that had higher pre-reformulation
OxyContin abuse rates. Our work diverges from theirs in two important ways. First, our time-series
evidence is able to date the changes in the heroin and opioid markets to the month in which the
reformulation occurred. Second, we incorporate information about how developed an area’s heroin
market is, an important determinant of how much substitution will occur from opioids to heroin, and
show that the increase in heroin deaths entirely offsets reductions in opioid deaths in the short run.
        In the next section, we provide background on OxyContin and its reformulation and heroin
markets in the US. In Section III, we use time series techniques from macroeconomics to date regime
changes and identify August and September of 2010 as the turning points for five national time series
measuring heroin and oxycodone use and abuse. In section IV, we use a panel of monthly state-level

mortality rates to demonstrate that the increase in the heroin death rate was much higher in states
where the market for heroin was thicker or where there were higher levels of pre-reformulation use
of oxycodone. In section V, we consider alternative explanations for the rise in heroin death rates
and in Section VI we make some concluding remarks.


II.     Background on OxyContin and the Reformulation
A.      The Rise of OxyContin
        OxyContin is a name-brand opioid pain killer marketed by Purdue Pharma containing the
ingredient oxycodone, an opioid that has been in clinical use since 1917 (Kalso, 2005). OxyContin is
an extended-release formulation that allows for up to 12 hours of pain relief and hence there is typically
a high milligram (mg) content of oxycodone in the pills. 11 Since its release in 1996, OxyContin has
been one of the most successful pharmaceuticals of all time with worldwide sales totaling $35 billion. 12
        OxyContin was introduced at a time when the medical profession was re-evaluating its use of
opioid-based pain killers. Historically, opioids were reserved for those with acute pain, such as post-
surgical and cancer patients, but not for those with chronic pain conditions. This was viewed by many
as a failure of the medical profession. In the middle 1990s, a number of physicians began to argue for
much greater use of opioids for patients with chronic pain. In the 1995 presidential address of the
American Pain Society, James Campbell (1995) introduced the notion that pain is the “5th vital sign.”
In 1996, the American Pain Society and the American Academy of Pain released a consensus statement
outlining the need for greater opioid use, especially for chronic pain (Consensus Statement, 1997). In
2001, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organization introduced standards for
pain assessment and management in a variety of patient settings (Berry and Dahl, 2000) that focused
on the patient’s rights to appropriate pain care, encouraged hospitals to make pain evaluation a priority,
and introduced the use of pain scales. In 2006, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid began fielding
a 32-question post-discharge survey for Medicare inpatients that contained three questions asking if
the patient’s pain was adequately controlled during their hospital stay. A number of observers, most
notably the Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing, have argued that the Joint Committee
standards and the Medicare survey have encouraged “dangerous pain control practices, the endpoint

11
   We refer to OxyContin ER simply as OxyContin. According to the Physicians’ Desk Reference online, Percocet
(oxycodone with acetaminophen) contains anywhere from 2.5 to 10 mg of oxycodone per pill while OxyContin contains
10 to 80 mgs of active ingredient. http://www.pdr.net/full-prescribing-information/OxyContin-oxycodone-

of which is often the inappropriate provision of opioids.” 13,14 During this time, state medical boards
and state laws started to relax regulations about prescribing opioids to non-cancer patients (Alexander,
Frattaroli, and Gielen, 2015). It is not clear how each of these changes impacted prescribing practices,
but prescribing opioids for those in chronic pain was becoming acceptable if not encouraged.
         With the heightened concern about patient pain, pharmaceutical manufacturers started to
market opioids directly to physicians. A key message in many presentations was that the risks of
addiction were small when opioids were used appropriately.                       Purdue Pharma was particularly
aggressive at promoting this line of argument for OxyContin. Quinones (2015) and Van Zee (2009)
note that an important study used by Purdue Pharma in their advertising materials, Porter and Jick
(1980), reported that of “11,882 patients who received at least one narcotic preparation [opioid], there
were only four cases of reasonably well documented addiction in patients who had no history of
addiction.” This “study” was in actuality a 100-word letter to the editor in the New England Journal of
Medicine, the entire substance of which is contained in the quote above. When OxyContin was first
marketed in 1996, the FDA allowed Purdue Pharma to claim that addiction was rare if opioids were
legitimately used in the treatment of pain. By 2001, the FDA required that the label be modified to
reflect that data was not available to establish the true incidence rate of addiction (Van Zee, 2009). 15
         The effect of this panoply of changes was a massive increase in opioid use. Between 1996,
when OxyContin was released, and 2003, sales of OxyContin increased from $44.8 million to $1.5
billion per year (United States General Accounting Office, 2003). Between 1991 and 2011, opioid
prescriptions tripled from 76 to 211 million with oxycodone-based products representing a quarter of
these prescriptions in later years. 16


B.       The Reformulation of OxyContin and the Shift to Heroin
         Given its extended-release nature, OxyContin had a large amount of the active ingredient
oxycodone. When taken properly, OxyContin slowly releases oxycodone over the course of twelve

   In November of 2016, the CMS agreed to remove the pain questions from the HCAHPS survey.

15
   In 2007, Purdue Pharma paid $600 million in fines in Federal civil and criminal cases, acknowledging that “‘with the
intent to defraud and mislead’ it marketed and promoted OxyContin as a drug that was less addictive, less subject to
abuse and less likely to cause other narcotic side effects than other pain medications.”

hours. However, the extended-release properties could be circumvented by crushing the pill into a
fine powder that could then be snorted, smoked, or liquefied and injected. In this way, a person could
gain access to the full milligram content of oxycodone all at once and rapidly achieve an intense high.
        To help combat this abuse, Purdue Pharma developed an ADF of the drug. When the new
pills were crushed, they did not turn into a fine powder, but instead a gummy substance that was much
more difficult to snort or inject. 17 The ADF was approved by the FDA in April, 2010. It became the
first drug that was allowed to claim on its label that it had abuse-deterrent properties. Without any
public notice, Purdue Pharma ceased shipping the old OxyContin formulation on August 5th, 2010.
On August 9th, 2010, they began shipping exclusively their reformulated version (Butler et al., 2013).
        Coplan et al. (2016) note that although the formulation for OxyContin changed, its price did
not. We find evidence consistent with this claim in the Truven Marketscan Research Database
(Marketscan). This is a database of individual-level claims for inpatient, outpatient, and prescription
drug use that by the end of our sample period provided information for over 37 million covered clients
per month from 350 self-insured plans. 18 Figure 4 reports the monthly time series of the total price
and the price that patients pay out-of-pocket for oxycodone for 2006 through 2013. There is no large
change in either price series at the time of the reformulation and so it is unlikely that changes in the
legal price for oxycodone are driving substitution to heroin. 19
        Unfortunately, at the time of the reformulation, there was a readily-available and inexpensive
substitute for OxyContin: heroin. Historically, heroin markets were supplied by two different groups.
East of the Mississippi, users consumed white powder heroin that was usually distributed through
networks out of New York. West of the Mississippi, much of the supply was “black tar” heroin from
Mexico (DEA, 2016). Over the past 30 years, there has been an increasing supply of heroin from
Mexican gangs. Of confiscated heroin, 79 percent is now from Mexico (DEA, 2016). Many of the
Mexican suppliers compete for market share by offering higher quality heroin (Quinones, 2015).
When price is calculated per pure gram, this high quality has pushed the price down to very low levels.
Figure 5 shows the price of heroin from 1981 to 2012 in real 2012 dollars. 20 The price has fallen from

   The saw-tooth pattern in the out-of-pocket series is due to patient cost-sharing.
20
   This figure is based on data from DEA (2016).

more than $3,000 per pure gram in 1981 to less than $500 in 2012. 21 In Figure 6, we display a time
series of the number of heroin deaths per 1,000 heroin uses; this series combines quarterly estimates
of the number heroin uses in the past thirty days from the NSDUH with the CDC’s estimates of
heroin deaths. 22 This measure of drug quality shows that deaths per use of heroin was volatile, but
without trend in the pre-reformulation period. There is an uptick in heroin deaths per use starting in
2013 that the DEA suggests is due to suppliers mixing the drug with fentanyl (DEA, 2016), but this
was not a problem in the pre-reformulation period; we discuss this trend later in the paper.
         Mexican gang suppliers are not only gaining an increasing share of well-established markets
for heroin such as Baltimore, New York, Boston, and Washington DC, but they have moved
operations into suburban and rural areas as well (DEA, 2016). Groups like the Xalisco Boys have
transformed the supply of heroin to suburban and rural US markets. Within their distribution
network, independent “cells” within a city are operated by cell managers and each cell is supplied with
high-quality Mexican heroin by the cell’s owner. The cell manager employs a telephone operator who
receives orders and then relays those orders to the drivers. A driver meets the client at a designated
spot or delivers the drugs directly to the customer’s location. Each cell operates almost completely
independently and constantly cycles through lower level employees to help prevent detection by
authorities. This organizational form’s spread throughout the United States has greatly reduced the
costs to the consumer of obtaining heroin (Diaz-Briseno, 2010; Quinones, 2015). The DEA (2016)
notes that 30 years ago, the typical heroin user was an urban resident. Heroin use in the 1990s and
2000s has now “spread to users in suburban and rural areas, more affluent users, younger users, and
users of a wider range of ages. There is no longer a typical heroin user.” Entry into heroin use is now
much easier than it was in the 1970s when it was mostly an injected drug. Because of increased purity,
the drug can now be smoked or inhaled, decreasing the cost of drug initiation (Mars et al., 2014).
         The available literature suggests that the because of the easy availability of heroin, many
OxyContin abusers switched to heroin after the product reformulation. Interrupted time series data
indicates that outcomes such as deaths, poisonings, emergency room visits, and enrollments in
treatment programs from heroin abuse have all increased since August of 2010 (Coplan et al., 2013;


21
   Although there is a slight decrease in the price between 2010 and 2012, the elasticity of demand would have to be
greater in magnitude than 15 to generate the observed rise in heroin death rates.
22
   Heroin use is known to be significantly under-reported in self-report survey data (Harrell, 1997). Thus, the true
number of heroin deaths per 1,000 uses is likely higher. However, as long as this under-reporting is constant over time,
it will not affect the implication of Figure 6 that the purity of heroin did not significantly change when OxyContin was
reformulated.
                                                            8
Cicero et al., 2012; Cicero et al., 2014; Cicero et al., 2015; and Compton et al., 2016). The movement
to heroin from opioids is born out in survey data as well. In a survey of 244 people that entered drug
treatment programs for OxyContin abuse in the post-reformulation period, respondents were asked
how they dealt with reformulation (Cicero and Ellis, 2015). About one-third of respondents said they
reacted by switching to other drugs and about 70 percent of this group said the drug they switched to
was heroin. In the population of people that use pain medicine recreationally, few eventually moved
to heroin. Looking at data from the 3rd quarter of 2010 through the end of 2014 in the annual
NSDUH, among respondents that have used pain medicine recreationally over the past year, less than
1 percent said they ever used heroin. However, over the same period, 79 percent of people that used
heroin in the past 30 days report a younger age of initiation for recreational pain medicine use than
their initiation age for heroin.


III.       Dating the Timing of the Shift from Oxycodone to Heroin
           We draw on the time series literature on structural breaks to estimate when the changes in the
oxycodone and heroin markets occurred. For time period t and break period c, we estimate the
quadratic spline
(1) 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 = 𝛾𝛾 + 𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐 (1 − 𝐴𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡 )𝛽𝛽1 + 𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐2 (1 − 𝐴𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡 )𝛽𝛽2 + 𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐 𝐴𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡 𝛼𝛼1 + 𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐2 𝐴𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡 𝛼𝛼2 + 𝜀𝜀𝑡𝑡
where 𝐴𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡 =1 if 𝑡𝑡 ≥ 𝑐𝑐, 𝐴𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡 =0 if 𝑡𝑡 < 𝑐𝑐, and 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 is the outcome of interest. As originally suggested in
Quandt (1960), we find the period that is most likely to have had a trend break by varying c and
choosing the c that maximizes the F-statistic on the test of a break in trend (𝛽𝛽1 = 𝛼𝛼1 and 𝛽𝛽2 = 𝛼𝛼2 ).
In most series, the break visually occurs between 2009 and 2011 so we allow c to vary between the
start of 2009 to the end of 2011. Each of the figures that follows plots the time-series, the quadratic
spline fit to the time-series, the time period that is most likely to have had a trend break, and the F-
statistics for potential break dates near the maximum.
           Figure 7a shows quarterly data on milligrams of oxycodone per 1,000 individuals from the
DEA’s Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System (ARCOS). Within this system, drug
manufacturers and distributers report to the DEA controlled substance transactions from
manufactures to points of sale or distribution. 23 Many of the drugs tracked in ARCOS are opioids
and we use data from Report 3 that reports quarterly drug distributions for oxycodone in milligrams


23
  More information about the ARCOS data can be found at
https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/arcos/retail_drug_summary/2015/index.html
                                                                       9
of the active ingredient. We divide this by quarterly state population (x1,000) and include data from
the start of 2004 through the end of 2014 in the regressions. 24 As seen in the figure, oxycodone per
person was rising steadily until 2010. At that time, it stopped increasing and even fell somewhat over
the next four years. In Table 1, we present information about the sample and the results from
estimating equation (1). The data suggest that the third quarter of 2010 is the most likely date for a
trend break in oxycodone shipments. The F-test of equality for the pre and post trends is presented
and is larger than the critical value needed to reject the null hypothesis (Andrews, 1993). As seen in
Figure 7a, the F-statistics for nearby dates are considerably lower than the most likely break date.
         Figure 7b presents monthly data on milligrams of oxycodone prescribed per 1,000 subscribers
in the Marketscan data. Prescribed oxycodone per 1,000 subscribers shows a similar pattern to that
observed in the ARCOS data: it rises until 2010 and then levels off part way through the year. As seen
in the second row of Table 1, the most likely date for a break in trend was August, 2010 and we can
reject the null hypothesis of no break.
         Although the data are considerably noisier, we also test whether there was a trend break in the
fraction of individuals in the NSDUH who reported using pain medications recreationally in the past
thirty days. Figure 7c shows that this fraction was fairly flat between 2004 and 2010. The data suggest
that in the second quarter of 2010, recreational use of pain medications began to fall. However, as
seen in the third row of Table 1, we lack the statistical power to reject the null. Taken together, the
analyses indicate that oxycodone use broke sharply from its previous trend right as the reformulated
version of OxyContin was injected into the market.
         Figure 7d shows evidence from the Marketscan data that encounters for heroin poisonings
per 1,000 subscribers were relatively flat until September, 2010. At that time, they began to increase
sharply and continued their climb through the end of the sample. Table 1 reports the corresponding
regression results. The data suggest that the break occurred in September of 2010, but there is not
enough statistical power to formally reject the null.
         Finally, Figure 2 that we discussed in the introduction shows that monthly heroin deaths per
100,000 people were flat or increasing slightly from 2004 through 2010, but began to rise dramatically
in September of 2010 and continued to do so through the end of the sample in 2014. While a number


24
   The ARCOS data reports population by state, but an inspection of the data reveals errors for many observations.
Instead of using these data, we obtained annual state population estimates from the National Cancer Institute’s
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (https://seer.cancer.gov/popdata/). These data are only available
at the annual level. We assume population levels are recorded in the first period (e.g., quarter or month) of the year and
change linearly over time until the next period.
                                                           10
of other studies have shown that heroin deaths began increasing quickly in 2010, we are unaware of
any other studies that date the start of the rise so precisely. The final row of Table 1 shows strong
evidence of a break in trend and that it is most likely to have occurred in September of 2010.
            Thus far, the results indicate that the oxycodone and heroin markets were hit by shocks in
August and September of 2010. A natural falsification test is to check for reductions in the use of
other opioids in August, 2010. If changes in prescribing practices, or some other event, were reducing
opioid use, then we should expect these changes to be reflected in the seven other opioids in the
DEA’s ARCOS data. Past research suggests this was not the case, finding that the use of some other
opioids rose when OxyContin was reformulated (e.g. Cicero et al., 2012; Cassidy et al., 2014). We
repeat our trend break analysis for the other opioids in the AROCS data. As seen in Table 2, none of
the other opioids show a statistically significant, negative break in trend in the third quarter of 2010. 25
These results for other drugs suggest that there was not a change to the opioid market more generally,
but that the shock was specific to oxycodone and heroin.


IV.         Heterogeneity in the Impacts of the Reformulation
            The substitution of heroin for opioids is not likely to be the same in all areas. Areas where
heroin is more easily available or where there is pervasive abuse of oxycodone will probably see larger
shifts from opioids to heroin. We use two proxies for these types of conditions and assess whether
there was in fact a greater shift to heroin in places that appear to be at a greater risk for substitution.
This is similar in spirit to the work of Alpert, Powell, and Pacula (forthcoming) who use annual state-
level data on drug poisonings to demonstrate that the shift to heroin after the reformulation of
OxyContin was larger in states that had higher pre-reformulation recreational use of OxyContin. In
what follows, we first outline each measure individually and proceed to demonstrate that there appears
to be greater shifts to heroin after the reformulation in areas where we would expect greater
substitution.
            Our first measure is intended to capture the extent of oxycodone abuse in the period
immediately preceding the reformulation. Areas with greater abuse are more likely to have individuals
who substitute to heroin than areas where there is less oxycodone abuse. We use milligrams of
oxycodone/1,000 people shipped to states in 2008 and 2009, the two years preceding the
reformulation. This measure relies on areas where there is high oxycodone use also having high abuse.


25   Figures including the time-series and the most likely trend break dates are shown in Appendix C.
                                                             11
The correlation coefficient between the state-level opioid mortality rate for the 2008-2009 period and
the state-level milligrams of oxycodone shipped to the state per 1,000 people in 2008 and 2009 is 0.45.
         Based upon the distribution of states’ oxycodone shipments per 1,000 people, we divide states
into two groups: those above and below the median. As seen in Figure 8, areas with greater pre-
reformulation oxycodone shipments per-person also had higher rates of heroin deaths. This level
difference supports the validity of our proxy since some opioid users transitioned to heroin even
before the reformulation. 26 The two groups’ heroin death rates track each other extremely well right
up to the reformulation. However, as soon as the reformulation occurs, the two groups immediately
begin to diverge. States with above median per-capita oxycodone shipments saw their heroin death
rates rise from just under 0.1 to more than 0.4; the other states started at a slightly lower level, but
increased far less and did not surpass 0.25.
         Our second proxy is intended to measure the availability of heroin. In areas where it is costly
to find and purchase heroin, e.g. where the market for heroin is thin, the reformulation is not likely to
lead many people to substitute towards heroin; in areas where there is an active, thick heroin market,
it is more likely that a person could find a dealer and begin to use or increase heroin use. We measure
the availability of heroin using a state’s heroin death rate in the two years preceding the reformulation,
2008 and 2009. We assume that high heroin death rates indicate greater availability of the drug.
         We divide states into two categories according to their pre-reformulation heroin death rates.
The “low” risk group contains the states that were below the median of the distribution; the “high”
risk group contains states that were above the median of the distribution. Figure 9 plots the heroin
death rates from 2004 through 2014 for these groups. Prior to the reformulation, the groups’ heroin
death rates were different in levels, but followed similar trends. Both groups had flat heroin death
rates from 2004 through 2007; from there, both groups increased slightly before leveling off. After
the reformulation, the death rates increased, but at quite different rates. The high-risk group
experienced much greater increases in the death rate than the low-risk group.
         Although the raw figures suggest that places that are more likely to have been affected by the
reformulation saw larger increases in heroin death rates, the areas that are most likely to have been
affected are those that had both high pre-reformulation heroin death rates and high pre-reformulation
oxycodone use. At the same time, those least likely to be affected are those with low pre-reformulation


26
   Even in the pre-reformulation period, the majority of heroin users started as recreational pain medicine users. Using
data from 2004 through the second quarter of 2010 in the NSDUH, we calculate that 67 percent of heroin users that
started in the past two years had recreational pain medicine use that pre-dates their heroin use.
                                                           12
heroin death rates and low pre-reformulation oxycodone use. We pursue this by putting states into
one of the four groups that are created by the interaction of our two risk factors. To ease exposition,
we will refer to whether a state is above or below the median with “high” and “low” respectively and
the pre-reformulation oxycodone shipments rate as “Oxy.” The heroin death rates for these four
groups were shown earlier in Figure 3. Once reformulation occurs, every group experienced a
noticeable increase in its heroin death rate with the greatest change occurring in the states that had
both high oxycodone shipments as well as high heroin death rates before the reformulation.
           To formalize the analysis, we estimate trends and trend breaks for each of the groups based
upon our proxies. For the heroin death rate in state i in month t, 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , we estimate
                   4

(2) 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = � �(1 − 𝐴𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡 )𝑇𝑇(𝑗𝑗)𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐 𝛽𝛽𝑏𝑏𝑗𝑗 + 𝐴𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡 𝑇𝑇(𝑗𝑗)𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐 𝛽𝛽𝑎𝑎𝑗𝑗 � + 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝛾𝛾 + 𝜆𝜆𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
                 𝑗𝑗=1

where 𝐴𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡 and 𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐 are defined as before, 𝑇𝑇(𝑗𝑗) is a dummy variable indicating which group the state is
in, 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 are basic demographics including the fractions of individuals in a set of age bins (less than 20,
20-34, 35-49, 50+), in race bins, local economic conditions via the unemployment rate, a set of month
fixed effects, and a set of state fixed effects, 𝜆𝜆𝑖𝑖 . In these specifications, we impose that August, 2010
is the month of the break in trend. Standard errors are clustered at the state level. In the previous
models where we allowed for a quadratic trend, we use a linear model to simplify the statistical tests
and interpretations of the coefficients. The key hypotheses to test are whether there is a break in trend
for each state type, H o : β aj = βbj , and whether there is a difference in the trend breaks between the
low Oxy/low heroin death rate group (which we refer to as group 1) and the other three groups,
H o : ( β aj − β a1 ) = ( βbj − βb1 ) where j=2, 3, and 4.
           Data for this exercise come from the CDC Multiple Cause of Death database and range from
January, 2004 through December of 2014 for all states and the District of Columbia. The CDC
normally suppresses data when there are fewer than 10 deaths in a cell, a frequent occurrence for
monthly heroin deaths in small states. However, we obtained the restricted use microdata and so have
accurate counts for all states and months. We combine these heroin death data with the population
data referenced above to calculate heroin deaths per 100,000 people in the state and month.
           For our initial analysis, we restrict the sample to years before 2013 because individuals began
increasing their use of fentanyl, a deadly synthetic opioid, at that time. The regression results for
heroin death rates are shown in Panel A of Table 3. The first row presents the estimated trends for
each of the four groups—each group gets its own column—prior to the reformulation. In all cases,
                                                                       13
the point estimates are positive, but suggest relatively slow rates of growth. The second row suggests
that the trends after the reformulation are much larger. The third row of the table shows the estimated
trend breaks (the difference in trends, after minus before reformulation) and their standard errors. In
each case, the trend breaks are positive; in states with high exposure to oxycodone, we can reject the
null of no increase in growth at conventional levels of statistical significance. The point estimate for
the high Oxy/high heroin death rate trend break is 0.0049. It would have taken these states only one
and a half years to double the pre-reformulation heroin death rate of 0.083. In the final row of Panel
A, we present the difference between the column’s trend break and the trend break for the low
Oxy/low heroin group. Although our estimates suggest both the high Oxy/low heroin group and the
low Oxy/high heroin group saw larger trend breaks than the low Oxy/low heroin group, we lack the
statistical power to differentiate the impacts. The heroin death rate for the high Oxy/high heroin
group does show a statistically significantly larger trend break than the low Oxy/low heroin group.
       Even if the reformulation of OxyContin increased heroin deaths, it could still have reduced
the total death rate for heroin and opioids together if the reformulation encouraged some to quit
opioid use altogether. Panels B and C of Table 3 present the same analysis seen in Panel A, but for
opioid death rates and for deaths that involved opioids, heroin, or either of the two. As seen in the
third row of Panel B, the point estimates suggest that all of the groups experienced a reduction in the
opioid death rate and that the reduction was largest in the states with high oxycodone exposure and
low heroin exposure. Panel C presents the results for opioid and heroin rates together. For three of
the four groups, the combined heroin and opioid deaths rate grew more slowly after the reformulation.
In these areas, the reformulation may have been successful at reducing opioid and heroin deaths in
the short run. However, states with high exposure to both oxycodone and heroin did not experience
a reduction in combined mortality. If anything, they actually saw their combined death rates increase
slightly. We can reject the hypothesis that the break for the high Oxy/high heroin group is equal to
the trend break for the high Oxy/low heroin group (p=0.014). This suggests that the availability of
heroin might play an important role in the effectiveness of the reformulation in the short run.
   The results from panel C of Table 3 suggest that the reformulation had impacts on combined
heroin and opioid death rates, but only in some states. To estimate the overall impact, we perform a
trend break analysis on combined heroin and opioid death rates. Although the most likely date for a
break is estimated to be August, 2010, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no break because the
F-statistic is only 1.21. This implies that in the aggregate, we cannot reject one-for-one substitution
of heroin deaths for opioid deaths in the short run.
                                                  14
     Ruhm (2016) points out that 20-25 percent of drug poisoning deaths do not specify a particular
drug and that these “unspecified” deaths lead to noisy measurement of drug-specific death rates. He
suggests an adjustment procedure that assumes the distribution of unspecified deaths is similar to the
distribution among specified drug deaths. We use this procedure and re-estimate the basic models
reported in Table 3. The results for these new models are included in online Appendix A and in Table
A1. Once we make these adjustments, the difference in post and pre-reformulation trends is actually
larger in magnitude. The results also suggest that in the high Oxy/high heroin states, there is still no
change in the trend in combined heroin and opioid deaths as a result of reformulation.


V. Other Influences on the Heroin Epidemic
        There are a number of potential alternative explanations for the observed increase in heroin
deaths. As we saw earlier in Figures 4-6, changes in the price of oxycodone, or changes in the price
or lethality of heroin are unable to explain the changes in the oxycodone and heroin markets. In this
section, we discuss how the passage of prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) and the rise
of fentanyl are unable to explain the observed changes in the oxycodone and heroin markets. We also
provide evidence on the role that changes in the legal environment in Florida, one of the largest
oxycodone markets in the country, might have played.
        A potentially important change in recent years has been the adoption of state-level PDMPs,
which are databases of prescriptions that doctors have written for patients. By giving doctors,
pharmacists, and in some cases law enforcement officials, access to this information, patients might
have greater difficulty obtaining large amounts of prescription drugs that can be abused and doctors
might be more conscious of their prescribing. A large body of research has studied the impacts of
PDMPs on prescribing and come to mixed results. While some find that PDMPs reduce opioid
overdose deaths (Kilby, 2015), others find no effects on prescribing patterns or effects for a very
limited subset of PDMPs (Buchmueller and Carey, 2018). Figure 10 shows the heroin death rate
separately for states that had passed PDMPs prior to 2010 and those that passed a PDMP in 2010 or
later. 27 Death rates for states with a PDMP before 2010 and states with a PDMP in 2010 or later have
extremely similar heroin death rates over time. This suggests that PDMPs are unlikely to be causing
the abrupt rise in heroin death rates at the end of 2010. In addition, states began passing PDMPs in
2004 and have continued fairly steadily since then (National Alliance for Model State Drug Laws,

27
  The District of Columbia and Missouri had not passed a PDMP by the end of 2013. Consequently, they are excluded
from the figure.
                                                        15
2014). One was created in 2004, two in 2005, two in 2006, four in each of 2007, 2008, and 2009, two
in 2010, four in 2011, and so on. Although the timing does not rule out the possibility that the PDMPs
impacted opioid prescribing and heroin deaths, it does strongly suggest that the PDMPs are not
responsible for the sharp, nationwide increase in heroin deaths that began at the end of 2010.
           A second important change to the opioid and heroin markets is the rise of fentanyl, a synthetic
opioid 50 times stronger than heroin. It has been included in counterfeit oxycodone pills and used to
increase heroin’s potency in recent years. Beginning in 2013, the DEA noted an increase in fentanyl-
related deaths and has suggestive, but not definitive, evidence that fentanyl-laced heroin is distributed
by the Mexican gangs selling heroin (DEA, 2016). Anecdotal evidence in the documentary Death by
Fentanyl is consistent with the DEA’s suggestions; 28 in the documentary, an individual who exports
heroin to the United States from Sinaloa, Mexico claims that all of the heroin exported to the United
States is now laced with fentanyl. The solid black line in the middle of Figure 11 (left axis), shows that
there was a stark increase in synthetic opioid deaths, including fentanyl, starting towards the end of
2013. The bottom line of Figure 11 shows that of deaths that include a synthetic opioid, the fraction
that also include heroin (right axis) increases precipitously beginning in 2013 and the top line shows a
declining mix of synthetic opioids with other opioids (right axis). Because of this, we did not use data
from 2013 or later in the previous section.
           To assess whether the rise of fentanyl would alter our findings, we re-estimate our previous
specifications and include the data from 2013 forward. This approach is preferable to including all
years, but excluding synthetic opioid deaths because heroin laced with fentanyl might not be uniformly
distributed across the country. To the extent that it is correlated with increased demand for heroin—
states where demand has grown the fastest could be more likely to have fentanyl-laced heroin because
dealers might need to stretch their supply or increase its potency—comparisons of trend breaks would
be biased towards zero. The results are in Appendix Table C1. The estimated impacts of the
reformulation on death rates are very similar to those presented in Table 3 with two exceptions. When
the later years are included, the trend breaks for opioid death rates and combined heroin and opioid
death rates are slightly smaller in magnitude; it is less clear that the reformulation would have reduced
combined heroin and opioid death rates in the absence of well-developed heroin markets.
           Another important change to the markets for opioids and heroin was the crackdown on
Florida’s “pill mills.” During the 2000s, Florida medical laws allowed physicians to prescribe and


28

dispense pharmaceuticals from their offices. Given the changes in prescribing patterns outlined in
Section II, this institutional structure allowed for the proliferation of pain clinics throughout the state
where patients could meet with a physician, receive an opioid prescription, and depart the clinic with
the drug. By 2010, there were over 900 pain clinics across the state. 29 These clinics could dispense
any opioid, but OxyContin was a popular drug of choice. The ARCOS data discussed previously
indicate that in 2009, 25 percent of shipments of oxycodone were sent to the state of Florida. Johnson
et al. (2014) report that in 2010, 98 of the 100 doctors in the country who dispensed the highest
quantities of oxycodone from their offices were located in Florida.
        The Florida pill mills were a popular destination for out-of-state residents. Interstate 75 runs
from the Canadian border in Michigan through Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia and all the way
through Florida to Miami. This interstate came to be known as the “Oxy Express.” 30 The use of pill
mills by out-of-state residents is shown in the award-winning documentary The OxyContin Express, 31
was a plot line in various TV shows such as Justified, and was described in John Temple’s 2015 book
American Pain which details the rise and fall of the largest pill mill in Florida.
        Beginning in 2009, a series of Federal and state programs were started that were designed to
reduce the impact of Florida’s pill mills. A number of authors have documented with a variety of
methods that the negative outcomes associated with opioids in Florida began to decline after the
introduction of these efforts (Johnson et al., 2014; Delcher et al., 2015; Rutkow et al., 2015; Chang
et al., 2016; Kennedy-Hendricks et al., 2016; and Meinhofer, 2016). If the Florida pill mills were a
significant component of OxyContin supply throughout the country, then the crackdown could also
be responsible for the shift to heroin in a way similar to the reformulation of OxyContin.
        We investigate the pill mill hypothesis and find mixed evidence. We briefly summarize two
analyses that suggest the crackdown in Florida had little impact on the national increase in heroin
deaths and two that suggest it might have; the analyses can be found in Appendix B.
        First, in Appendix Table B1, we provide a timeline of the significant events in the pill mill
crackdown in Florida. As the dates in the table suggest, the majority and potentially most effective
components of the pill mill crackdown did not go into effect until the second half of 2011, well after
the shift to heroin occurred. Second, we graph the time series of oxycodone and the seven other
opioids available in the ARCOS data for Florida and all other states. There does not appear to have

been a reduction in any opioid in Florida starting in the third quarter of 2010 except for oxycodone
(see Appendix Figures B1a – B1h). In fact, there appears to have been slight increases in the use of
other opioids in Florida starting at that time. If the pill mill crackdown had been effective, then there
should likely have been reductions in all opioids that were being abused, not just oxycodone.
        We do however find some evidence that states that were more exposed to the Florida pill
mills, and thus are more likely to be affected by the crackdown, see differential changes in the
growth of their heroin death rates. Our primary approach is based on anecdotal evidence from The
OxyContin Express which suggests that individuals who traveled to Florida to obtain opioids for
distribution in their home states were also using opioids. Using the universe of emergency
department and hospital admissions in Florida from 2007 through the second quarter of 2010, for
each state of residence, we calculate the admissions per capita for people aged 18-64 in Florida due
to opioids (labeled as OPCs), the non-opioid per capita admissions for the same group (NOPCs),
and generate the ratio, OPCs/NOPCs. We then designate states in the highest third of the
distribution as being more exposed to Florida’s pill mills. Our procedure identifies all states served
by The OxyContin Express, five states contiguous to these states (Alabama, Indiana, North
Carolina, West Virginia, Pennsylvania), and six other states (Rhode Island, Maine, New Jersey,
Maryland, Mississippi and New York) as likely affected by Florida’s pill mills. It is worth noting that
the procedure suggests that no states west of the Mississippi are being served by Florida’s pill mills.
        In Figure 12, we graph the monthly heroin mortality for the states that are likely users of
Florida pill mills (black line) and all other states (grey line). The time trend for both series is very
similar prior to reformulation and both show a large change in slope starting near the August 2010
period. The increase in slope in the non-pill mill using states must be generated by some other
factor – a factor common to both sets of states. Fitting our quadratic spline through the monthly
data for the states unlikely to be pill mill users, the data suggests that the trend break occurs in
August of 2010. There is a noticeable break in trend for the pill mill states at the same period but
the trend break analysis suggests that the trend break occurs in October of 2011 – the month that all
components of the Florida pill mill crackdown law go into effect. This graph suggests that the
Florida reforms did not generate the initial shift to heroin but provides some evidence that the pill
mill crackdown in Florida also encouraged a shift to heroin.
        Because states without significant opioid use are less likely to have had large increases in
heroin death rates after an intervention that raises the price of opioid use, we turn our focus to states


                                                    18
with high levels of pre-reformulation oxycodone use. 32 We divide these states up into four groups
depending on whether they had high pre-reformulation access to heroin and whether or not they
were exposed to Florida’s pill mills. We estimate equation (2) with these groups and present the
results in Table 4. Among states with high heroin availability, those exposed to Florida are
estimated to have had a greater increase in the heroin death rate following August, 2010, though this
difference is not statistically significant (p = 0.156).
            In Appendix B, we also run regressions where we measure exposure to the pill mills with
physical distance to Florida. In these models, we do not find that states closer to Florida see larger
increases in their heroin death rates, though our point estimates are not precise enough to rule out
moderately-sized effects associated with distance.
            Overall, our results suggest that the precipitating event for the explosion of heroin deaths is
the reformulation of OxyContin. There is suggestive but not statistically significant evidence that the
pill mill crackdown in Florida appears to encourage more of a shift to heroin but only after October
2011 when the full set of reforms in Florida are in effect. That said, even in states that appear to have
little access to Florida pill mills, heroin mortality increased by a factor of 3.5 between August 2010
and the end of 2014, compared to a factor of 4.5 in pill mill access states. This indicates that at most,
the pill mill crackdown can explain 25 percent of the increase in heroin death rates in pill mill access
states between reformulation and the end of 2014.


VI. Conclusion
            Although past work has suggested that the abuse-deterrent formulation of OxyContin has
reduced opioid poisonings and mortality, our results suggest that some of these benefits may have
simply become costs related to heroin abuse. We provide quantitative evidence that the switch to the
ADF of OxyContin in August of 2010 led to the increase in the heroin death rate and we find that in
states that were at a high-risk of substitution from opioids to heroin, the reformulation did not reduce
the combined heroin and opioid death rate at all. This provides an important counterpoint to the
push for the development of ADFs of commonly-abused pharmaceuticals. There is a general
acknowledgement by the FDA that ADFs do not necessarily erase all abuse of the drug being
reformulated (FDA, 2016), but much less recognition of equilibrium effects, of individuals switching




32   The same analysis using all states is presented in Appendix Table B4.
                                                              19
to other readily available drugs. Our results call into question whether the promotion of ADFs is an
effective policy to reduce drug abuse and poisonings in the presence of close substitutes.
         The economic costs of the heroin and opioid abuse crisis are high. These costs include
increased medical care use, worker absenteeism, lost productivity, the direct costs of police
enforcement and interdiction, and of course, the lost earnings due to mortality. Therefore, a formal
cost-benefit of ADFs in this instance would need to take into consideration these other factors,
something we do not do in this paper. There are clearly some benefits of ADFs. As we noted above,
about 80 percent of heroin users moved from pain medicine abuse to heroin but it is the case that a
small minority of pain medicine users switch to heroin in any given period. At the end of our sample
period, there are about ten times as many abusers of pain medicine as heroin users. Looking at Figure
7c, there appear to be fewer opioid abusers now after the reformulation of OxyContin and given the
small number of heroin users in aggregate, it is the case that the total number of opioid or heroin
abusers is most likely lower now than before. That said, the costs of the opioid crisis seem to be
driven primarily by the costs associated with mortality. Inocencio et al. (2013) put the total costs at
$20.4 billion in 2011 dollars, but 89 percent of these costs, more than $18 billion, are due to lost
earnings from higher mortality. Although we do not do a formal cost-benefit analysis, the fact is that
Purdue Pharma’s abuse-deterrent formulation of OxyContin has not affected the vast majority of the
crisis’s costs thus far.
         An important caveat is that we are only able to examine short run impacts of the reformulation.
If the stock of opioid abusers is significantly reduced in the long run because of the introduction of
ADFs, then it is likely that the stock of heroin users will also be reduced in the long run. As a
consequence, even though there does not appear to be a reduction in total opioid and heroin deaths
due to the reformulation of OxyContin in the first five years after reform, there could be a reduction
in these death rates in the long run. However, a back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that in the
long run, the reformulation might only prevent a combined 120 opioid and heroin overdose deaths
per year. 33 In addition, if fentanyl continues to be mixed into heroin and the resulting increase in
lethality is maintained over the long run, then the mortality benefits from the reformulation will be
even smaller. Furthermore, the short run in this context could last many years. While some individuals


33
  Based upon data from the NSDUH and CDC, we estimate that recreational use of pain medications fell by 17 percent
from 2010 to 2014, that 0.15 percent of those using pain medications recreationally die from an opioid overdose in a
given year, that 0.5 percent of those using heroin die from an overdose in a given year, and that the fraction of
recreational pain medication users who transition to heroin in a given year is no more than ten percent (an upper bound
based).
                                                          20
die from heroin overdoses shortly after initiation, on average, deaths among heroin addicts occur
between 5 and 10 years after initiation of use (Ochoa et al., 2001; Darke and Hall, 2003). The transition
from the old to the new steady state induced by the reformulation may play out over a decade or more.
        Another important caveat to our work is that it is based on a single reformulation and so it
does not imply that all ADFs will be unsuccessful. Although we cannot reject one-for-one substitution
of heroin deaths for opioid deaths in the aggregate, combined heroin or opioid death rates did fall
after the reformulation in states that had high levels of pre-reformulation oxycodone use and relatively
little heroin availability. This suggests that the ease with which individuals may substitute to other,
similar drugs plays a key role in whether any given ADF will reduce overall drug abuse and mortality
in the short run.

Each row presents results from a different regression. Frequency indicates whether the time dimension of the data is in months (M) or
quarters (Q). Break point indicates the date at which there was a break in trend. F test/trends the same provides the F-statistic for the test of
whether there was a trend break at break point. λ is related to the fraction of the sample in which we are testing for a trend break and is used
to determine the relevant critical value taken from Andrews (1993), presented in the final row.

test/trends the same provides the F-statistic for the test of whether there was a trend break
at break point. λ is related to the fraction of the sample in which we are testing for a trend
break and is used to determine the relevant critical value taken from Andrews (1993),

       “How the Reformulation of OxyContin Ignited the Heroin Epidemic”

Appendix A: Correcting for “Unspecified” deaths
          Ruhm (2016) points out that 20-25 percent of drug poisoning deaths do not include any
specific drug mentioned and that these “unspecified” deaths lead to noisy measurement of drug-
specific death rates. In this appendix, we implement the adjustment procedure suggested in Ruhm
(2016), re-estimate our main regression results for the adjusted measures of death rates, and report
the results.
          The adjustment procedure is as follows; see Ruhm (2016) for more details. For each county-
year combination, calculate the fraction of drug poisoning deaths which do not have any specific
drugs mentioned; denote this fraction as unspecified. Let heroin deathict be an indicator for whether or
not individual death record i, in county c, in month t, mentioned heroin among the causes of death.
Estimate the probit model

where xict includes controls for gender, race, marital status, education level, age, day of the week, and
census division. Given the parameter estimates, create predicted probabilities in which sample values
are used for all variables except unspecifiedct, which is set equal to one. To get an adjusted heroin death
rate, add up the individual probabilities for each state and month-year and divide by the population.
We implement this process for heroin deaths, opioid deaths, and heroin or opioid deaths.
          We estimate equation (2) with these adjusted versions of the dependent variable and report
the results in Table B1. The magnitudes of the trend breaks are qualitatively similar to what we
found for the unadjusted death rates, though the magnitudes appear to be slightly larger. We now
estimate that growth in heroin death rates increased for each of our groups; opioid death rates fell
for three of the four groups (not the high Oxy/high heroin group); and combined heroin and opioid
death rates fell for all groups except for the high Oxy/high heroin group.

Appendix B: Assessing the Impacts of the Florida pill mill Crackdown
         It is easy to generate suggestive evidence that the pill mill crackdown worked. Most work
(e.g. Johnson et al., 2014; Delcher et al., 2015; Rutkow et al., 2015; Kennedy-Hendricks et al., 2016;
Chang et al., 2016) on the topic is some version of an interrupted time series analysis showing that
opioid poisoning deaths in Florida started to fall after 2010. In Figure B1a, we report quarterly
shipments of oxycodone in milligrams per 1,000 people for Florida and the rest of the US. By the
middle of 2010, per capita shipments to Florida were more than four times what they were in the
rest of the US. The time series in this graph shows a sharp decline in oxycodone shipments starting
in the third quarter of 2010. 34 Although the break in trend is greater for Florida than the rest of the
United States, both groups have highly statistically significant negative breaks (t-statistics greater
than 10).
         We investigate the pill mill hypothesis and find mixed support for its ability to explain the
national shift to heroin. First, the majority and potentially most effective components of the pill mill
crackdown did not go into effect until the second half of 2011, well after the shift to heroin
occurred. A comprehensive list of events related to the pill mill crackdown is presented in Table B1.
The crackdown was phased in over an extended period of time. In June of 2009, the Governor
signed legislation establishing a statewide Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP), a
networked database designed to give doctors and pharmacists the ability to see if patients had
multiple prescriptions for the same drug. The law was scheduled to go into effect in December of
2010. 35 The original PMDP plan is criticized by some because it gives doctors and pharmacists 15
days to enter a patient’s prescriptions in the database, proving little deterrent for patients willing to
visit multiple physicians in a short period for many prescriptions. 36 The PMDP however does not
go into effect when scheduled for a variety of reasons. First, there were insufficient funds for the
project. 37 Second, in December of 2010, incoming governor Rick Scott fires all of the full-time
employees of the governor’s Office of Drug Control, the agency that was responsible for the



34
   To test for trend breaks in the third quarter of 2010, we fit linear splines separately for Florida and for the rest of the
United States.

Buchmueller and Carey (2018) find that this phenomenon of doctor shopping is only prevented by PDMPs that require
physicians to access the information before prescribing opioids to the patient.

PDMP. 38 In January of 2011, the governor-elect shuts down the Office of Drug Control and using
administrative orders, freezes “all new regulations” which shelves the new standards for pain
clinics. 39
     In March of 2010, the Federal Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) executes raids on the largest
pain clinics in Florida. 40,41 In October of 2010, various components of the law passed in 2009 that
established the state PMDP went into effect: pain management clinics must register with the state,
they can only provide a three-day supply of drugs, they can no longer advertise, and they must open
their doors to inspection. 42, 43
     In July of 2011, Governor Scott signed into law HB 7095. 44 The law prohibits most physicians
from prescribing and dispensing prescriptions such as OxyContin from their office and fully funds
the PDMP for the first time. Florida’s PDMP becomes operational in September 45 and on October
17th, physicians can register on the PMDP for the first time. 46
     It is difficult to see what part of these legislative actions would be responsible for the abrupt
shift in shipments of oxycodone in the same quarter that the drug was reformulated. The most
aggressive components of the laws, those that barred doctors from dispensing opioids and funding
for the PDMP, did not go into effect until the third quarter of 2011. When discussing HB7095,
Florida’s then current Attorney General, Pam Biondi, a supporter of both the 2009 and 2011
legislation noted, “We had no tough laws in place; now we do.” 47
          Because customers of pill mills could get prescriptions for many different drugs, not just
OxyContin, we would expect that if the crackdown on pill mills had been effective, the use of many
different drugs would have declined. In Figures B1b through B1h, we report the milligrams of
shipments per 1,000 people for Florida and for the rest of the US for seven other pain killers:
hydrocodone, morphine, codeine, pentobarbytal, hydromorphone, oxymorphone, and fentanyl.

Note that for these seven drugs, before the reformulation, Florida tends to have much higher per
capita use than the rest of the US. This suggests that pill mills were facilitating access to other drugs
as well and could well be the reason that Florida is actually below the median in pre-reformulation
heroin death rates. However, there is no sharp decrease in drug use for any of these seven drugs.
More telling, however, is that the time series patterns of shipments for these other drugs look very
similar to what is happening in the rest of the US.
        Although we have stressed the substitution from oxycodone to heroin, past research
suggests that the reformulation led some to substitute to other prescription opioids (e.g. Cicero et
al., 2012; Cassidy et al., 2014). Both the introduction of an abuse-deterrent version of oxymorphone
(brand name Opana) and the rescheduling of hydrocodone from a class III drug to a class II drug
(leading to restrictions on the amount of the drug that could be prescribed in a single visit) appear to
have led to substitution to other opioids. As seen in Figure B2, there is an initial increase in
oxymorphone shipments to Florida after the third quarter of 2010. When oxymorphone was
reformulated to an ADF midway through the first quarter of 2012, oxymorphone shipments to
Florida dropped precipitously. When hydrocodone was rescheduled in the first quarter of 2014, and
likely less easy to obtain, codeine shipments increased. Because these other events appear to have
had important effects on the use of opioids in Florida in 2012 or later, it is less clear that the
crackdown on pill mills had much traction.
        Using the quarterly ARCOS data, we fit separate linear splines for Florida and the rest of the
US where we impose that the break occurs in the 3rd quarter of 2010. We report the results from
these regressions in Table B2. Each row contains regression results for a different drug and for each
drug we report the average of the dependent variable in the four-quarters prior to the third quarter
of 2010, the regression results for the splines pre and post reformulation for Florida and the rest of
the US, the R2, the p-values on the test of the hypotheses that the pre-reform trends are the same
between Florida and the rest of the US, the post-trends are the same, and finally the joint test.
        The results for oxycodone suggest there is a clear difference in trends after reformulation
with Florida having a massive decline in use. For the other seven drugs, we cannot reject the null
that Florida’s post-reform trend is the same as the rest of the US in five of seven cases. In the two
cases where we do reject, morphine and hydromorphone, use in Florida is a) substantially higher
pre-reformulation, and b) the post-reformulation trends in the rest of the US show much sharper
declines than in Florida, the opposite of what we’d expect if the pill mill crackdown were having
dramatic effects.
                                                    42
           Lastly, we test whether states that were more exposed to Florida’s pill mills experienced
greater increases in heroin death rates than states that were less exposed. We take two approaches
to estimating how exposed a state was to Florida’s pill mills. The first is described in the main text.
Second, we use distance from Florida as a proxy for whether or not a state was affected by Florida’s
pill mills; Hawaii is excluded from this analysis. For state s and month t, we estimate equations of
the form

where 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 is a linear time trend, 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 measures the break in trend starting in August, 2010,
𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑠𝑠 is a measure of how far away state s is from Florida, 𝑥𝑥𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 are basic demographics including
the fractions of individuals in a set of age bins (less than 20, 20-34, 35-49, 50+), in race bins, local
economic conditions via the unemployment rate, a set of month fixed effects, and 𝜆𝜆𝑠𝑠 is a set of state
fixed effects. The main coefficient of interest in this analysis is 𝛽𝛽2 because it indicates whether
states that were closer to Florida’s pill mills had differentially larger or smaller breaks in their heroin
growth rates. Table B3 presents the estimates of the pre-reformulation trend, the break in trend,
and each of those terms interacted with a distance measure. The point estimates on the interaction
terms are consistent with the hypothesis that states further from Florida had smaller increases in
heroin death rates, though we lack the statistical power to reject the null of no effect. The largest (in
magnitude) estimate would imply that the rise in heroin death rates was approximately 20 percent
lower in states 1,000 miles from Florida (average distance from Florida in the sample is 1.7 thousand
miles). Our findings are similar regardless of whether we measure distance between states as the
miles between the centroids of the states or the time it takes to drive from one state’s capital to
Florida’s capital as well as whether we interact the spline with a nonlinear (one over the distance) or
linear measure of distance.
           Taken together, our analyses of the crackdown on Florida’s pill mills in the main text and in
this appendix does not provide strong evidence that it was primarily responsible for the national
increase in the heroin death rate that began in 2010.

Dependent variables are all measured in milligrams per 1,000 people. All regressions include separate splines for Florida and for the rest of
the US. Standard errors are in parentheses and values are calculated assuming regression errors are correlated at the state level. Each
regression has quarterly data for 50 states and DC from 2004 through 2014 for a total of 2,244 observations. Other control variables are
state fixed-effects, month effects, the fraction of the population that is ≤19 years of age, 20-34 years of age, 35-40 years of age, 50 or more
years of age, the fraction black, the fraction some other race, the fraction Hispanic, and the monthly unemployment rate.

Dependent variable is heroin deaths per 100,000 people in the state and month. Standard errors
are in parentheses and values are calculated assuming regression errors are correlated at the state
level. Each regression has monthly data for 49 states and DC from 2004 through 2012 for a total
of 5,292 observations; columns that drop Alaska have 5,184 observations. Distance measure in
the first two columns is thousands of miles between the centroid of the state and the centroid of
Florida; in the second two columns, it is tens of hours of driving time between the centroids.
Panel A shows results when the distance measure is interacted with the trend and trend break
variables; Panel B shows results when one over the distance measure is interacted with the trend
and trend break variables. Other control variables are state fixed-effects, month effects, the
fraction of the population that is ≤19 years of age, 20-34 years of age, 35-50 years of age, 50 or
more years of age, the fraction black, the fraction some other race, the fraction Hispanic, and the
monthly unemployment rate.
