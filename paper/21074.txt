                                            ABSTRACT

The Producer Price Index (PPI) for the United States suggests that semiconductor prices have barely
been falling in recent years, a dramatic contrast from the rapid declines reported from the mid-1980s
to the early 2000s. This slowdown in the rate of decline is puzzling in light of evidence that the
performanceof microprocessor units (MPUs) has continued to improve at a rapid pace. Roughly
coincident withthe shift to slower price declines in the PPI, Intel — the leading producer of MPUs —
substantially changed its pricing behavior for these chips. As a result of this change, we argue that
the matched-model methodology used in the PPI for MPUs likely started to be biased in the mid-
2000s and that hedonic indexes can provide a more accurate measure of price change since then. Our
preferred hedonic index of MPU prices tracks the PPI closely through 2004. However, from 2004 to
2008, our preferred index fell faster than the PPI, and from 2008 to 2013 the gap widened further, with
our preferred index falling at an average annual rate of 43 percent, while the PPI declined at only an
8 percent rate. Given that MPUs currently represent about half of U.S. shipments of semiconductors,
this difference has important implications for gauging the rate of innovation in the semiconductor
sector.

1. Introduction

How fast are semiconductor prices falling? Data from the Producer Price Index (PPI) published

by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indicate that prices of microprocessor units (MPUs) have

barely been falling in recent years. This very slow rate of price decline stands in sharp contrast

to the rapid declines in MPU prices reported from the mid-1980s up to the early 2000s and the

exceptionally rapid declines in the latter half of the 1990s. If accurate, the apparent slowdown in

MPU price declines in recent years would be troubling, given the long-run relationship between

rates of price decline of semiconductors and the pace of innovation in that sector. 1

        A stalling out of innovation in this sector likely would have broader implications for the

economy, as semiconductors are an important general-purpose technology lying behind advances

of the digital revolution, including machine learning, robotics, big data, and massive

connectivity. 2 Given this connection, adverse developments in the semiconductor sector could

damp the growth potential of the overall economy. 3 On the other hand, if technological progress

and attendant price declines were to continue at a rapid pace, powerful incentives would be in

place for continued development and diffusion of new applications of this general-purpose

technology. Such applications could both enhance the economy’s growth potential and push

forward the ongoing automation that has generated concerns about job displacement. 4

        The apparent slowdown in the rate of price decline is puzzling given evidence that the

performance of MPUs continued to improve at a rapid pace after the mid-2000s. The key to

resolving the puzzle may reside in another development in the semiconductor industry. Roughly

coincident with the shift to a slower pace of price decline in the PPI, Intel — the leading MPU

producer — dramatically changed its pricing behavior. Prior to the mid-2000s, Intel generally

lowered the list prices of existing chips to remain competitive with newly-introduced chips on a

price-performance basis. However, after the mid-2000s, Intel shifted to a new paradigm in

which it largely kept the list prices of existing chips unchanged.

       This change in Intel's behavior could resolve the puzzling disconnect between continuing

improvements in MPU performance and the shift to slower price declines. Namely, we argue

that the matched-model methodology used by BLS is not well suited to capturing price trends in

a pricing regime like the one that has prevailed since the mid-2000s. In such a pricing regime, if

performance is improving over time, then matched-model price indexes for MPUs such as the

PPI likely are biased. We argue that a specific hedonic index ― one based on prices for newly-

introduced models ― is better suited to capturing price trends in these circumstances and

develop new hedonic indexes for quality-adjusted prices using price data for Intel MPUs from

2000 to 2013.

       Our preferred index of MPU prices tracks the PPI closely from 2000 to 2004. However,

from 2004 to 2008 — roughly the period of transition to Intel’s new pricing regime — our

preferred index fell faster than the PPI. And from 2008 to 2013, the gap widened further, with

our preferred index falling at an average annual rate of 43 percent, while the PPI declined at only

an 8 percent rate.

       An important innovation in the paper is that the hedonic regressions utilize measures of

MPU performance on typical tasks for computer users rather than technical variables capturing

physical characteristics (such as feature size) and engineering specifications (such as clock

speed). Performance measures provide a superior control for quality change when constructing




                                                -2-
price indexes for MPUs because they gauge the actual output obtained by a user rather than the

input characteristics used to produce that output. Moreover, with rapid changes in MPU

architecture in recent years, identifying the correct set of technical characteristics (and likely

changes in that set) could be challenging.

        To gauge whether our measure of user performance matters empirically, we also estimate

parallel hedonic regressions with technical characteristics as the controls for chip quality. The

price indexes generated by the two approaches are strikingly different after 2004. The declines

in the indexes based on technical characteristics slowed sharply from that point forward, much

like the PPI. After 2004, clock speed ― which had been highly correlated with user

performance ― stopped rising in response to problems with heat generation, but Intel continued

to boost performance in other ways. The hedonic regressions we estimated with technical

characteristics evidently cannot capture the ongoing gains in performance, which translates into

slower declines in constant-quality prices. This result highlights the importance of using direct

measures of performance when estimating hedonic price regressions.

        This paper focuses on MPUs rather than a broader set of semiconductor products, a

choice we made for several reasons. 5 First, MPUs are a large segment of the semiconductor

sector; in 2014, they represented about half of U.S. shipments (the scope of the PPI). Second,

price series for MPUs extend back to the mid-1980s, allowing for comparisons of price trends

over time. Given that price trends in this sector often are used to infer rates of technical

progress, this historical comparability is important. Finally, we believe that developments in

 Among all MPUs, this paper analyzes prices of the MPUs used in desktop personal computers (PCs), for which
data are the most readily available. In other work, we are developing indexes for MPUs going into servers, the types
of machines that would support cloud computing in server farms and other processor-intensive applications. In
addition, Dan Sichel’s undergraduate thesis student, Sophie (Liyang) Sun (2014) developed price indexes for MPUs
used in laptop computers.


                                                       -3-
MPU technology likely provide a rough guide to developments in other parts of the

semiconductor sector, such as the chips that are used in smartphones and tablets. 6

        Our work on MPU prices builds on important earlier research. Much prior work on

semiconductor prices relied on technical characteristics of the chips to control for quality.

Notable studies that have used this approach to construct hedonic price indexes for

semiconductors (or computing equipment that embeds these chips) include Cole et al. (1986),

Grimm (1998), and Flamm (2007).

        Although the technical characteristics used in these studies are correlated with

performance, they may not fully capture the capabilities of the processor for end users. For this

reason, Triplett (1989) and Berndt and Griliches (1993) called for analysis of computer prices

with controls for more refined measures of performance. 7 In this vein, Chwelos (2000 and 2003)

constructed hedonic price indexes for PCs with controls for the results of a suite of benchmark

performance tests. 8

        An alternative approach has been to measure semiconductor prices with matched-model

indexes. Aizcorbe, Corrado, and Doms (2003) found that under certain circumstances (highly

granular data on model prices and high-frequency observations), a matched-model index may

produce similar results to a hedonic index. Such highly granular data were used by the Federal

Reserve Board for its MPU price index through 2006, which was constructed as a matched-

model index. The source data used by the Fed were discontinued after 2006. However, even if


6
  The market for chips going into smartphones and tablets is changing rapidly, and it is challenging to obtain
consistent time series on prices and performance. That being said, the production processes and technologies are
similar enough to those for MPUs that developments in MPUs likely provide at least a rough gauge of developments
in these other types of chips.
7
  See pages 147 and 91, respectively.
8
  In addition, Holdway (2001) examined unit value MPU price indexes using benchmark test scores as a measure of
quality-adjusted units of computing power. Grimm (1998) developed specifications that controlled for millions of
instructions per second (MIPS); this measure of performance, however, has limited ability to account for differences
across MPUs in the translation of instructions into program execution.


                                                       -4-
those data were still available, the issues explored in this paper suggest that the matched-model

approach would be problematic for more recent years.

       This paper extends the existing literature in two main ways. First, we develop hedonic

price indexes for MPUs that control for quality with performance measures based on typical

tasks performed by end users. Second, we use these hedonic price indexes to assess the

possibility that the PPI has been understating the price declines for MPUs.

       The next section highlights the puzzle raised by the very slow rate of decline in the PPI

during recent years at the same time that the engineering frontier for MPUs continued to move

out rapidly. This section also discusses the change in the pricing pattern of Intel MPUs that

occurred in the mid-2000s. Section 3 presents our argument that hedonic price indexes are likely

to better capture price trends than are matched-model indexes (such as the PPI) since that

change. Section 4 reviews our data, which cover the period from 2000 to 2013. In section 5, we

describe the hedonic regressions used to obtain measures of quality-adjusted prices. Section 6

presents our results, and section 7 concludes.



2. The Puzzle

As noted, the PPI for MPUs has fallen very slowly in recent years. This section explores the

plausibility of this extreme slowdown from two different perspectives. The first perspective is

whether the slowdown meshes with the trends in technological advance for MPU chips. The

second perspective focuses on the changes that occurred in Intel's pricing patterns for MPUs,

developments that, as we show below, have important implications for price index measurement.




                                                 -5-
        Technology cycles and chip performance. 9 The standard definition of a semiconductor

technology cycle is the amount of time required to achieve a 30 percent reduction in the width of

the smallest feature on a chip. Because chips are rectangular, a 30 percent reduction in both the

horizontal and vertical directions implies about a 50 percent reduction (0.7*0.7) in the area

required for the smallest chip component. As documented in Byrne, Oliner, and Sichel (2013),

the semiconductor industry has achieved massive reductions in scaling over time. Indeed, the

area occupied by a chip component in 2012 was roughly 200,000 times smaller than in 1969.

        There is a broad consensus that the pace of technical advance in the semiconductor

industry sped up in the mid-1990s, a development first brought to the attention of economists by

Jorgenson (2001). Table 1 reports the average length of the semiconductor technology cycle (as

defined above) for various periods. For the industry as a whole, the technology cycle averaged

three years until 1993 and then dropped to about two years from 1993 to 2012. Within the later

period, the scaling advances were especially rapid from 1993 to 2003 and a bit slower after 2003.

Even so, the average cycle since 2003 has remained substantially shorter than the three-year

cycle in effect before the 1990s. For Intel's MPU chips, there has been no pullback at all from

the two-year cycle. The upshot is that the cycles in semiconductor technology ― a key driver of

quality improvement in IT products ― have remained rapid. 10

        While the pace of miniaturization has been sustained, semiconductor producers have

changed the approach used to translate these engineering gains into faster performance.

Historically, each new generation of technology in semiconductors allowed for an increase in the

directly from that paper.
10
   These continuous increases in chip density are the force behind Moore's Law, which states that the number of
components on leading-edge chips will double every two years. Moore's original formulation (Moore, 1965) pegged
the doubling time at only one year, but in 1975 he revised the period to be two years based on the actual experience
to that point (Intel Corporation, 2005). For a discussion of the outlook for Moore's Law, see Bauer, Veira, and Weig
(2013).


                                                       -6-
number of basic calculations performed per second (clock speed) for a given chip design.

However, as speed continued to increase, dissipating the generated heat became problematic. In

response, Intel shifted away in the early to mid-2000s from increases in clock speed and boosted

performance instead by placing multiple copies of the core architecture on each chip — a change

enabled by smaller feature size — and by improving the design of those cores. 11

        How did this strategy shift affect the rate of increase in performance for end users? For

the period through 2008, Pillai (2013) addressed this question with performance scores from the

Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC). 12 These scores are based on standard

tasks designed to reflect the needs of computer users. Figure 1 extends Pillai’s analysis through

2013, plotting average SPEC performance measures for MPUs introduced each year. 13 Starting

in 2004, the figure includes a second SPEC performance measure (the "rate" score) that

incorporates more fully the performance gain from using multiple cores than does the standard

("speed") measure. 14

        Figure 1 confirms Pillai's finding that MPU performance gains cooled around 2001 from

the extraordinary pace in the 1990s, though the rate of advance has, nonetheless, remained

substantial through 2013. Using the SPEC rate measure that accounts more completely for the

effects of parallel processing, SPEC performance rose about 32 percent per year on average from

2000 to 2013, down from the 60 percent rate of improvement from 1990 to 2000 and the 36

percent pace over the earlier 1971-90 period (not shown). The figure also plots clock speed for

Intel desktop MPU chips introduced in that year. Details are provided in section 4 and in appendix A.

Intel desktop MPUs, highlighting that performance continued to improve even as clock speed

stalled out in the early to mid-2000s. 15

        Historically, improvements in the engineering frontier have translated into steep declines

in MPU prices. Figure 2 shows the annual price declines back to 1986, splicing together

estimates from Grimm (1998) through 1992, the Federal Reserve Board for 1993-97, and the PPI

for later years. Over this period, MPU prices fell at an average rate of nearly 30 percent per year,

with especially sharp drops in the second half of the 1990s. However, reported price declines

have slowed dramatically over the past several years. Indeed, the declines in each year since

2010 were smaller than in any prior year back to 1986, breaking the link with the continued

engineering improvements. Perhaps the cost of achieving these engineering advances has

accelerated in recent years. If that were the case, we might expect to see a similar price pattern

for other types of semiconductor chips. No such pattern, though, is evident for memory chips

(DRAMs). 16 As shown in figure 3, DRAM prices have been quite volatile from year to year,

with no clear trend toward slower declines. At least for DRAMs, then, the translation of the

engineering frontier to prices does not appear to have changed.

        All in all, the shift to much slower price declines for microprocessors in the PPI is a

puzzle in light of the continued substantial improvements on the engineering front. We next

consider the possibility that changes in the properties of Intel’s posted prices after 2006 could

have distorted the measurement of price trends in the PPI.




15
   During the first half of the 1990s, performance also increased more rapidly than did clock speed. Hennessy and
Patterson (2012) discuss this pattern; see the note to their figure 1.11.
16
   The most important driver of DRAM performance is the size of the components on the chip, which has continued
to shrink rapidly, as discussed above. See Flamm (1993) for a discussion of characteristics of DRAM chips.


                                                      -8-
        Intel's pricing behavior and market position. Between 2003 and 2006, the properties of

Intel’s posted prices for MPU chips changed dramatically. 17 Prior to 2003, the price of a specific

Intel MPU model tended to drop fairly rapidly in the year or two following its introduction,

especially once a new, higher performance model became available. By 2006, this pattern had

completely changed; the posted price of a specific model tended to remain constant, even after a

new, higher performance model became available at a similar price.

        Figure 4 illustrates this shift in pricing behavior. The upper panel shows Intel wholesale

list prices for all desktop models during 2000-01, while the lower panel shows the analogous list

prices for all desktop models during 2011-12. The difference between the two panels is stark. In

the early period, prices fell steeply over a model’s lifecycle. However, by 2011-12, the price

paths are flat or nearly so, with only a few instances of sizable price declines. Figure 5

summarizes this change in life-cycle pricing over the entire 2000-12 period by showing the share

of all Intel desktop MPU models introduced in each year that experienced a price decline within

four quarters of introduction. 18 As can be seen, every model introduced in 2000 and 2001 had at

least one such price cut. But the share then dropped to about 60 percent for the 2004 to 2009

cohorts and took another leg down thereafter, falling to roughly 10 percent for the 2012 cohort.

        This shift took place against the backdrop of a changing competitive environment vis-a-

vis AMD, Intel’s primary challenger in the MPU market. Figure 6 plots Intel's annual revenue

from all products (not only MPUs) as a share of Intel's and AMD's combined revenue. Over this

20-year period, Intel's revenue share ranged from just under 80 percent to slightly above 90

percent. In 2002 and 2003, Intel's share stood at the top of this range but then eroded


17
   While the BLS does not indicate which companies’ prices are included in the PPI for MPUs, it is only reasonable
to assume that Intel is included given its dominant market position. Moreover, it appears that BLS has been making
at least some use of Intel’s posted prices for MPUs (see Holdway, 2001).
18
   The price data in the figure are described in section 4.


                                                      -9-
significantly through 2006. Nosko (2010) also documented this share erosion, noting that from

2002 to 2006, AMD "consistently released products whose price/performance characteristics

were similar to or beat Intel's" (p. 8). Documents from legal actions against Intel for alleged

antitrust violations (see, for example, State of New York v. Intel Corporation, 2009) also provide

evidence that Intel was concerned about its losses of market share to AMD during this period.

         However, in 2006, Intel began to turn the corner by offering new MPUs that dominated

those sold by AMD (see Nosko, 2010, for details) and subsequently pulled ahead of AMD in a

decisive way, consistent with the recovery in Intel's overall revenue share. By 2013, Intel's

dominance had reached the point that AMD effectively had been relegated to the bottom end of

the MPU market. Indeed, as shown in figure 7, AMD received more than 85 percent of its MPU

revenue from chips that sold for less than $75, the low-end part of the market where Intel derived

only about 15 percent of its revenue. Conversely, Intel received almost 30 percent of its MPU

revenue from chips that sold for $200 or more, a segment in which AMD earned no revenue. 19

         This evidence indicates that Intel has enhanced its position in the MPU market since

2006. With less competition from AMD, Intel has greater scope to manage its price structure. 20

By keeping list prices essentially fixed over a chip's life cycle, Intel may be attempting to extract

more revenue from price-insensitive buyers while offering discounts on a case-by-case basis to

other customers. Such price discrimination could reduce the information content of its posted

list prices, potentially biasing the quality-adjusted indexes generated from these prices. The next


19
   Figure 7 slightly overstates the market separation between Intel and AMD for the following reason. The source
data used to construct the figure show the average selling prices for distinct product families (Intel's Core i5 Duo, for
example) rather than prices for individual chips. Within each product family, there is some amount of unobserved
price variation. The average selling price for AMD's most expensive product family, the FX-8, was less than $200
in 2013, but two chips in this family (the FX-9590 and the FX-9370) were priced between $200 and $500 at
introduction in July 2013 (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_AMD_FX_microprocessors). These isolated
cases do not affect the general point that Intel dominates the high end of the MPU market.

pricing environment.


3. Constructing MPU Price Indexes

As noted, the changes in the pattern of Intel’s posted MPU prices raise important questions for

price measurement. Can a matched-model index correctly capture price trends given Intel’s new

pricing regime? If not, what approach to price measurement is likely to deliver estimates that

are most robust to possible measurement error in prices? Finally, in an environment with rapid

gains in MPU performance and changes in chip architecture, what are the best ways to measure

quality change for MPUs?

       In this section, we investigate these questions and make the case that — given the new

pricing regime for MPUs that emerged in the mid-2000s — hedonic indexes are preferable to

matched-model indexes. In addition, we argue that, given possible measurement error and

current limitations on data availability, hedonic regressions that rely only on prices in the period

of a model’s introduction are likely to be more robust than hedonic regressions that include

prices over a chip's entire life cycle. We also argue that hedonic indexes using actual measures

of performance have important advantages over those using variables capturing physical

characteristics of MPUs.

       Matched-model or hedonic? To fix ideas, we briefly describe the matched-model and

hedonic approaches to price measurement (see Aizcorbe, 2014, for a recent, in-depth treatment

of this topic). Matched-model indexes control for quality change between two periods, say

period 0 and period 1, by averaging price changes for models that were in the market in both

periods. The underlying idea is to measure “pure” (or quality-adjusted) price change for products

whose quality did not change because they were in the market in both periods 0 and 1.



                                               - 11 -
       Hedonic price indexes identify “pure” price change by explicitly controlling for quality

change with measures of product characteristics or performance. The hedonic approach

regresses prices on these measures, with the price change left after controlling for quality taken

to be the quality-adjusted price change. Many alternative specifications have been proposed for

hedonic regressions. Perhaps the simplest is to include time dummy variables (time fixed

effects) in the hedonic regression and to read off quality-adjusted price change from the

coefficients on the time dummies. (We discuss in section 5 our preferred specification for the

new price indexes in this paper.)

        To illustrate why we prefer hedonic over matched-model indexes for MPUs, we use

stylized examples of Intel’s pricing behavior to highlight the implications of the shift in

behavior. Panel A of figure 8 illustrates the pricing pattern for Intel MPUs prior to the mid-

2000s in which the price of each MPU model falls as it ages; this panel is a stylized version of

the actual price cascade for 2000-01 shown previously. When a new, higher-quality model is

introduced, the price of the old model falls so that price per unit of quality is at least roughly

equalized across models. In this case, the gap between model prices in periods when two models

are in the market would represent the value of improved quality, and a matched-model index

would correctly adjust for this quality change.

       Panel B shows a scenario in which prices of incumbent models do not fall when new,

higher-quality models are introduced — a stylized version of the actual price cascade we

presented for 2011-12. Given the upward trend in chip quality, price per unit of quality in panel

B is falling as new models are introduced. However, a matched-model index would indicate that

quality-adjusted prices are constant because the price of each model stays the same as it ages.

Thus, a matched-model index would give a biased read of trends in quality-adjusted prices.




                                                - 12 -
       In contrast, a hedonic index that used appropriate measures of quality would correctly

capture price trends even in the scenario in Panel B. In that scenario, prices are not changing,

but the quality measure in the hedonic regression would account for the improvement in price-

performance ratios when new models are introduced, and a hedonic index would show a

downtrend in quality-adjusted prices reflecting the decline in price per unit of quality.

       These scenarios illustrate why we believe that matched-model indexes will generate

biased price trends in the period following the shift in Intel’s pricing behavior, and why we

believe that hedonic indexes are more likely to correctly capture price trends for MPUs.

       Introduction-period or full-sample hedonic regressions? A natural starting point would

be to assume that hedonic regressions should be estimated using all available data. However,

under certain circumstances, a full-sample regression can lead to biased estimates of price

change. For example, in the 1980s some researchers constructed price indexes for mainframe

computers using only introduction-period prices for each model. This choice was made because

of concerns that available IBM list prices for older models might not be actual transaction prices

(see Cole et al., 1986).

       We believe a similar concern may apply to MPUs. To explain why, we consider two

possible explanations for what lies behind the pricing pattern adopted by Intel in the mid-2000s.

Panel C of figure 8 shows a stylized scenario in which prices of older models are measured with

error. Specifically, posted list prices in this scenario do not represent true transactions prices

because Intel offers “age-related discounts” to selected purchasers as models age. In this

scenario, new models enter the market at the same list price that exiting models leave the market,

just as in panel B. We now add the dashed lines, which show actual transaction prices. These




                                                - 13 -
lines slope downward, as progressively larger discounts are offered on older models as newer,

higher performance models become available.

         In the age-related discounting scenario, a full-sample hedonic index based on observable

posted prices would go astray because the posted prices are measured with error. The actual

transaction prices of each model are falling over time but a full-sample hedonic index would not

account for this measurement error, leading to biased estimates of quality-adjusted price change.

         In contrast, the introduction-period hedonic index could correctly capture trends in

quality-adjusted prices if age-related discounts were offered as in panel C. 21 In particular, the

introduction-period hedonic would omit observations in which prices were measured with error,

and the performance variables in the regression would control for improvements in quality in

successive periods.

         Panel D highlights another scenario (“Drop-off in volume”) that also could create

challenges for a full-sample hedonic index. In this scenario, posted prices do not change, but in

contrast to panel C, we assume they represent actual transaction prices. With this pricing

assumption, the quantity purchased of a model drops off as it ages and faces competition from

newer, more powerful models with lower prices per unit of quality. The solid, heavier line

represents the early, high-quantity part of each model’s life cycle and the thinner line represents

the later part when sales have dropped. If model-level data on shipments or sales were available,

a shipments- or sales-weighted index would account for the declining importance of the older

model. However, model-level quantity data are not readily available. Accordingly, we (and

other researchers) are forced to consider price indexes that put equal weight on every

observation.

21
  The introduction-period index would capture price trends even if list prices at the time of introduction do not
represent actual transactions prices provided that discounts at the time of introduction do not vary systematically
over time or across models.


                                                        - 14 -
       In the scenario illustrated in panel D, an unweighted full-sample hedonic index would put

too much weight on price observations for which there were few transactions. In contrast, an

unweighted introduction-period hedonic index likely would do a better job of capturing the trend

in quality-adjusted prices. By focusing on prices at the beginning of each model’s life-cycle, a

regression that applies equal weights to all observations avoids over-weighting models whose

quantities have dropped off.

       For the reasons described here, we emphasize introduction-period hedonic indexes,

although we also report full-sample indexes. Our preference does not reflect a belief that

introduction-period indexes are inherently better, but rather the view that introduction-period

indexes are likely to be more robust to the data limitations that hamper efforts to estimate recent

trends in quality-adjusted MPU prices. In particular, we believe that an introduction-period

hedonic will be more robust to measurement error in list prices (the age-related discount

scenario) and to a lack of model-level shipments data that prevents the use of weighted

regressions (the drop-off in volume scenario).

       Performance measures or physical characteristics in hedonic regressions? A long-

recognized challenge facing hedonic methods has been the choice of variables to include in the

regression to control for quality. The typical approach has been to include measures of key

physical characteristics of each model, in the belief that these characteristics will serve as a

proxy for what purchasers value. This approach has raised concerns in the past, and researchers

have called for the inclusion of actual performance measures rather than physical characteristics

(see Triplett, 1989, and Berndt and Griliches, 1993). The underlying logic behind using

performance measures is to focus on the output received by users rather than the input

characteristics used to generate that output. For many products, measures of performance are




                                                 - 15 -
unavailable so there is little choice but to use characteristics. For MPUs, however, measures of

performance — specifically for the types of tasks actually undertaken by users — are available

as described above. Moreover, specifying an appropriate hedonic regression and finding suitable

data can be difficult for a rapidly evolving product, and using directly measured performance

helps to address this problem.

        Accordingly, in this paper, we develop hedonic indexes with performance measures from

SPEC that avoid the difficulties entailed in trying to capture quality for MPUs with rapidly

changing architecture by identifying relevant physical characteristics. Our preferred

performance metrics are described in detail in the next section.


4. Data

        Prices and SPEC scores. Our MPU prices are collected from publicly available Intel

price lists for the period from 1999 to 2013. 22 Intel announces wholesale list prices several times

a year for MPUs sold in multiples of 1,000. Unlike single units sold in retail channels, these

“trays” of MPUs do not include a cooling system and carry a shorter warranty. Models are

identified by family (for example, Core i7, Pentium, Core 2 Duo), model ID (for example, i7-

4960X), and selected technical characteristics (for example, amount of cache memory or clock

speed). We merged these price lists to create price data at a quarterly frequency. We restrict our

attention to the 373 MPU models for desktop computer systems introduced between 2000 and

2013.

          To measure the relative quality of different chips we use the performance scores from

SPEC that were mentioned in section 2. (These benchmark tests are described in detail in


22
  Price lists for the period from April 1999 to December 2006 were collected from an archived version of a website
devoted to computer hardware. Price lists for later dates were obtained directly from Intel’s website. On dates when
both sources were available, we confirmed that the website prices matched Intel price lists.

appendix A.) Briefly, SPEC scores evaluate performance of an MPU on individual tasks that

rely heavily on integer computation (such as word processing) and on tasks that rely heavily on

floating point computation (such as speech recognition). Scores for individual tasks are

measured in seconds, although SPEC rescales these scores so that higher scores indicate better

performance and the units are no longer in seconds. SPEC provides an overall score both for

integer and for floating-point computation, which are calculated as geometric means of scores for

12 integer computation tasks and 17 floating-point computation tasks, respectively. To construct

a single measure of performance, we take the geometric mean of the overall scores for integer

and floating-point tasks. 23

          SPEC scores are widely used to compare the performance of alternative MPUs or

computers and also are used as a standard by computer engineers. 24 For example, Hennessy and

Patterson (2012) — the standard text on computer design and architecture — notes that “One of

the most successful attempts to create standardized benchmark application suites has been the

SPEC (Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation) …” (p. 38). This textbook relies on

SPEC scores to measure the growth in processor performance in recent decades. 25

         SPEC benchmarks provide several ways to measure MPU performance. The

performance of a single task is measured by the “speed” score and the simultaneous performance

of multiple tasks is measured by the “rate” score. The “speed” and “rate” scores differ in their

use of parallel processing, an important consideration after the introduction of multi-core MPUs

in the mid-2000s. In the “speed” test, a single task may be broken into component calculations

to be run on different processing cores on the MPU. In the “rate” test, multiple instances of the

23
   Although the integer and floating-point scores could be included as separate variables in the hedonic regressions
described below, little would be gained relative to the equal-weighted geometric mean, as the correlation between
the two scores is greater than 0.98.

   One of our employers uses SPEC scores in making decisions about purchases of computing equipment.

same task may be run simultaneously to more fully exploit the potential of the chip. We use the

“speed” score as our base case, but the results using the “rate” score (available from the authors)

are very similar.

        Sample selection. We matched 184 MPU models from our price data, or 49 percent, to at

least one performance score published by SPEC. An important question is whether this selection

on the availability of SPEC scores could bias our results. Table 2 provides information on this

point, showing a range of chip characteristics both for chips with SPEC scores and for those

without scores. 26 As shown in Panel A of the table, average entry prices for chips with SPEC

scores are considerably higher than for chips without SPEC scores. Perhaps not surprising given

the difference in average prices, chips with SPEC scores tend to have technical features

associated with higher performance. Clock speed is somewhat greater for chips with SPEC

scores; the shift to multicore architecture occurred more quickly; and the amount of power used

by the chip (thermal design power 27) is greater. For the most part, these differences in technical

features taken individually are not very large, and there is no consistent difference in the final

characteristic shown in the panel ― the size of the smallest feature on the chip (lithography).

        For our purposes, the essential issue is whether price trends differ across the samples of

chips with and without SPEC scores. To examine this question, we construct matched-model

indexes using the PPI methodology (labeled PPI-like) for both samples. As shown in Panel B of

the table, over the full period from 2000 to 2013, the average rate of decline in these PPI-like

price indexes is very similar across the chips with and without SPEC scores (29 percent versus

26 percent, respectively). The two sets of chips also display similar price trends within the

  Thermal design power (TDP) measures the amount of heat generated when running typical software for the chip.
The amount of heat generated (measured in watts) is closely related to the MPU’s power consumption.

shorter time periods shown in the table. The similarity of the price trends suggests that our

results are not biased by the absence of SPEC scores for some chip models.

           Representativeness of our sample relative to the PPI. A second important question is

how well price trends in our sample track those in the PPI. Our sample is for Intel desktop chips,

while the scope of the PPI includes desktop chips from other manufacturers (notably including

AMD), as well as chips for servers and laptops. As can be seen in Panel B, our PPI-like indexes

for Intel desktop chips and the PPI for all MPUs display very similar price trends. Accordingly,

we are comfortable using our results for Intel desktop chips to draw inferences about the

performance of the PPI.



5. Specification of the Hedonic Regressions

To fix ideas, we first describe a dummy-variable hedonic specification:

           ln�𝑃𝑖,𝑡 � = 𝛼 + ∑𝑘 𝛽𝑘 𝑋𝑘,𝑖,𝑡 + ∑𝑡 𝛿𝑡 𝐷𝑖,𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑡                (1)

where Pi,t is the price of chip i in period t, Xk,i,t is the value of characteristic k for chip i in period t

(measured in logs or levels, as appropriate), Di,t∈Y is a vector of time dummy variables (fixed

effects) that equals 1 if chip i is observed in period t and zero otherwise, and εi,t is an error term.

           A potential shortcoming of equation 1, highlighted by Pakes (2003) and Erickson and

Pakes (2011), is that the coefficients on the characteristic or performance variables are

constrained to remain constant over the full sample period. One response to that concern is to

run a cross-section regression for every time period and then to use results from those

regressions to build up a price index. 28 Such an approach is appealing because it provides

maximum flexibility for estimated coefficients to change over time and allows the results to be


28
     See Aizcorbe’s (2014) discussion and the references there.


                                                         - 19 -
used in price index formulas. However, our sample size is too small to run reliable cross-section

hedonic regressions for every quarter or even every year.

          As a compromise, we focus on adjacent-period (in our case, adjacent-year) hedonic

regressions. 29 Specifically, we estimate the following regression for each two-year overlapping

period:

          ln�𝑃𝑖,𝑡 � = 𝛼 + ∑𝑘 𝛽𝑘 𝑋𝑘,𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛿𝐷2 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑡              (2)

where Pi,t is the price of chip i in year t. We measure Pi,t as the average of the observed prices of

chip i within the year. 30 The dummy variable D2 equals 1 if the price observation is in the second

year of the two-year overlapping period and 0 otherwise. To construct a price index from this

sequence of regressions, we spliced together the percent changes implied by the estimated

coefficients on the D2 variables. In our main results, we rely on the SPEC variable to capture the

performance of each MPU as experienced by users, so that ∑𝑘 𝛽𝑘 𝑋𝑘,𝑖,𝑡 reduces to 𝛽ln(𝑆𝑃𝐸𝐶𝑖,𝑡 ).

          As noted in the previous section, SPEC updated its suite of performance tests in 2006.

We use the older (SPEC 2000) benchmarks for the adjacent-year regressions through 2005-06

and the newer (SPEC 2006) benchmarks for the adjacent-year regressions beginning with 2006-

07.

          As a comparison, we also estimate equation 2 with a set of chip characteristics on the

right-hand side instead of the SPEC variable. This alternative regression represents the usual

approach to hedonic specification in the literature and allows us to gauge the effect on estimated

price trends of controlling directly for performance. The characteristics included in the

regression are those shown in table 2 ― clock speed (in gigahertz), number of cores, maximum


29
  See Triplett (2006) for a discussion of adjacent-period hedonic regressions.
30
  We also estimated regressions at the quarterly frequency for each two-year period and included a time trend
spanning the eight quarters of data included in each regression. That alternative yielded price trends similar to those
reported here.

thermal design power (in watts), and lithography size (in nanometers) ― plus cache memory (in

megabytes), a dummy for whether the chip has a separate graphics processing unit, and the

number of threads. 31 We use the natural log of clock speed, thermal design power, lithography

size, and cache memory; the number of cores and number of threads enter the regression in

levels.


6. Results

Table 3 shows estimates of equation 2 using SPEC performance for the overlapping two-year

periods during 2000-06, and table 4 shows estimates for 2006-13. The upper panel in each table

presents estimates that rely only on prices in each MPU model’s introduction period, while the

lower panel presents estimates based on the full sample of price observations. The coefficient on

the second-year dummy variable in each adjacent-year regression measures the rate of change in

quality-adjusted MPU prices from the first year to the second.

          Overall, the regressions explain much of the variation in MPU prices. The adjusted R2

averages close to 0.50 across the full set of regressions shown in tables 3 and 4.

          Although Pakes (2003) cautions against providing structural interpretations of the

coefficients, we note that the coefficients on SPEC performance are uniformly positive and

significant at the 5 percent level. These coefficients indicate that higher performing MPU

models sell for higher prices and suggest that the performance measure captures an important

element of the quality differences across MPU models.

          Analogous tables for the regressions that replace SPEC performance with chip

characteristics are provided in appendix C. These regressions fit the data well, with an average

adjusted R2 of about 0.75. Some of the estimated coefficients are in line with expectations. In

31
  MPUs can perform multiple threads—sequences of related program instructions—either by employing multiple
cores or by sharing resources on an individual core. Thus, additional threads provide a form of parallel processing.


                                                       - 21 -
particular, the coefficients on clock speed, number of threads, and cache memory are generally

positive and significant, with no instances of significant negative coefficients. In contrast, the

significant coefficients on thermal design power, number of cores, lithography, and the graphics

processor dummy change sign at least once. In addition, the significant coefficients on the

graphics processor dummy are generally negative. Overall, these regressions exhibit the

interpretational issues that often attend hedonic regressions estimated with a vector of product

characteristics. 32

         To construct annual price indexes from the SPEC and characteristics regressions, we set

the 2000 value of the index to 100, and then move the index forward year by year with the

implied percent change from each adjacent-year regression. For example, to calculate the

percent change from 2000 to 2001, we exponentiate the coefficient on the year dummy in the

2000-01 regression. 33 We then do the same for the 2001-02 regression, and so on.

         We summarize our results in table 5 and figure 9. The table reports average rates of price

change over 2000-04, 2004-08, and 2008-13 from six different measures: the hedonic index

based on SPEC performance and introduction-period prices (our preferred index), three other

hedonic indexes including those using chip characteristics, the MPU price index constructed by




32
   For completeness, we also estimated a version of the hedonic regression that included both SPEC performance
and chip characteristics as controls for quality. The results were not crisp, as might be expected given the inclusion
of both a summary measure of performance and chip features that influence the summary measure. In particular, the
coefficient on SPEC performance was positive and significant in less than half of the regressions and insignificant in
the rest. The coefficients on the characteristics, though broadly similar to the characteristics-only regression,
displayed more frequent instances of significant changes in sign.
33
   Because the exponential function is nonlinear, the translation from the natural log of prices to price levels requires
an adjustment in order to be unbiased. We apply the standard adjustment based on the estimated variance of the
regression error; see Aizcorbe (2014) for details. This adjustment had very little effect on estimated price trends
over 2000-04, but over 2004-08 and 2008-13 it slowed the estimated annual rate of price decline by as much as 10
percentage points relative to the unadjusted estimates.

the Federal Reserve Board, and the PPI. 34 The figure plots the levels of the PPI and the two

hedonic indexes based on SPEC performance.

        From 2000 to 2004, all of the indexes show very rapid declines in MPU prices. As

discussed in section 3, with Intel’s ubiquitous downward re-pricing of existing chips before the

mid-2000s, all of the price indexes—both matched model and hedonic—would be expected to

capture the downward trend in quality-adjusted prices. This expectation is borne out by our

results. As shown in table 5, all of the MPU price indexes fell at an average annual rate of 39

percent or more over 2000-04. In addition, the rate of decline in the PPI (and the Fed’s index) is

very similar to that of our preferred hedonic index.

        However, the trends in the indexes diverge after 2004. Although our preferred hedonic

index fell somewhat less rapidly after 2004 than before, the decline in the PPI slowed much more

sharply. Indeed, the PPI fell at an average annual rate of only 8 percent from 2008 to 2013 and

barely declined at all in 2012 and 2013. For the reasons highlighted earlier in the paper, we

believe that this divergence points to likely bias in the PPI for MPUs and suggests that the PPI

could be providing a deeply misleading picture of price trends for MPUs in recent years. 35

        The full-sample hedonic index based on SPEC performance declined less rapidly than the

introduction-period index in each period, with the largest difference occurring after 2008. As

indicated by the analysis in section 3, the wider gap after the mid-2000s is what would be

expected under the “age-related discounting” and “drop-off in volume” scenarios if Intel were

keeping posted prices for older models fixed to a greater degree than previously. Because


34
   The Federal Reserve series is a matched-model index from 1992 to 2006 linked to an introduction-period hedonic
index after 2006. The hedonic index is constructed from an earlier version of the empirical work presented here.
35
   In a closely related study, Sun (2014) estimated hedonic regressions for MPUs used in laptops. Because SPEC
scores were not available for a wide enough set of laptop chips, Sun used a variety of other performance benchmarks
in the regressions. She found that prices for laptop MPUs trended down at a 20 to 30 percent average annual pace
over past ten years, depending on the regression specification. The rate of price decline slowed after 2010, though
not to the extent shown by the PPI.


                                                      - 23 -
discounts from posted prices are unobservable, the full-sample index will understate price

declines to the extent that Intel is discounting older models; this bias will be larger than when

posted prices were more flexible. Moreover, to the extent that Intel is allowing price-

performance ratios on older models to rise above those for new models, sales of the older models

likely are falling off more substantially than when posted prices fell over a chip's life cycle.

Given that we do not have model-level shipments data, the index based on the unweighted full-

sample index would overweight the older models whose prices are not changing. Under either

scenario (or a combination of them), the full-sample hedonic index will understate the rate of

price decline, supporting our preference for the introduction-period index. 36

         The post-2004 slowing in estimated price declines is much more pronounced in the

regressions that use chip characteristics than in those using SPEC performance. As shown in

table 5, during 2004-08 and 2008-13, the price indexes obtained from the characteristics-based

regressions fell at average annual rates ranging from only 1 percent to 21 percent, a far slower

rate of decline than in the corresponding SPEC-based indexes.

         The wide gap stems from the post-2004 divergence between the continued performance

gains indicated by SPEC scores and the flat path for chip quality implied by the characteristics

regression (which we demonstrate below). With no quality improvement, the characteristics

regression "thinks" that constant-quality prices are no longer falling more rapidly than observed

list prices.




36
  As a robustness check for the introduction-period SPEC regression, we estimated an alternative version that
included not only chip prices in the quarter of introduction but also prices in the three quarters following the chip’s
introduction. The price index obtained from this regression fell at a (bias-adjusted) annual rate of 38 percent, 34
percent, and 39 percent, respectively, over 2000-04, 2004-08, and 2008-13. Thus, MPU price declines are estimated
to have remained rapid whether we use only the introduction-period price or broaden the sample to include prices
observed within a year of introduction.

         To measure the implied change in chip quality over time, recall from equation 2 that the

effect of quality on the log of observed chip price in the adjacent-year regression is ∑𝑘 𝛽𝑘 𝑋𝑘,𝑖,𝑡 .

Letting 𝑡1 and 𝑡2 denote the first and second of the two adjacent years, the average value of the

quality effect for the chips that appear in the regression in 𝑡1 is ∑𝑘 𝛽𝑘 𝑋�𝑘,𝑡1 , with an analogous

expression for 𝑡2 . Thus, the change in the quality effect from 𝑡1 to 𝑡2 is ∑𝑘 𝛽𝑘 �𝑋�𝑘,𝑡2 − 𝑋�𝑘,𝑡1 �. 37          36F




When SPEC performance is used as the sole control for chip quality, this expression reduces to

𝛽�𝑋�𝑡2 − 𝑋�𝑡1 �, where X is ln(SPEC). It is important to note that ∑𝑘 𝛽𝑘 �𝑋�𝑘,𝑡2 − 𝑋�𝑘,𝑡1 � measures

the effect of quality change on prices, not the pure change in quality itself. However, on the

reasonable assumption that higher quality is associated on average with higher chip prices, the

sign of ∑𝑘 𝛽𝑘 �𝑋�𝑘,𝑡2 − 𝑋�𝑘,𝑡1 � indicates whether chip quality is improving, worsening, or

remaining unchanged, which is sufficient for our purpose.

         Figure 10 shows the time series for the price effect of chip quality, measured from each

adjacent-year regression as ∑𝑘 𝛽𝑘 �𝑋�𝑘,𝑡2 − 𝑋�𝑘,𝑡1 �, with each year-pair then linked together to

form the time series. The 𝛽 coefficients and the average chip characteristics are both taken from

the introduction-period version of the regressions, and thus represent the price effect of quality at

the frontier. As can be seen, the SPEC-based series rises every year, implying a sustained

increase in chip quality; this result is consistent with the direct measure of SPEC performance

that was shown previously in figure 1. In contrast, the series based on chip characteristics in

figure 10 only edges up on net after 2003, implying little effect on prices of the improvement in

chip quality from that year forward, punctuated by a sizable decline in 2008. Interestingly, the

characteristics-based series in figure 10 bears a striking resemblance to the series for clock speed


37
  Aizcorbe (2006) also measures the price effect of changes in chip quality. Although her method involves taking
the difference between the changes in observed prices and quality-adjusted prices, algebraically this is very close to
what we do.

in figure 1. Thus, even though the characteristics-based regression includes seven MPU

characteristics, clock speed exerts a powerful influence on the implied measure of chip quality in

the regression.

       These results raise questions about the constant-quality MPU price indexes obtained from

the regressions that control for quality with chip characteristics. To view those indexes as

credible, one must accept either that the quality of MPU chips was essentially stagnant for the

decade after 2003 or that the market placed no value on rising performance over that decade.

The second condition is implausible on its face, while the first implies that the upward march in

chip quality indicated by SPEC ratings — the industry standard for performance measurement —

is spectacularly wrong. The much more likely conclusion, in our view, is that chip performance

has continued to improve and that constant-quality MPU prices have remained on a steep

downtrend.



7. Conclusion

After falling rapidly through the mid-2000s, the PPI for MPUs has declined very slowly by

historical standards in recent years. Such a slowdown is puzzling given evidence of ongoing

rapid advances in semiconductor technology. To reconcile these observations, this paper

demonstrates that the matched-model procedure used for the PPI for MPUs likely is

inappropriate in the pricing regime that Intel — the dominant manufacturer — adopted in the

mid-2000s. We argue that a hedonic approach based on introduction-period prices is the

preferred way to measure quality-adjusted MPU prices in the current pricing environment. We

implement this hedonic approach with an MPU performance measure that addresses




                                               - 26 -
longstanding concerns in the literature about the use of product characteristics to proxy for

performance.

       The results from our preferred hedonic price index indicate that quality-adjusted MPU

prices continued to fall rapidly after the mid-2000s, contrary to the picture from the PPI. Our

results have important implications for understanding the rate of technical progress in the

semiconductor sector and, arguably, for the broader debate about the pace of innovation and its

implications in the U.S. economy. Notably, concerns that the semiconductor sector has begun to

fade as an engine of growth appear to be unwarranted. Rather, these results suggest continued

rapid advances in technologies enabled by semiconductors.

       That said, it is important to highlight that our results have limited direct implications for

the measurement of real GDP or output per hour. Semiconductors mostly are intermediate inputs

and so are not counted directly in GDP. Imports and exports are the exception, but trade

quantities are small enough that, even if our preferred price indexes for MPUs were adopted,

measures of real GDP growth would change by only a small amount.

       As a final point, we note that our results raise a new puzzle. In recent years, the price

index for computing equipment in the National Income and Product Accounts has fallen quite

slowly by historical standards. If MPU prices have, in fact, continued to decline rapidly, why

have prices for computers ― which rely on MPUs for their performance ― not followed suit?

We believe there is a reasonable chance that the official price indexes for computers have been

measured with error, reflecting in part the challenge of identifying the relevant and likely

changing set of physical characteristics used to measure quality. The end-user performance

measure employed in this paper could help break this knot for computer prices, and we are

investigating this possibility in further work.

1. The results for the hedonic regressions have been bias-corrected for the conversion from the natural log of
price to the price level. See the text for details.
2. Constructed as a matched-model index through 2006 and as an introduction-period hedonic index after 2006.
The dataset and hedonic regression specification reflect an earlier version of the empirical work presented in
this paper.

Appendix A: Performance Measures from SPEC (System Performance Evaluation
Corporation)

As noted in the text, SPEC is a non-profit corporation that develops performance benchmarks for
computers. This appendix describes the performance benchmarks from SPEC that we use in our
analysis.

For MPUs, SPEC has developed a suite of benchmark tests that evaluate how quickly an MPU
can complete a set of tasks that are developed from real user applications. These benchmark
suites are updated periodically to reflect changes in MPU architecture and in relevant tasks. We
use the latest benchmark, called CPU2006, as well as CPU2000.

The performance of an MPU will depend on characteristics of the system other than just the
MPU; these other elements include memory and the compiler used. SPEC has benchmarks for a
standard configuration (“base” metrics) and a configuration in which compilers are tuned for
maximum performance (“peak” metrics). We use the base metrics.

Further details are provided below on how we use the CPU2006 and CPU2000 benchmarks to
construct the performance measure used in our analysis.


CPU2006

CPU2006 was introduced in 2006, and we use results from CPU2006 to measure the
performance of chips from 2006 to 2013. This benchmark consists of two suites of tasks. The
first suite contains 12 tests that focus on integer calculations, and the second suite contains 17
tests that focus on floating point calculations. For each test, SPEC normalizes the test time by
taking the ratio of the test time on a standardized reference machine to the test time for the MPU
being tested. By scaling results in this way, shorter test times result in higher performance
scores. SPEC then constructs a composite score for calculations by taking the geometric mean of
the normalized individual integer scores; SPEC constructs a composite floating-point score in a
parallel manner. The composite scores we use are called SPECint_base2006 and
SPECfp_base2006.

As noted, these tests cover actual user applications. The integer and floating-point applications
include the following.

    •   Integer applications include running PERL scripts, file compression, running a C
        compiler, combinatorial optimization, artificial intelligence (playing the games Go and
        chess), searching gene sequences, simulating a quantum computer, video compression,
        discrete event simulation, running path-finding algorithms, and XML processing.

    •   Floating-point applications include computations for fluid dynamics, quantum
        chemistry, quantum chromodynamics, molecular dynamics, general relativity, finite
        element analysis, linear programming, image rendering, structural mechanics,
        computational electromagnetics, weather modeling, and speech recognition.

To construct the performance measure used for most of our analysis, we take the geometric mean
of the integer and floating-point composites described above.

With the advent of parallel processing, SPEC began distinguishing between speed and rate
measures of performance. Speed measures focus on how fast a computer completes a single
task. Rate measures focus on how many tasks a computer can complete in a given amount of
time, taking advantage of available parallel processing. 38 The integer and floating-point
performance suites described above are speed measures. Our analysis primarily focuses on these
speed measures as they are available over a longer time span. That said, we also consider rate
measures to more fully account for parallel processing and the rise of multicore chips.


CPU2000

CPU2000 was introduced in 1999 and retired in 2007. We use results from CPU2000 to measure
the performance of chips from 2000 to 2006. The calculation of CPU2000 is very similar to that
of CPU2006 except that the individual performance tests are of a type appropriate to the
computing environment in the earlier period. The CPU2000 integer suite includes 12 tests, and
the floating-point suite includes 14 tests.

Just as with CPU2006, for CPU2000, our analysis relies on the geometric mean of the integer
and floating-point composite metrics, which themselves are geometric means of normalized
results of the individual integer and floating-point tests.


Additional Details

We are able to bridge across the SPEC2000 and SPEC2006 benchmarks because results for 2006
were reported on both benchmarks for many chips. This allows us to estimate hedonic
regressions for adjacent pairs of years through 2005-06 using SPEC2000 and for adjacent pairs
of years starting with 2006-07 using SPEC2006.

An MPU chip often has multiple scores for each of the SPEC benchmark tests. Multiple scores
can arise either because more than one computer vendor tested the chip or because a given
vendor tested the chip under different conditions. The variation in test conditions can reflect
differences in hardware (e.g., the circuit board or amount and type of DRAM) or software (e.g.,
the operating system or compiler). When multiple scores are available for a specific model, we
use the model’s median score.




38
   Speed scores do account for some parallel processing; in particular, speed scores allow for auto-parallelization for
a single task, and by 2014 almost all speed scores reported using this feature.

Appendix B: Intel Desktop MPUs on Wholesale Price Lists

The table below (see next page) lists every Intel desktop MPU shown on the company's
wholesale price lists starting in 1999. The most recent price list is posted at
http://www.intc.com/pricelist.cfm; price lists for earlier periods were collected from this location
and other online sites. Entry year denotes the year that the MPU first appeared on a price list.
The MPU description is taken directly from Intel's ARK database, located at http://ark.intel.com,
which contains a full history of Intel microprocessors; the note at the bottom of the table
describes the minor ways we edited the ARK description to save space. The final column shows
whether a SPEC score exists for each model. All of the models with a SPEC score are included
in our empirical analysis. Of 373 models introduced by Intel during the period, 184 have SPEC
scores available.
