                                              ABSTRACT

This study compares labor and total factor productivity (TFP) in France, Japan, the United Kingdom
and the United States in the very long (since 1890) and medium (since 1980) runs. During the past
century, the United States has overtaken the United Kingdom and become the leading world economy.
During the past 25 years, the four countries have also experienced contrasting advances in productivity,
in particular as a result of unequal investment in information and communication technology (ICT).

The past 120 years have been characterized by: (i) rapid economic growth and large productivity gains
in all four countries; (ii) a long decline of productivity in the United Kingdom relative to the United
States, and to a lesser extent also to France and Japan, a relative decline that was interrupted by the
second world war (WW2); (iii) the remarkable catching-up to the United States by France and Japan
after WW2, that stopped in the case of Japan during the 1990s.

Capital deepening (at least to the extent this can be measured) accounts for a large share of the variations
in performance; increasingly during the past 25 years, this has meant ICT capital deepening. However,
the capital contribution to growth varies considerably over time and across the four countries, and
it is always less important, except in Japan, than the contribution of the various other factors underlying
TFP growth, such as, among others, labor skills, technical and organizational changes and knowledge
spillovers.

Most recently (in 2006), before the current financial world crisis, hourly labor productivity levels were
slightly higher in France than in the United States, and noticeably lower in the United Kingdom (by
roughly 10%) and even lower in Japan (30%), while TFP levels are very close in France, the United
Kingdom and the United States, but much lower (40%) in Japan.

1.   INTRODUCTION

Productivity is a key determinant of the wealth of nations. Almost all theoretical and
empirical studies that set out to explain the extremely large economic growth and living
standard inequalities between countries focus on the differences in productivity levels and
growth rates. These studies are numerous and our study, like most others, is based on the
traditional “growth accounting” framework (outlined in Box 1). Its contribution is in taking
a fresh look at the productivity macroeconomic evidence for France, Japan, the United
Kingdom and the United States in the very long run (since 1890) and in the more recent
years (since 1980), thus covering a century during which the United States has replaced the
United Kingdom as the leading world economic power, and focusing on the past 25 years
during which the development of modern information and communication technologies
(ICT) has contributed very significantly, albeit unevenly, to productivity growth.


We have tried in this exercise to make the best use of the estimates of aggregate historical
data series going back in all four countries to the end of the 19th century for output (GDP),
employment, working time and investment in physical capital (see Box 2 on Data
Sources). As regards the past 25 years, we relied as much as possible on national accounts
data. Many of the estimates on which our comparison is based are subject to a great deal of
uncertainty and inaccuracy, not only for the most distant periods but also to a significant
extent for the more recent ones. We may nevertheless hopefully consider that the orders of
magnitude of these estimates, and the ensuing large differentials in productivity levels and
growth rates, are fairly reliable and meaningful. One important reason to be confident is
the long tradition of statistics gathering in the four countries. Another is that our
comparison is limited to the economies as a whole (and the fact that all four countries had
reasonably stable geographic frontiers over our study period). Moreover, given the
difficulties of measuring physical capital, as well as unknown differences in measurement
methods, we re-estimated capital stocks and services and their contributions to growth for
the four countries on the basis of the available investment series, using constant and equal
capital stock depreciation rates and shares of services in GDP (see Box 2). Similarly, we


                                                                                           2
chose to use the same hedonic price indices (relative to GDP price indices) for computer
hardware, software and communication equipment in all four countries, relying on those
for the United States, which are arguably those with the largest corrections for improved
quality.


In short, we examine productivity growth for the four countries, over the chosen periods
and sub-periods, and using three notions of productivity: labor productivity per employee
and per hour, and total factor productivity (TFP), measured as the productivity residual
accounting for changes in labor and physical capital input. In Section 2, we compare the
long-run trends, and then in Section 3, we focus on the evolution during the past 25 years
and on the major role played by the diffusion of ICT during this period.


2.   COMPARING LONG RUN PRODUCTIVITY TRENDS

In Section 2.1, we first look at the average long run labor productivity and TFP trends
over the entire period: 1890-2006 and comment on the 1890 and 2006 corresponding
productivity levels. In Section 2.2, we compare these trends and levels for the five
following sub-periods: from 1890 to 1913, just before WW1, from 1913 to 1950 (i.e.
including the years of the 1929 great depression and those of economic reconstruction
and recovery after WW2, in order to smooth out the most significant effects of the
conflict on production capacities and economic structures); from 1950 to 1973, just
before the first oil shock; from 1973 to 1980, the period between the first and second
oil shocks; and from 1980 to 2006, the period we will consider in more detail in
Section 3. In Section 2.2, we also carefully compare our productivity estimates to those
of several other studies.


2.1. …over the entire period

From 1890 to 2006, the overall growth of labor productivity was remarkable in all four
countries. The levels of productivity per employee and per hour increased by a factor of
respectively 10 and 20 in France, 25 and 40 in Japan, 5 and 9 in the United Kingdom



                                                                                        3
and 7 and 12 in the United States (see Table 1). The large differentials between the
growth rates of employee and hourly productivity reflect the huge decline in average
annual working time: by roughly 50% in France (sliding from 3,110 hours in 1890 to
1,540 hours in 2006), by 45% in the United Kingdom (from 2,990 to 1,670 hours), 40%
in the United States (from 2,850 to 1,710) and 35% in Japan (from 2,734 to 1,784).
Over these (nearly) 120 years, Japan experienced the highest average annual growth:
2.8% per employee and 3.2% per hour, and the United Kingdom the lowest: 1.4% per
employee and 1.9% per hour, while France and the United States were in an
intermediate position, with France (2.1% and 2.7%) above the United States (1.8% and
2.2%).


In terms of productivity levels, few studies are available on a long period to allow some
comparison with our results. Concerning productivity per hour, relative to the United
States level, results from Maddison (2007) seem, for Japan and the United Kingdom, very
close to ours (see Table 1 and Graphs 1 and 2 for our results, and Appendix Table 1 for the
results from Maddison, 2007).1


In 1890, the level of labor productivity in the United States, whether per employee or per
hour, was roughly four to five times higher than in Japan, 50% higher than in France, but
25% lower than in the United Kingdom.2 At the time, Japan and France had a much larger
proportion of their labor force working in agriculture, as compared with the other two
countries. It was still the case in 1970 (see Appendix Table 2). In 2006, the situation is
drastically different. The Japanese productivity level, though still the lowest, is about two
thirds that of the United States, and the French productivity level is close to that of the

1
  Although Maddison (2007) does not give a level comparison for TFP, he provides estimates of
capital stock per capita which seem roughly consistent with ours (see Table 6.4, page305). We can
thus expect that our estimates of TFP levels of the United Kingdom and Japan relative to the
United States are also consistent with his estimates for these countries.
2
  The relative productivity levels for France, Japan and the United Kingdom found in this study
differ somewhat from those mentioned in Cette (2004, 2007). These results do not alter the
commented stylised facts. The causes of these differences are two-fold. First, the data sources are
different: those used in the present study are detailed in Box 1 while in Cette (2004, 2007) they are
Maddison (1994, 2001 and 2003). Second, in order to ensure the continuity of historical series, we
chose to adjust them on the basis of growth rates (as indicated in Box 1).


                                                                                                   4
United States, while the British productivity level is noticeably lower (by about 10%) than
in the United States.3


Growth in total factor productivity (TFP) accounts for a major share of hourly labor
productivity growth over the past 120 years in the four countries: roughly 50% to 60% in
France, Japan and in the United Kingdom and 70% in the United States, while the
contribution of capital deepening appears much smaller (see Table 2). Overall, it appears
that the factors underlying TFP as computed, such as mainly a better educated and higher
skilled labor force, technical and organizational changes, knowledge spillovers, better
institutions, make a much greater contribution to observed productivity growth than capital
deepening per se.


In 1890, the level of TFP was roughly 100% higher in the United Kingdom, but 35% lower
in France and 50% lower in Japan than in the United States. Given that TFP growth was
relatively slow in the United Kingdom and fast in France, the level of TFP in both
countries was close to that in the United States in 2006. Such remarkable convergence did
not occur in Japan: for TFP it stopped at about 60% of the level of the United States in the
early 1970s, and for hourly labor productivity it came to a halt in the early 1990s. To a
significant extent, this can probably be attributed to persistent differences in industry
composition. In Japan, as evidenced in Table 2, low productivity activities, such as
agriculture, construction, trade and catering account for a larger share of the economy than
in the other three countries.


2.1   …by sub-periods

Our estimates of employee and hourly productivity growth and of the contributions of
capital deepening and TFP are given in Table 2, and shown in the corresponding Graph 3.


3
  Bourlès and Cette (2005, 2007) have shown that France’s strong productivity performance
compared to the United States at the end of the period can partly be explained by shorter working
hours and a lower employment rate in France and diminishing returns of both working time and
employment rate. Adjusting for these effects, the 2006 hourly labor productivity in France appears
lower than in the United States by about 5%.


                                                                                                5
Only a few analyses provide comparable estimations for the four countries over the last
century. As expected, our estimates of productivity per employee are very close to those of
Maury and Pluyaud (2004), since these authors largely rely on the real GDP and
employment data they have gathered and harmonized. The estimates are also consistent
with the results presented by Gordon (2003), Cette (2004, 2007) and Van Ark, Frankema
and Duteweerd (2004), who measure labor productivity growth over different sub-periods
using the real GDP and employment estimates calculated by Maddison (2001). Our
estimates of labor productivity and TFP are also consistent with those of Maddison (2007)
who makes long-term comparisons between Japan, the United Kingdom and the United
States, and considers in particular two of the same sub-periods, 1913-1950 and 1950-1973.


Appendix Tables 3 (France), 4 (Japan, United Kingdom, and United States), and 5 (United
States) show selected results from other researchers for comparison. As regards France, the
labor productivity and TFP estimates by Dubois (1985), which builds on the major work of
Carré, Dubois and Malinvaud (1972), are in very good accordance with ours, although
these cover only market activities (and not the whole economy), and in spite of our
simplified estimation of physical capital and of its contribution to growth (see Appendix
Table 3). For the United Kingdom and Japan, our estimates of labor productivity and TFP
growth are very similar to those of Maddison (2007) over both sub-periods 1913-1950 and
1950-1973 (see Appendix Table 4). For the United Kingdom, our estimates are also
consistent with those of Crafts (2004a, b and c).


For the United States, our results for hourly productivity are not very different from those
of Ferguson and Wascher (2004), although they consider the non-agricultural market sector
for slightly different sub-periods (see Appendix Table 5). Our estimates of labor
productivity and TFP growth are only roughly consistent with Maddison’s: our estimate of
TFP growth for the sub-period 1913-1950 is higher by about 0.7% per year (2.3% instead
of 1.6%), while our estimate of hourly productivity differs ‘only’ by 0.3% (2.8% instead of
2.5%).




                                                                                          6
If we combine the two sub-periods following the first oil shock (1973-2006), our results
confirm the “Big Wave” analysis of productivity in the United States offered by Gordon
(1999, 2003). Hourly productivity and TFP in the United States accelerate after 1913, and
then slowdown after 1950 and much more after 1973, while the contribution of capital
deepening to growth remains almost unchanged. Employee productivity has a different
evolution, growing fastest from 1950 to 1973. In France, Japan and the United Kingdom,
we also observe such a “Big Wave”. It is, however, shifted forward, with both hourly and
employee productivity growing faster during the years 1950-1973 than in the previous
years 1913-1950. This appears more pronounced in Japan than in France, and in France
than in the United Kingdom. These differences between the three countries and with the
United States can be attributed to several factors, among which are the later diffusion of
electricity, the slower improvement in the average education and skill level of the
workforce (Van Ark, Frankema and Duteweerd, 2004), and greater protectionism (see
Gordon, 2003, for a review of the literature). TFP appears to be the main determinant of
employee and hourly productivity growth in the four countries, although capital deepening
also contributes, especially in Japan since 1950.


Looking more precisely, we see behind these broad similarities substantial differences
across the four countries depending on the sub-periods considered.


From 1890 to 1913, France, Japan and the United States experienced similar annual growth
rates of productivity per employee (roughly 1.7%) and per hour (roughly 2%). Annual
productivity growth was lowest in the United Kingdom, mainly on account of a smaller
TFP contribution but also lower capital per employee-hour growth. In the four countries,
the shares of the contributions of capital deepening and TFP to productivity growth are
roughly similar (respectively 1/4 to ½ and 1/2 to 3/4). Compared to the United States, the
level of hourly productivity in France and Japan thus remained unchanged at respectively
roughly 45-50% and 20-25% of the U.S. level, while that in the United Kingdom dropped
from around 125% to 105% of that in the U.S.




                                                                                        7
From 1913 to 1950, the average yearly growth in employee and hourly productivity was
about 1.9% and 2.8% in the United States, that is much faster than in France (1.0% and
1.8%), Japan (1.3% and 1.8%) and especially in the United Kingdom (0.7% and 1.5%).
Except for Japan, these differences can be attributed to different TFP contributions, since
capital deepening increased at about the same rate in all three countries. In Japan, the
contribution of capital deepening was very high during this sub-period (roughly 70% of
hourly productivity growth). Consequently, as can be seen on Graph 1, the level of hourly
productivity dropped in 1950 moderately for France and Japan (to respectively about 40%
and 20% of the United States level), and much more for the United Kingdom (to 65% of
the United States level).


From 1950 to 1973, the growth in employee and hourly productivity was particularly
strong in Japan (7.5% and 7.4% per year respectively) and in France (4.7% and 5.2%), and
much slower in the United Kingdom (2.5% and 2.8%) and in the United States (2.3% and
2.5%). The faster productivity growth in Japan and France can be mainly attributed to
faster TFP growth, reflecting in part important changes in their economic structure. For
example, it is mainly during this period that the share of agriculture in French GDP
declined significantly, and became more in line with that in the United Kingdom and the
United States.4 In 1973, hourly productivity in France and Japan improved markedly to
reach a level of about respectively 70% and 50% of that of the United States, and France
had caught up with the United Kingdom, which had experienced slower productivity
growth.


During the short period between the two oil shocks (1973-1980), employee and hourly
productivity growth slowed down significantly in the four countries. It was highest in
France (2.6% and 3.4% per year respectively) and in Japan (2.6% and 3.2%), intermediate
in the United Kingdom (0.9% and 2.1%) and very low in the United States (0.2% and
0.7%). In all four countries the slowdown in productivity growth is mainly linked to the


4
 Card and Freeman (2002) estimated that between 1960 and 1979, the impact on labor productivity
of a change in the weight of employment in the agricultural sector amounted to roughly 0.5% each
year in France, against 0.1% in the United Kingdom and the United States.


                                                                                              8
slowdown in TFP growth, the contribution of capital deepening being almost unchanged or
even higher in Japan compared with the previous sub-period.5 By 1980 hourly productivity
in France and Japan had reached a level of about respectively 85% and 50% of that in the
United States, and France had overtaken the United Kingdom (which had a level of 75%).


During the last sub-period 1980-2006, employee and hourly productivity continued to
slowdown in France and Japan but not in the United States where they both strongly
accelerated, nor in the United Kingdom, where employee productivity and TFP also
recovered and hourly productivity maintaining its pace. Productivity per employee thus
increased fastest in the United Kingdom (2.0% per year), followed by Japan (1.8%), the
United States (1.6%) and France (1.5%), while hourly productivity improved most rapidly in
Japan (2.4%), followed by France and the United Kingdom (2.2%) and the United States
(1.6%). The slowdown in productivity can be attributed to the slowdown in both capital
deepening and TFP growth in France, and to capital deepening only in Japan. The
acceleration in productivity in the United States and the United Kingdom is also seen in TFP,
while the contribution of capital deepening remained about the same in the United States and
even declined in the United Kingdom. France continued to experience on average the highest
TFP growth, in spite of very significant slowdown (from 1.8% to 1.3% per year).


Consequently, the level of hourly productivity relative to that in the United States increased
markedly in France to become equal to that in the United States, and to a lesser extent in
Japan and in the United Kingdom, reaching roughly 70% and 90% of the U. S. level.


3.   LOOKING MORE CLOSELY AT PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH IN
     THE 1980-2006 PERIOD

In Section 3.1 we first focus on the changes in productivity growth over the five or ten year
sub-periods 1980-1990, 1990-1995, 1995-2000 and 2000-2006, then in Section 3.2 we


5
 Cette and Bourlès (2007) have made the case that two thirds of the slowdown in US productivity
growth over this sub-period can be accounted for by a rise in the employment rate and a smaller
decline in working hours, with strong diminishing returns in both variables.


                                                                                             9
consider and comment on the specific contribution to growth of the rapid and pervasive
diffusion of information and communication technologies (ICT) during these sub-periods.


3.1   Changes in productivity growth

Our estimates of employee and hourly productivity growth and the contributions of non-
ICT and ICT capital deepening and TFP are presented by sub-periods in Table 3, and in the
corresponding Graph 4 (in the same format as Table 2 and Graph 3).


During sub-period 1980-1990, employee productivity growth was the highest in Japan with
an average rate of 2.7% per year, followed by France and the United Kingdom with a rate
close to 2%, and it was the lowest in the United States with a rate of 1.4% (still, a much
higher average rate than the 0.2% recorded in the previous sub-period 1973-1980). Hourly
productivity growth was much faster in both Japan and France (close to 3%) than in the
United Kingdom (2.0%) and the United States (1.4%). The growth differential in hourly
productivity between Japan and France on the one hand and the United Kingdom and the
United States on the other can be accounted for by a higher TFP contribution (1.5% and
1.7% as against 1.0% and 0.8%), as well as a greater contribution of capital deepening
(1.6% and 1.2% as against 1.0% and 0.6%).


Over the sub-period 1990-1995, productivity growth differed widely across countries. In
the United States, it was slightly slower than in the previous sub-period 1980-1990,
corresponding to a slower TFP growth. In the United Kingdom, employee and hourly
productivity growth increased sharply (by 0.7% and 0.8% respectively). A large share of
this acceleration is due to a higher contribution of capital deepening. In France, employee
and hourly productivity growth slowed considerably, both by about 1.0%. This slowdown
reflects almost entirely that in TFP growth (which declined by 1.0%), and probably
corresponds to a strong cyclical component given the decrease in GDP growth. The
stronger TFP growth characteristic of France as compared to the United Kingdom and the
United States thus came to an end in the early 1990s. In Japan, employee and hourly
productivity growth also slowed down considerably, by 1.8% and 0.7% respectively. As in



                                                                                        10
France, this slowdown appears to be mostly related to a corresponding slowdown in TFP
growth.


The sub-period 1995-2000 is characterized by a significant rise in GDP growth in France,
the United Kingdom and the United States (by roughly 1.5% per year), but not in Japan
where GDP growth slowed even further than previously (by 0.5%). As in the first half of
the 1990s, productivity growth has developed differently in the four countries. In the
United Kingdom, per hour and hourly productivity growth slowed down by approximately
0.5% per year, due to a lower contribution of non-ICT capital deepening and of TFP. In
France, it remained stable, the acceleration in TFP being offset by a slowdown in non-ICT
capital deepening (by 0.6%). This slowdown may result partly from the implementation of
policies designed to enhance the labor intensity of growth, in particular reducing working
time and cutting social contributions targeted at low skilled workers (see Cette, 2004). In
the United States, productivity growth gained approximately 1% due to faster TFP growth.
According to Gordon (2005), the fact that productivity accelerates in the United States but
slows down in Europe can be attributed to several factors, among which are a
predominance of ICT-producing industries, public policies that promote entrepreneurship,
and better synergy between public research, private research and the financing of
innovation. Finally, in Japan TFP growth remained stable and the slowdown in
productivity is entirely due to a slowdown in non-ICT capital deepening.


The last sub-period 2000-2006 is characterized by a slowdown in productivity (about 0.4%)
in France and the United-Kingdom and a small acceleration in productivity in the other two
countries (by 0.2%). This is mainly accounted for by a smaller contribution of ICT capital
deepening in the United Kingdom, of TFP in France, a higher contribution of capital
deepening in the United States and of TFP in Japan.


To conclude, the productivity per employee and per hour graphs show that growth was
mostly higher in the United States over the period 1995-2006 than in the other three
countries, implying that the catching-up process had slowed or stopped. This result is due
to higher growth in both ICT and non-ICT capital intensity and also in TFP (mainly due to


                                                                                        11
ICT-producer industries, see below) in the U.S., in comparison with the previous period.
Therefore the success of the United States’ productivity growth relative to the other three
countries over the period 1995-2006 is due to ICT but not to ICT alone.


3.2       The contribution of ICTs to productivity

A number of studies (see for example Cette, Mairesse and Kocoglu 2002 and 2005b for a
review of the literature) have tried to assess the contribution of ICTs to GDP and
productivity growth, many of them relying on macroeconomic evidence and on the growth
accounting framework. Most, if not all, of these studies conclude that ICTs have had a
positive and significant impact over the past two decades, via two main channels:


      •    Substitution effects linked to the accumulation of ICT capital (capital deepening),
           which itself results from the continuous and rapid improvements in the productive
           performance of ICT investments, leading to a sharp fall in the price of ICT relative
           to other capital goods and labor. To take the most striking case, in the United States
           over the 1980-2004 period the price of computer hardware has decreased at an
           average yearly rate of 15%, while the GDP price deflator increased at an average
           yearly rate of 3%.


      •    TFP gains largely driven by rapid technological progress in the different ICT-
           producing industries.


As stressed in Cette, Mairesse and Kocoglu (2000), the relative importance attached to
these two effects in growth accounting analyses depends to a great extent on the
methodological choices and practices of statisticians and national accountants in measuring
the prices of ICT and using them to construct real ICT investment series from nominal ICT
investment. The more the estimation of price changes takes into account the improvements
in ICT performance (through substantially upgraded products or new products), by relying
in particular on hedonic methods, the larger is the contribution of capital deepening to
productivity gains and the lower that of TFP, and conversely.


                                                                                              12
In what follows, we first briefly comment on the estimates of the ICT investment ratios to
GDP in the four countries, then on the changes in ICT prices. We finally focus on the
comparison of our estimates of the ICT capital deepening contribution to productivity
growth across the four countries and with other studies.


a) ICT investment ratios to GDP
Measuring ICT investment in nominal terms already raises a number of difficulties. Putting
aside the problem of the availability and reliability of series long enough to estimate
capital stocks and services by implementing the (misleadingly called) permanent inventory
method, a major difficulty is the breakdown between investment and intermediate
consumption of total ICT expenditures, and another one is the measurement of investments
in custom software and the purchase of prepackaged software. The solutions adopted by
national accountants have differed between countries as well as over time.


For example, following the OECD recommendations on the international harmonization of
the methods for measuring software investment, INSEE, the French National Institute for
Statistics and Economic Studies, changed its methods for breaking down software
expenditures between intermediate consumption and investment on the one hand, and for
measuring custom software expenditures on the other. As a result, the amount of software
investment in 1999 rose from 11 billion Euros in the previous 1995-based national
accounts to 21 billion Euros in the current 2000 base, that is a 90% increase. In the United
Kingdom, Chesson and Chamberlin (2006) have shown that the methodological change in
the measurement of software investment, particularly own account software, has led to a
rise in the ratio of total software investment to GDP from 0.8% to 1.8% in 1999. These
measurement difficulties also affect, but to a lesser extent, the estimation of ICT hardware
investment. The estimates presented here are based on the most recent available statistics
from all the countries, and therefore different from those in the older comparable studies.6


6
 For France, these estimates are updated versions of those given in Mairesse, Cette and Kocoglu,
2000, which can be referred to for more details on the assumptions and problems involved in the
different steps of the calculations of ICT capital and its contribution to growth.


                                                                                             13
Looking at Appendix Graph 1, which shows the ICT to GDP investment ratios in the four
countries, we observe the following:


   •   In 1980, ICT investment in the United States accounted for 2% of GDP against
       only 1.2% in France and the United Kingdom and 1.4% in Japan. By 2005, the
       share of ICT investment to GDP had increased by a factor of two in the four
       countries;


   •   Overall, the ICT investment ratio to GDP has evolved similarly in the four
       countries. It accelerated from 1980 to 1985 and from 1995 to 2000, and remained
       stable, or even declined, from 1985 to 1994, and dropped slightly between 2001
       and 2005;


   •   The burst of the Internet bubble in 2000-2001 led to a substantial fall in the ICT
       investment ratio in the four countries. In the United Kingdom and the United States
       particularly, the ICT investment ratio fell from 4.9% to 3.6% between 2000 and
       2005. Such a decline in ICT investment appears to be a correction to overshooting at
       the end of the 1990s, partly fuelled by the financial market dotcom euphoria and the
       investment due to the possibility of a Y2K bug.


b) Changes in ICT prices
As already mentioned, perhaps the major difficulty, and hence the major uncertainty, in
measuring the contribution of ICT capital deepening to growth lies in the measurement of
changes in the prices of ICT products, which have had very rapid quality improvements in
the recent past. Price statisticians and national accountants are gradually adopting hedonic
methods to adjust prices for such quality improvements. However, there are substantial
differences in the way in which different countries apply these methods. To avoid that such
differences affect our comparison, and considering that ICT products with basically
comparable characteristics are produced or imported everywhere in the developed world,
we chose to rely only on the United States national accounts price indices for ICT


                                                                                         14
products. Precisely, we have assumed that, relative to the overall GDP price index, the
quality adjusted prices for the three ICT product categories that can be distinguished in the
national accounts (i.e., computer hardware, software and communication equipment) are
the same in France, Japan and the United Kingdom as in the United States. This method,
proposed by Colecchia and Shreyer (2001), seems realistic enough for developed countries
and better than relying on national accounts data for ICT products that are not yet based on
harmonized methods for quality adjustment.


Appendix Table 8 gives the overall ICT price average yearly growth rates by sub-period in
the four countries calculated by weighting the price growth rates for computer hardware,
software and communication equipment. The differences between countries arise from (i)
differences in the GDP price growth rates and (ii) differences in the composition of ICT
investments in computer hardware, software and communication equipment. Computer
hardware experienced the largest price fall relative to other ICT products.7 Over the 1980-
2005 period, the average annual decline in ICT prices was of the same magnitude in the
United Kingdom and the United States (roughly 5%). In Japan, ICT prices decreased
somewhat faster (by 5.7% per year) due to the slower growth of the GDP price (0.7%
compared to 3%) and the larger share of computer hardware.8 In France, the price decreased
less rapidly (by 4% per year) because of the smaller share of computer hardware and a faster
growth of the GDP price. The 1995-2000 period is that of the most pronounced decease in
ICT prices in the four countries, ranging from 6.7% per year in France to 9.5% per year in
Japan.


c) The contribution of ICT to productivity growth
The contribution of ICT to labor productivity growth is shown in Table 3 and Graph 4. The
main findings are the following:



7
 Between 1980 and 2005, computer hardware prices in the United States decreased at an average
annual rate of 15%, compared with roughly 1% per annum for both software and communication
equipment.
8
  On average over the 1980-2005 period, computer hardware accounted for 25% of ICT investment
in France, against 40% in the United Kingdom, 28% in the United States and 45% in Japan.


                                                                                          15
•   Over the entire 1980-2006 period, the contribution of ICT capital to productivity
    growth per hour is greater than that of non-ICT capital in the United States but less
    than that of non-ICT capital in the other three countries;


•   The contribution of ICT capital to average annual productivity growth (per
    employee or per hour) ranges, depending on the period, from 0.3 point to 0.7 point
    in the United States and the United Kingdom, from 0.3 point to 0.6 point in Japan
    and finally from 0.2 point to 0.3 point in France. The ICT investment ratio is
    roughly the same in the United Kingdom and the United States (see Appendix
    Graph 1), and the contribution of ICT to productivity growth is also the same. This
    important ICT impact can be attributed to the significantly faster average annual
    growth rate of the capital stock due to the rapid decrease in the global ICT price
    index (see Appendix Table 8). Compared to previous studies, the result that the
    contribution to productivity growth of ICT capital deepening was the same in the
    United Kingdom and in the United States can be attributed to the improvement in
    the measures of ICT investment in the United Kingdom from using a more
    appropriate price index. In France and Japan, the investment ratio is low and the
    annual growth rate of ICT capital per capita is slightly lower than in the United
    States;


•   In all four countries, the contribution of ICT capital is the largest over the 1995-
    2000 period. It amounts to roughly 0.7 point in the United States and the United
    Kingdom, 0.6 point in Japan and 0.3 point in France. At the same time, the
    contribution of other equipment and buildings declined considerably in France,
    Japan and the United Kingdom compared with the previous period (about 1%). The
    faster decline in ICT prices over this period (Appendix Table 8) seems to have
    accelerated the substitution between ICT capital and non-ICT capital;


•   Lastly, after 2000, the fall in ICT investment is directly reflected in the contribution
    of ICT capital to productivity growth. This effect is the less pronounced in France
    (-0.1% and -0.2% to -0.3% in the other three countries). Except in Japan, this


                                                                                         16
       period was also marked by an increase in the contribution of non-ICT capital
       deepening to productivity growth in all countries, particularly in the United States
       (about 0.4%).


Cette and Lopez (2008) analyze in more detail the ICT diffusion gap among major
industrialized countries vis à vis the United States during the period 1981-2005. Their
results confirm the (positive) impact of the share of the population having completed
higher education and the (negative) impact of market rigidities on ICT diffusion. These
effects are heightened when ICT diffusion is already substantial. Compared to the United
States, the lower ICT diffusion in the United Kingdom is explained by a shortfall in
highly educated employees and for France and Japan by both lower shares of highly
educated workers and also by higher market rigidities.


On the whole, the results presented here are in keeping with those obtained in the most
recent international comparative studies, such as those by Jorgenson and Kuong (2005),
the OECD (2003) or Van Ark and Piatkowski (2004), presented in Appendix Table 6. As
regards France, they are consistent with our previous assessments (see Cette, Mairesse
and Kocoglu, 2005b). For the United Kingdom, they are not directly comparable to the
recent assessments by Oulton and Srinivasan (2005) on the market economy; although
their profile is similar, the contribution of ICTs is lower than in our estimates. According
to these authors, the contribution of ICT capital deepening accounts for 0.7% of the
average annual increase in hourly labor productivity between 1979 and 1990 and for
1.0% over the 1990-2000 period. As regards the United States, although the scope of the
economy covered is different, our results are very close to those of Jorgenson, Ho and
Stiroh (2006, 2008), and Oliner, Sichel and Stiroh (2007), presented in Appendix Table
7. As regards Japan, our estimates are close to those of Jorgenson and Kuong (2005) for
the 1990s but they show a greater decrease in the contribution of ICT capital-deepening
to growth during the period 2000-2006 (see Appendix Table 6).


As mentioned above, national accountants are faced with a number of methodological
problems when assessing ICT investment expenditure and establishing the volume-price


                                                                                         17
breakdown.     However,     since   national   accountants   have    been    following   the
recommendations of the OECD-Eurostat Software Task Force, the measure of investment
in software is more homogenous across countries.


4.   CONCLUSION

The results of our study, in spite of being highly aggregated and confirming facts for many
of them already known, are nevertheless striking. Possibly the most thought provoking
findings are the far-reaching changes in the relative economic situation in France, Japan,
the United States and the United Kingdom over the long period. While all four countries
have experienced very rapid economic growth and extraordinary productivity gains, the
past 120 years have also been characterized by the long relative decline of the United
Kingdom until WW2, the impressive catching-up of Japan which came to a stop in the
1990s and that by France at least until recently.


At present, total factor productivity is very close in the four countries except Japan, where
it is still significantly lower. However, hourly labor productivity is slightly higher in
France than in the United States, significantly lower in the United Kingdom, and even
lower in Japan. Furthermore, productivity per employee is slightly lower in France than in
the United States, much lower in the United Kingdom and even lower in Japan. These
differences reflect the more or less contrasting developments during the various periods of
the analysis, associated with varying contributions of capital deepening and the downward
trend in working hours.


Between 1890 and 2006, a faster drop in working time accounts for roughly 25% of the
differential in the growth of productivity per employee between France and the United
States, and just about 5% of that between the United Kingdom and the United States.
Similarly, over the same period, the lower contribution of capital deepening explains 15%
of the differential in the growth of productivity per employee between France and the
United States and almost 25% of that between the United Kingdom and the United States.
The other growth factors underlying total factor productivity account for 100% of France’s


                                                                                          18
catching-up with American labor productivity and for 40% of the decline in British labor
productivity compared with the United States. These other growth factors (i.e. working
hours and capital deepening “being equal”) would thus account for the almost three-fold
increase in French labor productivity compared with the United Kingdom, i.e. an average
annual growth differential over 116 years of 1.0%.


It thus appears that the productivity catching-up process differs strongly among countries
and periods. The three important questions are then: (i) why do some countries (and not
others) benefit at certain periods (and not others) from a productivity catching-up of the
highest country level? (ii) What are the determinants of the speed of this catching-up
process when it happens? (iii) Why is this catching-up process achieved for some countries
but ends before being achieved for others? Important recent literature suggests that these
differences can mainly be explained by the education level of the working age population
and by institutional aspects, such as rigidities in labor, product and financial markets.


However, the respective contribution of each of these different factors has not been
precisely assessed. There is no consensus in the empirical literature on the effect of labor
and product markets rigidities on growth. Numerous studies assess very disparate results:
either no effect, or a positive or a negative impact (for a survey emphasising this diversity,
see Babetskii and Campos, 2007).


In recent analysis, Aghion and Howitt (2006) and Aghion et al. (2009) stress that the
education level and rigidities in labor and product markets have different effects depending
on whether a country is far from or close to the technological frontier. We know that in the
current period market rigidities are, at an aggregate level, the highest in Japan and the
lowest in the United States, with France and the United Kingdom being in an intermediate
situation. Such higher market rigidities in France, Japan and the United Kingdom than in
the United States may have penalized them more in recent years when they are much
closer to the United States technological frontier than during the period 1950-1980 when
they were much farther from it. This might explain in part why the catching-up process




                                                                                            19
with the United States productivity has ended in the last two decades before being
completely achieved for France, the United Kingdom and mainly Japan.




                                                                               20

    Box 1: The growth accounting approach to estimating the contribution
    of TFP and capital deepening
    Solow (1956, 1957) was one of the first proponents of the “growth accounting
    approach” to assess the contributions of the main factors of production to economic
    growth, in particular capital deepening and “total factor productivity”, or TFP.9
    Assuming that the production possibilities may be represented using a production
    function with a multiplicative TFP term (standing for autonomous technical progress
    and other unmeasured factors), we can write:

                                        Y = TFP. F(Kj, Li)

    where Y denotes the production output and Kj and Li represent respectively the services of
    the various types capital and labor (or other variable inputs). With a Cobb-Douglas
    production function, with labor considered as homogeneous (which is the case in the
    present study), and taking logarithms and first differences (corresponding approximately
    to growth rates), we obtain the following linear relation:

                                  Δy = Δ tfp + ∑j αjΔkj + βΔl
    where αj and β are the elasticities of output with respect to the inputs Kj and L.

    Assuming also unit (constant) returns to scale (i.e. ∑j αj + β = 1), the growth rate of
    output can be written as the sum of the growth rate of each input weighted according to its
    production elasticity and the growth rate of TFP. Growth accounting can also be
    presented in terms of labor productivity accounting (assuming constant returns to scale),
    as follows, respectively in log-levels and log-growth rates:

               (y-l) = tfp + ∑j αj(kj-l)     and(Δy-Δl) = Δtfp + ∑j αj(Δkj-Δl).

    In order to implement such decomposition, it is necessary to have data on output, labor
    and capital. In macroeconomic analyses, these data are available in national accounts. The
    sources used in this study are detailed in Box 2. It is also necessary to measure the output
    elasticities with respect to the different inputs. In addition to the hypothesis of constant
    returns to scale, it is generally assumed that production factors are remunerated at their
    marginal productivity (at least over the medium to long term), which means that it is
    possible to estimate the factor elasticities on the basis of the share of their remuneration
    (cost) in total income (or total cost). Given that labor costs (wages and related taxes and
    social security contributions) represent roughly two thirds of income, we simply took here
    β = 0.7 and therefore ∑i αi = 0.3. Note also that we have taken as the measure of capital K
    used in year t the stock of capital installed at the end of year (t-1).

    For a history of growth accounting and TFP (“the residual“), see Griliches (1996) and Maddison
    (2007).


                                                                                               26
TFP is thus measured as a “residual”: it is the contribution to labor productivity that is not
attributable to all factors not considered explicitly in the growth accounting
decomposition. Although such analysis does not provide causal explanations and is
mainly descriptive, it can be useful for making comparisons and looking for the sources
of differences in productivity levels and growth rates between periods and countries.

In our study, the volume of labor L is written as L = N*H where N is the level of
employment and H the average annual working time, and the decomposition of
productivity is presented either in terms of productivity per employee or productivity per
hour on the basis of the two following relations:

  (y-n) = tfp + ∑j αj(kj –n) + (1 -∑j αj)h or Δ(y-n) = Δtfp + ∑j αjΔ(kj -n) + (1 -∑j αj)Δh

                (y-l) = tfp + ∑j αj(kj-l)   or   Δ(y-l) = Δtfp + ∑j αjΔ(kj-l)

In Table 1 and Graph 2, we present TFP level in France, Japan and the United Kingdom
as a % TFP level. of the United States, where TFP level is computed as:
             Y /L
TFP =                    .
       ∏ j ( K j / L)α j

Box 2: Data Sources
The data sources on which we rely in this study are historical or national accounts series,
which we put together to construct indicators over the very long term or, in the case of
ICT, over the past few decades. In order to avoid breaks in these indicators, for sources
from the more distant periods we calculated them using growth rates applied to the
available historical and national accounts series.

In order to compare the levels of variables, we first expressed them in constant domestic
currency terms on the basis of the year 2000, and then converted them into 2000 constant
dollar terms, using the PPP exchange rates derived implicitly from PPP 2000 constant
dollar GDP estimates provided by Maddison (2003).

The most commonly used databases are those of Maury and Pluyaud (2004), Cahn and
Saint-Guilhem (2006) and Kocoglu (2001), which we respectively denote by (a), (b) and
(c) in what follows.

GDP (gross domestic product)

   prior to 1959;
 – Japan: National accounts for the period 1994-2006, OECD for the period 1970-1994
   and Maddison (2001, 2003) for the period prior to 1970;

   and Development Centre (GGDC) and Feinstein (1976) for the period prior to 1955a;
 – United States: National accounts (BEA) for the period 1929-2006b and Mitchell
   (1998)a for the period prior to 1929.

 – France: National accounts from OECD for the period 1970-2006, GGDC for the
   period 1959-1970 and Villa (1994)a for the period prior to 1959;
 – Japan: OECD for the period 1970-2006, GGDC for the period 1959-1970 and
   Maddison (2001, 2003) for the period prior to 1959;
 – United Kingdom: OECD for the period 1970-2006, GGDC for the period 1959-1980
   and Feinstein (1976)a for the period prior to 1959;
 – United States: National accounts for the period 1970-2006b, GGDC for the period
   1959-1970 and Mitchell (1998)a for the period prior to 1959.

Working time (average number of hours worked per year, per worker)
– For the four countries: OECD for the period 1970-2006; GGDC for the period 1950-
   1969; Maddison (2001) for 1870, 1913 and 1950; linear interpolation for the periods
   1890-1913, 1913-1950.




                                                                                         28
Investment
 – France: National accounts for the period 1959-2006, Maddison (1993) for the period
    1935-1959, Levy-Leboyer (1978)c for the period 1820-1935. The breakdown of total
    GFCF between equipment and buildings is taken from Villa (1994) for the period
    1820-1935;
 – Japan: National accounts for the period 1980-2006 and Maddison (1993) for the
    period prior to 1980;
 – United Kingdom: National accounts for the period 1965-2006b and Maddison (1993)
    for the period prior to 1965;
 – United States: National accounts for the period 1967-2006b and Maddison (1993) for
    the period prior to 1967.

ICT investment
-    France: GGDC (EUKLEMS) for the period 1970-2005;
-    Japan: GGDC (EUKLEMS) for the period 1970-2004;
-    United Kingdom: GGDC (EUKLEMS) for the period 1970-2005;
-    United States: GGDC (EUKLEMS) for the period 1970-2005 and trend from the
     BEA for the market economy for the period 1959-1969.

Fixed capital
 – Fixed capital series are constructed on the assumption that the annual depreciation
    rates are: 2.5% for buildings, 10% for non-ICT equipment, 15% for communication
    equipment and 30% for computer hardware and software. The coefficients used to
    take into account WW1 and WW2 damages in France are taken from Villa (1994)c.
    For Japan, WW2 damages are implicitly taken into account by using the Maddison
    (1993) growth rate for the period prior to 1946. For this country, the WW2 damage
    coefficients are those proposed by the Bank of Japan (1966), and the Maddison
    depreciation assumption (1993) are consistent with ours.

Prices of ICT products
 – The relative ICT price indexes (compared to GDP prices) for France, Japan and the
    United Kingdom are the same as those taken from the United States national
    accounts (see Colecchia and Shreyer, 2001, for detailed discussion about this
    procedure).
