       Prucha   and Nadiri   (1982,1986,1988) introduced a   methodology to estimate

systems of dynamic factor demand that allows for         considerable flexibility in
both   the choice of the functional form of the technology and the expectation

formation process. This paper applies this methodology to estimate the

production structure, and the demand for labor, materials, capital and R&D by

the U.S. Bell System. The paper provides estimates for short—, intermediate—

and long—run price and output elasticities of the inputs, as well as estimates

on the rate of return on capital and R&D. The paper also discusses the issue

of   the   measurement of technical change if    the   firm Is in temporary rather than

long-run equilibrium and the technology is not assumed to be linear

homogeneous       The paper provides estimates for input      and output based

technical     change as well as for returns to    scale. Furthermore, the paper

gives a decomposition of the traditional measure of total           factor productivity

     In Prucha and Nadiri (1982) we Introduced a methodology to estimate

systems of dynamic factor demand that allows for considerable flexibility in

both the choice of the functional form of the technology and the expectation

formation process. This approach was explored further in Prucha and Nadiri

(1986). It Is based on a firm with a finite but shifting planning horizon.

The stocks at the end of the planning horizon are determined endogenously via

the assumption that the firm maintains a constant firm size and static

expectations beyond the actual planning horizon. Prucha and Nadiri (1982)

introduced also a corresponding estimation algorithm that avoids the need for

an explicit analytic solution of the firm's control problem and show how at

the same time it is possible to evaluate (for reasons of numerical efficiency)

the gradient of the statistical objective function from analytic expressions.

A generalization of the algorithm is given in Prucha and Nadiri (1988).

     In this paper we apply the methodology of Prucha and Nadiri (1982) to

estimate the production structure and the demand for labor, materials, capital

and R&D in the historic U.S. Bell System.   (The merits of the breakup f the

U.S. Bell System is still an Item of considerable debate. In future research

it seems of interest to compare the historic U.S. Bell System with several of

the currently operating telephone companies. )   We consider alternative

specifications of the length of the planning horizon and the expectation

formation process; we compare, in particular, results obtained from the finite

horizon model with those from an infinite horizon model. The empirical

application to the U.S. Bell System not only provides an illustration of the

methodology but also contributes several new features to the existing

 literature on the production structure of AT&T. First, we formulate and




                                        1
estimate a dynamic model in contrast to the static models that were usually

applied to AT&T data.2 Schankerman and Nadiri (1986) find evidence to reject

the hypothesis that for AT&T all factors are variable. Second, contrary to

conventional studies we include R&D as a factor of production. R&D should be

of particular importance in a high technology firm like AT&T.3

     As a description of the technology we introduce a new restricted cost

function that generalizes the restricted cost function introduced by Denny,

Fuss and Waverman (1981a) and Morrison and Berndt (1981) from the linear

homogeneous to the homothetic case. Furthermore, we discuss measures of

technical change if the firm is in temporary rather than long—run equilibrium

and if the technology is not a priori assumed to be linear homogeneous.

     The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we describe the

theoretical model under both the assumption of a finite and infinite planning

horizon, and derive the factor demand equations used in the empirical

analysis. In Section 3 we present the parameter estimates of the model

corresponding to different planning horizons and expectation regimes.

Adjustment cost characteristics as well as price and output elasticities of

the inputs in the short—, intermediate— and long—run are presented in Section

4. Section 5 deals with the formulation of pure measures of technical change

and the measurement of returns to scale. In Section 6 we provide a

decomposition of the traditional measure of total factor productivity growth

into components attributable to technical change, scale and the adjustment

costs. We also provide a decomposition of the growth of output and labor

productivity. Section 7 deals with the calculation of rates of return on

physical and R&D capital. The conclusions are contained In Section 8 followed

by a brief technical appendix.

2.      Theoretical Model and Empirical Specification

2.1 Theoretical Model

        Consider a firm that employs in variable inputs V                    (i1,...,m) and n

quasi-fixed inputs X (j1                    n) in producing the single output good Y.

The firm's production process Is described by the following generalized

production function:


(1)          Y = F(V ,X ,X ,T
              t     t t—i  t t



where Vt = (Vt }1=1is the vector of variable inputs, Xt = (X )"                         is the
                                                            )t J=i

vector of end—of—period stocks of quasi—fixed factors, L.                    is   a technology

index, (and t denotes time). The vector                    =        -
                                                               X,       X1   appears in the

production function to model Internal adjustment costs in terms of forgone

output due to changes in the quasi—fixed factors.               It is assumed that F(.)

is twice continuously differentiable and that                  > 0, F        > 0 and Fii <

        It is furthermore assumed that the production function Is Strictly

concave in all arguments (except possibly in the index of technology). This

implies that the marginal products of the factors of production V and X1

are decreasing and that the marginal adjustment costs are Increasing.

        The stocks of the quasi—fixed factors accumulate according to (j=1,. ..                  ,n)

(2)          x = I      + (i—3 )X

where         denotes gross Investment and               denotes the depreciation rate.

        The firm Is asstimed to face perfectly competitive markets with respect to

its factor inputs. We denote the acquisition price for the variable and

quasi—fixed factors as w             (1=1       m) and         (j=l,...,n), respectively.

It proves convenient to normalize all prices in terms of the price of the




                                                 3
first variable factor. We denote those normalized prices as w                                       =

and       q =   q1/w             and define vectors w =            {W}m2 and q =
          Instead of describing the production structure in terms of the production
function (1) we can describe the productions structure equivalently in terms

of the normalized restricted cost function. Let {V} denote the cost

minimizing variable factor inputs needed to produce output V                                      conditional on

X         and tX t        then the normalized restricted cost function is defined as
    t—1



(3)             G(w ,X          ,AX ,Y ,T )        =      w V
                    t     t—1         t    t   t       1=1 it It


This function has the following properties (compare Lau (1976)):                                        < 0,

C         > 0 G Y> 0               C > 0. Furthermore G(. )           is convex in X—1               and X
    IxI                               w

and concave in w.

          The firm's cost in period t is given by


(4)             C(X t,X i_—i      t
                                ,ir )

                                                                                   it
                                                                                        + A
                                                                                              t



where A denotes taxes (which will be specified In detail later on) and

is a vector composed of w,                                 T, as well as tax parameters.

          The firm is assumed to minimize the present value of current and future

costs. We consider two alternative specifications of the firm's optimization

problem regarding the length of the planning horizon. First consider the case

of an infinite planning horizon.                        In this case the firm's objective function

in period t Is assumed to be given by

                   =0
                        C(X

where E denotes the expectatIons operator conditional on information

available at the beginning of period t and r denotes the real discount

rate.     It Is assumed that in each period t                             the firm derives an optimal plan

for the quasi—fixed inputs for periods t.t+1,... such that (5) Is minimized

subject to the initial stocks X1 and information available at that time;

the firm then chooses its quasi—fixed inputs In period t according to this

plan.     (Note that in each period the firm only Implements the initial portion

of its optimal input plan.) The firm repeats this process every period. In

each period a new optimal plan is formulated as new information on the

exogenous variables becomes available and expectations on those variables are

modified accordingly.

        Next consider the case of a finite but shifting planning horizon.

Following Prucha and Nadiri (1982, 1986) we assume that the stocks of the

quasi—fixed Inputs at the end of the planning horizon are determined

endogenously subject to the assumption of static expectations and a constant

firm size beyond the planning horizon. This means that under the finite

horizon specification the firm minimizes (5) in each period t subject to the

                                  = X                             E
constraints           X
                        t+T             tT   and E ir
                                                      t t+t       t irt*T for r a T. As in the
infinite horizon case the process is repeated every period as new Information

becomes available. The firm's objective function can now be written as


(6)              T-r=OC(Xt+r ,Xt.t—1 ,Eit
                                       t t+t )(l+r)_T                 +   'I'(Xt.T ,Eu

by the firm from maintaining its operation beyond the (actual) planning

horizon at the same level as at the end of the (actual) planing horizon.

2.2 EmpIrical Specification
      For the empirical analysis we specialize the model to the use of two

variable inputs, labor (L) and materials (H), and two quasi—fixed factors, the

stock of physical capital (KI and the stock of R&D (R).                           In the subsequent

discussion we use the following notation: V =                     [V,V]       =    ELM]    where L

and M denote, respectively, labor input and material input; X =                                 [X,X]
=   [K,R]     where K       and R denote, respectively, the end of period stocks

of capital and R&D. Further w = v                     denotes the price of material goods,

and q1 =           and          = qR     denote the investment defiators for capital and
              qK

R&D normalized by the wage rate, respectively.

      The technology is (dropping subscripts t) modeled in terms of the

following normalized restricted cost functions

      It    is not difficult to see that the normalized restricted cost

corresponding to a homothetic production function is in general of the form

where H(Y) is a function in V.                  (The scale elasticity is then given by

H(Y)/EY(dH/dY)]; compare also Section 5.) We note that h(Y) can (apart from

a scaling factor) be viewed as a second order translog approximation of H(Y).

then FnH(Y)      const + p0tnY + p1nY2 =               const + Ln{YPo'l'} and therefore

H(Y)                    The restricted cost function (7) can hence be viewed as a

second order approximation to that of a general homothetic production

function. The functional form (7) Is a generalization of the restricted cost

function introduced by Denny, Fuss and Waverman (1981a) and Morrison and

Berndt (1991) from the constant returns to scale case to the homothetic case.

In case of constant returns to scale we have p =                                I and p =           0.

       Following Denny. Fuss and Waverman (1981a) and Morrison and Berndt (1981)

we impose parameter restrictions such that the marginal adjustment costs at

corporate tax rate, s is the rate of tax credit for gross investment, m is

the portion of the tax credit that must be deducted from the depreciable base,

d the portion of investment that can be depreciated after i years.

       We will explore the model under alternative assumptions on the planning

horizon and expectations on output. Expectations on relative prices and tax

parameters are taken as static. In case of an infinite planning horizon the

firm's objective is defined as to minimize (5) subject to (7) and (8). We

restrict the solution space for {Kt+T,R

The demand equations for the variable factors, labor and materials, are the

same as in the infinite horizon case. The estimating equations for the finite

horizon model are hence given by (ii), (12) and (14), with random errors added

to each of those equations. The next period plan values KT 1 and RT 1

appearing in (14) are unobservable but implicitly defined by (13).                                    In

principle we could solve (13) to obtain explicit analytic expressions for
 T
K       and RT           ,     and substitute those expressions into (14). However,

because of the complexity of the expressions involved this approach is quite

impractical even for short planning-horizons. We hence estimate the model

using the algorithm developed in Prucha and Nadiri (1982, 1988) for the full

information maximum likelihood estimator for systems of equations with

implicitly defined variables.8 This algorithm does not require an explicit

analytic solution for K1 and R but solves (13) numerically for those

values at each iteration step of the estimation algorithm, i.e. for each set

of trial parameter values. For numerical efficiency Prucha and Nadiri (1982,

1988) show how the algorithm can be designed such that the gradient of the




                                                                   10
log-likelihood function can be evaluated from analytic expressions rather than

by numerical differentiation.

     We note that under static output expectations the 'flnite horizon"

quasi—fixed factor demand equations (14) differ from the 'Infinite horizon"

3.   Estimation and Empirical Results

     We have estimated the production structure and factor demand for the Bell

System using data from 1951 to 1979. Data on 1967 constant dollar gross

output, capital, R&D, labor, and materials, as well as data on the rental

prices of capital and R&D, the wage rate, and material prices,              were taken from

sources provided by AT&T. The sources and construction of the data are

described in Nadiri and Schankerrnan (1981b). We used a simple time trend as

our technology index and a real discount rate of 4 percent.9 Data on output,

stocks of capital and R&D, labor and materials were used in mean scaled form;

prices were constructed conformably.

     For the finite horizon model we considered several different forms of

expectations, but because of need for brevity only the results              obtained for

two expectations processes are reported. First, in order to identify the true

effect of changing the planning horizon we consider (as in the infinite

horizon case) static expectations:         'j        = '1   for t = o,. . ,T.
                                                                        .       To generate

the second form of expectations we first estimate an AR model for               output1° and

then use the model to generate a sequence of rational expectations.

     We have tested several hypotheses (in addition to the hypothesis that the

adjustment paths of the two quasi fixed factors are separable, which was, as

 reported above, accepted). We first considered the hypothesis that the

 technology Is homogeneous, i.e., p—O, and accepted this hypothesis.11 The

 second hypothesis considered the absence of adjustment costs for both of the

 quasi—fixed factors, i.e.   a.. =   a..    = 0.       This hypothesis was clearly

 rejected; similarly the hypotheses of the absence of adjustment costs was

 rejected individually for K and R. This suggests that a static equilibrium

 model is inappropriate to describe the technology and the structure of factor




                                                12
demand of the Bell System. A similar conclusion was reached by Schankerman

and Nadiri (1986) using a different methodology.

     In Table 1 we present the estimation results for the infinite horizon

model with static expectations and of the 4-period and 10—period horizon

models with static and rational (output) expectations. We allowed for

autocorrelation of the disturbances in all equations. The estimation

technique used was full information maximum likelihood. The results reported

in Table 1 show good R2's for all four equations and models. The

DW—statistics generally do not suggest further autocorrelation. A comparison

of the likelihoods corresponding to static and rational expectations on output

suggests (somewhat informally) the rejection of the hypothesis of static

expectations in favor of rational expectations.

     The parameter estimates for the infinite and the 4—period horizon model

under static expectations are very similar. The largest change occurs in the

estimate for a.. which is about 90 percent higher for the 4-period horizon

model. The estimate of a.. changes only by 5 percent. We hypothesize from

this result that by expanding the planning horizon a bit more we should be

able to duplicate (in a numerical sense) the results of the infinite horizon

model under static expectations almost exactly with our finite horizon model.

This is borne out by the results reported in Table 1 for the 10—period

planning horizon. The results for the 10—period and infinite horizon model

under static expectations are essentially identical.12

     By allowing for nonstatic expectations we get further differences in our

parameter estimates, especially for a v, aR   ,   a   ,   aKX , a..

estimates for    form the 4-period horizon model with rational expectations

is 200 percent larger than that from the 4—period horizon model with static

expectations. We note, however, that the results for the 4-period and

10—period horizon model under rational expectations are again very similar.

     The above results suggest that the optimal plans for the finite horizon

model converge rapidly to those of the infinite horizon model as the planning

horizon increases.   (Similar evidence was reported by Prucha and Nadirl (1986)

for a somewhat different model under rational price and output expectations.

We note that this result may be viewed as a justification for why it may be

reasonable for a firm to only plan moderately ahead into the future (which is

what firms actually do). Additional planning costs will very quickly exceed

additional gains from extending the planning horizon. To put it differently,

the length of the planning horizon does matter for the investment decision of

the firm. However once a reasonable horizon is identified, the finite horizon

model approximates the infinite horizon model very well.

     In principle, we can estimate all of the technology parameters from the

variable factor demand equations, i.e. the labor and material demand equation,

alone. Those equations are essentially unaffected by the choice of the

planning horizon and the form of the expectations. By estimating the labor

and material equations jointly with the demand equations for capital and R&D

we hope to increase the precision of our estimates. We can, however, only

expect Improvements If the demand equations for the quasi-fixed factors and In

particular the expectations entering those equations are properly specified.

In light of this remark we would not expect that different forms of

expectations and different choices for the length of the planning horizon

affect all estimates of model parameters equally. Not surprisingly we find




                                       16
the main changes in estimates for parameters that determine the adjustment

path of capital and R&D (while the estimates of other parameters that

determine characteristics of the technology such as scale are essentially

unaffected).

4.      Adlustment Costs, Price and Output Elasticities

4.1. Adlustment Process

        For the infinite horizon model the optimal paths for the quasi-fixed

factors capital and R&D are described by the flexible accelerator equations

(10).     In each period a fraction of the difference between the initial stocks

of capital and R&D and the respective long—run optimal values are closed.

(Note that the long—run optimal values, i.e. the targets, are changing over

time in response to changes in the variables exogenous to the firm's input

decisions. )     These fractions correspond to the adjustment coefficients m

and mRR.       For the finite horizon model the optimal input path has no exact

accelerator representation. Still, since the expressions for the adjustment

coefficients in (lOc) only depend on the technology parameters and the

discount rate, we can pose the question of what values for in KX     and mRE   are

implied    by the estimates of the technology parameters obtained from the finite

horizon models.

        Table 2 contains estimates of implied adjustment coefficients for capital

and R&D, m         and m, for the infinite horizon model under static

expectations and the four-period horizon model under static and rational

expectations. The estimates of the adjustment coefficients for capital are

quite different from those for R&D. The estimates for mKK vary between 0.94

and 0.83 and those for m          between 0.24 and 0.21. The estimates for m
                             RB

 and    mRB obtained under the assumption of rational expectations are about 10

 percent smaller than those obtained under the assumption of static

 expectations.

        To give some indication of the disequilibrium (from a long—run

perspective) in the factor Inputs we have calculated for the infinite horizon

model with static expectations the percentage difference of actual values from

long—run optimal values for respective inputs. These deviations are given In

Table 3.     The long-run optimal values for capital and R&D, K and                                                               are

defined by (10); the long—run optimal values for labor and material, L                                                             and

   are obtained by substituting K: and R        into (11).

     At the beginning of the sample period labor and materials exceeded

considerably the long—run optimal values; the reverse is true for capital and

R&D. Over time there have been changes in the extent to which actual and long

—run optimal values differ. For the variable inputs, labor and materials, as

well as for capital the (absolute) difference between actual and long—run

optimal values declined substantially in the 1950's. The gap between the

actual stock of R&D and the long-run optimal value widened in the late 1950's,

then declined throughout the 1960's.   It widened again slightly in the 1970's;

still, the size of the shortfall in the actual stock of R&D from the long—run

optimal value in 1979 is about 65'!. higher than in 1951.




4.2. Elasticities
                                                                              of
     Tables 4 and 5 contain, respectively, price and output elasticities

the demand for capital, R&D, labor and materials. Elasticities calculated

from estimates obtained from the 4-period, 10—period and infinite horizon

model under static expectations were found to be quite similar.    Likewise

 elasticities calculated from estimates obtained from the 4—period and

 10—period horizon model under rational expectations were found   to be similar.

 In Tables 4 and 5 we hence only report elasticities corresponding to estimates

 of the 4—period horizon model with static and rational output expectations,

 respectively.13 Short—run, intermediate— and long—run elasticities are,

 respectively, evaluated at t+t with t=O, r1 and r.
      The own—price elasticities for both capital and R&D are small. The

 long—run own—price elasticity for capital varies between —0.25 and —0.28,     that

 for R&D between -0.12 and —0.14. The cross—price elasticities of R&D are

The symbols SR, JR and LR refer to the short-run, intermediate-run and
long-run.




The respective estimates for the short—run output elasticity of capital are

0.60 and 0.54, those of R&D are 0.14 and 0.15. The estimates of the short-run

output elasticity of materials and labor show that both factors overshoot in

the short—run. The respective estimates of the short—run output elasticity of




                                                 22
materials are 1.53 and 1.56, those of labor are 1.38 and 1.29.

     The differences in the short—run output elasticities corresponding to

estimates obtained under the assumptions of static and rational output

expectations are sizable. Consider a change in output by, say, 7 percent.

(The average growth rate of output for AT&T over the sample period was 7.33

percent.) Then the implied differences In the estimated short-run demand for

the stock of capital, the stock of R&D, materials and labor would be

approximately -0.4, -0.1, -0.2, and 0.6 percent. The average ratios of net

capital and R&D investment to the stocks of capital and R&D over the sample

period were 5.9 percent and 6.3 percent respectively. Therefore the above

reported differences in the demand for stocks of capital and R&D translate

themselves Into big differences in Investment demand. The labor bill and the

materials bill of AT&T in 1967 were, respectively, 4329 and 1508 millions of

dollars. The above reported differences in the demand for labor and materials

hence imply significant dollar differences in how we expect variable costs to

react to changes in output.

5.   TechnIcal Change and Scale

     To avoid ambiguities we explicitly define measures for technical change

and scale within the context of our cost of adjustment technology,              I.e. within

the context of temporary equilibrium. In the following we use again the

general notation of Section 2 with V =             [V,V1   = [L,M1    and X =   [X,X]   =


EK,R].
        Let a(,V,X1,X,T) be the factor by which output can be increased for

given inputs if the technology index shifts by ,               i.e.    aF(V,X1,X,T) =

F(V,X,K,T+).             Similarly let b(,V,X,AX,T) be the factor by which all

inputs can be decreased for a given level of output If the technology index

shifts by ,            i.e.   F(V,X1,X,T) =   F(bV,bX,bX,T+).         We then define the

following "output and input based" measures of technical change:


(15a)              =   8(•)
                       ao
                                 — 1 8F
                                 —rr
(15b)              =   — ____      = 3F/[2      _V +                      +
                                                       =iax1Xj._i
         Let   u(A,V,X,tX,T) be the factor by which output increases if all

 inputs increase by the factor A,            I.e. uF(V,X1,X,T) = F(AV,AX,AtX,T).

Then the returns to scale, say c,             are defined as



 (15c)         c              1= =             v   +
                                                       iax     j..i
                                                                      +



Of course c =          A/A.     We note that the definitions adopted here are analogous

 to those given in Caves, Christensen and Swanson (1981) and Caves, Christensen

 and Diewert (1982a,b) for technologies without adjustment costs.

         The Lemma in the Appendix implies Immediately the following relationships

 between the derivatives of the production function F and the restricted cost




                                                24
                               14
function G=V
           1
             +wV:
               22

(16)        3F/8V1 =    1/taG/a?],                       aF/8V2 = w2/EÔG/8Y1,

            aF/aX1 = _[aG/aX,_11/IaG/aYI.                8F/aX = _EaG/8AX]/[3G/aY].
            F/8T = —I8G/aTI/EaG/3YI.

Consequently A and A, and hence c, can be written as follows in terms

of the restricted cost function G(.):


(17a)       A =    -   3G aG


(17b)          =   - /[G       -
                                   E=iax   Xj1          a    X1L

(17c)       c = (G      =iax71j, -

        Given our estimate for the restricted cost function G we can now
estimate technical change and scale from the above expressions.             Our estimates

for technical change and scale are quite stable over models.             (As remarked

above, this suggests that differences in the specification of expectations and

the length of the planning horizon mainly affect the estimates of the dynamic

characteristics of the model and not the estimates of basic technological

characteristics.) The estimates were also quite stable over time. In the

 following we report results for the 4—period horizon model with rational

 expectations. The estimate of scale,            c,   for 1967 is 1.60, suggesting that

 AT&T has experienced substantial economies of scale. This estimate is
                                                                       (1981b) and within
 somewhat lower than that reported in Nadiri and Schankerman
                                                                    and Schoech (1983).
 the range of estimates reported in Christensen, Cummings

 Our 1967 estimates for technical change A Y            and AX   are 0.60 and 0.37

 percent. Denny, Fuss and Waverman (1981b) report similar results for Bell




                                                 25
Canada.

       The expressions in (17) for output based and input based technical change

and scale In terms of the restricted cost function were given previously in

Nadiri and Prucha (1983, 1984). They generalize analogous expressions given

Caves, Christensen and Swanson (1981) for a model without explicit adjustment

costs and by Otha (1975) for a model where all factors are variable.           (We note

that the algebra employed here Is completely analogous to that used by Caves,

Christensen and Swanson. )       All results generalize trivially to the case of in

variable   and n quasi—fixed factors. Furthermore, the results can be readily

generalized along the lines of Caves, Christensen and Swanson to the multiple
               15
output case.

       The issue of a proper measure of technical change, given the firm is in

short-run or temporary equilibrium but not in long—run equilibrium, has also

been discussed, In particular, in recent papers by Rerndt and Fuss (1981,

1986), Hulten (1986), and Morrison (1983, 1986). Those papers relate the

proper measure of technical change to an adjustment of traditional measures in

terms of a capacity utilization measure.            Berndt, Fuss and Hulten consider

technologies with constant returns to scale. Morrison allows for (possibly)

non—constant returns to scale and works within an explicit dynamic framework.

Given our analysis also allows for (possibly) non—constant returns to scale

and Is based on an explicit dynamic framework it seems of interest to relate

our measures of technical change to those given by Morrison (and hence to that

in the papers by Berndt, Fuss and Hulten). Define total cost and shadow cost

shadow value for the j—th quasi—fixed factor and z =          -aG/8X   denotes the

shadow value of X. Consider the following traditional measure of technical

change defined in terms of the total cost function:       c    = -(aC/aT)/C.   Then

observing that C/8T = ÔG/8T         It follows immediately from (17a,b) that

Analogously,   let       =   (aC/aY)(Y/C) denote the output elasticity of total
cost. Then observing that ôc/8Y          aG/aY it follows immediately form (17c)

Morrison's    (1983,1986) measures of pure technical change (denoted in her paper

by c;.1 and e'1) correspond exactly to the expressions on the right hand

side of (19a) and (19b), and hence are identical to those considered here.

observation    that C /C can be viewed as a measure of capacity utilization

Morrison emphasizes that the derivation of a pure measures of technical change

from c       involves an adjustment in terms of capacity utilization to account

for temporary equilibrium. The approach taken here, and previously by Nadirl

and Prucha (1983, 1984), is to first look for a proper definition of technical

change on the production side and then to demonstrate how this measure can be

evaluated in terms of the restricted cost function. The two approaches

complement each other in terms of interpretation.       1'e emphasize the simplicity

in the algebra employed here.

6.      Decomposition of Total Factor Productivity and Output Growth

        Traditional measures of productivity growth assume, in particular, (1)

that all factors are variable, (2) that the technology exhibits constant

returns to scale, (3) that output and Input markets are perfectly competitive,

and (4) that factors are utilized at a constant rate. If any one of those

assumptions is not satisfied, traditional measures of total factor

productivity growth will not be pure measures of technical change.16 Given

traditional measures of total factor productivity growth are widely used, it

seems of interest to analyze the Composition of those measures if those

assumptions are possbily not satisfied.         (The question how to properly

estimate technical change under non—constant returns to scale and within a

dynamic    framework was   discussed in Section 5.

        Denny, Fuss and Waverman (1981b) and Nadiri and Schankerman (1981a,b)

consider technologies with non—constant returns to scale and provide, within a

static framework, a decomposition of the traditional measure of total factor

productivity growth into a part attributable to technical change and a part

attributable to economies of scale. A similar decomposition exists for our

cost of adjustment technology. More specifically, let IF? be the rate of

growth of total factor productivity as measured by the conventional Divisia

index and let ATFP be the corresponding Tornquist approximation defined as

where     tLnY   denotes   the growth rate of output and         denotes the growth

rate of a cost share weighted index of aggregate inputs. The index of

aggregate    inputs, N, is defined by

the adjustment costs. We refer to this effect as the temporary equilibrium

effect. The fourth term reflects the direct effect of the presence of tX in

the production function. We refer to this term as the direct adjustment cost

effect. in long—run equilibrium both of the last two terms are zero since

then eiax           +   c       = BG/AX       = 0.   Furthermore both of the last two terms are

zero if all factors (and hence the aggregate input index) grow at the same

        Based on (21) we have decomposed TFP for different types of model

specifications and different periods. We present in Table 6 the results for

the four-period horizon model with rational expectations. The results for the

other models were similar to those reported in this table. They indicate that

the scale effect is by far the most important contributor to total factor

productivity growth. The temporary equilibrium effect and the adjustment cost

effect are negligible and technical change contributes about 10 to 12 percent

to growth of total factor productivity. The contributions of scale and

technical change are comparable to those reported by Denny, Fuss and Waverman

(1981b) for Bell Canada. Average total factor productivity growth for the

Bell System was about 2.82 percent in 1952—1965; it declined slightly (2.71

percent) in 1965—1972, but increased substantially in 1972-1979 to 3.87

percent. This pattern is in sharp contrast to the behavior of total factor

productivity growth at the level of the total economy and many of the

industries (Nadiri (1981)) for the period 1972 to 1979.

restricted cost function obtained for the four-period horizon model with

rational expectations using the formulae given in (16). Decompositions based

on estimates from other models were again very similar to those reported in

Table 7.     The average growth rate of output of the Bell System has been very

high, about 7.33 percent per annum over the entire sample period. The

contributions of various inputs to the growth of output differ considerably.

The most significant source of the growth of output is the growth of capital

which contributes more than 50 percent to the growth of output. Materials and

labor Inputs contribute about 14 percent while the contribution of technical

change Is about half as much. Growth of R&D contributes about 2 percent

which, given its small share In the production cost, is fairly substantial.

The same pattern of contributions are evident over the time periods of

1952—1965, 1965—1972 and 1972—1979. The results suggest that most of the

growth of output is accounted for by the growth of the conventional inputs in

the Bell system.

The major component of labor productivity growth is again due to the growth of

capital and to a much lesser extent due to technical change, materials and

scale. Growth in R&D also contributed less than 1 percent to the growth of

labor productivity; the adjustment costs played a relatively small role in

reducing labor productivity.

7.     Averag Rate of Return on Physical and R&D Capital

       In the following we define a measure for the rate of return on the

investment expenditures on an individual factor in period t within the present

framework of a dynamic factor demand model; cp. also Mohnen, Nadiri and Prucha

(1986). In this paper we have assumed that the firm chooses its

inputs such that it minimizes, for a given output stream, the discounted value

of its costs. For expository reasons, consider for a moment a firm

whose objective is to maximize the discounted value of its net revenue stream:


(24)        °      fl(Vt,T ,Xt*T—i ,tXt+t )/(1+r)'

where    fl(V ,X     ,tX) denotes net revenues in period t.           (Since price

expectation have been taken to be static, we suppressed, for notational

simplicity, prices in the argument list of H.) Let {Xt•t ,V
                                                          t*t }
                                                              T=odenote
the optimizing input sequence.

        The firm Is assumed to realize the initial portion of its investment

plan. The firm's net investment expenditures on (say) the first quasi-fixed

factor are then given by X =                                 To calculate the net
                                            1(X1—X11).
returns from this investment we have to compare these returns with the returns

from an input sequence where that particular investment is not undertaken. To

capture the pure effect of the firm's investment we assume that this

alternative input sequence is conditionally optimal, i.e., optimal subject to

the condition that the firm's investment in the first quasi—fixed factor in

period t is not undertaken and hence zero. More formally, we consider as the

alternative input sequence, say {t+T            ,t.r} ,
                                                      t—O
                                                            the   input sequence that

maximizes (24) subject to the constraint X = 0.                   We now define as our rate
                                                       It

of   return the internal rate p that equates the present value of the

differences in the two net return streams with the initial investment

expenditure, i.e.,:


(25)
             it It   = U(V
                             t ,X
                               t—1,X it,X 2t) —      1T(V
                                                            t ,Xt—i ,0, 2t) +

            r=j {TT(Vt.r t+t—1 ,.X
                                   t.t   ) - TT(V
                                                    t.t ,X
                                                        t.t—i ,t,.r )}/(1p)_t
       The definition generalizes in an obvious way to the case of a finite

planning horizon. Further, in case of a cost—minimizing firm we can think of

establishing the respective input sequences by optimizIng (24) subject to the

output constraint. Formally, we can then still use (25) for the calculation

of the average rate of return on investment. However, since gross revenues

are identical for both input sequences we then effectively compare the

difference in cost streams.

       In Table 9 we present the estimated internal rates of return on net

investment in plant and equipment and R&D for the period 1952-1979 and for

three subperiods for both finite and infinite planning horizons and for both

static and rational expectations on output. These rates are net of the

adjustment costs and depreciation of the two quasi—fixed Inputs. They are

calculated using equation (25). The gross rate of return will be of course

much higher. The gross rate of return on capital will average about 13

percent and that on R&D about 30 percent. The magnitude and pattern of these

rates are quite comparable to what has been reported in the literature.18

       Several interesting points about these results should be noted: First,

the net average rates of return for capital and R&D are quite different; the

rate of return on R&D Is about two to five times larger than that on capital.

This result is consistent with the results reported in the literature

which show that the rate of return on R&D is much higher than that on physical

capital. Second, there are variations in the rates of return over time for

both capital and R&D. The return on physical capital is fairly stable from

1951 to 1972 at about 7 to 8 percent and then declines to an average rate of

return of 4 to 5 percent. The average rate of return on R&D is not only

higher than that on physical capital but seems to rise over time and therefore

the gap between the two rates widens substantially.

8.   Conclusions

     In Prucha and Nadirl (1982, 1986, 1988) we developed a methodology that

allows for the estimation of systems of dynamic   factor   demand without strong a

priori restrictions on the functional form of the technology and the

expectation formation process. In this paper we applied this methodology to

estimate the production structure and dynamic factor demand of AT&T. We

considered alternative assumptions concerning the planning horizon and the

form of expectations. The technology was modeled by a new restricted cost

function. This function generalizes the restricted cost function introduced

by Denny, Fuss and Waverman (1981a) and Morrison and Berndt (1981) from the

linear homogeneous to the homothetic case. The paper computes various short-,

intermediate- and long—run price and output elasticities.       Furthermore, we

present proper measures of technical change for technologies where some of the

factors are quasi—fixed and shows how those measures can be evaluated in terms

of the restricted cost function. Those measures were first introduced In

Nadiri and Prucha (1983, 1984) and are related here to measures introduced by

Morrison (1983, 1986). The paper also provides a decomposition of (the

traditional measure of) total factor productivity growth Into technical change

and components that are attributable to scale and the adjustment costs.

     Our empirical results suggest the following:

     (1) The optimal plans for the finite horizon model converge rapidly to

those of the infinite horizon model as the planning horizon extends.      (The

obtained estimation results for the 10—period and the Infinite horizon model

are found to be nearly identical; Prucha and Nadiri (1986) report similar

results.) This observation suggests that additional planning costs will

quickly exceed additional gains from extending the planning horizon. This




                                       37
observation may hence serve as a rational for why many firms only plan

moderately into the future.

     (2) Not all parameter estimates are equally sensitive to alternative

specifications of the expectation formation process. On the one hand

estimates of parameters determining the adjustment path of capital and R&D

turned out to be sensitive. This, of course, would in turn affect conclusions

concerning the effects of tax and monetary policies on investment. On the

other hand estimates of other characteristics of the underlying technology

such as scale seem to be insensitive to the specification of the expectation

formation process.

     (3) Using our model we calculate the rates of return on physical and

R&D capital. The net rate of return on R&D is about two to five times larger

than that on capital. Also the gap between the two rates widens over the

sample period. The average net rate of return on R&D Investment over the

period 1952 to 1979 is approximately 20 percent.

     (4) The model generates reasonable estimates of the price and output

elasticities for the variable and quasi—fixed inputs in the short—,

intermediate— and long—run. We find evidence that the variable inputs

overshoot in the short-run their long—run targets and that in particular the

estimates of the short—run elasticities are sensitive to the specification of

the expectation formation process.

     (5) The obtained estimates for output and input based technical change

are approximately 0.60 and 0.37, those for the returns to scale are

approximately 1.60.

     (6) The estimates of the adjustment coefficients suggest a fairly short

adjustment period for physical capital and a long adjustment period of about




                                      38
four to five years for R&D. Our estimates of the adjustment coefficients are

sensitive to the form of expectations, but Insensitive to the length of the

planning horizon (unless it is chosen very short).

     (7) Our decomposition of the traditional measure of total factor

productivity growth shows that approximately 80 percent of the growth is due

to scale effects and only approximately 10 percent is due to pure technical

change. That is, the traditional measure of total factor productivity growth

would seriously mi3measure technical change in the U.S. Bell System.

Lema: Let y, m, n, k, and w be elements of ,                       , , and ,
respectively.    Consider the function

(A.l)     y =   f(m,n,k)
that maps elements of                   into B. Let m =          m(n,k,y)     be the unique solution

of (A.1) for a for any n, k, y. Let n =                     n(,,k,y)   be the unique solution of

(A.2)     (a/an) (m(n,k,y) +       w'n) =      0

for any w, k, y. Define

(A.3)      (w,k,y) =        in(n(w,k,y),k,y)       +   w'n(w,k,y),
then:

(A.4)     af/am =      1/[a/ay],        af/an =        /Eai/ay1,       f/8k =       —[8/3k]/(8-/8y1,
(A.5)              =   n,    8-1/5k =   am/ak,         8/ay = Srn/Sy.

(Note that we have implicitly assumed that f(.), xn(.) and '(.)                         are

differentiable).



Proof: The proof is standard; compare, e.g., the proof of Shephard's or

Hotelling's lemma. By definition, y f(m(n,k,y),n,k). Differentiation

yields

(A.6)     1 =   [af/am][Sm/8y],          o =   [af/aml[Sm/8n1          +   8f/Sn,
          0 = [Sf/3m] [am/ak] +          8f/3k.
Furthermore, differentiation of (A.3) and observing (A.2) yields

(A.7)     8i/3 =       , aiai      = 8m/8k,            3/ay =

Equations (A.4) and (A.5) follow immediately from (A.6) and (A.7).                                     o



In the following we give a proof for the decomposition of total factor

productivity growth as stated in equation (21). Recall the definition of the

in Section 5.       Recall further that (l7c) and (18) imply that C                                                 c(aG/aY)y.

1
     An earlier version of this paper (Nadiri and Prucha (1983)) was first
presented at the Workshop on Investment and Productivity of the Summer
Institute of the National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, July 1983.
A first revision was circulated as Nadiri and Prucha (1984).    (This revision
was submitted as a contribution to a book that remained In the stage of

preparation. )   The present revision connects the material with recent
developments in the theory of dynamic factor demand and productivity
measurement. We would like to thank Pierre Mohnen for his assistance. We
also gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the National Science
Foundation, Grant PRA-8108635. and the Research Board of the Graduate School
of the University of Maryland. Furthermore we thank the computer centers of
New York University and the University of Maryland for their support with

     Christensen, Cummings and Schoech (1983) and Nadiri and Schankerman
(1981b) specify a restricted variable cost function and demand equations for
the variable factors, but do not estimate dynamic demand equations for the
quasi—fixed factors. Similar models have been estimated using Bell Canada
data; see Denny, Fuss and Waverman (l981b).



     Nadiri and Schankerman (1981b) do treat R&D as a factor of production and
Christensen, Cummings and Schoech (1983) use R&D as a proxy for an index of

technology.



     We take the production function to be twice differential in all
arguments. Let f be some function and let z be some argument of f. Then
    denotes the partial derivative of f with respect to z.




                                        45
       As an alternative to (5) we could have stated the firm's objective
function in period t as

(5')               EYm
                    t—t=o
                         C(Xt+T,X
                                t..t—1
                                       ,ff
                                           t*T

It   is well known that in case CC.) is linear—quadratic the (certainty
equivalence feedback control) solution for X, corresponding to (5) is
identical to that implied by the (closed loop feedback control solution)
corresponding to (5'). This result is typically referred to as the certainty
equivalence principle. If CC.) Is not linear—quadratic certainty equivalence
will generally not hold. Malinvaud (1969) derives, however, for this latter
case a first—order certainty equivalence result under reasonable conditions.
We note that the formulation in (5) may be interpreted as a limited
information formulation in that it only depends on knowledge of the first
moment of the exogenous variables (i                } , while
                                                 t.t r=o
                                                                the formulation in (5'
depends (in general) on the knowledge of their entire distribution. For an
interesting limited information formulation based on the knowledge of the
first and second moments see Bitros and Kelejian (1976).

       We have tested the hypothesis that a.. =                     both from the infinite
horizon model and from the finite horizon model via the likelihood ratio test.
To estimate the model in the infinite horizon case under the alternative we
followed the approach developed in Epstein and Yatchew (1985) and Madan and
Prucha (1988).       In estimating the finite horizon model we followed the
approach developed in Prucha and Nadiri (1982, 1988).



       Note that           reduces to (l+r) in the case of static output
expectations.


8
       We note that the algorithm can be readily modified to apply to
alternative objective functions.




                                                  46
     We have estimated the model with alternative discount rates and found the
results quite insensitive to this specification.

     The autoregressive model for output was of the form (t—ratios are given
in parentheses)

     V = — 0.00373     +   1.56874 Yt—1   —   1.10271 V
                                                          t—2
                                                                +   0.62257    V
                                                                                   t-3
      t
            (0.73)         (9.12)             (3.66)                  (2.93)

                                                       R2 =         .999, DW = 1.82.

     The value of the likelihood ratio test statistic was 1.86 compared to the
critical value of 3.84.



12
     To examine the effect of the length of the planning period we estimated

the finite horizon model with planning horizons of two, four, five and ten

periods. Whatever changes can be observed seem to follow patterns that are

smooth with respect to the length of the planning horizon. To conserve space,

we report in Table 1 only the estimates for the four and ten period planning

horizon.


13
     The elasticities are both a function of the model parameters and
expectations. The elasticities reported for the two sets of parameter
estimates are in both cases evaluated under static expectations. Therefore
any difference in the elasticities are solely due to differences in the
parameter estimates.



14
     In applying the Lemma we take y=Y, m=V,                nV,       k=[X ,1X,T],
f(.)=F(.)   and L)G(J. The results summarized in the Lemma are standard.
