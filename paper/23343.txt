Growing, Shrinking, and Long Run Economic Performance: Historical Perspectives on Economic

                                             ABSTRACT

Using annual data from the thirteenth century to the present, we show that improved long run economic
performance has occurred primarily through a decline in the rate and frequency of shrinking, rather
than through an increase in the rate of growing. Indeed, as economic performance has improved over
time, the short run rate of growing has typically declined rather than increased. Most analysis of the
process of economic development has hitherto focused on increasing the rate of growing. Here, we
focus on understanding the forces making for a reduction in the rate of shrinking, drawing a distinction
between proximate and ultimate factors. The main proximate factors considered are (1) structural change
(2) technological change (3) demographic change and (4) the changing incidence of warfare. We conclude
with a consideration of institutional change as the key ultimate factor behind the reduction in shrinking.

1. INTRODUCTION

Understanding long run economic performance is a fundamental concern of economists,

economic historians and social scientists more generally. To date, most work in this area has

focused on “growing”, but recent work for the post-1950 period has suggested that economies

vary as least as much in how they “shrink” as in how they grow (Easterly et al., 1993;

Pritchett, 2000; Cuberes and Jerzmanowski, 2009). However, despite these findings on the

volatility of GDP per capita in poor countries, there has been little research into why poor

societies shrink so often or by so much. Furthermore, economic historians have not so far

systematically investigated the possibility that improved long run economic performance

since the eighteenth century could have been due to less shrinking rather than faster growing,

despite the widespread acceptance of the idea that economic growth was slow during the

Industrial Revolution (Crafts and Harley, 1992; Broadberry et al., 2015). In this paper, we

show that to understand economic performance over the long run, economic historians,

growth economists and development specialists must explain a reduction in the rate and

frequency of shrinking rather than an increase in the rate of growing, a different problem

from the one they normally address.



       The key empirical findings reported here can be summarised as follows, where the

growing rate refers to the average rate of change only during years of positive growth and the

shrinking rate refers to the average rate of change only during years of shrinking (i.e.

negative growth): (1) In most of the world since 1950, and historically for today’s countries

where data are available back to the thirteenth century, growing rates and shrinking rates

have been high and variable. (2) When average growing rates have been high, average

shrinking rates have also typically been high. Similarly, when average growing rates have

been low, average shrinking rates have been low. (3) The improvement of economic


                                              2
performance over the long run has occurred primarily because the frequency and rate of

shrinking have both declined, rather than because the growing rate has increased. (4) Indeed,

as long run economic performance has improved over time, the short run rate of growing has

normally declined rather than increased, but the frequency of growing has increased. In

arithmetic terms, changes in growing rates by themselves would have led to lower rates of

long term economic growth, ceteris paribus. To avoid misunderstanding, however, it is

important to be clear that we do not dispute in any way that positive long run economic

performance requires positive short run growing and that increases in short run growing rates

contribute to positive long run economic performance. Rather, we draw attention to the

under-appreciated role that economic shrinking has played both in the period since World

War II and over the last millennium.



       Despite this important role for a reduction in the rate and frequency of shrinking in

the transition to modern economic growth in today’s mature developed economies as well as

in later developing countries, most analysis of the process of economic development has

hitherto focused on increasing the rate of growing. Here, we make a start on redressing the

balance by analysing the forces making for a reduction in shrinking, drawing a distinction

between proximate and ultimate factors. The main proximate factors considered are (1)

structural change (2) technological change (3) demographic change and (4) the changing

incidence of warfare. Institutional change is seen as the key ultimate factor behind the

reduction in shrinking, bringing about the transition to modern economic growth.



2. LONG- AND SHORT RUN ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE

2.1 Economic performance in the contemporary world




                                             3
We know that today’s high income countries have had a better long run economic

performance than today’s low income countries since at least the early nineteenth century

(Maddison, 2001; 2010). That fact is the essential motivation for growth theory, with its

focus on the rate of growing. On closer examination, however, high income countries do not

grow faster during their episodes of positive growth than poor countries grow during their

episodes of positive growth. This can be demonstrated using information from the Penn

World Table (PWT) for the period 1950-2011 (Feenstra et al., 2015). Table 1 from PWT 8.0

provides evidence on long run economic performance across groups of countries, broken

down by level of income. The sample underlying the table includes 141 countries, with all

included countries having data available from at least 1970 onwards. The data are arranged in

five groups, ranging from high income countries with per capita incomes in the year 2000

greater than $20,000 (in constant 2005 dollars), to poor countries with per capita incomes of

less than $2,000.



       Table 1 makes use of an identity for establishing the contributions of growing and

shrinking to long run economic performance. Long run economic performance can be

measured by the rate of change of per capita GDP over periods of fifty years or longer.

Economic performance over this time frame is the aggregation of short run changes measured

at the annual level. Long–run economic performance, g, is a combination of 4 factors: (1) the

frequency with which an economy grows, f(+) (2) the rate at which it grows when growing,

or the growing rate, g(+) (3) the frequency with which an economy shrinks, f(-) and (4) the

rate at which it grows when shrinking, or the shrinking rate g(-). Thus:

       g = {f(+) g(+)} + {f(-) g(-)}                                                     (1)

Since the frequency of growing is equal to one minus the frequency of shrinking, equation (1)

can be rewritten as:


                                               4
        g = {[1-f(-)] g(+)} + {f(-) g(-)}                                                                (2)

which reduces the number of independent factors to three. We can use this identity to

decompose long run economic performance into shrinking and growing components. We will

show that better long run economic performance occurred not so much because of an increase

in the growing rate, but more because of a reduction in the rate and frequency of shrinking.1



        In Table 1, we see from the third column that poor countries have not grown less

rapidly than rich countries when they have been growing. Indeed, the average growing rate

has actually been higher for poorer countries than richer countries. Similarly, we can see in

the final column that the average shrinking rate has also been higher for poorer countries.

However, the second column shows that the frequency of growing has been higher for

countries with higher levels of per capita income. The richest countries grew in

approximately 84 per cent of years, while the poorest countries grew in just 62 per cent of

years. Since the frequency of shrinking is one minus the frequency of growing, the frequency

of shrinking has to be higher for poorer countries: the poorest countries shrank in almost 38

per cent of years, while the richest countries shrank in just 16 per cent of years. So poor

countries have grown less frequently than rich countries; they have higher shrinking rates and

shrinking frequencies.



        Table 2 shows the contributions of growing and shrinking to long run economic

performance. The contribution of growing to long run economic performance is the growing

rate multiplied by the frequency of growing years. We see that most poorer countries had a

stronger contribution from growing than economies with per capita incomes above $20,000,

1
 We abstract from issues of timing. Over a fixed period of time, which is what we consider, when growing and
shrinking occurs does not matter to the change in per capita income over the period. Substantively, however,
the economy would be better off if growing occurred in the early years and shrinking in the later years rather
than vice versa. Considerations of timing would make no difference to the calculations we perform.

                                                      5
since the higher average growing rate of poorer countries more than offset the lower

frequency of growing years. The only exception to this was the poorest category of countries

with per capita incomes below $2,000. These very poor countries had a weaker contribution

of growing than the richest group of countries, but this was due to their lower frequency of

growing years rather than to a lower growing rate. The contribution of shrinking to long run

economic performance is the shrinking rate multiplied by the frequency of shrinking years.

All poorer economies had a bigger negative contribution from shrinking than economies with

per capita incomes above $20,000. This was due to both the higher frequency of shrinking

among poorer countries and higher shrinking rates.



       Long run economic performance is measured by the net rate of change in per capita

incomes in the final column of Table 2. Poorer economies did not have a significantly better

long run economic performance than the richest group of countries, which means that there

was no systematic catching-up over the period as a whole. Middle income countries increased

their per capita incomes at about the same rate as the rich countries, but poor countries

increased their per capita incomes substantially more slowly, so that there was unconditional

divergence rather than convergence as the poorest countries fell increasingly behind

(Pritchett, 1997). This lack of long run convergence is explained mainly by differences

between countries in the contribution of shrinking, as rich countries shrank less and in fewer

years than poor countries.



       The next two sections explore the implications of the post-1950 findings for a longer

sweep of economic history, encompassing the transition to modern economic growth in

today’s rich countries. To do this, we make use of the Maddison Data Base for the nineteenth




                                              6
and twentieth centuries, and data on a sample of four European countries for which annual

data have recently become available, reaching back to the thirteenth century.



2.2 Economic performance in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries

The final version of the Maddison Data Base contains annual data on 14 European countries

starting between 1820 and 1870 and 4 New World economies starting in 1870. Annual data

for most other economies begin only in the twentieth century, and in many cases after 1950

(Maddison, 2010). Widely accepted revisions to the original Maddison Data Base do not

affect these data, but rather focus on the period before 1820 for the 14 European countries

and the twentieth century for other economies (Bolt and van Zanden, 2014). Table 3 shows

data on the frequency of growing and shrinking for the 18 country sample as a whole, while

figures are given for a number of individual countries in Appendix Table A1. The frequency

of growing has increased very sharply in the period since 1950 in this group of rich countries

in Europe and the New World, or to state it the other way round, there has been a sharp

reduction in the frequency of shrinking, from about one third to one eighth.



        Table 4 shows the average growth rate in all years, growing years and shrinking years,

i.e. long run economic performance, the growing rate and the shrinking rate. Again the data

in the text table are provided for the 18 country sample, with data on some individual

countries in Appendix Table A2. Since 1950, the growth rate across all years has increased

sharply in both Europe and the New World, and this has happened despite the fact that the

growing rate (i.e. the growth rate in growing years) has actually fallen substantially almost

everywhere.2 Long run economic performance improved despite the reduction in the growing




2
 The one exception among this sample of 18 countries is Spain, which experienced a faster growing rate post-
1950 during recovery from the catastrophic effects of the Civil War.

                                                      7
rate because of an even sharper decline in the shrinking rate combined with a reduction in the

frequency of shrinking.



           It should also be noted from Table 4 that during the period 1910-1950, covering the

two World Wars and the Great Depression, the growing rate increased almost everywhere, in

many cases substantially so.3 However, this did not lead to any significant improvement in

long run economic performance because there was an equally sharp increase in the shrinking

rate, while the frequency of shrinking also increased slightly. It is natural to associate this

increased volatility with the two world wars and the financial crises of the interwar period.



           Table 5 shows how the frequency of growing and shrinking interacted with the

growing and shrinking rates to produce the contributions of growing and shrinking to long

run economic performance, as measured by the average rate of change of per capita income

in all years. Data in the text table are presented only for the 18 country sample as a whole,

with more detail provided in Appendix Table A3. Again, this makes clear that the

improvement in economic performance during 1950-2008 compared with earlier periods can

be attributed mainly to a reduction in the contribution of shrinking, since the contribution of

growing either stagnated or actually declined slightly in most countries.



2.3 Economic performance over the very long run

Recent work in historical national accounting has extended annual estimates of GDP per

capita as far back as the thirteenth or fourteenth century for a number of European countries

(Broadberry, 2013; Fouquet and Broadberry, 2015). We also analyse this Very Long Run

Data Base for Britain, the Netherlands, Italy and Spain (Broadberry et al., 2015; van Zanden


3
    Again the exception is Spain, as a result of the Civil War.

                                                           8
and van Leeuwen, 2012; Malanima, 2011; Álvarez Nogal and Prados de la Escosura, 2013).

The annual time series are plotted in Figure 1 for Italy and Spain, in Figure 2 for Britain and

the Netherlands, with the four countries being considered together in Figure 3. Beginning

with the Mediterranean economies in Figure 1, there was a clear alternation of periods of

positive and negative trend growth over periods of a decade or more, with growth booms

typically followed by growth reversals, leaving little or no progress in the level of per capita

incomes over the long run. Per capita GDP therefore fluctuated without long run trend before

the mid-nineteenth century. For the cases of Britain and the Netherlands in Figure 2,

however, although there were alternating periods of positive and negative growth until the

eighteenth century, there was also a clear upward trend over the long run, with the gains

following the Black Death being retained, and the growth reversals eventually disappearing

with the transition to modern economic growth in the eighteenth century. As periods of

negative growth became less frequent and as the rate of shrinking decreased in northwestern

Europe, Britain and Holland overtook Italy and Spain, as shown in Figure 3.



       It is also useful to quantify the number of significant growing episodes (defined as at

least consecutive three years of positive per capita GDP growth) and the number of shrinking

episodes (defined as at least three consecutive years of negative per capita GDP growth). The

results can be seen in Table 6, assessed over the whole period 1348-1870 and broken down

by shorter periods of approximately 50 years. The most striking finding is that for the period

as a whole, Britain and the Netherlands overtook Italy and Spain not because of any greater

incidence of growing episodes, but rather because of much fewer shrinking episodes. Note

further the performance of Britain, the first country to achieve modern economic growth,

during its periods of significantly improved per capita GDP performance. Britain experienced

fewer growing episodes than all other countries after the Black Death, 1348-1400, fewer


                                               9
growing episodes than Italy and Spain after the Civil War 1650-1700, and even after 1800, no

more growing episodes than the Netherlands and Spain, and fewer than Italy. Britain’s path to

modern economic growth and world economic leadership was not obviously the product of

more growing episodes.



       However, a complete analysis must cover all years rather than just those with at least

three consecutive years of growing or shrinking. Tables 7 to 9 show the frequency, rates and

contributions of growing and shrinking to long run economic performance over complete

periods of roughly fifty years in the Very Long Run Data Base, as in the analysis of the Penn

World Table and the Maddison Data Base. The first thing to note from Table 7 is that for all

of the economies considered here, the frequency of shrinking was about one third in the

nineteenth century, as in Table 3. For earlier centuries, by contrast, these economies grew and

shrank in roughly equal proportions of years. A reduction in shrinking therefore played an

important role in the improved long run economic performance of Western Europe. Second,

turning to Table 8, we see that growing and shrinking rates tended to move together, so that

high rates of growing were accompanied by high rates of shrinking and low rates of growing

were accompanied by low rates of shrinking. Third, the transition to modern economic

growth occurred first in Britain during the eighteenth century, where growing and shrinking

rates were both low but the growing rate was significantly higher than the shrinking rate and

the frequency of growing was greater than the frequency of shrinking. Although there had

been an earlier episode between 1450 and 1550 when the growing and shrinking rates were

both low and the frequency of growing was greater than the frequency of shrinking, at this

time the shrinking rate was higher than the growing rate. Fourth, Table 9 shows the

contributions of growing (the frequency of growing multiplied by the growing rate) and

shrinking (the frequency of shrinking multiplied by the shrinking rate) to long run economic


                                              10
performance (the average rate of change of per capita income in all years). In this table,

notice that the rate of economic performance over all years increased from 0.23 per cent in

the period 1700-1750 to 0.79 per cent in the period 1800-1870 as Britain experienced the first

transition to modern economic growth. But this was not caused by an increase in the

contribution of growing, which fell from 2.38 per cent in the early period to 1.85 per cent in

the later period. Even though the frequency of growing increased over this period from 50 per

cent of years to 61 per cent (Table 7), this was offset by a sharp decline in the rate of growing

from 4.76 per cent to 3.00 per cent (Table 8). On their own, then changes in the rate and

frequency of growing would have led to a decline in economic performance. The improved

economic performance between 1700-1750 and 1800-1870 was thus due to the reduction in

the contribution of shrinking from -2.15 to -1.05 per cent, which more than offset the

reduction in the contribution of growing (Table 9). This occurred as a result of both the

reduction in the frequency of shrinking from 50 to 39 per cent (Table 7) and the reduction in

the rate of shrinking from -4.31 to -2.73 per cent (Table 8). In terms of a simple

decomposition, more than all of the increase in economic performance between the two

periods is explained by changes in shrinking rather than growing.4



2.4 A summary of the empirical results

Before moving on to the explanatory section, it will be useful to summarise the main

empirical results, which a framework for understanding long run economic performance

needs to be able to explain:

    (1) Growing rates and shrinking rates have been high and variable throughout most of

        history and remain high and variable in less developed economies today


4
 Note that the second half of the seventeenth century is not conventionally regarded as a period of modern
economic growth because although there was a substantial increase in British per capita GDP, it was
accompanied by a small reduction in the population.

                                                     11
   (2) Improving long run economic performance has occurred because the frequency and

       rate of shrinking have both declined, rather than because the growing rate has

       increased

   (3) The rate of growing has typically declined rather than increased as long run economic

       performance has improved



3. WHY DO ECONOMIES STOP SHRINKING?

The previous section has established that the transition to sustained economic growth has

historically owed more to a reduction in the rate and frequency of shrinking than to an

increase in the rate of growing. Put simply, economic development depends on economies

first dampening growth reversals and then stopping shrinking altogether. However, there has

been no systematic analysis of shrinking episodes or of the reasons for their disappearance.

Rather, shrinking episodes are typically regarded as aberrant anomalies, caused by negative

shocks, while their disappearance has gone largely unremarked.



       Focusing on the Very Long Run Database, most previous accounts of the Industrial

Revolution in Britain seek to explain an increase in the rate of growing rather than a

reduction in the rate and frequency of shrinking. As Ashton’s [1948: 48] “wave of gadgets

swept over England” during the eighteenth century, the average rate of growing during

periods of positive growth was actually falling (Table 7). But this still led to improved long-

run economic performance because of a decline in the rate and frequency of shrinking. So it

is not enough to explain why great inventors discovered coke smelting of iron or the spinning

jenny in cotton textiles. We also need to understand why Britain and other parts of Europe

stopped shrinking. After all, it has been known for some time that coke smelting of iron was

widely used in Northern Song China, seven hundred years before Abraham Darby


                                              12
rediscovered it at Coalbrookdale (Hartwell, 1966). And as Allen (2009: 904-907) has pointed

out, inventions such as the spinning jenny were so simple in principle that they were almost

bound to be discovered once people started looking for them. And yet researchers continue to

focus on innovation during periods of positive growth, while the issue of why economies

shrink continues to be largely ignored.



       So why did growth reversals become dampened after the Black Death and eventually

disappear altogether in Britain? Standard growth theory is not much help here, since it

assumes away periods of shrinking and focuses only on the long run. In a neoclassical growth

model with a production function and emphasis on accumulation and technological progress,

it is difficult to see how an economy could shrink by five or ten percent a year for several

years. In addressing this question, we follow Maddison (1991: 12) in drawing a distinction

between proximate and ultimate elements explaining per capita GDP performance, but

focusing on shrinking rather than growing. The main proximate factors considered here are:

(1) structural change (2) technological change (3) demographic change and (4) the changing

incidence of warfare. Institutional change is also considered as the key ultimate factor behind

the reduction in shrinking.



4. PROXIMATE CAUSES OF THE DECLINE IN SHRINKING

4.1 Structural change

The period 1270-1870 saw a major structural shift of the British economy away from

agriculture, which accounted for around 40 per cent of nominal GDP between the late

fourteenth century and the end of the sixteenth century, declining to around 30 per cent

during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and around 20 per cent by the mid-

nineteenth century (Broadberry et al., 2015: 194). Short-run fluctuations of agricultural


                                              13
output were often extremely large, with annual declines of 10 or 20 per cent a frequent

occurrence, as weather related shocks led regularly to bad harvests and years of shrinking. As

the share of agriculture in overall economic activity declined, therefore, it may be expected

that such episodes of shrinking would become less important.



       Two observations are appropriate here, however. First, it is clearly more natural to see

this as a result rather than a cause of economic development. In line with Engel’s Law, the

share of income spent on food declines as income increases, so that the industrial and service

sectors increasingly come to dominate economic activity. Identifying structural change as a

proximate source of the reduction in shrinking does not, therefore, provide any useful policy

recommendations.



       The second observation concerns the relative importance of structural change and

changes in the pattern of growing and shrinking within individual sectors of the economy.

We are interested in changes in the balance between growing and shrinking. A reduction in

the importance of a particularly volatile sector, such as agriculture, may in fact be expected to

affect the growing rate just as much as the shrinking rate, with little effect on long run

economic performance. It is useful, therefore, to consider the contributions of growing and

shrinking at a sectoral level. Table 10 shows that there was no trend reduction in the

frequency of shrinking in agriculture, which remained at around 50 per cent throughout the

period 1270-1870. In services, although the frequency of growing was much greater than the

frequency of shrinking, there was again no strong trend decline in shrinking. Only in industry

was there a clear trend decline in shrinking. Table 11 sets out the average rates of change of

output in all years, growing years and shrinking years. In agriculture, output performance in

all years improved despite a trend decline in the growing rate as the shrinking rate also


                                               14
declined. Services also exhibited an improvement in output performance across all years, but

with an increase in both the growing and shrinking rates. Industry is the most interesting

sector, with an improvement across all years resulting from a combination of an increase in

the growing rate and a decline in the shrinking rate. Table 12 shows how the frequencies and

rates of growing and shrinking interacted to determine the contributions of growing and

shrinking to long run economic performance, measured as the average rate of change of

output in all years. Again, all sectors showed an improved long run economic performance,

but industry stands out as the only sector where the contribution of growing increased and the

contribution of shrinking declined. In agriculture, the contributions of growing and shrinking

both declined, while in services the contributions of growing and shrinking both increased.



       The question of the extent to which that the declining share of agriculture might

explain the decline in shrinking rates and frequencies in the aggregate economy is addressed

directly in Table 13. The table performs a shift-share analysis, comparing the 1270-1348

period with the 1800-1870 period. The first column of Table 13A gives the shares of output

in agriculture, industry, and services in 1381, the earliest year for which shares of nominal

GDP are available (Broadberry et al., 2015: 194). At this point, agriculture accounted for

more than 45 per cent of British GDP. The second column gives the share in 1841, when

agriculture’s share had fallen to just over 22 per cent. The contributions of growing and

shrinking in each sector in each period are taken from Table 12. Table 13B combines the

1381 shares and 1270-1348 contributions with the 1841 shares and 1800-1870 contributions.

If the declining share of agriculture is what mattered for the reduction in shrinking at the

aggregate level, then comparing the columns that hold contributions constant and allow the

shares to shift should show a marked difference in economic performance from the actual

performance (shown in the last two rows of the table). Since Table 10 has established that


                                              15
agriculture continued to be a highly variable sector of the economy, if the change in

contributions holding the shares constant shows a significant change in economic

performance, then we can conclude that agriculture was developing too, and that the decline

in the importance of shrinking at the aggregate level was not the result of a declining share of

agriculture in the economy.



       We hold the contributions of growing and shrinking constant for each sector, but vary

the sectoral shares, in columns (2) and (4) and in columns (6) and (8) of Table 13B. The

effect on aggregate economic performance of shifting the sectoral shares is minimal. In both

cases, this leads to only a small change in the net output performance, from 0.16 to 0.19 per

cent holding the 1270-1348 contributions constant, and from 1.74 to 2.07 per cent holding the

1800-1870 contributions constant. By contrast, holding the sectoral shares constant and

shifting the contributions shows a marked change in net output performance, comparing

columns (2) and (6) or columns (4) and (8). In both cases, this leads to a very large change in

the net output performance, from 0.16 to 1.74 per cent holding the 1381 shares constant, and

from 0.19 to 2.07 per cent holding the 1841 shares constant. In practice, then, the declining

share of agriculture explains rather less than might be expected of the patterns of growing and

shrinking that are observed in the data. Conversely, developments within each of the

individual sectors, including agriculture, were of rather more importance.



4.2 Technological change

In theory, shrinking could disappear as the economy moves from technological stagnation to

technological progress. In a world with no technological progress, an upturn must lead to

positive per capita GDP growth, while a downturn must lead to negative growth i.e.

shrinking. The emergence of trend technological progress for the first time could therefore


                                              16
lead to the elimination of shrinking, at least in theory. Imagine that the entire distribution of

growing and shrinking episodes shifts a fixed amount towards growing. Shrinking rates and

frequencies would both decline. Growing rates and frequencies should both increase, and we

have already seen that is inconsistent with the historical or contemporary data on economic

performance. But as a kind of robustness check, we can ask whether, in practice, the scale of

trend growth in total factor productivity (TFP) at the time of the transition to modern

economic was large enough to explain the declining shrinking rates and frequencies we

observe.



       The main constraint in measuring TFP growth in the past is the lack of reliable data

on the capital stock. For Britain, however, Feinstein’s (1988) estimates back to 1760 have

been produced using the perpetual inventory method, ensuring consistency between the stock

of capital and the flows of investment. The augmented Solow growth accounting estimates of

Crafts (1995) in Table 14 derive TFP growth taking into account the growth of human capital

as well as raw labour and physical capital. As annual output growth accelerated from 0.60 per

cent during 1760-1780 to reach a peak of 2.40 per cent during 1831-1873, TFP growth

increased only from 0.05 to 0.35 per cent. TFP growth therefore accounted for just one-sixth

of the increase in output growth, with five-sixths of the increase being accounted for by faster

growth of factor inputs.




       Estimates of TFP growth for Holland are provided by van Zanden and van Leeuwen

(2012), covering the period 1540-1800 and including human capital as well as labour and

capital inputs. In Table 15, Dutch TFP is estimated using the same weights as those used by

Crafts and Harley (1992) for Britain (0.4 for capital, 0.35 for labour and 0.25 for human

capital). These estimates differ only very slightly from those of van Zanden and van


                                               17
Leeuwen, who also include land as a fourth factor input. The period of fastest TFP growth

was 1540-1620, during the Dutch Golden Age, at 0.64% per annum. This was higher than at

any other time in Holland during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, or in Britain

during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, but was still relatively small compared with

the average growing and shrinking rates for the Netherlands in Table 8. Furthermore, this

period of positive TFP growth was followed by a period of strongly negative TFP growth

between 1620 and1665, and barely positive TFP growth thereafter, so there was no trend

increase in TFP over the period 1540-1800 as a whole. The Dutch example thus serves as a

reminder that growth reversals can occur in TFP as well as GDP per capita, and that the

transition to modern economic growth requires an end to TFP growth reversals as well as

GDP per capita growth reversals.




4.3 Demographic change

The Malthusian approach explains long-run stagnation of GDP per capita in the pre-industrial

world with shorter episodes of growing and shrinking through demographic factors (Malthus,

1798; Clark, 2007). Malthus assumed feedback from income per capita to fertility (the

preventive check) and mortality (the positive check) together with diminishing returns to land

(the resource constraint). Short-run growing of per capita income occurs in response to

anything which reduces population (an increase in mortality or a decline in fertility) or

increases the availability of land. Short-run shrinking of per capita income occurs in response

to a decline in mortality, an increase in fertility or a reduction in the availability of land. In

the Malthusian approach, however, any gain to GDP per capita will only be temporary

because of the feedback from living standards to fertility and mortality.




                                               18
       As noted earlier, the growth in living standards in Italy after the Black Death of the

mid-fourteenth century, and its subsequent reversal after the return to population growth from

the mid-fifteenth century, can be understood in the light of the Malthusian model. However,

other countries do not fit into this approach at all well. Most obviously, Britain and the

Netherlands were able to break free during the early modern period from the Malthusian

constraints that held Italy on a path of long-run stagnation, despite similar demographic

trends. As population returned to its pre-Black Death level in Britain and Holland during the

sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Holland enjoyed its Golden Age of economic growth,

while British living standards remained on a plateau rather than declining.



       For England, excellent demographic data exist for the period since 1541, as the result

of a major research project by Wrigley and Schofield (1981), and can be considered

alongside the GDP per capita data examined in section 2 of this paper. Figure 4 provides a

graph of annual data on the crude birth rate and the crude death rate per 1,000 population. It

is immediately clear that England’s breaking out of the Malthusian trap in the eighteenth

century was not caused by a reduction in fertility or an increase in mortality. Indeed, there

was a population explosion after 1750 as fertility increased substantially while mortality

declined (Wrigley and Schofield, 1981: 314-315). Furthermore, when the fertility transition

did begin in England with the decline in the crude birth rate from the 1870s, there was a

decline in economic performance. The fertility decline from the 1870s can be seen clearly for

England in Figure 4, and applies also to the rest of Britain (Tranter, 1996: 86). The decline in

economic performance shows up in the GDP per capita growth rate for the UK in Table A2,

and is conventionally referred to as the late Victorian climacteric (Matthews et al., 1982).




                                               19
         Spain provides another interesting example of an economy behaving in a non-

Malthusian way after the Black Death. In contrast to Italy, the Netherlands and Britain, Spain

did not experience even a temporary increase in per capita incomes after the Black Death.

Álvarez-Nogal and Prados de la Escosura (2013) explain this by the high land-to-labour ratio

in a frontier economy during the Reconquest. Instead of reducing pressure on scarce land

resources, Spanish population decline destroyed commercial networks and further isolated an

already scarce population, reducing specialisation and the division of labour. Thus Spain did

not share in the general west European increase in per capita incomes after the Black Death.

This serves as a useful reminder that the mechanical operation of demographic forces

highlighted in the Malthusian approach can be offset and dominated by the forces of

coordination emphasised in the Smithian approach. Explaining the changing relationship

between population, output and per capita output has proved difficult enough in unified

growth theory, even abstracting from the issue of shrinking (Galor and Weil, 2000; Galor,

2005).



4.4 Changing incidence of warfare

The outbreak of war and the return to peace can be seen as shocks to economic activity, with

effects on growing and shrinking both directly, through disruption to business, and indirectly

through Malthusian effects on demography. An increase or a reduction in the incidence of

warfare could therefore in principle have had significant effects on the frequency and rate of

shrinking. A case for the direct effects could be made, for example, when comparing the

period 1910-1950 in Table 5 with the prewar period 1870-1910 or the postwar period, 1950-

2008. The outbreak of World War I clearly created considerable difficulties for trans-national

businesses, making it impossible for normal commercial relationships between Britain and

Germany, for example, while the return of peace in 1918 allowed for a period of recovery in


                                              20
trans-national business, disrupted once again by the outbreak of World War II (Reader, 1970:

249-314; 1975: 251-296; Broadberry, 1997: 210-291). The higher rates of shrinking and

growing in the period 1910-1950 compared with both the pre-1910 and post-1950 periods,

but without improved long run economic performance, can be understood in this light.

However, Malthusian effects on living standards during and after the two world wars are

much less apparent. Higher mortality and reduced fertility during the wars does not seem to

have been associated with prosperity, while postwar baby booms do not seem to have led to

slower growth of GDP per capita, particularly after World War II (Urlanis, 1971: 248-312).



       The role of war and peace in the transition to modern economic growth has attracted

the attention of a number of writers in recent years. Building on the work of Jones (1981) and

Tilly (1990), Hoffman (2015) argues that the fragmentation of Europe into a large number of

warring nations led to the development of states with high per capita revenues that were spent

largely on warfare, and stimulated the development of technologies which had useful

spillovers into civilian economic activity. Hoffman’s stress on the institutions of governance

and technological progress are in stark contrast to Voigtländer and Voth’s (2013a) emphasis

on the Malthusian aspects of warfare. Voigtländer and Voth (2013b) see a “First Divergence”

between 1350 and 1700 as Europe laid the foundations of the “Great Divergence” after 1700.

War, together with plague and urbanisation, is seen as good for development as it raised

mortality, hence lowering population growth and allowing an increase in per capita incomes.

To this effect, which they see as the “gift of Mars”, Voigtländer and Voth (2013c) add the

“invention of fertility restriction” after the Black Death to consolidate the gift of Mars by

keeping fertility low.




                                              21
       From our perspective, both the Malthusian and the institutional/technological versions

of the “war as the driver of economic progress” thesis suffer from a failure to pay sufficient

attention to the effects on shrinking as well as growing. Historically, the main effect of

warfare has been to raise both the frequency and rate of shrinking during the war, offset by an

increase in the rate of growing during the postwar recovery. The net effect of this on long run

economic performance has been relatively small, even during the total wars of the twentieth

century (Broadberry and Harrison, 2008). In explaining the transition to modern economic

growth, what we are looking for is something that led to a reduction in the rate and frequency

of shrinking, and wars had the opposite effect.



5. ULTIMATE CAUSES OF THE DECLINE IN SHRINKING

This section adopts a Smithian approach to the explanation of shrinking and its dampening

during the process of economic development. Smithian growth occurs with an increase in the

extent of the market and the greater division of labour, while Smithian shrinking occurs with

a reduction in the extent of the market (Smith, 1776). The basic idea builds on a tradition

associated with the work of Douglass North, who emphasised the importance of institutional

change in bringing about modern economic growth in a series of papers and books reaching

back as far as 1961 (North 1961, see Wallis 2016), clearly articulated in North and Weingast

(1989) and North (1990). However, in common with most other economic historians, North

in his early work emphasised the need to increase economic growing, without considering the

possibility of improved economic performance through reduced shrinking. This shift of

emphasis appeared for the first time during North’s collaboration with John Wallis and Barry

Weingast in North et al. (NWW, 2009).



5.1 Institutional change


                                              22
Most early work on institutions, including North up through 1990, assumed that rules were

meant to apply equally to everyone in principle, but in practice they often did not. Credible

commitment to enforce the rules was lacking, and how to create credible commitment on the

part of the government was a key concern of North and Weingast (1989) and North (1990).

NWW raised a different set of issues, with important implications for the nature of rules. In a

world where violence was endemic, powerful individuals and organizations had an incentive

to create social order. To do so credibly, however, meant that powerful actors had to believe

that the other powerful actors would honour commitments not to use violence. NWW

developed the idea of the “natural state” to explain how such arrangements could work.

Powerful actors recognized each other’s ability to control resources in return for promises not

to fight. Because the resources of the actors would be less valuable if fighting occurred, their

arrangements created conditions under which powerful organizations could find it in their

interest to honour their commitments not to use violence, but only within a narrow range of

conditions. NWW call this the logic of the natural state.



        Critically, the rules that emerge from the agreements between powerful organizations

explicitly could not treat everyone the same. The rules had to recognize the privileges of

powerful elites, often on an individual basis. Rules that treat individuals differently are an

important source of the rents that make intra-elite agreements credible. As long as the rents

produced by elite agreements are reduced by violence, then elites have a stronger incentive to

limit violence and honour their agreement. The rules that emerge in a natural state are

“identity rules:” rules whose form and enforcement differ according to the organizational

identity of the individuals to whom the rule applies.5 The logic of the natural state produces a



5
 North, Wallis, and Weingast do not use the term identity rules in their book. For the development of the idea
of identity rules see Wallis (2011), where he calls them anonymous rules.

                                                     23
coalition of powerful organizations that limit violence, but the rules governing the interaction

of those organizations, and elite individuals generally, are identity rules.



       A system of identity rules creates two kinds of problems, one for powerful elites and

the other for the entire society. Because the rules and enforcement favour them, powerful

elites face a paradox of privilege: the more powerful the elite, the less able he is to bind

himself by rules that can be enforced by the courts. The king, as the saying used to go, is

above the law. The paradox of privilege is compounded by the uncertainty of elite identity,

the second problem. The power of specific elites is tied to their organizations, which are

often factions, parties, and alliances rather than legally recognized entities (that comes later),

and the relative power of organizations rises and falls unpredictably over time. Sometimes

the relative power of organizations, and thus elite identity, can change quickly and

unexpectedly. When that happens, how identity rules will be applied may not change in

principle, but since the identities of elite individuals and organizations have changed, how the

rules apply to specific individuals changes. This creates significant complications for the idea

of credible commitment as an organizing theme of institutional analysis. Governments can

be credibly committed to enforcing identity rules, but the identities themselves are uncertain

and changeable.



       The transition from natural states to open access orders depends on the ability of

societies to create and enforce some impersonal rules: rules that treat everyone the same. The

“open” in open access refers to the ability to form organizations, which is limited in natural

states. Identity rules and enforcement are an integral part of the limits that create the rents

that provide credible incentives underlying the social order (to put all the links together in

one sentence). The transition from an identity rule regime to an impersonal rule regime


                                                24
involves much more than just a change in the enforcement of rules, it requires a shift in the

pattern of social dynamics, which we will not consider here.



        What matters for the rate and frequency of shrinking are the two problems with

identity rules. First, the paradox of privilege means that some elite relationships that could be

credible if an elite relationship could draw on the unbiased enforcement of a contractual

agreement, will not be feasible. Specifically, agreements that require the more powerful elite

to be bound by the rules will not be feasible. In Smithian terms, since elite organizations

stand at the nexus of commercial, economic, political, and social networks, the degree of

coordination within a society through those networks will determine the degree of

specialization and division of labour. The paradox of privilege will limit the range of

supportable elite arrangements, and so the extent of the market. This will appear as a

problem of scale, and so many of the new growth theory ideas that extend Smith’s insights

apply to this long term problem.



        But even more important in terms of shrinking is the problem of shifting elite

identities.   Looking forward in time, elite relationships that would be credible if elite

identities, and therefore elite rule enforcement, remain stable over time, may not be credible

if elite identities are uncertain, or become more uncertain, going forward in time. Looking

backward in time, when a shock occurs and elite identities change, relationships that were

sustainable suddenly become problematic. Elite relationships break down, division of labour

and specialization are reduced and the economy shrinks.                  A shock may have both an

immediate effect on output, and then an ongoing effect through elite relationships.6 The long

run Smithian forces mean that identity rule societies have a lower level of economic

6
 Rodrik’s (1999) paper “Where did all the growth go?” is a neat and clean example of this phenomenon, using
the 1973 oil shock as an identification strategy.

                                                    25
performance for long run structural reasons, and the short run Smithian forces mean that

identity rule societies are more subject to shrinking, and thus lower levels of economic

performance over the long run. Both factors are at work.



       Broadberry and Wallis (2016) develop this argument to show how a reduction in

shrinking occurs with institutional change during economic development, as an economy

moves from operating with a system of identity rules to a system of impersonal rules. We see

this as the major change behind the transition to modern economic growth in today’s

developed economies as well as in today’s newly developing countries. In very simple terms,

elites can be ordered in terms of their power, which is determined by their ability to control

resources. Since the ability to control resources changes over time, elite orderings also

change, both in a prospective and retrospective way. Changing elite identity does not matter

for the enforcement of impersonal rules, but is crucial for the enforcement of identity rules.



       Two important results follow from this. First, elite relationships which would be

viable in an impersonal rule society may not be viable in an identity rule society, simply

because there is no mechanism for the most powerful elites to credibly commit to an

agreement that could be enforced in the courts. Second, changes in elite ordering can bring

about shrinking episodes in identity rule societies, but not in impersonal rule societies. In

identity rule societies, business relations which were viable in the old ordering may cease to

be viable in the new ordering, and it takes time for new relationships to develop, since they

depend on establishing credible commitment. Long-run development, where episodes of

growth are not routinely followed by episodes of shrinking, therefore requires a transition

from a world of identity rules to a world of impersonal rules.




                                               26
5.2 Interaction between proximate and ultimate factors

We have identified institutional change as the key ultimate factor behind the reduction in

shrinking, leading to the transition to modern economic growth. We end by considering how

institutional change can operate through changes in the proximate factors. As Maddison

(1988) notes, the interactions between proximate and ultimate factors can be complex, but a

number of consequences can be seen to follow from the institutional changes leading to an

impersonal rule society, where a change in the ordering of elites does not interfere with the

set of feasible contracts. First, diversification becomes easier in a world where everyone is

treated the same, and the need to hang on to land to ensure access to food during periods of

crisis becomes less important, facilitating a move away from dependence on agriculture

(Solar, 1995). Second, these same forces encourage experimentation amongst a wider group

of people and thus an increase in the rate of technological progress (Kahn, 2005). Third, the

increase in technological progress can be expected to bring about a demographic transition

via the need for human capital, as in unified growth theory (Galor, 2005). Fourth, the

perceived fairness of a legal system where rules are enforced impersonally should lead to a

more peaceful environment (Pinker, 2011).



6. CONCLUSIONS

Work by development economists during the 1990s highlighted the importance of episodes of

shrinking for keeping economies poor in the contemporary world. Easterly et al. (1993) used

data from the post-1950 period to highlight that the main difference between poor and rich

countries was not that the poor countries grew more slowly than the rich countries when they

were growing, but rather that they grew in less years, and indeed experienced many years of

very rapid negative growth, or “growth reversals”. Viewed in this light, the problem of

development becomes one of reducing the variability of short-run growth rates, rather than


                                             27
increasing short-run growth rates. Pritchett (2000) uses a topographical analogy to describe

the difference between those countries that have made the transition to modern economic

growth and those that have not. Modern economic growth is a “continuous hill” and getting

there is the final stage of a dynamic process, which involves dampening growth reversals,

thus avoiding “mountains”, but also “plains” and “plateaus”. This approach can be applied

equally to the pre-World War II period, now that annual data are available back to the

nineteenth century for a sample of 18 countries and back to the medieval period for a sample

of 4 countries. Britain, the first country to achieve modern economic growth, during the

eighteenth century, began the process of dampening growth reversals as early as the medieval

period, following the gains to per capita income after the demographic shock of the Black

Death.



         How did the successfully developing economies dampen and ultimately eliminate

episodes of shrinking? Here we distinguish between proximate and ultimate factors, with

structural change, technological change, demographic change and the changing incidence of

warfare as the main proximate factors. First, agriculture, with its exposure to shrinking

through weather shocks and climate change, has typically declined in importance during the

process of economic development. However, this is better seen as a result rather than a cause

of development, and it is important to consider the effects on both the growing rate and the

shrinking rate, since it is the difference between the two that determines the impact on long

run economic performance. Second, a movement from long run technological stagnation to

trend growth of TFP can turn downturns from years of negative growth to slower positive

growth, although the increase in TFP growth, during the early stages of economic

development has been dwarfed by the decline in the rate of shrinking. Third, a reduction in

population growth can bring about reduced shrinking, although in many cases, the transition


                                             28
to modern economic growth was accompanied by an increase in the rate of population

growth, with a demographic transition occurring only later. Fourth, a reduction in the

incidence of warfare can similarly bring about reduced shrinking, although the transition to

modern economic growth has often occurred during a period of intensification rather than

diminution of warfare. Turning to ultimate factors, we show how institutional change can

bring about the transition to modern economic growth, as society makes the transition from a

system of identity rules to a system of impersonal rules. This can operate through changes in

the proximate factors, as the economy diversifies away from agriculture and experiences an

increase in technological progress, a demographic transition and a more peaceful

environment.
