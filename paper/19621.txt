                                             ABSTRACT

We examine effective tax rates (ETRs) for 9,022 multinationals from 87 countries from 2006 to 2011.
 We find that, despite extensive investments in international tax avoidance, multinationals headquartered
in Japan, the U.S., and some high-tax European countries continue to face substantially higher worldwide
taxes than their counterparts in havens and other less heavily taxed locations. Other findings include:
(a) Effective tax rates remained steady over the investigation period; (b) Entering a tax haven country
for the first time results in a slight reduction in the firm’s ETR; (c) ETR changes vary depending on
whether the subsidiary is a financial conduit or an operating subsidiary. These results should aid ongoing
international tax policy debates and expand scholars’ understanding about the taxation of multinationals.

1. Introduction

         This paper provides the most comprehensive analysis to date of the impact of a

multinational’s locations on its global tax liability. We use Orbis ownership data and Compustat

financial information for 9,022 multinationals headquartered in 87 countries to calibrate the

impact that each country has on the typical firm’s worldwide effective tax rate. We also quantify

the immediate ETR impact of moving into a new country via a foreign subsidiary. The resulting

statistics about various tax systems enhance our understanding of how differences across

countries in corporate taxes affect multinationals. They also provide additional empirical

underpinnings for the continuing international tax policy debates in the United States, the United

Kingdom, and other countries as all nations compete in the market for corporate tax domicile.1

         Markle and Shackelford (2012) compare ETRs for companies around the world using

2009 financial statements. We extend those comparisons through 2011. In addition, the data in

this paper are more extensive, enabling us to conduct two new tests. First, we can (mostly)

reconstruct each multinational’s set of foreign and domestic subsidiaries from 2006-2011.2 This


1
  Tax domicile is the location of the firm for tax purposes. Countries differ in their definitions of domicile, e.g., U.S.
domicile is the country of incorporation; UK domicile is the location of operational headquarters. Throughout the
paper, we observe countries of incorporation and operations and assume that domicile follows. To the extent these
assumptions are wrong, our measures are erroneous.
2
  Orbis lists the subsidiaries ultimately controlled by the multinationals in our sample as of 2011. To determine
when that subsidiary came under the control of the multinational, we use the presence of data in the shareholder
allows us to observe changes in ETRs as firms move into a new country. Second, the new data

disclose the ownership of the subsidiaries (i.e., who owns whom throughout the tiers of the

ownership structure). This permits us to test whether the ETR impact of entering a country

depends on the subsidiary being an active operating company or a financial conduit that holds

stock in other companies.

         The updated comparisons and the results from the new tests should aid policymakers as

they continue to adjudicate two competing views about multinationals and taxes (see discussion

in Toder, 2012). One perspective, widely accepted among American corporate managers, is that

establishing headquarters in the U.S. results in higher total worldwide taxes, that new companies

anticipating substantial foreign operations should not incorporate in the U.S., that U.S. tax law

results in inefficient build-up of cash abroad (e.g., Summers, 2013) and that companies located

outside the U.S. have a tax advantage in the market for corporate control (Nakabayashi and

Carter, 2013, Carroll, 2010, Huizinga and Voget, 2009, and Samuels, 2009, among others).

Reasons include the U.S.’s atypical worldwide tax system, limits on the deductibility of some

expenses, a relatively restrictive controlled foreign corporation (CFC) regime, and aggressive

federal and state tax administration.3 As one example that other countries dominate the U.S. as a

domicile for multinationals and that companies currently domiciled in the U.S. would leave if the

tax costs of exiting were not prohibitive, critics of the current U.S. system point to the strong

legislation and political pressure that were needed to stem the exodus of U.S. companies through

inversions (reincorporations in low-tax countries with no operational impact), following Stanley

information variables in previous years as an indicator that the subsidiary was controlled by the parent in that year.
Unfortunately, we are not able to distinguish whether the first instance of data captures the acquisition of the
subsidiary or the beginning of coverage of the subsidiary by Orbis. Furthermore, because we begin with the set of
subsidiaries controlled by the multinational in 2011, we are unable to identify subsidiaries that were divested in our
sample period.
3
  In overly simplistic terms, countries with territorial systems only tax the domestic income of companies domiciled
in their country. In contrast, countries with worldwide systems tax all income (domestic and foreign) of their home
companies and provide foreign tax credits to prevent double taxation of foreign profits.

Works’ highly controversial aborted move to Bermuda in 2002 (see discussion in Desai and

Hines, 2002). Furthermore, concerns about domicile competitiveness are not limited to the U.S.

In his study of 278 changes in multinational headquarters involving 19 countries from 1997 to

2007, Voget (2011) shows that relocating to reduce global taxes is a widespread phenomenon.4

In fact, a perceived inability to compete in the market for domicile reportedly contributed to the

UK’s 2009 adoption of a territorial system of taxing the foreign profits of British multinationals.5

        Another perspective is less sympathetic to multinationals and the challenges they face in

international taxation. From exposés of Dutch-Irish Sandwiches and other colorfully named tax

plans, to claims of “stateless” income (Kleinbard, 2011a, 2011b), to Congressional and

Parliamentary attacks on high-profile companies, such as Apple, Google, Starbucks, and

Amazon, to OECD reports and plans,6 many believe that multinational firms can easily erase any

disadvantages arising from operating in high-tax domiciles. Scholars too have documented that

multinationals can arrange their affairs to undo differences in taxation across countries.7 By

shifting income from high-tax to low-tax countries through transfer pricing, using hybrid entities

that are treated as corporations in some countries and flow-through entities in others, stripping

profits from high-tax countries through intracompany financing, repatriating under favorable tax

conditions, and other tax avoidance mechanisms, multinationals mitigate, if not fully erode, the

deleterious implications of doing business in a high-tax country.

4
  From a policy perspective, it is important to remember that relocation is a zero-sum game; every relocation is a
loss for one country but a gain for another. Thus, focusing solely on the companies that are leaving a country might
lead to erroneous inferences. For example, in the Voget (2011) sample, more companies (37) left the UK than any
other country. However, the same number relocated to the UK.
5
  For example, at one point, the Financial Times (September 21, 2008) quoted an anonymous source saying, “As we
understand it, half the FTSE 100 is looking at this [redomiciling outside the UK.].” (Braithwaite, 2008).

Shackelford (1997), and Hines and Rice (1994), among many others.

       Thus, how domicile affects a multinational’s total worldwide taxes is an empirical

question. To address these two perspectives, we analyze firm-level financial statement

information. In particular, we regress firm-level ETRs (i.e., total income tax expense as a

percentage of pre-tax income) on categorical variables for the countries in which the

multinational is located—both at the parent and subsidiary levels. The regression coefficients on

the categorical variables estimate the incremental impact of locating the headquarters of the

multinational in a specific country or entering a new country through a subsidiary.

       Our primary finding is that, despite decades of international tax planning and continuing

reports of elaborate innovative schemes to avoid taxes, the effective tax rates of multinationals

vary considerably depending on the sites of the company. We find dramatic differences in

effective tax rates based on the headquarters of the multinational. Japanese-headquartered

multinationals face the highest ETRs, by far. After controlling for industry and size, their ETRs

average 8.5 percentage points higher than their runner-up counterparts from the U.S. The ETRs

of American multinationals are slightly ahead of those from two major trading partners, France

and Germany. On the other end of the distribution, multinationals from the Middle East (Tax

Havens) enjoy ETRs that average 12.5 (10.8) percentage points lower than American firms. In

short, we find that differences continue to persist in ETRs between high-tax and low-tax

countries despite vast investment in international tax avoidance.

       Other findings include the following: (1) Prior work had shown that worldwide ETRs

fell in recent decades. We find stable ETRs from 2006 to 2011. (2) Industries are taxed

similarly around the world, albeit with construction taxed a bit lightly and information a bit more

heavily. Compared with the rest of the world, the U.S. taxes the financial services more heavily

and information more lightly. (3) When a company first enters a tax haven, ETRs fall but only



                                                 4
by a small amount. (4) Whether a subsidiary is an equity holding company or a terminal

operating subsidiary alters its ETR effect.

       The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 outlines the research

design. Section 3 presents the empirical findings. Closing remarks follow.



2. Research Design

   2.1. Regression Equation

       It is difficult to undertake statistical analyses of cross-country variation, such as the

impact of headquarter domicile on multinational ETRs, because country-level unobservables

undermine identification. Ideally, we would address this limitation by randomly assigning

headquarter countries to multinationals. Alternatively, if companies regularly moved their

headquarters, then remedies, such as fixed effects, difference-in-differences, or instrumental

variables, could provide reliable causal links. Unfortunately, too few companies move their

headquarters across borders to provide sufficient power. Thus, in these initial tests of the impact

of headquarters on firm ETRs, we mostly avoid statistical comparisons.

       In light of these econometric challenges, we take the actual firm-level ETRs, control for

as many observable factors as possible, and report the remaining variation in ETRs by country.

For example, we control for industry because if the mining sector faces relatively low taxes

throughout the world because of tax incentives for natural resources, then countries with

disproportionately large numbers of miners might appear to enjoy lower levels of taxation than

other countries do, even though the difference actually arises because of the industry mix.

However, it is important to recognize that including control variables in a regression does not

provide assurance that the country-level observables that plague cross-country tests have been



                                                  5
fully accounted for. Thus, the average tax rates that we compute should be viewed as statistics

about tax systems, rather than measures of economic incentives.

         With that caveat, we use the pooled, cross-sectional regression equation developed in

Markle and Shackelford (2012) with the sole modification that we drop all variables involving

indicators for multinational firms because all companies in this study are multinationals. By

suppressing the intercept, the coefficients on the COUNTRY variables can be interpreted as the

marginal cost of domiciling in a country, conditional on the control variables.




where:                    total worldwide income tax expense divided by net income before

                          an indicator variable equal to 1 if firm i is domiciled in country j in year

                          t, equal to 0 otherwise.

                          an indicator variable equal to 1 if firm i is identified as being in

                          industry k (by two-digit NAICS) in year t, equal to 0 otherwise.

                          an indicator variable equal to 1 for firm-years for which t = m, equal to

                          n={Assets, Revenue, Owners’ Equity}.

         For the dependent variable, we opt for total income tax expense in the numerator, as

opposed to current income tax expense or cash taxes paid. The reason is that many non-U.S.

companies only report the total income tax figure; thus, using the total provision maximizes the

sample size. We recognize that the total income tax expense is an imperfect measure of the


                                                     6
firm’s actual taxes paid in part because it fails to capture the impact of transactions for which

taxable income is recognized after book income. 8 However, we take comfort from Markle and

Shackelford’s (2012) finding that the Pearson correlation coefficient between total and current

income tax expense is 95%, suggesting that the increase in sample size may justify any loss of

information about cross-firm differences in deferral tax avoidance. Finally, to mitigate the

impact of outliers and errors in the data, we limit the sample to observations with non-negative

ETRs less than or equal to 70%.



    2.2. Sample

         We conduct our tests using the most recent ownership information in Orbis (usually 2011

financial statement data). Orbis, a database maintained by Bureau van Dijk, dominates other

databases because it enables us to observe the country locations for both headquarters and the

foreign subsidiaries of many multinationals and to determine the ownership structure for the

subsidiaries. We then match these firms to financial statement data in Compustat’s Global and

North America databases. The sample selection process yields 42,738 multinational-years from

2006 through 2011 spanning 87 countries, ranging from only five firm-years in two countries

(Bahrain and Kazakhstan) to 13,234 observations in the United States. We combine countries

with fewer than 400 observations into six categories: Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America,

Middle East, and Tax Havens. The remaining fifteen countries are included on their own and our




8
  See Graham et al. (2012) for a detailed discussion of the different tax figures found in the financial statements and
the imperfections of each for tests such as these. In simplest terms, total income tax expense is the product of the
tax rate and pre-tax book income adjusted for any items that are never subject to tax. Current income tax expense is
the portion of total income tax expense that relates to the current year’s taxable income. Cash taxes paid are the
actual taxes paid to all governments in a particular year related to tax returns from the current and past years, net of
any refunds.

main tests are conducted and results are reported using these 21 countries and groups (hereafter

referred to simply as “countries”).

        For the 21 countries, Table 1 reports the firm-year means of Sales, Assets, Equity, Pretax

income, ETR, and statutory tax rates.9 31% of the sample are companies whose headquarters are

domiciled in the U.S. The mean American company has sales of $4.4 billion, assets of $10.9

billion, equity of $2.3 billion, pretax income of $0.4 billion, and an ETR of 28%.



3. Findings

    3.1. Does the Location of the Multinational’s Headquarters Matter?

        Table 2 presents all regression coefficients from estimating equation (1). The COUNTRY

coefficients are of primary interest because they denote the incremental ETR impact to a

multinational of having its headquarters in a specific country. The wide range of COUNTRY

coefficients is striking with the maximum value (30.4% for Japan) more than triple the smallest

(9.4% for the Middle East, which relies on non-income tax levies on its natural resources). The

U.S. has the second largest coefficient at 21.9%. The next four smallest coefficients all hail from

locations associated with international tax avoidance: Tax Havens (11.1%), Singapore (13%),

Switzerland (13.1%), and Taiwan (14.6%).

        The results are not surprising in that they confirm widely-held views about which

countries have the highest income taxes and which ones have the lowest income taxes.

Nonetheless, it remains remarkable that with increasingly integrated global capital markets,

domicile remains such an important factor in determining a multinational’s total income tax

burden. Apparently the tax and non-tax frictions of moving to a less heavily taxed domicile are

non-trivial. Otherwise, it is hard to explain the persistence of Japanese companies with

COUNTRY coefficients exceeding 30.4% while Singaporean companies enjoy coefficients of just

13.0%.10 These coefficient differences imply that the typical Singaporean company has an

enormous advantage over its Japanese competitor, pocketing 17.4 cents more for every dollar of

pre-tax profit. Restated, these estimates imply that a Japanese company that relocated its tax

domicile to Singapore without affecting any other aspects of its business would increase its

bottom line by 25% [(1-.13)/(1-.304)]. Other sizeable imbalances involving companies from

similar markets include French companies at 21.7% when British companies are at 16.2%;

American companies at 21.9% while Canadian companies are at 17.5%, and German companies

at 20.6% when Swiss companies are at 13.1%.

         The magnitude of the COUNTRY coefficients should not be taken as estimates of the

actual ETRs from the financial statements, because the coefficients are the actual ETRs,

conditional on industry, year, and size. Instead, the coefficients should be compared with each

other. To aid in that comparison, Table 3 presents the results of F-tests comparing the

COUNTRY coefficients for each country generated by estimating equation (1). It confirms the

widespread differences among the equation (1) coefficients. A star in a cell of Table 3 indicates

that the COUNTRY coefficient for the row country is statistically significantly different from the




10
  One potential explanation for the persistence of these large differentials is that income generated in Japan is taxed
heavily and income generated in Singapore is taxed lightly. Then, if Japanese companies operate mostly in high-tax
Japan and Singaporean companies operate mostly in low-tax Singapore, we might erroneously infer that
headquarters matters when actually the location of operations determines the difference between Japanese and
Singaporean companies’ tax rates. Unfortunately, firms do not segregate their profits into domestic and foreign
portions in their financial statements; so, we are unable to assess the extent to which differences in domestic taxation
drives our inferences about headquarter effects.

COUNTRY coefficient of the column country.11 The American COUNTRY coefficient differs

significantly from every other country’s coefficient, except the ones for France and South Africa.

         In summary, these findings are consistent with the location of a firm’s headquarters

continuing to affect its global tax burden. We infer that, contrary to the assertions of some and

despite many successful strategies for shifting profits from high-tax countries to low-tax

countries, companies domiciled in high-tax countries still appear to pay much higher global

taxes.



     3.2. Variation in Headquarter ETR Effects Over Time and Industry

         Tables 2 and 3 present results from tests that combine all firm-years from 2006-2011.

Next, we estimate COUNTRY coefficients separately for each year to test whether ETRs have

been trending over the six years under investigation. Instead, we find that ETRs have been

generally steady over the period.

         Table 4 shows that the distribution of countries from high-tax to low-tax remains

consistent throughout the six years. Every year Japan has the largest COUNTRY coefficient, and

the Middle East, the Tax Havens, Singapore and Switzerland are among the five locations with

the lowest coefficients. The U.S. has the penultimate COUNTRY coefficient every year except

2011, when it comes in fourth. Moreover, the coefficients do not appear to be uniformly rising

or falling over time. However, they are generally larger in 2009 and smaller in 2011. Thirteen

of the 21 locations have their largest coefficient in 2009, while none has its lowest that year. In

contrast, 14 of the 21 locations have their lowest ETR estimate in 2011, while none has its

highest coefficient in that year.

11
 For example, the star in the upper left-hand corner indicates that the COUNTRY coefficients for Australia and
China are significantly different at the 5% level; the lack of a star for Australia and Canada shows that their
COUNTRY coefficients are not statistically different.

                                                        10
           Next, we assess whether ETRs vary across industries. To do so, we modify equation (1)

to include an interaction between COUNTRY and INDUSTRY.




We group two-digit SIC codes to ensure that each reported industry has at least 1,000 firm-years.

All observations are included in the regressions, but only cells with 20 or more observations are

reported. Manufacturers comprise 40% of the firm-years, followed by financial companies at

20%.

           Table 5 breaks out the COUNTRY, INDUSTRY, and COUNTRY*INDUSTRY coefficients

from estimating equation (2). The COUNTRY coefficients are in the far left column identified as

the “Country main effect.” The INDUSTRY coefficients are in the top row column identified as

the “Industry main effect.” The COUNTRY*INDUSTRY coefficients occupy the rest of the

table.12

           With one exception, the INDUSTRY coefficients range from -3.2% (Construction) to

5.4% (Information). This suggests that across the globe, on average, Construction is more lightly

taxed than other industries and Information is more heavily taxed. The exception to this fairly

tight industry band is Transportation at -18.9%. At first blush, this would imply that the

Transportation industry is extremely tax-advantaged worldwide compared with other industries.

However, the COUNTRY*INDUSTRY interactions involving Transportation are uniformly very

large and positive, offsetting this large negative main effect. Thus, when both main and

interactive effects are jointly considered, the Transportation industry is not an outlier. However,
12
  To get the total ETR impact for a particular industry in a specific country, sum these three coefficients. For
example, to compute the ETR impact for the Australian construction industry, sum 19.5% (Australia country main
effect), -3.2% (Construction industry main effect) and 8.8% (the COUNTRY*INDUSTRY coefficient for Australian
Construction for a total ETR effect of 25.1%.

                                                       11
because of the unusual coefficients for the Transportation industry, we ignore it in the remainder

of our discussion of Table 5.

       The interaction coefficients enable us to see how specific countries vary their taxes across

industries, after accounting for the normal worldwide variation captured in the Industry main

effect, discussed above. For example, compared with other countries (and ignoring

Transportation), the U.S. taxes Information relatively lightly, as shown by a -8.9% interaction

term, and taxes Finance relatively heavily, as demonstrated by a 4.9% interaction term. We find

striking similarities across countries in the interaction terms. Specifically, we compute the

Pearson coefficient correlation using the interaction terms for the six countries with enough firm-

years to report coefficients for all industries (i.e., China, Sweden, UK, U.S., Europe and Tax

Havens). Despite marked tax and non-tax differences across these six countries, the smallest

correlation among the 15 pairs formed by them is 72%, indicating that the interaction terms rise

and fall together across industries for these six countries. The U.S. correlations range from 79%

(Sweden) to 93% (Europe).



   3.3. How Does Expansion into a New Country affect a Multinational’s Worldwide ETR?

       So far, the paper has looked at the ETR effect of the country in which the multinational

establishes its headquarters. We now shift to quantifying the immediate impact on effective tax

rates of expanding into a new country through a foreign subsidiary. To assess the immediate

impact of the country location of a foreign subsidiary on a multinational’s ETR, we regress ETR

on categorical variables that identify the countries in which a firm has subsidiaries. Using a firm

fixed effects model and a control for year, the regression equation is:




                                                 12
where:                    an indicator variable equal to 1 if firm i reports a subsidiary in country

                          k, equal to 0 otherwise;

Because we adopt a firm fixed effects model, maintain the year dummy, and have a sample

where the foreign subsidiary locations only change when the multinational expands, the SUB

coefficient captures the impact on effective tax rates of entering a new country. Therefore, each

SUB coefficient is the estimated ETR impact in the first year arising from establishing a

subsidiary in a particular foreign country.

         We use the same sample of 42,738 firm-years from 2006-2011. For these firm-years,

there are 224,090 SUB variables with a value of one, led by 23,807 subsidiaries in the United

States, 16,957 in the United Kingdom, and 10,098 in Germany.

         The first column of Table 6 shows the SUB regression coefficient estimates for the 48

countries with at least 1000 firm-years where SUB has a value of one. Coefficients range from

-1.3 for Belgium (implying that multinationals from all countries lower their ETRs by 1.3

percentage points on average when they enter Belgium) to 1.9 for the British Virgin Islands

(implying that multinationals increase their ETRs by 1.9 percentage points on average when they

enter the British Virgin Islands). Both of these coefficients are significantly different from zero.

However, they are the exceptions. Only two other coefficients are significant at the 10% level—

Poland at -0.9 and the United States at 0.7, the latter estimate consistent with assertions that the

U.S. is a high-tax country. The shortage of statistically significant coefficients is not surprising

because the immediate influence of any single subsidiary on a multinational’s worldwide tax

liability should be small. The net effect of many companies from many countries (plus the

normal measurement error that plagues all empirical work) would not be expected to result in


                                                 13
huge percentage point changes in effective tax rates. Nonetheless, we do find the sign and

magnitude of the coefficients interesting.

            Other countries with particularly large positive coefficients are Portugal (0.9), Sweden

(0.9), Romania (0.7), Argentina (0.7) and the UK (0.7). Other locations where foreign

subsidiaries appear to substantially lower ETRs are Slovakia (-0.9), Denmark (-0.8), and the

Cayman Islands (-0.7), a well-known tax haven. Consistent with establishing a subsidiary in a

tax haven leading to a reduction in effective tax rates, the mean (median) coefficient for the

countries most commonly identified as tax havens (Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Hong Kong,

Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Singapore, Switzerland, Taiwan and Other Tax Havens)

is slightly negative at -0.2 (-0.1). Surprisingly, however, the SUB coefficients are not correlated

with the statutory tax rates for these countries, implying that the immediate effect of a foreign

subsidiary’s statutory tax rate is undone or masked when it is included as part of a

multinational’s portfolio of locations around the world.

            The remainder of Table 6 shows the SUB coefficients when the regression is run for

subsets based on the headquarters of the multinational.13 For example, the U.S. column shows

the results from equation (3) when the only observations are firm-years for American

multinationals. Coefficients vary widely by the domicile of the multinational’s parent. By

comparing the coefficients across countries, we can see the extent to which ETR impact of a

foreign subsidiary fluctuates across countries. For example, the impact appears similar for

American, British and German multinationals with positive Pearson correlation coefficients for

these three columns of regression estimates. In contrast, both the U.S. and UK columns of

coefficients are negatively correlated with the Japanese column of coefficients, implying that

establishing a subsidiary for a Japanese company in a particular country has a very different
13
     Coefficients are reported if there are at least 100 firm-years.

                                                              14
immediate impact on effective tax rates than it does for an American or British company.

Reviewing a few key tax havens demonstrates the divergence between U.S. and Japanese

coefficients: The Hong Kong coefficient for American (Japanese) multinationals is -0.7 (1.8).

The Irish coefficient for American (Japanese) multinationals is -0.3 (-3.1). The Singaporean

coefficient for American (Japanese) multinationals is zero (-1.7).



   3.4. Comparisons of Operating Subsidiaries and Holding Companies

       Dyreng et al. (2013) stress that not all subsidiaries are the same. Some house operations;

others are financial conduits transporting capital from headquarters to those operating

subsidiaries. The remaining tests in the paper distinguish between operating subsidiaries and

their corporate shareholders, which may conduct production, marketing, and other nonfinancial

activities of the firm, but (principally) serve as financial links between headquarters and the

operating subsidiaries. The purpose of these tests is to see if the type of subsidiary affects its

impact on effective tax rates.

       We anticipate that taxes play a secondary role, if any, in the location of operating

subsidiaries. For example, if operating subsidiaries are principally concerned with sales, then

demand for the company’s products likely drives the site. If the operating subsidiaries are

principally for manufacturing, then efficiencies associated with the factors of production likely

drive the location. On the other hand, the fungibility of money provides some flexibility in site

decisions for holding companies, which merely serve to pass funds from headquarters to

operating subsidiaries. Thus, we expect to see the location decisions for at least some financial

conduits to be tax-motivated with likely destinations being tax havens and larger countries noted

for facilitating tax avoidance, such as the Netherlands.



                                                  15
        To compare operating and financial subsidiaries, we use the Dyreng et al. (2013) sample

of terminal operating subsidiaries and their immediate corporate shareholders. Unfortunately,

their data are limited to American, British, Canadian, French, German, Italian, and Japanese-

headquartered multinationals, which nearly halves our sample to 23,004 firm-years. Untabulated

sensitivity tests, however, provide some confidence that this smaller sample is representative of

the larger sample that we have used to date in this paper.14

          Table 7 enables us to compare regression coefficient estimates for terminal operating

subsidiaries (Panel A) and equity holding companies (Panel B). Specifically, Panel A presents

findings from reestimating a modified equation (3), where we assign one to SUB only if the firm

has a subsidiary in the country that is a terminal subsidiary, i.e., owns stock in no other company.

Following Dyreng et al., 2013, we infer that terminal subsidiaries are solely operating

subsidiaries because, by definition, they own no other companies. Panel B depicts statistics from

reestimating a different modification of equation (3), assigning one to SUB only if the firm has a

subsidiary in the country that owns a terminal subsidiary. We report countries with at least 500

subsidiaries and coefficients with at least 100 firm-years.

        When observing Table 7, we first notice that Panel A reports results for 117,062 terminal

operating subsidiaries spread across 48 countries. In contrast, Panel B presents findings for only

37,517 equity holding companies in 18 countries. Furthermore, 14% of the operating

subsidiaries are located in tax havens and larger countries associated with international tax

planning (specifically, Hong Kong, Ireland, Netherlands, Singapore or Switzerland),

significantly less than the 18% of the financial conduits found in those countries. This is


14
  To assess the impact of the smaller sample on our analyses, we reestimate equation (3) using the reduced sample.
When we compare results using the complete sample of 42,738 observations from Table 6 with results using the
sample of only 23,004 firm-years, we find the two columns of regression coefficients for American multinationals is
correlated at the 97% level, suggesting inferences are largely the same using the smaller sample.

                                                        16
consistent with real operations occurring throughout the world wherever business opportunities

arise with less concern for taxes, while financial conduits are more likely to be concentrated in

countries that can facilitate tax-efficient cash transfer along the company’s equity supply chain

(see discussion in Dyreng et al., 2013). For example, a multinational might set up an equity

holding company in the Netherlands for all of its European operating subsidiaries because Dutch

holding companies enjoy certain advantages in global cash management. In our data, the Dutch

holding company would appear as a single observation in Panel B, while each of the operating

companies in the different European countries would show up as separate observations in Panel

A.

       Recognizing the financial conduit specialization in certain countries, we now turn to the

more relevant question for this inquiry, namely, do coefficients vary depending on whether the

subsidiary is an operating company or a holding company? To test this question, we compute

the Pearson correlation coefficient for the columns of coefficients in Panel A and Panel B. Using

all firm-years, the correlation coefficient is -0.01, implying that the immediate ETR impact of an

operating subsidiary in a country is unrelated to the immediate impact of a financial conduit in

the same country.

       When we restrict the correlation test to multinationals headquartered in specific countries,

we find conflicting results. For American multinationals, the Pearson correlation coefficient is

negative (-0.21), suggesting that operating and financial subsidiaries immediately affect ETRs in

opposite directions. For example, establishing an operating company in Luxembourg for an

American multinational results in an immediate 0.7 percentage point ETR boost, on average;

whereas, a financial intermediary in Luxembourg immediately drives down ETRs by 2.1

percentage points. We also find negative correlations for France (-0.18) and Germany (-0.75).



                                                17
However, the sign is positive for Japan (0.27) and the UK (0.59), suggesting that operating and

financial subsidiaries affect ETR similarly in the first year in those countries. We infer from

these results that in at least some countries the immediate tax effects of locating a subsidiary in a

country vary substantially depending on whether the subsidiary is an operating company or a

financial conduit. The takeaway is that focusing simply on where a multinational has its

subsidiaries may be insufficient to understand the immediate ETR impact of a country; rather, it

may be necessary to know the type of subsidiary that is being deployed.

       Next, we estimate the following regression to identify individual countries where

subsidiary type matters:




where HOLD is one if the firm has an equity holding subsidiary. Significant HOLD coefficients

will indicate that the immediate ETR impact for a subsidiary varies whether the subsidiary is a

financial conduit or a terminal holding company. In untabulated results, we find that the HOLD

coefficient is significantly greater than zero for three countries (Brazil, Spain, and the United

States) and significantly less than zero for five countries (Australia, Cayman Islands, Finland,

Luxembourg, and Poland). Note that two of the countries with negative HOLD coefficients, the

Cayman Islands and Luxembourg, are tax havens, suggesting that these countries are effective

locations for establishing financial conduits that can lead to immediate effective tax rate

reductions.

       The final set of tests introduces an interaction between types of subsidiaries that enables

us to examine each of the subsidiary components by estimating the following equation:




                                                 18
OPERATE is one if the firm has a terminal subsidiary, and its coefficients capture the main effect

for operating companies, i.e., the impact in the first year of establishing a holding company in the

country. The HOLD coefficients capture the main effect for financial conduits, i.e., the impact in

the first year of establishing a holding company in the country. The interaction’s coefficients

capture the joint effect on ETRs in the first year of having both the operating and the holding

company.15

         Although Table 8 only reports interactions if there are at least 500 firm-years, there

remain far too many to detail here. For brevity, we leave them for the reader to peruse. We

close by noting that the most negative HOLD coefficients are for tax havens: Other Tax Havens

(-5.5), the Netherlands (-3.1), and Luxembourg (-2.5).16 This is consistent with tax havens being

a highly desirable location for equity holding companies. Of course, using this same logic, we

might have expected Ireland and Switzerland to have had negative HOLD coefficients, but

neither does. The U.S. has a positive coefficient (2.8), consistent with its reputation as a lousy

base for global expansion because of its worldwide tax system. Nonetheless, many companies

have American holding companies. As with much of the documentation in this paper, the

findings raise as many questions as they answer. We look forward to future work, both

theoretical and empirical, that furthers our understanding of how multinationals undertake

efficient international tax planning.



15
   Note that the interaction is one even if the conduit does not hold stock in that particular operating company. For
example, suppose a firm has a holding company in the Netherlands and an operating company in China. The
interaction of China and the Netherlands is one even if the Dutch holding company does not own the stock of the
Chinese operations.
16
   These coefficients can be interpreted as: ETRs average 5.5 (3.1) [2.5] percentage points less for companies that
have an equity holding company located in one of the small tax havens not specifically identified (Netherlands)
[Luxembourg].

4. Closing Remarks

       This paper extends our understanding of the impact of country location on effective tax

rates. It updates prior work with more recent financial statement information, provides the first

estimates of the immediate ETR impact of entering a new country, and explores differences in

the tax impact of financial and operating subsidiaries. The empirical documentation should

benefit policymakers, practitioners, and researchers who wrestle with the complex issues

surrounding international tax policy.

       Our principal findings include:

      Despite enormous investments in tax planning designed to flatten the differences in taxes

       across countries, the tax domicile of a company appears to be a major determinant of a

       firm’s worldwide effective tax rate. Major differences persist in the ETRs of

       multinationals simply because their parents reside in different countries. For example,

       establishing headquarters in Japan, rather than Singapore, results in a 17 percentage point

       increase in a firm’s ETR. Yet, Japanese companies continue to compete favorably

       against Singaporean and other companies located in much more tax-favorable domiciles.

       The same is true for American multinationals (whose ETRs are second only to Japan’s).

       This persistence of widely divergent ETRs deserves further investigation.

      Effective tax rates were stable from 2006-2011. This stands in contrast to studies of

       earlier periods that had documented a steady worldwide decline in ETRs.

      Compared with the rest of the world, the U.S. taxes financial firms more heavily and the

       information sector more lightly.

      When a multinational enters a tax haven for the first time, its ETR usually declines

       slightly.


                                                20
      The tax impact of entering a new country through a subsidiary differs depending on

       whether the subsidiary is an equity holding company or an operating company.



       We close by repeating two caveats. This paper relies on the tax information in the

financial statements, not actual tax return data. To the extent the accounting data poorly capture

a firm’s actual tax activities, we measure with error. The same criticisms can be made about our

reliance on accounting disclosures for determining the tax domicile of the firm and its portfolio

of subsidiaries. If the financial statements are a poor lens through which to observe these aspects

of the company, our inferences could be misleading. On the positive side, the extensive

aggregation in this paper should mitigate any firm-level measurement error. Nonetheless,

readers should interpret these findings with caution.

       Second, as discussed above, our statistical tests of the effect of headquarters on ETRs are

potentially flawed because of identification problems that plague cross-country comparisons.

Although some companies have changed the headquarters country and in fact inversions and

similar locations are a partial motivation of this paper, too few have done so to provide us with

enough power to conduct tests that would better specify causal links. Thus, once again, readers

should be cautious. These problems should not affect our analyses of foreign subsidiaries

because companies often change the location of their foreign subsidiaries and in fact the

movement into new countries is the source of variation that we exploit in our tests of foreign

subsidiaries.
