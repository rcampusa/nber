                           A TEST OF CONSUMPTION INSURANCE


                                         ABSTRACT




    Are individuals        effectively   insured    against    idiosyncratic   shocks   to

income or wealth by either formal or informal mechanisms?               This paper shows

that under perfect   insursnce,    marginal utility should grow at the same rate

for all consumers,   and that the distribution        of measured consumption growth

rates should be independent of variables that are exogenous            to the individual

consumer when we allow for measurement error in consumption and for vsristion

in preferences.    This proposition is tested by cross sectional regressions of

individual   consumption    growth on s variety      of variables    that should not be

correlated with it under perfect insurance)           including     illness, being   fired

from s job, etc.

L   Introduction


       If    markets    were     complete          and    perfect,     or   if there       was     some other

institution     or mechanism         that implemented a full                information pareto optimal

consumption     allocation,          then    individuals'         consumption      would vary only with

              consumption        and would not respond to idiosyncratic                       variations      in
aggregate

income      or wealth.         This proposition                can be viewed as         a cross       aectional


counterpart      to the permanent             income       hypothesis:      perfect     insurance        implies

that consumption         growth should not vary across                      individuals     in response       to

idiosyncratic          shocks,       just     as     perfect        asset     markets      imply      that    an

individual's consumption             should not vary over time in response to temporary

shocks in income.




       At face value this is a ludicrous proposition:                          the consumption         of state

lottery     winners     certainly      rises,       even when aggregate            consumption        declines.

However,     it is not so obvious that the proposition                         is ludicrous        for shocks

that are important to macroeconornists: when an consumer                              loses his job, gets

sick, works      in an industry             that    suffers a loss          in demand,     etc.,      does that

consumer     suffer a loss of wealth,               revealed in his consumption choice?                  Or are

such   shocks effectively             insured,           either   by formal        instituti.ons such         as


unemployment      and     disability          insurance,          or   by    the    network      of    informa].


institutions     that can proxy             for insurance,         including       gifts and "loans" from

relatives,      friends        and    neighbors,           "labor      hoarding"      or   other       implicit

insurance     on the part of employers,                  local or national charities,            etc.?




                                                           1
        Beyond direct interest in this question,                       the presente     or strength of

consumption insursnce has further implications in a number or contexts.                              As a

first    example,    perfect      insurance        implies    the existence       of s representative

consumer,     i.e. a social welfsre               function    that is independent        of changes in

the distribution of income or wealth (but not, in general,                          independent of the

individual Pareto weights).             Without perfect insurance, the existence of such

a representative          consumer    depends on specific             functional    foras   for utility

and technology,           for example       quadratic       utility     and   linear    technology   (see

Hansen (1986)).            As a result,           the     presumed    lack of perfect       conaumption

insurance     in the real world is often cited as an explanation for empirical

failures of representative             consumer models, and as                motivation for studying

macroeconomic       and financial theories without perfect insurance and hence with

"missing    markets"       and a dependence             on the ex post distribution          of wealth.

(Conatantinedes        (1988)       gives     a    good    review     of recent     research in this

direction.)          By     testing     for       consumption        insurance,    we    can test the

presumption behind this explanation and motivation.



            As a second example,              the need for           explicit   treatment    of private

information    in macroeconomics            is similarly       ascribed to a lack of consumption

insurance     due    to    that   private         information.        In many private       information

setups, the Pareto optimal consumption allocation                       less than perfectly insures

individuals    against       risk, as a result of moral hazard.                    A test for perfect

consumption insurance is a teat of this implication, and hence a teat for the

empirical relevance            of     private       information        theory for       macroeconomics.

Conversely,    in many circumstances it is attractive to apply the results of a
full    information      Pareto     planning exercise            directly   to    an actual    economy

without worrying about the mechanism                  or market or other           institutions    that

implement    it (see Townsend (1987)); a test for consumption insurance can give

us some evidence whether this approach is a good idea for our economy.




       The basic idea of the tests for consumption insurance in this paper is

that    since    individual       consumption       growth should only depend on aggregate

consumption growth, then             should equal zero in a regression like


                           +                                                                        (I)
        Ac   —o+$X
where         — a measure      of household j's nondurable consumption growth, and X.
        ac
is some shock variable             that    is exogenous      to the consumer (not a decision

variable),       for    example    days of work lost              due   to illness.       By running

regressions      like (1) we not only test the theory (which, as mentioned above,

is ludicrous      if take too literally)        ,
                                                    but    we can find out for which shocks and

                                             the theory does hold, snd for which               it does
among which groups of consumers

not.




        In a perfectly measured economy of identical consumers                         with constant

relative     risk aversion,        there    should be no error          term     in a regression    (1)


under     perfect insurance:          each individual's            consumption      growth would     be

exactly         equal   to all the         others    and    to    aggregate      consumption   growth.

However,     we can expect an error term when applying (1) to our economy.                          The


theory of perfect insurance states that the growth in marginal utility of

consumption      should be the same          for all consumers, but measured consumption

growth can vary across individuals if the consumers' utility functions have

                                                      3
different shapes, undergo ahifrs, or if consumption growth is measured with

error.      In particular, I will take a household as the basic unit of analysis

rather than           try    to       construct   an age-standardized           per        capita      consumption

              so                                                                           -
measure,             changes in the composition of the household                       -
                                                                                               having     a baby or

a child     leaving         --    are an      obvious source of preference             shocks,         as are     the

aging    of     existing          household       members,     or   shocks      to    the       preferences       of

individuals         in the household.




        Since       the error term is compoaed of measurement error and variation in

preferences,           it is important            to pick right hand side variables                       that are

plausibly uncorrelated with the measurement error in consumption,                                         that are

well measured themselves,                     and that       are    uncorrelated       with variation in

preferences          across individuals            and with preference           shocks.            For    example,

quitting        s    job    might       be    correlated     with other         events          that    reduce    an

individual's         desired          level   (marginal utility)       of consumption,              end so would

not be an appropriate right hand vsrisble; being fired from a job is more

plausibly uncorrelated                   with such events.             Hence,        the       best right        hand

variables       in an equation like (1) are vsrisbles                     that are exogenous                to the

household, and not decision vsriables of the household.



        In psrticulsr,            I    will not emphasize          income as s right             hand variable.

Though regarding income as exogenous to the individual has a long and honored

tradition,      households            that undergo a preference        shock (say, having a baby, or

having a child leave) have an incentive to work more or less to incresse or

decrease income.            This is especially important if the shock is unexpected, or



                                                         4
if well functioning insurance markets are accompanied by poorly functioning

markets for borrowing            and lending.      Hence,    income   is quite       likely    to be


correlated with preference shocks.



       The observation that individual's consumption should vary together under
                                                  assertion are of course not
perfect insurance, and the attempt to verify this

new.    As a few examples, Scheinkmann and Weiss                (1986) look at variation            in

                                                             at consumption
consumption across countries, Abel and Kotlikoff (1988) look

within s dynastic                     in which case         altruistic      preferences     are     the
                           family,

mechanism for perfect insurance, and Mace (1988) focuses on the use of income

as a right hand variable,             using    a variety     of techniques       to mitigate its

potencial     correlation with the error          term.




2. Testable     Implications of Consumption Insurance




       This   section presents       two results. First, under perfect              insurance,      the

                         of consumption         should    grow at     the    same    rate     for   all
marginal      utility

                                                                            to be independent        of
individuals.         Second,     consumption    growth rates     ought

variables     that are external       to the consumer, and hence uncorrelaced with the

consumer's                             shocks,     and measurement       error      in consumption.
               type, preference

This last proposition is the basis of the tests that follow.



       I will characterize the behavior of consumption under perfect markets by

               the      Pareto                 rather    than explicitly constructing                an
examining                          problem



                                                   5
equilibrium or other implementation                  mechanism.         The Pareto problem is


        max             S       ($i)t
                            t
                                        u(c)
              j

(j   indexes consumers and t indexes time) subject to a feasibility constraint.

The period utility function uJ(c3) may include preference                                     shocks.     Other

goods, and leisure               in particular, may enter separably                (this is generalized

below)        The feasibility constrsint is

        cA        TA
         t         t


where    c        —
                       E.c,     and TA    is   the aggregate          amount of the    consumption         good

available         at time t.        (A indicates aggregate quantities).



        In    an        endowment       economy,    the       total    endowment     is       available      for

distribution,
         A    eA

where    eA —         .e3   and e3 are endowment          streams (labor income)          .    With     a linear

capital accumulation technology, we have instead


        TA_RKA+eA KA1                                                                                        (5)


where    K    denotes the capital stock or nonhuman wealth at time t.                             The form of

the intertemporal               transformation     of consumption will drop from the analysis,

so more complicated production technologies will give the same results.                                      The

important assumption is that conaumption can be coatlessly reallocated                                    across

individuals, embodied in (3).

(6)   and (7) may hold independently of each other.                                    A group of agents may be

relevant marginal product; conversely, they may be able to borrow and lend or

to invest in backyard technologies, and not be perfectly                                         insured.

        The equality of marginal utility growth does not imply that consumption

growth        rates         should be       equal,         unless     consumers     have   identical     CRRA

preferences           and    consumption        is perfectly          measured.     To derive a testable

implication,          I'll    first     display     a parametric          example   that makes     the logic

clear, and then pteaent the general statement.                            Assume that utility functions

display constant relative risk aversion with a multiplicative                              shock
                                                                                                   S,   and a

risk aversion coefficient y that is common across consuznera.

    (f is written this way because marginal utility growth depends                                         c+r
and     not   just on the growth rate                          t+/c,      without power           utility.)          The

properties       of the function f are unessential; what matters is the list of

variables       that make measured consumption growth rates vary across individuals

while marginal utility growth is constant.




        With the measurement error                              in consumption     growth, the equality of

marginal utility growth (8)                   implies that

of variables that affect marginal utility growth given consumption growth}



        If leisure (or another good) enters the utility function nonseparably,

then leisure affects               the marginal utility of consumption,                      and this drives a

further       wedge    between          marginal         utility                 and consumption
                                                                       growth                                 growth.

However,      leisure must enter in a way that is nonseparable                                   under arbitrary

monotone        tranaformations,             not     just linear         transformations,              as           the

ordinal       properties           of       the     utility         functions,    or       marginal         rates    of

substitution,         enter into the derivation of the equality of marginal utility

after a log transformation.                       With nonsepsrsbilities that cannot be removed by

a monotonic        transformation,                the    prediction      that    consumption           growth rates
should     be     independent           of              will    still    hold,    if       X3     is     distributed

       Under    perfect      insurance,     we predict      that     coefficients           as   in (14)

should equal zero.           If we find a nonzero coefficient,             it is tempting to cast

this    not just       as    a statistical      rejection     of the      theory,        but also      as   a

measurement of the rule for the allocation                     of consumption            conditional        on

outcomes    X      The caveat to this interpretation               is that if there are several

variables       that   are    not   perfectly      insured,    say    X   and        ,
                                                                                          and if these

variables      are correlated,       then a single regression             coefficient        as in (14)

will not be the same as the true allocation rule, which would be revealed by

the multiple regression coefficient of consumption growth on both X3 and




3. Results




        I used data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics for the years 1981                               -



1984.     Table 1 presents a description of the variables.                      I   used two measures

of consumption         growth.      In the first, I rejected households                    that had any


change    in composition, because composition changes ought to imply a shift                                in

the household's        utility function.        The second measure of consumption does not

screen out these households.                Utility   shifts    induced by family composition


changes contribute to the error              term in (14);      since the right hand variables

are chosen to be uncorrelated with those shifts, the inclusion of households

that change                          does    not    bias    coefficient      estimates,          but    will
                   composition

                                                                         in composition
influence      standard errors.       Including households with a change

raises        the   variance    of the         error          term,      but       incresses      the    number of

observations.




        The right hand variables include illness, strikes, being forced to move,

involuntary         job loss, and weeks                looking        for   unemployment.            I    also    used
hot:   hold     composition change as a right hand variable                             as a test whether          the

technique       can    pick up a coefficient                  we know should be positive,                        and   I

included the obvious regression on growth in total family income.




        Table 2 presents the results.                     For each right hand variable and each

consumption measure it presents an OLS regression, an OLS regression using a

dummy right         hand variable,       and       a          test    for      independence       of the events

(consumption        growth >    0) and    (right hand variable >                     0).    The   01.5   regression
using    dummy variables        amounts to an estimate                   and test of the difference                    in

sample means between the group with                           >0   and         —   0.


        The    illness    variable     (panel II)             is statistically              significant      in the

regressions.        The value    of the parameter is quite small--each day of illness

is associatedwith a .048 percentage point decline in consumption
                                                                 growth from
80 to    83.   However,    the relationship             seems to be nonlinesr,               and the rejection

illness       have consumption       11.2      -

coefficients        by 100.    Furthermore,            the regression using a dummy for illness >

0 was insignificant,          as is the            test for independence                 of (consume > 0) and

         The       lostjob variable (panel III) has                              the largest         and most         significant
coefficient.             Households       with lostjob —                  I      had consumption               growth     24     -     26

percentage points lower than households with lostjob —                                              0,   which   is about        half

of      the        standard deviation             of        reported          consumption            growth rates.                   The

t-atstistics             and p value for               clearly reject independence.                            Fig. 1 presents

a histogram of the conditional distributions                                     of consumption given lostjob — C

and 1, and the difference in conditional distribution is clearly visible.



        The wkslook variable (panel IV) is an attempt to find a continuous scale

over which the effects of losrjob can be seen.                                           However,        the coefficients on

wkslook            are   small     and    insignificant.                      The                   reason is          that      most
                                                                                         major

households with lostjob — 1 did                              not        report       any     weeks                                   for
                                                                                                         spent       looking

employment.              The    strike    variable           (panel        V)       is    another        plausible        external

shock         to     labor      income,     but        it     too         produced          small        and     insignificant

coefficients.




        The move             variable     (panel VI)               is     another          possible        indicator           of an

external shock to hit the household.                               The coefficients                 are large, but on the

borders of significance,                  and one is of the wrong sign.




        The        regression      of consumption             growth on income                   (panel VTI)           yielded         a

positive           and significant         coefficient              of s surprisingly                    low magnitude.                A

model with liquidity conatraints and no insurance would predict a coefficient



                                                               13
of          the   coefficients     here are        .051    and    .104.     Note also     that      the
      1;

coefficients       on income are roughly double for families with a composition

change,       reinforcing the      view that        income       changes    are   correlated     with


preference shocks, in this case induced by household composition changes.



       I also regressed consumption growth on net number of new people added to

the household,                           as a    test of the        power   of the technique         to
                         (panel VIII)

uncover      a coefficient that ought to be positive and large                     in the enorrous

measurement       error of this consumption variable.              Consumption growth increases

                                                                        the

     Concluding Remarks



       The central point of this paper is a technique for testing consumption

                  and for measuring      which   shocks are and aren't            insured, based     on
insurance,

the                        that   measured consumption            growth     rates    ought    to    be
           proposition

independent of variables          that are exogenous to the consumers.



                                                    mixed      results:     the   coefficients      were
           Many of the variables         yielded

small, and the t-ststiscics             were around       2,   which does not allow me to "fail

to reject" the theory, but are not very convincing rejections                        in sample sizes

of 2000-4000.         On the other hand, the loss of more than 100 days of work due

to illness        snd the loss of s job are important right hand variables,                      whose




                                                    14
associations     with consumption growth are both economically and statistically

significant.      Unless    these variables       are significantly          correlated   with the

error terms (sick people might lose their appetites,                   and leisure might enter

nonseparably),     this    is    evidence     against    perfect insurance.            Income    also

yielded a large coefficient,            but    this     is   more   plausibly    correlated      with

shocks to preferences.



     The    empirical     results    in this study       can be extended        in a variety      of

ways, with richer data sources.               The most obvious        extensions      are to other

variables   and more time periods.            Also, we should expect stronger insurance

among groups that are geographically close to each other, work together,                          or

among relatives, because the informal arrangements or altruistic motives that

proxy for consumption           insurance   should be stronger         for    these    groups,    and

regressions    for subgroups can be used to test this hypothesis.

1Monotone concave utility   also implies   that utility   growth is monotone   in
consumption growth:

       fJ(1   c,
            t 8,
                       -
                    t+r t    - 1 and f1'(.;c1,
                                              t     u - t
                                               8, t+r        > 0.
This condition may be useful when using long time series of data.     It says
that with variation in preference but no preference shocks, consumption growth
rates should all have the same sign, if not the sane magnitude.
