In the 1830s, when whaling was a prosperous American industry, a number of whaling corporations

were chartered. All of them were short-lived. This paper analyzes the failure of corporations in

American whaling, and argues that the corporate form was unable to create the incentives requisite

for success in the industry. Most nineteenth-century whaling ventures were owned by a small

number of local investors, and were configured to provide powerful incentives for their managers.

The effect of the corporate form on productivity is analyzed using a newly-collected panel dataset

of 874 whaling voyages. Many whaling corporations were managed by individuals who had

previously (or would subsequently) manage ventures with the usual ownership structure. Using an

individual-fixed-effects framework, a strong negative effect of the corporate form on productivity

is identified.

       Consider the problems faced by a prospective investor in a nineteenth-century whaling

venture. The business would be managed by an “agent,” a managing partner, who would

purchase supplies and hire a captain and crew, and plan the voyage on behalf of the in-

vestors.1 The agent’s performance may have been difficult for the investor to evaluate,

or even observe. Then the vessel was entrusted to the captain and crew and sent on a

voyage to seas tens of thousands of miles away for periods of three years or longer, often

circumnavigating the earth in the process. The actions of the crew would have been nearly

impossible to observe while the voyage was underway, as would the efforts of the agent hire

a good captain, and supervise the voyage. Incentive problems arise in the financing of any

business, but in whaling these problems were particularly acute.

       The contracts and organizational forms employed in whaling in the nineteenth century

evolved in response to these problems. Most American whaling enterprises were closely held

by a small number of local investors, and the allocation of ownership rights within these

ventures was configured to provide powerful incentives for their managers. The industry’s

agents usually held substantial ownership shares in their ventures, thus aligning their in-

terests with those of the other investors. Organized as unincorporated partnerships, these

enterprises dominated the industry from its inception in the seventeenth century, through

its decline in the late nineteenth century.

       In the 1830s, a new mode of organization was introduced into the industry: the corpo-

ration. These whaling corporations were created at a time when the use of incorporation

began contribute to the development of many nineteenth century industries.2 Indeed, some

have argued that the growth of corporations was “the most important and conspicuous

feature of the development of society in Europe and America.”3 These early whaling cor-

porations attempted to create diffusely-owned enterprises, governed by a formal structure

including a board of directors and a committee of executive officers. This represented a

significant departure from the traditional reliance on concentrated ownership to resolve in-

centive conflicts in the industry, and it failed: none of the whaling corporations survived

beyond the 1840s, and few experienced much financial success, at a time the American

whaling industry as a whole continued to expand.

       This paper will analyze the failure of corporations in the American whaling industry.

The whaling corporations of the 1830s and 1840s did not alter the production process

used by unincorporated ventures—they paid their crews using the same incentive contracts

known as “lays,” they used similar vessels, and their day-to-day operations were managed

by an agent with the same responsibilities.4 They differed from other whaling enterprises

mainly in their ownership structures and their hierarchical form of governance. Although

these features offered many potential advantages to small investors, they were unable to

create the incentives requisite for success in the industry. The managers of these corpo-

rations, who did not hold significant ownership stakes, did not perform as well as their

peers in unincorporated ventures, and as a result, the enterprises “failed to yield the profit

anticipated,” and were abandoned.5

       The American whaling industry presents an ideal setting in which to analyze the effects

of organizational forms on productivity in the development of the American economy. The

entrepreneurs of the business—the agents—often managed dozens voyages over their careers,

each of which can be regarded as separate business units, and many of which might have

had different investors. The customs records that were created for each voyage contain

detailed information not typically available for early-nineteenth-century firms, and present

a unique opportunity to follow the different ventures of entrepreneurs over time.

       This paper endeavors to exploit these features of the whaling industry and its surviving

records through the analysis of a newly-constructed panel of 874 whaling voyages from 22

different ports, managed by 106 different agents. Many whaling corporations were founded

and managed by entrepreneurs who had previously managed (or would subsequently man-

age) unincorporated partnerships with the usual ownership structure. The dataset contains

a number of whaling voyages managed by these entrepreneurs, and the effect of incorpora-
   4
      Because they did not modify the production process, but merely imposed a different governance structure
on the same production process employed by other enterprises, these corporations did not differ from their
unincorporated counterparts in the extent to which they faced the tradeoffs associated with joint production,
as assumed, for example, in Allen and Lueck (1998). The “lay” system of incentive compensation contracts
is analyzed in Davis, Gallman and Gleiter (1997), and Hohman (1928).

tion can thus be identified in an individual-fixed-effects framework from these observations.

The entrepreneurs who formed whaling corporations were certainly a self-selected group,

located in ports with little whaling activity (in a business dominated by a few large ports

that specialized in whaling), and may have lacked the talents or experience requisite for

success. However, the estimated results indicate a robust negative effect on productivity in

the entrepreneurs’ incorporated enterprises, compared to their unincorporated partnerships.

Thus, even if only a self-selected group of unsuccessful entrepreneurs formed corporations,

their corporate ventures were even less successful.

    The paper proceeds as follows. In the next section, the evolution of the organizational

forms of whaling enterprises is examined, with a particular focus on the role of the provision

of incentives, and the allocation of rights of control. The history is followed through the

many phases of the industry’s development, into the 1830s, when whaling corporations were

formed. The section that follows—Section 2—a presents a discussion of the experience of

whaling corporations, and an analysis of their governance structures. Section 3 suggests

some explanations for the failure of these corporations, and Section 4 presents an empirical

analysis of the performance of whaling corporations. Section 5 discusses the results and

concludes the paper.

    The contracts between the investors and managers of whaling ventures in the nineteenth

century evolved from earlier schemes used in 18th century whaling voyages, which, in turn,

had evolved from contracts used in the much earlier shore whaling industry. The next section

presents a brief description of the evolution of the contracts employed in the industry.



1    History of Whaling Enterprises and their Organization

In the earliest British settlements in Massachusetts and on Long Island, the commercial

exploitation of whales commenced almost immediately upon the colonists’ arrival. A small

number of merchants usually owned the capital employed by the “companies” of men who

were based on shore, and pursued whales in small craft. Rather than owning a stake in a

formally-organized firm, these “adventurers uppon the whale designe” might each have con-

tributed some of the goods and supplies involved in whaling, and received a commensurate


                                              3
share of the proceeds.6 In general, the crews were paid in shares of the oil they produced,

with the owners of the vessel and equipment receiving the balance; usually the crew and

the owners each received half. The shares paid to the different sailors appear to have been

equal; each member of a six-person crew would have received a “sixthe part of a halfe fish.”7

The shore whaling companies on Long Island and in Massachusetts all seem to have used

this arrangement, with a “half share” paid to the crews, and the balance retained by the

owners.8

       In order to pursue larger, more distant populations of whales, the passive shore-based

approach was gradually supplanted by voyages in larger craft capable of travelling greater

distances. This early deep-sea whaling, which began in the late seventeenth century, was

carried out in small vessels of around 30 to 50 tons, on voyages lasting a few weeks, with

crews of twelve or thirteen.9 The companies would hunt whales from the decks of these

vessels, or, in the case of the larger schooners, might carry small whaleboats on board,

which would be launched when whales were spotted. These “offshore” whalers pursued

populations of right whales that roamed farther out at sea, a transition that was accelerated

as local whale populations began to decline due to the predations of the industry.10 But

they also began to pursue another species of whale that remained far offshore, unreachable

to the shore whaling companies: the sperm whale.11

       Whaling enterprises evolved along with whaling techniques. Deep-sea whaling required

a greater amount of capital, both in the form of the larger vessel, and in the supplies and

equipment necessary for the larger crews on their longer voyages. A precise description of

of the Town of Southampton, in April 7, 1675; January 30, 1677; and January 20, 1676.
    8
      Some of the owners may have also held indentures of men, usually Indians, who were employed as sailors
in the company. See, for example, Records of the Town of East Hampton, March 13, 1678. Vickers (1983)
describes the importance of indentured Indian labor, and the use of debt peonage, in the whaling industry on
Nantucket. There is some evidence that enslaved Africans were also employed in whaling in the eighteenth
century; see Palmer (1959).

      Right whales are baleen whales, meaning that they have keratinous strands of this substance in their
mouths. The oil produced from their blubber is denoted “whale oil,” in contrast to the oil from sperm
whales.
  11
      The blubber of sperm whales produces an oil of superior quality to (right) whale oil, and is odorless,
whereas even refined right whale oil emits a fishy smell. Moreover, encased in their enormous heads is a
waxy substance, spermaceti (sometimes called “head matter”), which was even more valuable.

the configuration of whaling enterprises from this era is found in a letter written by Micajah

Coffin, a whaling merchant (and former whaling captain) on Nantucket. In response to an

inquiry from a friend in another city, who was considering entering the whaling business,

about the organization of a whaling voyage, Coffin wrote:



       In the first place, a whale voyage is performed with Thirteen men which forms
       the said voyage into thirteen shares because we have our men on shares that all
       the men on board may have an interest in the success of said voyage. The master
                                                           1
       has for his wages one share of the whole, that is 13  of said voyage. The mate
            1
       has 20 of the voyage, the third man or harpooner has one twentysixth of ditto
       the fourth man or harpooner has one Thirtieth of said voyage and nine men
       more have half shares of three quarters which in a good voyage is tolerable good
       wages; in a poor voyage there is no wages to pay. The vessel Draws for her share
       fore ware & tare one fourth of said voyage. The remainder is for them that lay
       in the Stores or pay for them (which we call with us adventurers) stores such as
       provisions Boats oars whale Irons barrels &c. The charge commonly Expended
       with us on a voyage is about one hundred & Eighty five pounds which voyage is
       performed in about six months heretofore but I conceive a voyage to the coast of
       Guinea & Brazille will be nine months sailing...Find partners agreeable to own
       a vessel of about one hundred; or one hundred ten or twenty Tons...12


The basis for the crew’s pay was a modified form of the “share” system from the early shore

whaling companies: for a crew of thirteen, the proceeds were divided into thirteen shares.

The letter also indicates that the owners of the vessel received one fourth, as they did in

shore whaling, and the the other investors or “adventurers,” who paid for the supplies and

equipment used in the voyage, received the balance, or around one fourth.13 But because

the productive process now occurred onboard the vessel, rather than taking place partly on

land, the owners of the vessel itself assumed greater control over the enterprise. As maritime

law grants the owners of the vessel the right to control its voyage14 , this implied that the

investors who paid for the supplies and equipment of the voyage—the very materials that

would be expended—had no rights of control or, in the language of Grossman and Hart

(1986), residual rights. In exchange for a fixed share of output, the investors paid to finance

a voyage whose conduct and expenses they could not control.
  12
     Micajah Coffin, letter to Capt. Nath. Bacchus, August 13 1773 (Coffin, 1773).
  13
     The amount paid to the owners of the vessel, one fourth, seems to be relatively constant among different
vessels at the time. See Vickers (1983).
  14
     See Blunt’s (1829) discussion of the rights of vessel owners (ch. 8).



                                                     5
    Conflicts between the investors and the vessel owners under this arrangement were in-

evitable. In a 1769 printed broadside, Boston merchants who had financed whaling voyages

listed quantities of supplies they agreed were necessary for a whaling voyage, and wrote:



      Inasmuch as it is found from several Years Experience in the Whale-Fishery,
      that the Method of fixing out for that Business has been unequal, and much to
      the Prejudice of the Fixers: Wherefore, in Order to put the same upon a more
      just and equal footing in the future, We the Subscribers do agree to grant...such
      Stores...as is specified above, and no more.15


Unless the vessel owners granted rights to the investors, these outsiders did not have a legal

basis to influence the conduct of the voyage, or, for example, to recall their equipment if

they felt it was improperly used.

    In the late eighteenth and early ninteenth centuries, American whaling vessels began to

venture into more distant oceans, on ever longer voyages.16 The size of the vessels employed

increased, and reached an average of more than 300 tons; the size of the crews increased

with the vessels, growing from around thirteen in the 1770s to around 30 after 1815; and the

length of voyages increased to around two years by 1815.17 These voyages required much

larger investments in vessels and in supplies, and the allocation of rights of control in the

industry’s financial contracts evolved in response.18

    In particular, the class of investors who financed a voyage’s expenses in exchange for

a share of profits, with no rights of control, disappeared. Instead, investors in whaling

voyages purchased ownership shares in the vessels themselves. As co-owners, maritime law

guaranteed them rights of control over the voyage, in proportion to their stake in the vessel.

They were also collectively responsible for the expenses of the voyage, in proportion to their

  16
     Starbuck (1878, p. 168) presents a detailed tabulation of American whaling voyages in the eighteenth
century; his tables include statistics for vessel tonnages and voyage lengths. The innovation that facilitated
these longer voyages was the introduction of on-board “tryworks,” the apparatus used to render the oil from
blubber, sometime during the mid-eighteenth century.
  17
     In their sample of New Bedford voyages, Davis, Gallman and Gleiter (1997) carefully document average
vessel tonnages and lengths of voyages for this period.
  18
     Data on the costs of early whaling voyages are scant, but in the 1770s, the cost of the equipment and
provisions for whaling voyages was generally around £180, and the vessels and rigging cost between £200
and £1000 (Alden, 1774-1816; Rotch, 1771). By the 1830s, By 1835, the cost of the supplies for a voyage
had risen to $18,000, and the cost of a typical 300-ton vessel was $20,000 (Macy, 1835).



                                                      6
ownership stakes, and, after the crews were paid, received the profits from the voyage. It is

likely that this change in the structure of the contracts used in financing whaling voyages

was important in facilitating the larger investments that were made in the industry during

the nineteenth century.

       Most whaling vessels of this era therefore had many owners.19 But they were sent on

voyages that were far more complex than their shorter, eighteenth-century predecessors, and

the successful management of these ventures required substantial expertise. In response, the

planning and management of these voyages was delegated to a merchant or merchant firm,

known as the vessel’s “agent,” who specialized in managing whaling voyages.20 The agent

would handle all of the important decisions for the voyage: he would purchase the supplies;

hire the captain and crew; keep all the vessel’s accounts; give the captain his orders for the

voyage, which included the locations where he was to seek whales; supervise the captain

while the voyage was underway, by corresponding with the captain whenever possible; and

determine the timing of the sale of the vessel’s output. Essentially, the agent served the same

role as the vessel owner in the previous arrangement, except that his co-owners possessed

the same rights of control as he did.

       The management of whaling voyages was not governed by any articles of agreement. The

co-owners simply delegated management of the vessels’ day-to-day operations to the agent,

and participated only in the most crucial decisions for the voyage, such as its itinerary over

the oceans. In order to ensure that the agent had strong incentives to act in the owners’

interests, the agent usually retained a substantial ownership share in the vessel, and in some

ports the agents retained, on average, 44% of the equity in their vessels.21 Given the wide

range of responsibilities held by the agent, this was a crucial source of incentives for the

manager to perform fulfill his responsibilities diligently.
  19
      In the sample of voyages from the 1830s and 1840s presented below, the average number of owners of
the vessels is around 9.
   20
      This arrangement is similar to the position of managing owner or “ship’s husband” employed in other
maritime trades with jointly-owned vessels.
   21
      Systematic data on the size of ownership shares of agents becomes available on the late 1840s, when this
information was recorded on the vessels’ registers. In Davis, Gallman and Gleiter’s (1997) sample of New
Bedford vessels from 1846-60, the average ownership share of the agents was more than 30%. Hilt (2003)
finds that in New London during this period, the agent’s retained 44% on average. On the effectiveness of
concentrated ownership in resolving incentive conflicts, see for example, Jensen and Meckling (1976) and
Shleifer and Vishny (1986).



                                                      7
         Other complimentary mechanisms were employed to create the necessary incentives for

the agents. The relatively small number of owners, each holding a substantial share in the

vessel, had strong incentives to monitor the agent’s activities. In addition, most of the in-

vestors in whaling voyages lived in the same towns as the agents whose voyages they helped

finance.22 Personal, and sometimes even familial, relationships between the investors and

the agents probably helped create additional incentives for the agent. Moreover, Davis,

Gallman and Gleiter (1997, chapter 10) document that groups of investors tended to invest

in voyages together, usually with the same agent. Thus the prospect of repeated inter-

action, and in particular, future investments, probably also created an important source

of incentives for the agent, which complemented the incentives arising from his ownership

share.

         In the many port cities in which whaling became an important industry in the nine-

teenth century, whaling voyages were owned and managed in this way. This highly successful

mode of organization survived through the late nineteenth century, when the whaling in-

dustry itself became nearly extinct in the United States. The only significant deviation

from this model occurred in the 1830s, when a number of whaling firms were organized as

corporations.



2         Whaling corporations

Although most of the firms that served as agents for whaling voyages were partnerships,

and thus typical of other New England merchants, the whaling vessels they managed were

separate business entities that were not formal partnerships.23 Whaling vessels resembled

partnerships in some respects, in that the assets of the vessel owners and the assets of the

vessel were not considered legally distinct. As such, the owners of the vessel were personally

liable for whatever debts or legal judgements the vessel incurred. But there were important

features of the shipowning arrangements used in whaling, as well as other maritime trades,
    22
     In a sample of major whaling ports, Hilt (2003) documents that about 75% of vessel owners resided in
the city in which the voyages were managed.
  23
     For a description of partnerships and a discussion of their prominence among early business enterprises,
see Lamoreaux (1995; 1997), Bodenhorn (2000), and Kim (2003).




                                                     8
that enabled the vessels to enjoy many of the privileges normally reserved for corporations.24

For example, the vessels were treated by their agents as distinct business entities, and

accounts were kept in the vessels’ names. More importantly, whereas partnerships usually

terminated upon the death or withdrawal of a partner, ownership shares in vessels could be

transferred without affecting the vessel.

       In the 1830s, a few whaling entrepreneurs—some with experience as agents, and oth-

ers simply wishing to enter the business—applied to their state legislatures for charters of

incorporation. The formation of whaling corporations in the 1830s coincided with a large

increase in incorporations generally, as state legislatures became more willing to grant char-

ters to businesses.25 Initially, they met with some resistance, as legislators were particularly

wary of granting charters to maritime firms that might eventually develop into monopolistic

entities like those



         under the European governments that have been considered an evil, and such
         is the British East India Company, such was the South Sea Company, and such
         the Dutch East India Company...26


Eventually, however, the charters were granted.27

       The content of the charters of whaling corporations in different states varied somewhat,

but in general they included: the right to own land, up to some specified amount; the right

to exist over a specified period of time; the right to act in law, or to sue and be sued as a

separate entity; a clear governance structure; the right of shareholders to transfer ownership

stakes; and some limitations, in the form of minima and maxima, on the firm’s capital stock.

Although synonymous with incorporation today, limited liability was not granted to any
  24
      An exploration of shipowning in general is presented in Albion (1941). Boyce (1992) describes similar
institutions in Britain.
   25
      In general, the types of organizations that states were willing to charter evolved slowly after the Rev-
olution, beginning first with non-business organizations (churches, libraries, schools, etc.); then businesses
where there was some public interest involved, such as banks, insurance companies, and land companies; and
finally, railroads and manufacturing companies. Massachusetts, for example, began to charter manufacturing
companies on a wide scale only after 1809. See, for example, Dodd (1954, p. 226). Wallis (2003) documents
the differences across states in the willingness of governments to grant corporate charters to businesses.

‘An Act to Incorporate the North River Whaling company’,” New York Assembly, April 16, 1833. Most
bills to incorporate whaling firms encountered some resistance of this nature.
   27
      The state legislatures that granted the charters may have charged fees or otherwise extracted revenue
from the incorporators. See Wallis (2003).


                                                      9
of the whaling corporations of this era.28 The Massachusetts whaling corporations were in

fact required to print an admonishment of unlimited liability on their stock certificates.

       What advantage, then, did the corporate form of ownership offer to whaling entrepreneurs

and investors? Although the right to act in law, and to sue and be sued, would probably

have simplified interactions with other firms, there does not seem to have been a pressing

need for this feature of corporate charters.29 Moreover, the owners of unincorporated vessels

possessed at least some limited right to transfer their shares, and the right to exist as an

enterprise so long as the vessel existed, and so did not need to apply for a charter for these

privileges. More likely, it was the formal governance structure (and with it, the carefully

specified voting rights and disclosure requirements), coupled with the official imprimatur

embodied in the corporate charter granted by the state. Compared to the industry’s unin-

corporated ventures, where there were no articles of agreement and no formal procedures

for decisionmaking—most decisions were simply delegated to the agent—these features of-

fered the potential to make an investment in a whaling venture more attractive to small

investors.30

       Thus whaling corporations were formed at least in part to create an alternative mode of

organization for the industry’s firms, that was believed to be attractive to greater numbers of

shareholders. The incorporators envisaged large enterprises, with diffuse ownership among

many investors, whose interests would be protected by an elected board of directors. In some

cases, perhaps in an attempt to safeguard the interest of small investors, the corporations

prohibited any investor from owning more than a small number of shares.31 In general,

these firms were able to attract investments from large numbers of investors.
  28
      See, for example, “An Act to Incorporate the Poughkeepsie Whaling Company,” New York Session
Laws, April 20 1832; and “An Act to Incorporate the Fall River Whaling Company,” Massachusetts General
Court Laws, April 9 1836. Many of the rights and privileges to which corporations were entitled were in
flux in the early nineteenth century, and varied significantly between states, and between different industries
within states.
   29
      In lawsuits between whaling vessels, the vessels “and owners” were named as litigants. This would pose
a problem only if some of the owners of each vessel were the same; an individual can not be on both sides
of a lawsuit.
   30
      This suggests another possible reason that investors in whaling ventures tended to live in the ports in
which their vessels were based: these individuals probably knew one another, and may have been able to reach
agreement over contentious questions more easily in the absence of a formal structure of decisionmaking.

       As with unincorporated whaling ventures, the investors owned the corporations’ assets,

and possessed rights of control over them. However, the investors in corporations delegated

their rights of control to a substantial extent to a board of directors, and/or an executive

committee of corporate officers. These directors and officers would then delegate the man-

agement of the day-to-day operations of the vessels to an individual, who was usually called

the corporation’s agent. It should be noted that the configuration of production within

these corporations was precisely the same as it was in the unincorporated ventures: an

agent would plan and supervise the voyage, and would hire a crew, who would be paid in

the same share or “lay” system used in all whaling voyages at the time. The corporations

thus simply grafted a much more diffuse pattern of ownership and a more formal governance

structure onto an enterprise organized in the typical fashion in most other respects.

       But as these corporations sought to become owned as diffusely as possible, the agent

was not envisaged to be a major investor in the firm, and in fact usually held only a small

stake.32 At least in one case, the agent’s compensation came principally in the form of a

fee of 2 12 % on all expenses—the purchase of vessels, supplies, etc.—which created strong

incentives for spending, rather than effort.33 The agent’s role evolved into something like

that of a professional manager, whose incentives to perform his duties diligently and act

in the interest of the shareholders arose chiefly from the monitoring of the directors and

officers.34

       The success of these firms depended critically on the strength of this governance struc-

ture, and its ability to create the appropriate incentives for management. This meant that

the directors needed to have been capable of monitoring and evaluating the performance of

the agent, and using their power to fire and replace him if necessary. Rather than relying on

management’s stake in the firm to provide incentives, these corporations created an alter-

native incentive mechanism, an example of what Williamson (1985) has termed hierarchies.

After more than 100 years of deep-sea whaling from American ports, these corporations
  32
     Data on individual shareholdings are scant, but in the Cold Spring Whaling Co., Portsmouth Whaling
Co., Fall River Whaling Co., and Wilmington Whaling Co., the agent owned shares equivalent to less than
5% of the firms. In comparison, Hilt (2003) documents that agents in some ports owned as much as 44% of
their ventures, on average. See also Davis, Gallman and Gleiter (1997).

represented the first attempt to organize and govern a whaling venture in this fashion.

         Of the whaling corporations that were chartered in the 1830s and early 1840s, none

survived past the late 1840s. The American whaling industry continued to thrive until the

Civil War, and enjoyed some years of success in the postbellum period, but most whaling

corporations were unable to remain in business long enough to sponsor more than a few

voyages. The next section will attempt to determine the sources of the failure of these

corporations.



3         Determinants of the corporations’ failures

The heavy reliance on concentrated ownership throughout the history of the American

whaling industry suggests a need for powerful incentives that a corporation may not have

been capable of providing. However, there were many other forces, unrelated to incentive

problems, that undermined the success of the whaling corporations. The founders of whaling

corporations, for example, generally had little experience in whaling, and simply may not

have possessed the requisite knowledge or skills to succeed. Incompetence may have doomed

these firms, irrespective of their ownership structure.

         The locations in which the corporations were founded suggest another possible explana-

tion for the failure of whaling corporations. 78 different American ports sponsored at least

one whaling voyage, but the industry was dominated by a relatively small number that

specialized in whaling. Figure 1 plots the number of voyages from American ports from

1805-70, and illustrates the share of the five major whaling ports—Nantucket, New Bedford,

Fairhaven (MA); Sag Harbor (NY); and New London (CT)—which together accounted for

68% of whaling voyages during the period.35 If there were significant agglomeration ex-

ternalities in the industry, for example in the form of better prices for supplies, or more

accurate information about the past success of potential captains or the location of whale

populations, then firms located outside these ports would suffer a natural disadvantage.

         Table 1 presents a list of whaling corporations that were chartered before 1845, along

with their locations. In none of the five largest whaling ports of the 1820s were corporations

formed. Instead, whaling corporations were founded in ports that were only marginal

participants in the industry.

       Thus, whaling corporations were often founded by new entrants into the industry, lo-

cated in ports with little history of whaling activity, who may have been unable to finance

a whaling voyage (or succeed in the business) using the traditional organizational struc-

tures, and who obtained a charter to help raise money. Many of the corporations chartered

had difficulty attracting sufficient capital to commence operations—the charter of Dutchess

Whaling Co. was amended so that its founders could have additional time to raise the re-

quired $50,000 capital stock, and the charter of the Cold Spring Whaling Co. was amended

so that it could commence operations after only $40,000 had been paid in, rather than

the $50,000 initially required.36 Successful whaling entrepreneurs, who would have been

able to finance their investments through the cash flows generated by their firms’ existing

operations, would have derived little benefit from the features of corporate charters, unless

they wanted to obtain better access to capital by making their businesses more attractive

to small investors.

       Another potential source of the inferior performance of whaling corporations could be

that these enterprises pursued a different approach or technique to whaling. At a minimum,

these corporations probably faced a different cost of capital, which should have influenced

their investment decisions.37 But if their diffuse ownership structures effectively insured

their owners and managers against the risks of their operations, their risk-taking decisions

may have been affected. These factors may have resulted in voyages that were less produc-

tive in ex post measures of performance.

       There are several potential explanations for the failure of whaling corporations. Unfor-

tunately, detailed financial data on whaling ventures from this era are scant, meaning that

direct tests on the financial performance of whaling corporations can not be conducted.

However, it is possible to measure from surviving records the productivity of the whaling

voyages, and therefore to compare the productivity of voyages sponsored by corporations

to those sponsored by unincorporated owners.38 Moreover, many voyage characteristics,

ranging from the size and age of the vessels employed, to the itinerary of the voyages and

the prior experience of the captain, can be obtained from surviving records, so that differ-

ences in the types of voyages pursued, or inputs employed, can potentially be included as

controls in an empirical test. If a negative effect of the corporate form on productivity can

be identified, then this would support the notion that corporations were unable to create

adequate incentive structures for their agents. In the next section, the dataset used to

conduct an empirical test, and the identification strategy employed, are described.
  37
     Whether this cost of capital was higher or lower than that of the unincorporated ventures is unclear.
On the one hand, in principle the small and presumably more diversifiable stakes held in corporations could
have led their owners to demand a lower rate of return. On the other hand, many of these corporations had
difficulty raising capital and attracting investors, suggesting that they faced binding constraints on their
access to capital.
  38
     It should be noted that, to the extent that firms in smaller ports faced higher costs, the measure
of productivity presented below may understate the average difference in financial performance between
corporate whaling ventures and their unincorporated counterparts.

4         Empirical Analysis

4.1         Data

In order to identify the effects of organization as a corporation on the success, or productiv-

ity, of whaling voyages, a dataset of 874 voyages from 22 different ports, from 1830-1849, was

assembled. A detailed account of the sample, and the sources employed, is presented in the

Data Appendix. In order to ensure that the sample contained as broad as possible a range

of whaling firms, data on agents from major whaling ports, including New London, New

Bedford, Fairhaven and Sag Harbor, as well as many different minor ports were obtained.

The voyages in the sample were sponsored by 106 different agents, and include those of 14

corporations.39 Except for the voyages from New Bedford, New London, and Sag Harbor,

where a 20% sample was taken, all voyages where data was available were included in the

sample. The 874 voyages in the dataset are equivalent to 19.5% of the total population of

whaling voyages initiated in the United States during the period.

         The identities of the owners of each vessel, and the vessels’ characteristics (their age and

tonnage), were obtained from vessel registers.40 For many vessels owned by corporations,

the name of the corporation, rather than the name of each shareholder, was listed on the

register. However, in some cases, the names of all the shareholders were listed on on the

register; these names were compared to the names listed as founders in the charters of the

corporations to identify which corporation owned the vessel. The departure date, itinerary

(Atlantic, Pacific, or Indian Ocean), arrival date, and proceeds (barrels of sperm oil and

whale oil, and pounds of baleen) were obtained from Starbuck (1878). Data on the identity

of the captain, his experience (measured as number of previous commands), and whether

he died during the voyage was obtained from Lund (2001).

         In order to compare the success or productivities of the different voyages, an index
    39
      17 charters of incorporation were granted to whaling enterprises between 1830 and 1850; see Table 1. 3 of
these corporations were unable to raise the minimum paid-in capital required by their charters to commence
operations, and are therefore sponsored no voyages that could be included in the sample. See the Data
Appendix.
   40
      After 1790, registers were required of all domestic vessels engaged in foreign trade. The register listed
the name of the captain, the vessel’s owners and their managing owner or agent, the dimensions and age of
the vessel and the place in which the vessel was built. Around 1850, these registers also began to record the
fraction each owner held in the vessel.




                                                      16
of voyage productivity was constructed. This index measures the log of output produced

per unit of inputs. As these voyages returned with quantities of sperm oil, whale oil, and

baleen—that is, the oil of sperm whales, the oil of right whales and other similar whales, and

the flexible keratinous material known as “whalebone”—these amounts (in gallons in the

case of oil, and in pounds for baleen) were summed, with the gallons of sperm oil and pounds

of baleen first multiplied by their relative prices at the time of arrival.41 The quantities are

thus expressed in whale-oil-gallon-equivalent amounts. The denominator, the quantity of

inputs, is measured as the vessel tonnage multiplied by the number of months at sea, and

is thus expressed in ton-months.42 The productivity index is the log of this ratio, or:

                            µ                                                                       ¶
                                whale oil + (sperm oil × rel. price) + (baleen × rel. price)
        Productivity = ln
                                                     tons × months

For 50 of the voyages in the sample, the vessel was lost or sufficiently damaged to be

“condemned” in a foreign port, and did not return home. For 43 of those voyages, Starbuck

(1878) does not record how much, if any, of the output of the voyage had been produced

until the point where it was damaged, or how much was recovered and sent home. The

loss of these voyages was regarded as a separate event, and excluded from the productivity

regressions. However, a dummy variable equal to one for lost vessels was recorded.

       Finally, the experience of each agent, measured as the number of voyages managed prior

to the sample period, was also recorded from Starbuck (1878), as was the total voyages

in each city from 1815-1829. For the corporations, if the agent (as identified on the vessel

register) had some experience prior to incorporating the firm, the number of voyages that

agent had sponsored is recorded as the prior experience of the corporation. Summary

statistics for each of the variables collected is presented in Table 2.

       The characteristics of the voyages sponsored by corporations and by unincorporated
  41
    Relative prices were obtained from Starbuck (1878).
  42
    The limitation of this approach is that the quantity of labor input is not measured. Unfortunately, data
on the crews of voyages from small whaling ports is scant. Moreover, there was very high rates of desertion
from whaling voyages, which makes the quantity of labor observed at the vessels’ departures a poor measure
of total labor input. However, as the size of the crew varied with the size of the vessel—larger crews were
necessary to operate larger vessels—the data on vessel tonnage should serve as a reasonable proxy for total
inputs. Some verification of this is provided below. In addition, an important indicator of the quality of
labor inputs, the level of experience of the captain, is included separately in the regressions below. For a
discussion of the determinants of crews on whaling voyages, see Davis, Gallman and Gleiter (1997).

partnerships are compared in Table 3, which also includes the significance level of a two-

sided t-test. As one might expect, the characteristic for which the corporations and the other

ventures differ most substantially is their average number of owners: 41 for corporations,

compared to 9 for partnerships. The corporations were also located in ports with far less

experience in whaling prior to the sample period, and founded by entrepreneurs who were

less experienced than the partnerships’ agents.

   However, in many respects the choices that the corporations made for their voyages were

not so different from those of the partnerships. They used vessels of approximately the same

size, and roughly similar ages; they sent their vessels to the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans with

roughly the same frequency as the partnerships; they managed voyages that specialized in

obtaining the oil of sperm whales about as often as their counterparts did; and the average

length of their voyages was just slightly longer. This is important because it suggests that

any differences in the productivity among the different types of firms were unlikely to be

due to differences in methods or approach, at least across these observable dimensions. At

a minimum, this suggests that the whaling voyages sponsored by corporations were not

different from those sponsored by partnerships in any fundamental way.

   Two other features of the data are worth noting: perhaps because they were based in

ports with less whaling activity, the corporations hired captains who had somewhat less

experience, measured as the number of voyages on which the captain had previously been

master. The difference (1.2 vs. 1.6 voyages) is nearly statistically significant at the 5%

level, and suggests that an analysis of voyage productivity should control for the captain’s

experience.

   Secondly, the number of crewmembers per vessel ton is the same in both groups. This

is critical, because it implies that there are no systematic differences in the relationship

between crew size and vessel size, between the corporations and the unincorporated ven-

tures. This implies that the the vessel tonnage—as used in the productivity index described

above—is a reasonable measure of the quantity of inputs employed on the voyages.


                                                      20
   Table 4 presents measures of productivity for the voyages in the sample. The first

measure presented, the number of months a vessel sits idle between voyages, is a general

indication of the efficiency with which the firms made use of their capital. Although the

corporations tended to take somewhat longer to refit their vessels and send them back out

to sea, the difference is not statistically significant. Moreover, the delay might simply be

the result of the fact that the corporations tended to be located in obscure ports, where

supplies were somewhat more difficult to obtain.

   The second and third rows of the table present the means and standard deviations of

the voyage productivity index. The voyages sponsored by corporations were significantly

less productive than those managed by partnerships. This is a much clearer indication

that the performance of whaling voyages was significantly different than that of the voyages

sponsored by partnerships. The standard deviation of this measure is only slightly higher

for the corporations, suggesting that (at least ex post) it does not appear to be the case that

their managers undertook riskier voyages. The higher rate at which corporate vessels were

lost (9% vs. 5%), however, could be an indication of this, although it could also simply be

an indication of poor performance or management.

   These tabulations suggest that the voyages sponsored by corporations were very similar

to those sponsored by partnerships, except that they were less productive. One must

be careful not to infer a causal relationship from these results—the corporations do not

represent a randomly-assigned treatment group, after all. The next section presents an

analysis of voyage productivity in an individual-fixed-effects framework, in order to try to

identify a causal effect, or at least rule out the possibility that the productivity difference

observed are due purely to selection.


4.2   Estimation Results

The 874 voyages in the dataset are organized as a panel, with the groups being the 106

different agents that sponsored the voyages. Many of the corporations in the dataset were

founded and managed by agents who had some prior experience in whaling, and/or would

have subsequent experience in whaling after the corporation was dissolved. Comparing the

productivity in the voyages managed by these agents in corporations and in partnerships

                                              21
can therefore be used as a source of identification of the effect of the corporate structure,

in an individual-fixed-effect framework. The dataset contains 91 voyages sponsored by such

agents, and the effect of the corporate form will be identified from these observations.

   The effect of organizational form on productivity will be estimated in the context of a

simple empirical model of the determinants of the productivity of voyages. For the voyage

of agent i in year t, the model is as follows:


                              yit = αi + δt + γcorpit + xit β + uit ,


where αi is an agent fixed effect, δt is a year effect, corpit is a binary variable for the corporate

form of organization, and xit is a vector of voyage characteristics. The hypothesized sign

of γ, the coefficient on the corporation variable, is negative.

   The voyage characteristics in the regression include data on the vessels, the captain, and

the itinerary of the voyage. In their careful study of the determinants of productivity of

New Bedford whaling voyages, Davis, Gallman and Gleiter (1997) that there were (mildly)

decreasing returns to scale in the industry; larger vessels should therefore be somewhat less

productive on a per-ton basis. Therefore the tonnage of the vessels will be included, as will

the age of the vessels. Only very coarse measures of the “cruising grounds” to which the

voyages were sent is available; the ocean listed as the primary destination of the voyage will

also be included in the regression.

   The role of the captain at sea was critical in the prosecution of the voyage, and the

captain’s performance of his role was certainly an important determinant of the success of

the voyage. The measure of the captain’s experience will therefore be included, as it may

help control for the quality of the captain commanding the vessel. On about 2% of the

voyages in the sample, the captain died during the voyage, usually due to injuries sustained

on board the vessel, but sometimes due to disease. When this occurred, the captain would

usually have been replaced by one of the mates, leaving the vessel with one fewer officer,

and this would have impacted the productivity of the crew. But in addition, in response to

the death of the captain, the mates would sometimes bring the vessel into port and attempt




                                                 22
to contact the agent to decide how to proceed, disrupting the progress of the voyage.43

Therefore, a dummy variable measuring whether the captain died during the voyage will

also be included.

       Davis, Gallman and Gleiter document that hunting pressure—the quantity of vessels

on the oceans pursuing whales—had a negative effect on productivity, and these forces,

combined with declining quality of the crews hired in whaling, caused productivity to decline

over the period covered by the sample. The year fixed effects included in each specification

should capture the effects of these (and related) influences on productivity over time.

       The results are reported in Table 5. Column (1) reports the results when only the corpo-

ration variable is included, along with the fixed effect for the individual agents, and for the

years. The estimated coefficient is negative and highly significant, and approximately equal

to 90% of a standard deviation of the dependent variable. This is a strong indication that

the voyages of corporations were less productive than those of unincorporated enterprises,

and this can not be attributed to selection.

       In column (2), the characteristics of the vessels and the captains, and the voyage

itineraries, are included as covariates.44 As expected, the size of the vessel has a negative

effect on productivity, as does the vessel’s age (although the latter effect is not statistically

distinguishable from zero.) The ocean to which the vessel was sent also had an important

effect on productivity; voyages sent to the Pacific were less productive, relative to those sent

the excluded (Indian) ocean. The productivity of voyages sent to the Atlantic, however,

was essentially no different from that of the Indian. The captain’s experience increases

productivity, although again the estimate is quite imprecise.45

       As expected, the effect of the death of the captain is large and highly significant. It

should therefore be noted that the effect of organization as a corporation, even with the

various vessel and voyage characteristics included as controls, is actually larger than the

effect of the death of the captain (-.36 vs. -.34).
  43
     Some examples of this are mentioned in Starbuck (1878).
  44
     The data on the age of the vessel is missing for 22 voyages in the sample. In many cases, this is due
to the fact that the vessel entered the fleet as a prize vessel—a vessel captured from a foreign power by a
privateer. For these vessels, the date it was constructed was not known or recorded in the registers.
  45
     In general, the effects of the voyage itinerary and vessel characteristics are consistent with those found
by Davis, Gallman and Gleiter (1997).

                                        24
       Is the large negative effect of the corporate form on productivity due to weak incentives,

or other forces? One way to look for evidence corroborating the importance of incentives

is to examine the effects of ownership structure on productivity throughout the sample.

Among the voyages sponsored by agents who were never involved in corporations, there was

substantial variation in the number of owners of the vessels. Some unincorporated voyages

had large numbers of owners, and in some ways even attempted to become somewhat more

corporate-like in their emphasis on small shareholders.46 If the productivity of these voyages

was lower than that of the voyages with fewer owners (again, in the context of a model with

agent fixed effects), this would be consistent with the finding of the importance of weak

incentives for productivity in whaling corporations. Diffuse ownership should diminish the

incentives of individual shareholders to monitor the agent.

       Column (3) in Table 5 presents estimates for a specification similar to the one presented

in column (2), only it includes the the number of owners of each vessel (divided by 10), and

a quadratic term in this number, in lieu of the variable for corporations. The estimated

effect of the number of owners is negative and substantial. The coefficients imply that, at

the mean, a one-standard-deviation increase in the number of owners reduced the value of

the voyage productivity index by 0.140, the equivalent of 32% of a standard deviation of

the dependent variable.

       This raises the question of whether the effects of the corporate form arise from the large

number of shareholders in corporations, or whether there other features of the corporations

form that affected productivity. Column (4) presents an attempt to address this question,

by including both the corporation variable, and the variables measuring the number of

owners, in the same specification. With both ownership variables included, the effect of

the corporation variable becomes smaller but remains significant, while the variable for

the number of owners also becomes smaller. This is at least consistent with the notion

that corporations had some effects on productivity independent of the diffuse ownership

structures they created. The fact that the agents themselves tended to hold small stakes,

for example, may have played a role in diminishing productivity, independently of the fact
  46
    Several merchants in the port of Sag Harbor, for example, managed whaling “companies” with relatively
large number of owners and some corporate-like features. See Tiffany (1840-48).



                                                   25
that there were few other large shareholders within the same ventures.

       Are these effects plausible? Could the efforts of the manager make such a difference?

One response is to note that in their careful study of whaling agents in New Bedford, Davis,

Gallman and Gleiter (1997) find substantial differences in the average productivity of the

different agents. This implies that the efforts of the agents were important determinants

of voyage productivity, and anything that reduced the incentives of the agents to perform

their roles diligently might have a substantial effect on the outcome of the voyages.

       Some further evidence suggestive of diminished incentives in corporations is found in the

behavior of one corporation’s agent, whose letter book survives. Rather than identifying

and hiring a captain and crew himself, as would normally have been the case for whaling

agents, this agent wrote to a friend in New Bedford and asked him to hire an agent for his

vessel. For another voyage he agent delegated all authority to the captain for hiring the

crew, and negotiating their wage contracts.47 Certainly this agent exerted less effort in the

process of hiring the captain and crew than his counterparts in unincorporated ventures

normally would have.

       In the next section, the robustness of the findings is examined in more detail.


4.3      Robustness of the Results

The results presented in Table 5 identified a strong negative effect on productivity of the

corporate form within the voyages managed by agents who were involved in both partner-

ships and corporations. The results can refute the notion that the poor performance of

corporations was due purely to selection.

       However, there are other reasons to question whether a causal relationship has been

identified. There is the possibility, for example, that agents whose productivity was declining

joined corporations, as this provided a way for them to reduce their exposure to their

voyages’ returns. If this were the case, then the lower productivity observed in corporations

would not be caused by the corporate form, but would simply be due to the fact that after

the agent joined a corporation, his productivity continued to decline due to other forces. In

          trend, respectively. Column (4) reports the results for the same specification as column
          (2) in Table 5, with port fixed effects and port-specific trends, rather than individual
          effects. All specifications include time effects. Standard errors, adjusted for clustering on
          ports, reported in parentheses. ** denotes significance at the 1% level; * denotes signi-
          ficance at 5%.




order to address this possibility, some of the regressions in Table 5 were re-estimated with

agent-specific time trends included as well. That is, the model presented above would be

modified, to become,


                             yit = αi + δi t + δt + γcorpit + xit β + uit ,


where δi t is the agent-specific trend. These time trends should control for such changes over

time in the productivity of the agents.

   Table 6 presents the results of these specifications. (The table reports only the estimated

coefficient on the corporation variable, and omits all the others.) Columns (1) and (2) report

the estimates from the same equations as columns (1) and (2) in Table 5, respectively, only

with the addition of agent-specific time trends. Column (3) in Table 6 considers the more

complicated possibility of nonlinear time trends in the agents’ productivities, by estimating

the same equation as column (2) in Table 5, with the addition of linear and quadratic agent-

specific trends. None of the results are meaningfully different from those reported in Table

5. The issue of agents selecting into corporations in anticipation of poor performance, at

least as far as it can be captured by agent-specific trends, does not seem to have played a

role in the productivity differences documented above.

   A further check of the robustness of the results is to use fixed effects for the ports in

the sample, rather than the agents, thus comparing the corporate-managed voyages to the

unincorporated ventures within the same ports. If the observed effect were substantially

different, this might suggest that the agents who formed corporations were somehow un-

representative of the agents from the same port. Estimates for a specification that includes

port effects and port-specific trends are presented in column (4) of Table 5, and the effect

is quite similar.

   Finally, Table 7 compares the characteristics of the 91 voyages managed by the agents



                                                       28
observed in both corporations and partnerships, in order to examine whether the agents

managed these voyages in a way that differed somehow (and may have influenced productiv-

ity.) There are a few differences in their voyages—they hired captains with somewhat less

experience, they sent vessels to the Pacific with slightly greater frequency, and, of course,

the voyage productivity was lower. In addition, their corporate voyages were much longer.

It is likely that this is due to the lower productivity of these voyages (meaning that the

captain chose to remain at sea in order to obtain a reasonable catch.)

    In most other respects, the voyages are very similar. In particular, the standard devia-

tions of the voyages’ productivities are quite similar, so this ex post measure of risk taking

does not seem to indicate any difference between organizational types. It does not appear

to be the case, for example, that these agents took greater risks in their voyages when they

were within corporations.



5    Discussion and Conclusion

In the 1830s, the corporate form began to find widespread use among businesses in the

United States, and some of the entrepreneurs who obtained charters did so to create whaling

corporations. Whaling was a thriving American industry in this period, and was dominated

by closely-held enterprises in a small number of specialized ports. The new whaling corpo-

rations faced many disadvantages—they were located in obscure ports, and were founded

by individuals with relatively little experience in the business.

    This paper has shown, however, that there was another important obstacle to these ven-

tures’ success: the corporate form itself. The empirical analysis compared the productivity

of whaling voyages sponsored by the same managers within corporations, and within un-

incorporated ventures, and found that these managers’ voyages were less productive when

they were employed by corporations. Thus the estimated effect is not due to the obscure

ports in which the corporations were located—the managers’ various voyages were all based

in the same ports—or the lack of talent or experience of the manager. The diffuse owner-

ship structure of the corporations, and the reduced stakes held by their managers, likely

diminished the incentives for the managers to perform their roles diligently.


                                              29
      The analysis of this paper has shown that the problems identified by Berle and Means

(1932) in the large firms of the 1930s were likely to have been endemic in much earlier

corporations as well. About 100 years before the publication of their study, the first whal-

ing voyages sponsored by an American corporation were launched. The corporations that

sponsored these voyages represented a significant departure from the usual mode of orga-

nization of whaling ventures. These corporations were diffusely owned, and were run by

agents whose role began to resemble that of professional managers. Whaling was a business

where consistent success was very difficult to achieve, and the weaker incentives produced

by these corporations at least contributed to their poor performance. Perhaps because of

their organizational forms, these enterprises proved themselves to be “nothing but land

lubbers.”48

Data Appendix

Whaling corporations were identified by searching the session laws of the states of Delaware,
New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and
Maine, and examining all of the corporate charters that were granted as special acts of the
legislatures. Of the 17 corporations listed in Table 1, 14 were able to raise the paid-in capital
required by their charters to commence operations. Each of these corporations’ voyages are
included in the sample. The three that were never able to commence operations were the
New York Whaling Co., North River Whaling Co., and Westchester Whaling Co.
    The dataset contains 874 voyages initiated in 22 different American ports. These include
Salem, Dorchester, Fall River, Fairhaven, Duxbury, and New Bedford, Massachusetts; New-
port, Bristol, Warren and Providence, Rhode Island; Sag Harbor, Poughkeepsie, Newburgh,
Hudson, Port Richmond, and Oyster Bay, New York; Wiscasset and Portland, Maine; and
Newark, New Jersey; Portsmouth, New Hampshire; Wilmington, Delaware, and New Lon-
don, Connecticut. 4 of the 5 major whaling ports—New Bedford, Fairhaven, Sag Harbor,
and New London—are included in the sample. (Nantucket is excluded because very few
registers for Nantucket vessels are in the possession of the National Archives.) The ports
included in the sample were the ports from which the best records are available. In its dis-
tribution of major and minor ports, the sample is generally representative of the population:
68% of the voyages in the sample are from major ports (vs. 66% of the population for the
sample period), and 32% of the voyages are from minor ports (vs. 34% of the population.)
Population statistics were computed from data contained in Starbuck (1878).
    Vessel registers were used to identify the agent or firm managing each whaling voyage,
and also for the vessels’ tonnage and age, and the number of owners. (A description of the
purpose and content of vessel registers is found in Stein, 1992.) For the voyages originating
in the states of New York, New Jersey, Delaware, New Hampshire, Connecticut, and Maine,
these registers were found at the National Archives, Washington D.C. (Records of the Bu-
reau of Marine Inspection and Navigation—Group 41). For the vessels originating from
the ports of Massachusetts and Rhode Island, the compilations of vessel registers produced
by the Survey of Federal Archives of the Works Progress Administration were used. These
volumes included: Ship Registers and Enrollments of Dighton-Fall River, Massachusetts
1789-1938 (1939), Ship Registers of New Bedford, Massachusetts, 1796-1850 (1940), Ship
Registers and Enrollments of Bristol-Warren, Rhode Island, 1773-1939 (1941), Ship Reg-
isters and Enrollments of Providence, Rhode Island, 1773-1939 (1941), and Ship Registers
and Enrollments of Boston and Charlestown (1942). For the vessels originating from Salem,
Massachusetts, the source used was Hitchings and Phillips, Ship registers of the district of
Salem and Beverly, Massachusetts, 1789-1900, Salem: Essex Institute (1906).
    Usually, the registers of vessels owned by corporations listed the name of the corporation
as the owner on the register. However, in some cases, the names of all the shareholders
were listed on on the register; these names were compared to the names listed as founders
in the charters of the corporations to identify whether a corporation owned the vessel. In
cases where the individual shareholders were not listed on the vessel registers, the names
of the shareholders (used to compute the number of owners) were obtained from stock
certificates or stock transfer ledgers. These included: the Cold Spring Whaling Co. “Ledger
of Stockholders;” the Portsmouth Whaling Co. stock certificates, the Fall River Whaling
Co. “Stock Transfer Ledger,” and the Wilmington Whaling Co. “Stock Ledger.” Few vessel
registers survive for the port of Sag Harbor. The vessel characteristics and the identity of


                                               34
the managing agent of each vessel was obtained from the manuscript “List of Shipping
Owned in Sag Harbor in 1839” in the John Jermain Library, Sag Harbor NY.
     The number of crewmembers on board the vessel at its departure was obtained for
vessels originating in the ports of Hudson, Poughkeepsie, and Newburgh, NY; New London,
CT; Newport, RI; and Salem, Fall River, Fairhaven, and New Bedford, MA. For the ports
in New York, these were taken from the crew lists of vessels from the port of New York,
in the National Archives, New York (Records of the Customs Service—Group 36). For the
ports in Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts, these were taken from the crew
lists of the various ports in the National Archives, Boston. (A description of the purpose
and content of official crew lists is found in Stein, 1992.)
     The departure and arrival dates of the voyages, the number of barrels of whale oil and
sperm oil taken, the dummy variable for whether the vessel was lost, the voyage itineraries,
and the characteristics of the different ports were all compiled from Starbuck (1878).
     Data on the identity of the captain, his experience, and whether he died during the
voyage was obtained from Lund (2001).
