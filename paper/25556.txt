Retirement Implications of a Low Wage Growth, Low Real Interest Rate Economy

                                          ABSTRACT

We examine the implications of persistent low real interest rates and wage growth rates on
individuals nearing retirement. We begin by reviewing the concept of r star – the long-term real,
safe interest rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary – and presenting recent estimates
suggesting that this value has declined. We then examine the implications of low returns and low
wage growth for individuals currently aged 45 and 55. We find that low returns and low wage
growth have substantial welfare effects, with compensating variations that are often in the
hundreds of thousands of dollars. Low returns increase optimal Social Security claiming ages and
the marginal benefit of working longer, while low wage growth decreases the marginal benefit of
working longer. Low economy-wide wage growth has a much larger welfare effect than low
individual wage growth due to wage indexation of the initial benefit and the progressivity of the
Social Security benefit formula. When individual wage growth alone is low, wage indexation is
unchanged, and the progressivity of the benefit formula provides insurance. When economy-wide
wage growth is low, wage indexation is less generous and there is no insurance benefit from
progressivity as average wages fall along with individual wages.

             I.       Introduction

         Real interest rates have remained persistently low despite an economic recovery that

began in June 2009. Yields on 10- and 20-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS)

have averaged less than 1 percent since the start of 2010.1 The macroeconomics literature has

attempted to explain this phenomenon via a concept called the natural rate of interest, or “r star.”

R star is the real, safe short-term interest rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary and

neutral with respect to inflation; it is important for those setting monetary policy as it indicates

whether current real interest rates are expansionary or contractionary. The natural rate of interest

is not directly observable but can be estimated by examining actual real short-term interest rates,

the acceleration or deceleration of inflation, and the widening or narrowing of the difference

between actual and estimated potential aggregate output (i.e. the output gap). Recent estimates of

this parameter suggest that r star has declined considerably since 2000 and has been close to zero

since 2008 (Laubach and Williams 2003; 2015). A related concept is the growth rate of potential

output. The macroeconomic models used to estimate r star also suggest that the growth rate of

potential output has fallen over the past 10 years. Persistently low economic growth translates

into persistently low real wage growth.

         These macroeconomic shifts have important implications for retirement planning and

security. Two key inputs into any retirement plan are future rates of return on retirement assets

and future wage growth rates. Estimates of r star are natural candidates for future, real safe rates

of return and provide a more defensible basis for assumptions in a life cycle plan than current

real interest rates. In this paper, we use a life cycle model to explore how shifts in r star and

economy-wide real wage growth affect the retirement plans and well-being of individuals in their

                                                                                                        2
40s and 50s today. We find that low real interest rates increase optimal Social Security claiming

ages. Low growth (characterized by both low interest rates and low real wage growth) reduces

optimal saving rates close to retirement and reduces consumption in retirement. For any

exogenous retirement age, it also increases the marginal benefit of working an additional year,

suggesting that working longer is part of an optimal response to today’s macroeconomic

environment.

       We further demonstrate that the low economy-wide rate of wage growth has a much

stronger adverse effect on retirement well-being than low individual wage growth. Social

Security benefits are calculated by applying a progressive benefit formula to the highest 35 years

of earnings indexed for economy-wide wage growth. Specifically, earnings prior to age 60 are

indexed by dividing by the economy-wide average wage during the year in which they were

earned and multiplying by the economy-wide level of wages at age 60. (Earnings after age 60

count at their nominal value.) If individual wage growth is lower than expected, while economy-

wide wage growth remains constant, average earnings fall but the indexation of earnings does

not change, and the progressive benefit formula provides insurance by ensuring that Social

Security benefits are affected less than proportionately. On the other hand, if low individual

wage growth reflects low economy-wide wage growth, the individual’s position relative to the

economy-wide average wage does not change and there is no insurance benefit from the

progressive formula. Moreover, wages are indexed to a lower benchmark, which exacerbates the

impact of low wage growth on retirement income.

       Our analysis is based on a standard life cycle model in which households save to smooth

consumption over their lifetime (Friedman 1957; Modigliani 1966). Life cycle models have been

used to study a range of retirement behavior. For example, Haan and Prowse (2014) and



                                                                                                    3
Gustman and Steinmeier (2008; 2015) have examined the impact of changes in Social Security

or pension claiming rules on consumption and retirement behavior. Most closely related to this

paper is work by Horneoff, Maurer, and Mitchell (2018), who examine the impact of persistently

low real asset returns on life cycle consumption and retirement behavior. Their model is

calibrated to the U.S. economy and shows that low real returns cause individuals to save less in

tax-preferred accounts and more in taxable accounts; overall, saving declines. In addition,

individuals claim Social Security later. Brohnshtein, Scott, Shoven, and Slavov (2018) do not use

a life cycle model but show that working 3-6 months longer, and delaying Social Security over

that period, has the same impact on retirement living standards as saving an extra one percent of

earnings over 30 years. The closer one is to retirement, and the lower are real asset returns, the

greater the relative impact of working longer.

       Relative to Horneoff, Maurer, and Mitchell (2018), the contribution of this paper is to

explore the implications of low wage growth in conjunction with low interest rates. Low

economy-wide wage growth has important implications for retirement given the way it interacts

with the Social Security benefit formula. It has a far greater impact than low individual wage

growth. In addition, we consider the optimal strategies for individuals who are approaching

retirement (aged either 45 or 55) instead of just starting their careers, and we also provide an

estimate of the welfare cost of low r star and wage growth. Relative to Brohnshtein, Scott,

Shoven, and Slavov (2018), we formally show using a life cycle model that the marginal benefit

of additional work increases in a low return environment. This impact is even larger when

individuals follow the commonly observed behavior of claiming Social Security upon retirement

(see Shoven, Slavov, and Wise 2018) rather than optimizing claiming age. Individuals who make




                                                                                                     4
retirement decisions by comparing the marginal benefit of additional work to the marginal cost

of effort are likely to work longer.

       Our work is also related to the large literature examining the tradeoffs involved in Social

Security claiming and documenting the impact of recent low real interest rates on those tradeoffs

(e.g., Meyer & Reichenstein, 2010; Munnell & Soto, 2005; Sass, Sun, & Webb, 2007, 2013;

Coile, Diamond, Gruber, & Jousten, 2002; Mahaney & Carlson, 2007; Shoven & Slavov,

2014a,b; Kotlikoff, Moeller, and Solman, 2015). Most of these papers use straightforward

expected present value calculations rather than life cycle models. The key findings of this

literature are that delaying Social Security claiming, often to age 70, substantially increases the

expected present value of benefits for important groups such as married primary earners. At

historical interest rates, delay does not produce large gains for single men, those with higher than

average mortality, or married secondary earners. But when real interest rates are close to zero,

some degree of delay becomes actuarially advantageous for most people. Our findings here are

consistent with this prior research and shows that low interest rates indeed delay optimal

claiming in a life cycle framework with liquidity constraints.

       This paper is organized as follows. Section II discusses the macroeconomics literature on

r star and its implications for assumed real interest rates and wage growth in retirement planning.

Section III presents our life cycle model and calibration. Section IV discusses our results. Section

V compares the recommendations of the life cycle model in a low growth scenario with standard

financial planning advice. Section VI concludes.



           II.     Implications of R Star




                                                                                                      5
       The natural rate of interest is the real interest rate that would prevail once the impact of

temporary shocks to the economy have dissipated. It is the best forecast of what safe rates of

return will be over the medium to long-run horizon. The literature that attempts to estimate r star

is extensive and is reviewed in Taylor and Wieland (2016) and Laubach and Williams (2015).

One of the most important models in this literature is laid out in Laubach and Williams (2003,

2015), who use a multivariate Kalman filtering technique to estimate both the natural rate of

interest and the growth rate of potential output. The intuition behind the methodology is that if

inflation and the estimated output gap are steady, then observed short-term real interest rates

must approximate the natural rate. Such a situation, at least in terms of inflation, has been the

case since the Great Recession. On the other hand, if inflation is accelerating as it did in the

1970s, then current interest rates are below the natural rate. If inflation is rapidly decelerating, as

it did in the Volcker years, then the natural rate is below the current rate. Laubach and Williams

utilize this approach to provide updated quarterly estimates of r star.

       Figure 1 shows the Laubach and Williams point estimates of r star from 1980 through the

first quarter of 2018. The figure shows that the natural rate fluctuated somewhat above 3 percent

in the 1980s, dipped to 2 percent in the mid- 1990s, and recovered to about 3 percent in the

1999-2002 period. It then fell gradually from 2002 to 2008 (reaching about 2 percent), when it

plummeted to roughly 0 percent. The natural real rate of interest has shown no sign of recovery

since, with the most recent reading (Q1 2018) being close to 0 percent. These estimates are

different from the current TIPS rates cited in the introduction to this paper. They are the center of

the distribution of future real rates, assuming neutral monetary policy in the long-run.

       The safe interest rate going forward is a key input into any lifecycle retirement plan.

Certainly, investors can hope for higher investment returns than short-term federal government



                                                                                                      6
interest rates, but such returns can only be achieved by investing in risky portfolios. While the

expected returns of risky portfolios will exceed r star, such portfolios also increase the likelihood

of realizing less than r star. Figure 1 suggests that someone who made retirement plans in 2000

assuming that real safe short-term interest rates would remain around 3 percent should now

reassess that assumption and substitute zero or one percent as the best forecast for real, safe

interest rates going forward.

          The Laubach-Williams approach also generates estimates for the trend rate of growth of

real potential output for the U.S. economy. The relevance for retirement planning comes from

the fact that average future wage growth is associated, via labor productivity, with the growth

rate of the economy. Figure 2 shows the latest Laubach-Williams estimates for the trend rate of

growth for potential output. It shows that the growth rate of potential output has fallen from the

3.2 to 3.4 percent range over the period 1980 to 2002, to closer to 2.4 percent for the past two

years. The fall in growth rate of potential output was steepest during the Great Recession. Just as

with the natural rate of interest, there is no sign of recovery in the rate of growth of potential

output. A major contributor to the fall in the rate of growth of potential output is the decline in

labor productivity growth, a phenomenon that has been extensively studied in the literature.

Baily and Montalbano (2016) provide a review.

          While the r star approach is not universally agreed upon, it has sufficient backing that it is

worth considering its implications for retirement planning. The purpose of this paper is to

determine the optimal response to taking down interest rate and wage growth assumptions mid-

career.



             III.    Model



                                                                                                      7
                      a. Setup

         Consider an individual who starts working life at age 𝑡 = 20 and can live up to age 𝑡 =

110. The individual chooses consumption in each period, 𝑐𝑡 ∈ ℝ≥0 , as well as an age at which to

claim Social Security, 𝑡𝑐 . Social Security full retirement age is denoted FRA. Retirement age, 𝑡𝑅 ,

is exogenous; it is defined as first year with no earnings. We assume the earnings test effectively

requires that 𝑡𝑅 ≤ 𝑡𝑐 if 𝑡𝑐 < 𝐹𝑅𝐴. That is, individuals who are currently working may not claim

before full retirement age.2 The wage at time 𝑡 is 𝑤𝑡 and the risk-free real interest rate in period 𝑡

is 𝑟𝑡 . The real Social Security benefit received in each period 𝑡 ≥ 𝑡𝐶 is
                                                                 𝑡𝐶
                                  𝑏𝑡 (𝑡𝐶 )= 𝑏0 (𝑤0 , … . , 𝑤𝑡 ) ∏𝑘=63(1 + 𝑧𝑘 )

where 𝑧𝑘 is the growth rate of benefits between period 𝑘 − 1 and 𝑘 and 𝑏0 (𝑤0 , … . , 𝑤𝑡 ) is the

benefit that would be payable at age 62 based on earnings history (𝑤0 , … . , 𝑤𝑡 ). It is based on an

application of the Social Security benefit formula to the earnings history at time 𝑡. For each year

of delay between age 62 and benefit receipt, the benefit grows by 𝑧𝑘 . Note that benefits are

updated each period to reflect any earnings after claiming.

         The probability of surviving to period 𝑡 is 𝑆𝑡 . Note that 𝑆111 = 0. That is, survival

beyond 110 is impossible. We assume all assets are invested in actuarially fair annuities, and a

$1 annuity contract pays a gross return of (1 + 𝑟𝑡𝑎 ) in period 𝑡 if and only if                   the individual

is still alive. Since 𝑆𝑡 is the unconditional probability of surviving to period 𝑡, 𝑆𝑡 /𝑆𝑡−1 is the

probability of surviving to period 𝑡 conditional on having survived to period 𝑡 − 1. Annuity

markets are competitive, so the expected gross payout for the annuity seller, (1 + 𝑟𝑡𝑎 )𝑆𝑡 /𝑆𝑡−1 ,

 The earnings test effectively forces individuals who work to delay some fraction (possibly 100 percent) of their
benefits depending on the income they earn.

                                                                                                                    8
must equal (1 + 𝑟𝑡 ). Therefore, the period 𝑡 return on $1 used to purchase annuities is

(1 + 𝑟𝑡𝑎 ) = (1 + 𝑟𝑡 )𝑆𝑡−1 /𝑆𝑡 .

           We solve the model for individuals who are aged either 44 or 54 in 2019. Starting in this

base year, 𝑡0 , the individual solves

Here 𝑐 = (𝑐𝑡0 , … , 𝑐110 ) is the consumption path, 𝑢(𝑐𝑡 ) is the utility derived from period 𝑡

consumption3, 𝐼(⋅) is an indicator function, 𝐴𝑡 is assets carried into period 𝑡, and 𝛿 is the

discount factor. The constraint 𝐴𝑡 ≥ 0 implies that borrowing is not allowed. The individual

assumes a deterministic, constant future real interest rate, 𝑟, and deterministic future path of

wages (𝑤𝑡0 , … , 𝑤𝑡𝑅 ). Under the baseline, these future projections are in line with the average of

past values for these variables (described in detail in the following section). Under alternative

scenarios, we consider lowering the future real interest rate and wage growth and examining how

these alter the solution to the model. The initial level of assets, 𝐴𝑡0 , is determined by solving the

same model for a 20-year-old using a historical series of wages and interest rates (through 2018),

combined with the baseline future projections. The 20-year-old is assumed to have perfect

foresight over future wages and interest rates. (Even if this assumption is not literally true, this

solution gives us a ballpark figure for initial assets for the age 44 or 54 problem.) We set 𝐴𝑡0 to

optimal assets at either 44 or 54. Let 𝑉(𝐴𝑡0 ; 𝑟, 𝑤, 𝑡𝑅 ) be the maximized value of this problem

given projected real interest rate 𝑟, projected wages 𝑤 = (𝑤𝑡0 , … , 𝑤𝑡𝑅 ), and retirement age 𝑡𝑅 .

        Social Security benefits are based on the average of the highest 35 years of earnings,

indexed for economy-wide wage growth though age 60. (Any additional years of earnings count

at their nominal value.) This average, divided by 12 to convert to a monthly rate, is called

average indexed monthly earnings (AIME). A progressive benefit formula is applied to AIME to

obtain the primary insurance amount (PIA), or the monthly benefit payable at full retirement age.

Under the progressive benefit formula, there are two thresholds, or “bend points,” that are

indexed to the economy-wide average wage. Individuals receive 90 percent of their AIME up to

the first bend point ($895 in 2018), 32 percent of any AIME between the first and second bend

points ($5,397 in 2018), and 15 percent of any additional AIME. The applicable bend points are

taken from the year in which the individual turns 62. We allow earnings after claiming to affect

the AIME (assuming they enter into the highest 35 years). Social Security benefits are adjusted

based on claiming age. Individuals born in 1960 or later who claim at 62 receive 70 percent of

their PIA, and that amount increases with each month of delay.4 To simplify our calculations,

however, we assume claims must take place on birthdates, which allows for 9 possible claiming

ages.

        Our model makes two important simplifying assumptions. First, there is no uncertainty.

We assume that individuals have perfect foresight about the paths of 𝑟𝑡 and 𝑤𝑡 . The late-career

shock to both series from a shift to a low-growth economy is completely unanticipated. A

realistic model would incorporate uncertainty period-to-period fluctuations in both series.

However, modeling uncertainty about the key macroeconomic shift we consider – in r star and

long-term real wage growth – is challenging. Thus, we treat these shifts as one-off surprises: they

are completely unanticipated, and once they happen they are expected to be permanent. This

simple deterministic model captures the basic intuition behind long-term shifts in interest rates

and wage growth, and that is likely how many people approaching retirement today view the

recent low-growth environment. Second, there is no labor supply decision or cost of effort.

Rather, the individual works full time until an exogenous retirement date. We are still able to

derive findings relating to career length by examining the increase in 𝑉(𝐴𝑡0 ; 𝑟, 𝑤, 𝑡𝑅 ) when 𝑡𝑅

increases by one year. This quantity is the marginal benefit from extending working life, which

the individual can compare to the cost of effort in the additional year of work.



                   b. Parameter Choices

       Mortality rates come from the cohort mortality tables underlying the intermediate

scenario in the Social Security Administration’s 2013 Trustee’s Report. These mortality tables

extend through age 120; however, survival probabilities beyond 110 are small, and we truncate

the distribution at 110 by assuming a zero probability of survival to age 111 conditional on

attaining age 110. We perform our analysis for stylized single males in the 1965 and 1975 birth

cohorts, aged 54 and 44, respectively, in 2019. Full retirement age for both cohorts is 67.

Workers are assumed to enter the labor force at age 20 and work full time until retirement. Our

baseline retirement age is chosen as 65. However, we perform calculations for alternative

retirement ages.




                                                                                                    11
       Social security COLAs are based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners

and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). We model inflation using this index. From the year a worker

turns age 20 through 2018, we use the historical average monthly CPI-W values for the third

quarter to calculate a year-over-year inflation rate. For example, a worker born in 1965 (1975)

experienced a 2.55% (2.16%) annual growth rate. From 2019 after, CPI-W is assumed to grow at

a constant rate, i.e., the forecasted inflation rate. For the base case, we assume forecasted

inflation grows at 2.5 percent, in line with the historical average for the 1965 cohort. All

monetary amounts are expressed in 2018 dollars.

       We construct an age-earnings profile based on the Center for Economic Policy

Research’s Uniform Current Population Survey (CPS) Extracts. We utilize the 2016 Outgoing

Rotation Groups file, which includes the subset of monthly CPS respondents who are asked

detailed questions about hours and earnings. This file contains a consistent hourly wage variable

(rw_ot), the construction of which is detailed in Schmitt (2003). We multiply this hourly wage

variable by 2,000 (roughly the number of hours in a full time working year) to get imputed full

time annual earnings for each worker. We divide each worker’s full time annual earnings by

economy-wide full time annual earnings (i.e., the average value of this variable of all individuals

in the dataset). We then calculate average relative annual earnings by age. Since this age-

earnings profile is not smooth, particularly at older ages when the sample of workers is small, we

smooth it by regressing age-specific average earnings on a 5th order polynomial in age and using

the predicted values for this estimation. This procedure gives us predicted full-time earnings at

each age relative to economy-wide earnings. The relative age-earnings profile is shown in Figure

3. It suggests that most age-related wage growth occurs early in the average worker’s career. At

older ages, real earnings growth occurs primarily via economy-wide wage growth.



                                                                                                    12
           A worker’s nominal wages from the year he turns age 20 through 2016 are modeled as

the product of the age-earnings profile and the Social Security average wage index (AWI) for

that year. In 2016 and prior, we use the AWI’s historical record.5 For the years 2017 and 2018,

we estimate the AWI using the growth rate the worker experienced since starting work. For

example, a worker born in 1965 (1975) experienced a 3.50% (3.30%) nominal annual growth

rate. Going forward from 2019 through retirement, the worker’s wages are the product of the

age-earnings profile and a quantity we refer to as the Worker’s Wage Index (WWI), which grows

at a constant rate, 𝑔𝑊𝑊𝐼 . Growth in the WWI represents growth in the worker’s individual wage,

holding age constant. Similarly, the AWI, which is used to compute AIME, is assumed to grow

at a constant rate, 𝑔𝐴𝑊𝐼 , from 2019 and after. Note that the WWI may differ from the AWI. The

AWI affects all workers, whereas the WWI reflects a worker’s individual expectations. For the

base case, we assume that AWI and WWI are equal and grow at 3.5 percent, in line with

historical growth for the 1965 cohort. The various low-growth scenarios reduce one or both

assumed growth rates to 2.5 percent, the same value as assumed long-term inflation, making real

wage growth zero.



               IV.      Results

                        a. Reevaluating Saving, Claiming, and Work Decisions

           The baseline solution to the model when retirement age is fixed at 65 is shown in Figure

4. For the 1965 cohort, consumption is constant at $49,527, and assets reach a maximum of

$404,649 at age 65. The optimal claiming age is 68. Because the liquidity constraint does not

bind and actuarially fair annuities are available, the optimal claiming age reflects the age that

                                                                                                    13
maximizes the expected net present value of Social Security wealth. This age depends only on

Social Security rules, mortality, and the real interest rate. Results for the 1975 cohort are similar,

with consumption constant at $53,972 and assets reaching a maximum of $445,842 at age 65.

The optimal claiming age is again 68.

       We consider several alternative scenarios.

       1) 1 percent real interest rate

       2) 1 percent real interest rate and real discount rate

       3) AWI and WWI grow at 2.5 percent (same as inflation)

       4) 1 percent real interest rate; AWI and WWI grow at 2.5 percent (same as inflation)

       5) 1 percent real interest rate and real discount rate; AWI and WWI grow at 2.5 percent

           (same as inflation)

       Figures 5-9 show the deviation from the baseline for consumption, income, and assets.

The one percent real interest rate in scenario 1 increases the optimal claiming age to 70.

However, it remains 68 in scenario 3 where the real interest rate remains at the baseline value of

3 percent. In the two scenarios where the interest rate falls but the discount rate remains at 3

percent (scenarios 1 and 4), the profile of consumption is altered in such a way that it falls over

the lifetime. In scenario 1, consumption initially increases relative to the baseline but then falls.

Thus, saving declines initially but then increases. In scenario 4, consumption declines initially

and then continues to decline relative to the baseline. When both the real interest rate and the real

discount rate decline in scenarios 2 and 5 (reflecting a shock to both preferences and asset

returns), the consumption profile remains flat but lower relative to the baseline. A decline in

economy-wide (and individual) wage growth, reflected in scenarios 3-5 reduce both income and

consumption relative to the baseline.



                                                                                                      14
       We next explore the welfare effects of each of these changes by calculating their

compensating variation. Recall that 𝑉(𝐴𝑡0 ; 𝑟, 𝑤, 𝑡𝑅 ) is the maximized value of the life cycle

problem at base age 𝑡0 given projected real interest rate 𝑟 and wages 𝑤 = (𝑤𝑡0 , … , 𝑤𝑡𝑅 ). The

compensating variation for a change in 𝑟 and 𝑤, to 𝑟′ and 𝑤′, is defined as Δ in the following

equation:

                             𝑉(𝐴𝑡0 ; 𝑟, 𝑤, 𝑡𝑅 ) = 𝑉(𝐴𝑡0 + Δ; 𝑟′, 𝑤′, 𝑡𝑅 )

The first three columns of Table 1 indicates the compensating variation at age 55 (for the 1965

birth cohort) and 45 (for the 1975 birth cohort) of the shift from the baseline assumptions in

alternative scenarios 1, 3, and 4 described above. (We do not calculate compensating variations

for scenarios 2 and 5 because this concept is not well defined when there is a shock to

preferences.) For comparison, initial assets for the 1965 cohort are $141,002 and initial assets for

the 1975 birth cohort are $19,862. Relative to these initial assets, the compensating variations are

large. For a retirement age of 65, the compensating variation for a reduction in the interest rate is

more than two-thirds of initial assets for the older cohort almost 5 times initial assets for the

younger cohort. The compensating variation for a reduction in real wage growth is around a third

of initial assets for the older cohort and more than 6 times initial assets for the younger cohort.

Comparing scenarios 1 and 3, a low interest rate has a greater cost to the 1965 birth cohort than

low wage growth. However, the relationship is reversed for the 1975 birth cohort assuming a

retirement age of 63 or older. This result makes intuitive sense, since the older cohort has less

time remaining in the labor market and more initial assets; moreover, the time remaining in the

labor market for either cohort is positively related to retirement age. A shock to wages and real

interest rates (scenario 4) has a compensating variation that is greater than the sum of the

compensating variations for each of the shocks individually.


                                                                                                      15
       Table 1 assumes that retirement date is fixed. To the extent that retirement date is

adjustable, working longer can mitigate some of the welfare cost of low growth. Table 2

indicates the wealth equivalent of delaying retirement by an additional year for baseline

retirement ages between 62 and 69, and under the alternative scenario with real interest rate 𝑟′

and real wage vector 𝑤′. That is, it is Δ𝑅 from the following equation:

                          𝑉(𝐴𝑡0 ; 𝑟 ′ , 𝑤 ′ , 𝑡𝑅 + 1) = 𝑉(𝐴𝑡0 + Δ; 𝑟′, 𝑤′, 𝑡𝑅 )

It is the compensating variation of being forced to retired at time 𝑡𝑅 instead of 𝑡𝑅 + 1. Our model

does not include a cost of effort. But without taking a stand on the functional form for cost of

effort, we can state that low interest rates generally increase the benefit of working longer, while

low growth rates reduce it. These results suggest that there is a stronger incentive to delay

retirement in a low interest rate environment and a weaker incentive in a low wage growth

environment.

       Table 3 is identical to Table 2 except that the Social Security claiming age is constrained

to be equal to the retirement age. Claiming upon retirement is a common behavior observed in

the data (see Shoven, Slavov, and Wise 2018). Each cell in the table presents the compensating

variation of being forced to both retire and claim at time 𝑡𝑅 instead of 𝑡𝑅 + 1. In this table, the

marginal benefit of working longer incorporates any gains or losses from delaying Social

Security. The values reported in this table are usually (though not always, due to nonlinearity in

the actuarial adjustment) greater than the corresponding values in Table 2 for retirement

(claiming) ages that are below the optimal claiming age. The values in Tables 2 and 3 are a direct

measure of the value of working longer relative to saving more (having additional wealth).



                   b. Economy-Wide Wage Growth vs. Individual Wage Growth


                                                                                                      16
       The adjustments required in response to a reduction in economy-wide wage growth are

substantially larger than the adjustments required in response to a reduction in individual wage

growth. In addition to the five alternative scenarios considered above, we consider a sixth and

final alternative scenario: reducing 𝑔𝑊𝑊𝐼 to 2.5 percent (the rate of inflation) while 𝑔𝐴𝑊𝐼

remains at 3.5 percent. Figure 10 illustrates the deviations of consumption, income, and assets

from the baseline under the assumption that the retirement age is fixed at 65. The decline in

consumption is smaller relative to scenario 3, which lowered both economy-wide growth ( 𝑔𝐴𝑊𝐼 )

and individual wage growth (𝑔𝑊𝑊𝐼 ) to 2.5 percent. Annual consumption for the 1965 (1975)

birth cohort declines by only $1,770 ($4,455) in alternative scenario 6, compared to $2,407

($5,329) in alternative scenario 3. The milder impact on consumption is reflected in the

compensating variations, which are shown in the fourth column of Table 1. Depending on

retirement age, the 1965 (1975) birth cohort’s compensating variation for a shock to individual

wage growth is between 61 and 83 percent (79 and 88 percent) of the compensating variation for

a shock to economy-wide wage growth.

       This large difference arises from the Social Security benefit formula, and there are two

factors driving it. First, when there is a shock to individual wages but not economy-wide wages,

there is no change to wage indexation relative to the baseline. That is, the individual’s earnings

history is indexed to the same economy-wide level. Second, the bend points do not change

relative to the baseline, but the individual’s AIME is lower relative to them. Thus, the

progressivity of the benefit formula provides some insurance against the wage shock. Table 4

summarizes this contrast. The first column of the table shows each worker’s AIME and PIA

under the baseline; these amounts are expressed in nominal dollars in the year each worker turns

62. The next two columns show the same values under alternative scenarios 3 (low economy-


                                                                                                     17
wide and individual wage growth) and 6 (low individual wage growth only). For the 1965

cohort, a shock to economy-wide wages lowers PIA by 6.78 percent, while a shock to individual

wages alone lowers PIA by only 1.37 percent. The contrast is even larger for the 1975 birth

cohort, which has a longer time remaining in the labor market. The decline in PIA is 15.39

percent when economy-wide wage growth is low, compared to only 4.63 percent when

individual wage growth is low.



           V.      Relationship to Financial Planning Advice

       These life cycle model results stand in contrast to standard financial planning advice,

which generally holds that lower interest rates require greater saving to meet income targets. The

retirement planning process typically starts with retirement goals and ends with a plan for

investing and saving. The process can be divided into three general steps. First, a goal for

income in retirement is established. Typically, this goal is set as some fraction of preretirement

income, e.g. 70% or 80%. The next step calculates the amount of assets needed at retirement to

fund this spending goal. Finally, with an assumed rate of interest, a saving plan can be

constructed to achieve the target asset level at retirement.

       Consider how this planning process is impacted by a change in the real interest rate.

First, if wage growth is assumed to be unchanged, the goal for retirement income is also

unchanged. The amount of assets needed to fund this goal has unambiguously increased with a

lower real rate assumption. Economists would generally look to prices of real annuities to

estimate this cost increase. Given our framework, we estimate real annuity prices at age 65 for

our stylized retiree as increasing from $15.09 per $1 of income when real rates are 3% to $18.57

per $1 of income when real rates are 1%. That represents a price increase of over 23%.



                                                                                                  18
       The baseline financial planning rule of thumb for spending down assets is the “4% rule.”

The 4% rule prescribes spending for a new retiree to equal 4% of initial retirement assets. Each

subsequent year, spending is increased to keep pace with inflation. Based on an analysis of

historical returns, investing the assets in a 50/50 bond/stock portfolio has been able to support the

4% rule spending profile (Bengen 1994). The 4% rule suggests $25 are needed for every $1 of

retirement income. This is substantially higher than the annuity price for two reasons. First, the

4% rule approach does not benefit from mortality discounting, and in fact often leaves

substantial assets to heirs. Second, the 4% rule approach invest in risky assets, and requires the

payouts are feasible even under worst-observed market conditions.

       However, the financial planning community has also recognized that lower interest rates

should translate into lower retirement spending. Blanchett, Fink and Pfau (2013) consider the

impact of lower interest rates on “safe portfolio withdrawal rates.” The authors state that “This

research also shows that a 2.5% real withdrawal rate will result in an estimated 30-year failure

rate of 10 percent.” If the 4% rule is replaced with the 2.5% rule, the price of $1 income in

retirement has now skyrocketed to $40! That represents a 60% increase. They recognize this

dramatic increase and suggest clients might want to consider annuity type products: “Few clients

will be satisfied spending such a small amount in retirement. It is possible to boost optimal

withdrawal rates by incorporating assets that provide a mortality credit and longevity

protection.”

       Finally, lower interest rates mean workers need to save more to achieve any given

accumulation goal. For instance, suppose the goal is to accumulate $100,000 after 10 years.

With a 3% interest rate, $8,469 in annual saving is required. If interest rates fall to 1%, saving




                                                                                                     19
must increase to $9,463 to fund the $100,000 goal. That represents almost a 12% bump up in

annual saving.

       In contrast, with the life-cycle approach, a change in interest rates is essentially viewed as

a change in prices. In this case, the price of later consumption has gone up relative to earlier

consumption. Like all price changes, this leads to a wealth effect and a substitution effect. First

consider the wealth effect. Since wages are significantly higher than Social Security income, our

stylized workers save early so that they can spend more later. The wealth effect of an interest rate

decrease should drive our agents to want to spend less in every period. How much less? To gain

some intuition, consider a simple model where the goal is to spend equal amounts each year. For

our economic agent born in 1965, we estimate they can spend $49,460 per year for life if interest

rates are 3%. If interest rates decrease to 1%, the lifetime annual spending that can be supported

from savings, wages and Social Security drop to $44,934, a 9% decline.

       In addition to the wealth effect, there is also a substitution effect. Prices for late-life

consumption significantly increase when interest rates decline. If interest rates change from 3%

to 1%, the price of consumption at age 84 relative to consumption at age 54 has increased by

over 80%! With this level of price change, we would expect substantial substitution away from

late-life consumption. This is exactly what we observe in the life-cycle model. In the baseline

case, our agent born in 1965 has arranged things so that their consumption is constant throughout

their lifetime at a level of $49,460. As previously described, changing the interest rate to 1%

would imply that this person’s lifetime wealth would only support constant annual consumption

at a level of 44,934. However, as we see in Table 5, this is not the chosen strategy. Instead, the

person chooses an initial spending level of $49,526. This is substantially above the constant

consumption solution, and in fact is even above the initial spending rate. For the first year, the



                                                                                                      20
substitution effect is larger than the wealth effect. If the person survives to their maximum age

of 110, the plan is to reduce consumption to $34,346. Early consumption is costly relative to

later consumption, so to shift consumption earlier in life, average consumption must fall. In this

case, consumption falls to $41,482.

       The life cycle model suggests two major differences from the planning approach. First,

spending in retirement should not be held constant. Since dollars are needed to be shifted from

working years to retirement years, a lower interest rate reduces wealth and should be generally

pushing down spending in all years. Moreover, a lower interest rate significantly increases the

relative price of consumption during retirement, which also pushes down optimal consumption in

retirement. Saving levels is more ambiguous. The life-cycle model would strongly argue against

massive increases in saving levels pre-retirement. In addition, there are some situations where

initial saving levels would not increase at all. Since the price of current consumption is now

relatively low, the substitution effect could outweigh the wealth effect and increase initial

consumption thereby decreasing saving levels.



           VI.     Discussion and Conclusions

       The main purpose of the paper has been to examine the consequences of mid-career

workers lowering their assumptions regarding real interest rates, wage growth rates or both in the

context of a standard life cycle model. We think that this circumstance is relevant to many mid-

career Americans who may have chosen their initial assumptions in the 1990s. At that time,

safe interest rates were approximately 3 percent. Not only have real interest rates been under 1

percent for a decade now, but one prominent model in the r star literature suggests that future

real interest rates over the medium to long run will average between zero and one percent. So,



                                                                                                    21
there is good macroeconomic reasons why mid-career workers might be taking down their safe

rate of return assumption within their life cycle plan. We investigate the consequences of

reducing the real interest rate assumption from 3 percent to 1 percent.


        The need to take down the future wage growth assumption could come from either

macroeconomic factors (such as the slowdown in the growth rate of average labor productivity)

or more microeconomic factors. Figure 3 shows that the average mid-career worker cannot

expect real wage increases based on additional experience, unlike a much younger worker.

Some mid-career workers undoubtedly have become more pessimistic about their future wage

increases and there probably are more of them in a slower growing economy. We investigate

two circumstances. The first is where future projected wage growth is reduced both for the

individual and also for the economy as a whole. The second is where the newfound pessimism

about wage growth applies only to the individual and not to economy-wide average wage

growth.


        We reach several conclusions. First, reducing the safe rate of return assumption for a

mid-career worker is equivalent to a substantial hit to assets. The numbers were shown in Table

1. This wealth effect lowers optimal consumption both in retirement and for the rest of the

working career. Second, for the cases where the rate of time preference is unchanged, future

consumption becomes more expensive relative to current consumption with the lower real

interest rate. This encourages a shift of consumption towards the present, leading to lower

saving, at least initially. Third, the optimal age for single men to commence Social Security

advances from 68 to 70, when the real safe interest rate changes from 3 to 1 percent. Fourth, the

incentive to retire later is increased when interest rates are lower. Finally, all of this is contrary

to standard financial advice which often is to save significantly more in the face of lower rates of

                                                                                                     22
return. This advice comes from an attempt to maintain the retirement standard of living. But,

maintaining a given standard of living in retirement is not optimal when one is poorer in a

lifetime sense and when future consumption has become relatively more expensive.


       When mid-career workers lower their assumption about future wage growth, it makes a

big difference whether their more pessimistic outlook is for the economy as a whole or just for

themselves. If they are only taking down their own outlook, then Social Security provides them

with an element of insurance. If their final wage is now forecast to be 20 percent lower than

previously, their Social Security benefits will fall far less than 20 percent. This cushions their

loss in a compensating variation sense (comparing scenarios 6 and 3 in Table 1) and also

cushions the fall in their optimat consumption path. On the other hand, Social Security offers no

insurance against slower aggregate wage growth. In that case, if one’s final wage is reduced by

20 percent due to the aggregate slowdown in wage growth, projected Social Security benefits

will also fall by roughly 20 percent. The Social Security replacement rate of final wages will be

approximately unchanged.


       The consequences of a low return, low wage growth environment on mid-career workers

are non-trivial as our compensating variation numbers indicate. However, financial planners

who advocate saving lots more in the face of these circumstances are not giving advice

consistent with the optimal plan for a life cycle model of economics.
