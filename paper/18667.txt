                                            ABSTRACT

We re-examine the links between changes in housing wealth, financial wealth, and consumer spending.
We extend a panel of U.S. states observed quarterly during the seventeen-year period, 1982 through
1999, to the thirty-seven year period, 1975 through 2012Q2. Using techniques reported previously,
we impute the aggregate value of owner-occupied housing, the value of financial assets, and measures
of aggregate consumption for each of the geographic units over time. We estimate regression models
in levels, first differences and in error-correction form, relating per capita consumption to per capita
income and wealth. We find a statistically significant and rather large effect of housing wealth upon
household consumption. This effect is consistently larger than the effect of stock market wealth upon
consumption.

In our earlier version of this paper we found that households increase their spending when house prices
rise, but we found no significant decrease in consumption when house prices fall. The results presented
here with the extended data now show that declines in house prices stimulate large and significant
decreases in household spending.

The elasticities implied by this work are large. An increase in real housing wealth comparable to the
rise between 2001 and 2005 would, over the four years, push up household spending by a total of about
4.3%. A decrease in real housing wealth comparable to the crash which took place between 2005
and 2009 would lead to a drop of about 3.5%.

I. Introduction

        In the winter of 2000-2001, we made presentations at several professional

meetings in which we sought to link household consumption expenditures to incomes and

wealth, by relying on aggregate panel data on U.S. states and fourteen different countries.

A formal paper was ultimately presented at the Summer Institute of the National Bureau

of Economic Research (NBER) in July of 2001, and it was circulated as an NBER

working paper (#8606) that fall.

        That research attempted to measure average consumption, income, housing

wealth, and stock market wealth over time for U.S. states and foreign countries. The

statistical relationship between consumption, income and wealth was estimated using

standard multivariate techniques, and we interpreted the coefficients of the wealth

variables as indicating the strength of the association between these two kinds of

household wealth and household consumption.

        Our statistical results suggested that there were significant “wealth effects” upon

consumption associated with both types of wealth, housing wealth and financial wealth,

but that the stimulatory effects of housing wealth substantially exceeded the effects of

financial wealth. This result persisted for a variety of specifications for both panels of

aggregate data.

        These results received some notice in the popular media,1 in some part,

presumably, reflecting concurrent trends in the macro economy. In due course, the paper,

“Comparing Wealth Effects: The Stock Market versus the Housing Market,” was

  This work was the subject of the “Economics Focus” column in the Economist (November 8, 2001) and
formed the basis for a subsequent cover story (March 30, 2002).

made available online, and they were used by John Muellbauer (2008) in his well-known

paper presented at the Federal Reserve Conference at Jackson Hole, Wyoming in 2007.

       When our paper was originally presented, it relied upon the most recent data

available. The paper was first presented in January 2000, and it relied upon data from

1982 through the second quarter of 1999. By the time the research was published, five

years had elapsed, and by the time of the disastrous meltdown in mortgage markets, more

than seven years had elapsed.

       The purpose of this paper is to update the empirical analysis using data through

2012, and thus to incorporate the past decade of unusual volatility in housing wealth,

stock market wealth, and personal consumption. The update more than doubles the

number of observations from under 3500 (68 quarters and 51 states including D.C.) to

over 7600 (150 quarters and 51 states). As before, we present a variety of econometric

models linking consumption to income, housing wealth, and stock market wealth. As in

our previous analysis, we make no effort to “deduce” a structural model reflecting these

relationships, preferring again to observe the robustness of these relationships to plausible

specifications of the association. An earlier version of this paper updates the research to

2009 and was distributed as NBER Working Paper 16848 in March, 2011.

       In attempting to update our previous analysis, it was immediately apparent that

comparable data from the panel of OECD countries previously analyzed could not be

obtained. Hence, this analysis is confined to quarterly data on U.S. states, 1975:1-2012:2.

       The principal results and interpretations in our previous work are largely

unchanged, but the estimated magnitudes are larger and in some cases more important
                                           2
statistically. When the more recent volatile period is included in the analysis, we find that

the relationship between housing market wealth and consumption is a good bit stronger,

relative to the link between stock market wealth and consumption. This key finding is

robust to a variety of reasonable specifications. One set of previous findings does not

seem to hold up. In our earlier work, we noted an asymmetry in the association between

housing market wealth and consumption. When housing market wealth increased,

household consumption increased. But when housing market wealth declined, household

consumption declined only marginally. This asymmetry is absent or reversed in the

longer panel. The data now include substantially more variation in asset prices, notably

periods of declining house prices and declining stock market indices, and show that

declining house prices do lead to a lower level of consumer spending.

       In Section II below we review the conceptual and measurement issues addressed

in the original research paper, and we discuss our efforts to extend the time series for

analysis. We also describe recent trends in housing wealth, stock market wealth, and

household consumption.

       Section III extends the econometric models which relate consumption to housing

wealth and stock market wealth. Section IV presents our conclusions briefly and reflects

on their significance.


II. Wealth Effects and Consumption

       It has been widely observed that changes in the values of financial assets are

associated with changes in national consumption. In regression models relating changes

in log consumption to changes in log stock market wealth, the estimated relationship is

                                           3
generally positive and statistically significant. Under a standard interpretation of these

results, from a suitably specified regression, the coefficient measures the “wealth effect” -

- the causal effect of exogenous changes in wealth upon consumption behavior.

        There is every reason to expect that changes in housing wealth exert effects upon

household behavior that are quite analogous to those found for financial wealth. Yet until

our work a decade ago, there was virtually no comparative research on this issue. As is

evident from the events of the past half decade, the housing wealth effect may have

become especially important, as institutional innovations (for example, second mortgages

in the form of secured lines of credit, and option-ARM first-mortgage contracts) made it

as simple to extract cash from housing equity as it was to sell shares or to borrow on

margin.

        Our previous paper summarizes the extensive theoretical and empirical rationale

for wealth effects, and we do not repeat this summary here. However, two arguments

have recurred and should be acknowledged. The first, a general point, was made by

Glaeser in his comments on Case (2000). The claim is essentially that, since a house is

both an asset and a necessary part of outlays, when the value of a house increases there is

little or no welfare gain.2 Glaeser’s comments were in part motivated by a comment made

in a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan (November 2, 1999) in which

he stated that “The permanent increase in spending out of housing wealth is somewhat
2
  Glaeser reminds us of the result from elementary price theory that if a rational individual has already
purchased the desired housing (so that the endowment point equals the consumption point) then price
changes in either direction are utility improving. (The household can always continue to consume the same
bundle that it did before the change, but the price change has opened up new opportunities.) But we cannot
infer, when comparing general equilibria, that any price change is unambiguously welfare improving -- not
without understanding the exogenous shocks that produced the change. A transcript of the debate can be
found in the discussion following the paper by Karl Case (2000). A fuller discussion of the complex issues
surrounding housing wealth effects can be found in our previous paper (2005).

                                                  4
higher, perhaps in the neighborhood of five percent.” A decade ago, Glaeser found these

remarks “inscrutable, unsupported and hard to accept.”

       But Glaeser’s theory is belied by the public’s widespread impression that

increased home prices make them very much better off. Part of the reason may be

psychological, due to the salience of home price increases and myopic failure to consider

that there cannot be such an advantage if most other households have experienced the

same price increases. This is exacerbated by the fact that homes are the collateral behind

mortgage loans.

       A second way to approach the topic of consumer spending out of home price

appreciation is to simply look at the cash flows. Greenspan and Kennedy (2007), in an

extensive data collection exercise, produced careful estimates of all the free cash and

credit extracted from the housing stock since 1990. During the housing boom of 2001-

2005, an average of just under $700 billion of equity was extracted each year by home

equity loans, cash-out refinance, and second mortgages.

       Table 1 reports the total value of the housing stock every five years since 1980

according to the Flow of Funds Accounts maintained by the Federal Reserve. Between

2001 and 2005, the value of real estate directly owned by the household sector increased

by roughly $10 trillion, of which half was appreciation of land and half was the value of

new structures (see Case 2006). On the way down, real estate holdings of households

lost over $6 trillion. Given the magnitude of these flows and the general failure at the

time to recognize them as part of a credit bubble, it is hard to imagine that the buildup in

home equity when and where it occurred did not encourage aggregate spending.

III. Housing Prices: 1975 – 2012

       We use regional (state level) data to identify the wealth effect to exploit the fact

that home prices have evolved very differently in different parts of the country. This

arises largely from differences in the elasticity of land supply, the performance of

regional economies, and the changing demographics of states.

       The expanded data set described below adds information on the years 1975-1981

and 2000-2012. These periods include the two most serious recessions since the Great

Depression. The time period also spans the longest expansion in U.S. history, 1991-2001.

In fact, as reported in Figure 1, between 1983 and 2000 there were only two quarters of

negative growth, both in 1990.

           The steady performance of the national economy contributed to a national

housing market that had almost never experienced price declines, at least not since 1975.

The behavior of home prices since 1975 is chronicled in detail in Case (2008) and Case

and Quigley (2008, 2010). Here we review a few salient facts.

           Figures 2 and 3 report two national measures of house prices. The S&P Case

Shiller composite-10 index shows only a minor drop during the recession of 1990-91

while the FHFA index never declines at all between 1975 and 2007. Beginning in the late

1990s, prices begin to rise at an increasing rate. House price increases, fed by inertia,

easy money and optimism, accelerated during the recession of 2001 even as the stock

market was in decline. The recession of 2001 followed closely on the heels of the
                                                                                                                                                                           7
DotCom stock market crash which began in the Spring of 2000. The NASDAQ peaked in

March of 2000 and ultimately fell by 78 percent. This led to a period when the stock

market and the housing market were headed in opposite directions.

          The most dramatic increases in home values and wealth occurred in regional

booms and more broadly at the low end of the price distribution. A substantial expansion

of credit to less-qualified buyers occurred between 2003 and 2007. In a number of cities,

house prices tripled, for example, Miami (+ 241 percent), Los Angeles (+240 percent),

and San Diego and Washington D.C. (+197 percent).

          In many regions of the country, there have been substantial periods of decline as

well. Both the Northeast boom and the second California boom were followed by deep

declines in housing prices. Nominal prices fell by thirteen percent in the Northeast, where

a bottom was reached in fourteen quarters. In California nominal prices fell fourteen



                                               9
percent, and a bottom was not reached for twenty quarters. Some areas fared even worse;

in San Diego prices fell seventeen percent and did not hit bottom for 24 quarters.

       In September of 2005, prices began to fall in Boston, and by the summer of 2007

prices in every major metropolitan area of the U.S. were declining, some quite rapidly.

Table 2 shows the extent of the decline and the differences in the pattern of decline over

time. The largest declines occurred in the cities which had previously experienced the

largest price increases and in cities where over-building had been most extreme (e.g.,

Miami, Phoenix, Las Vegas). The California coastal cities had experienced very large

increases in house values, but due to supply restrictions they never overbuilt. Finally,

some cities did not experience any boom at all, but had declining regional economies

(e.g., Detroit and Cleveland).

       The changes in housing wealth and stock market wealth do not move closely with

per capita income across states. Figures 4 through 7 report changes in the ratio of the

price of a standard house to per capita income for four states. The charts are based on the

value of the median house in the state in 2000, indexed over time with the Fiserv Case

Shiller Index for the state, divided by per capita income in the state. Texas witnessed a

steady decline in the ratio of house prices to income from 1975 to the late 1990s.

       The most dramatic cyclical pattern is in California where the highest peak is

simply out of line with the rest of the country. The patterns in Florida and Arizona are

much like that in Texas, but with bubbles inflating and deflating since 2004. State

housing markets were moving in complicated and asynchronous ways during the periods

which we were able to add new data to the time series.




                                           13
IV. Measurement Issues: The Data

        The data set for U.S. states exploits the fact that the distribution of increases and

decreases in housing values has been anything but uniform across regions in the U.S., and

variations in stock market wealth have been quite unequally distributed across

households geographically. The panel offers the advantage that data definitions and

institutions are uniform across geographical units. In addition, the extension reported here

doubles the sample size for analysis from just under 3,700 observations on state-by-

quarter-year to over 7600 observations.

        It should be noted that virtually all the data in the paper are new. We are

cognizant of the fact that many of the time series variables have been completely revised

a number of times over the years. The four main time series, personal income, stock

market wealth, retail sales and a proxy for housing wealth are all constructed with the

most recent updates available.

A.      Housing Wealth

        Estimates of housing market wealth were constructed from repeat sales price

indexes applied to the base values reported in the 2000 Census of Population and

Housing by state. Weighted repeat sales (WRS) indexes (see Case and Shiller, 1987,

1989) published by Fiserv Case Shiller Weiss are now available for this entire period for

all states.

        Equation (1) indicates the construction of the panel on aggregate housing wealth:

        (1)     Vit  Rit N it IitVio   where,

        Vit = aggregate value of owner occupied housing in state i in quarter t,

        Rit = homeownership rate in state i in quarter t,
                                            14
       Nit = number of households in state i in quarter t,

       Iit = weighted repeat sales price index, for state i in quarter t

               (Ii1 = 1, for 2000:I),

       Vio = mean home price for state i in the base year, 2000.

       Our previous paper describes in detail the construction of the aggregate housing

market wealth variable, using data from the Current Population Survey and the 1990 and

2000 Census of Population and Housing.

B.     Retail Sales as a Proxy for Consumption Spending

       Unfortunately, there are no direct measures of consumption spending by

households recorded at the state level. However, a consistent panel of retail sales has

been constructed by Moody’s Economy.com (Formerly Regional Financial Associates,

RFA. See Zandi, 1997). Retail sales account for roughly half of total consumer

expenditures. The RFA estimates were constructed from county level sales tax data, the

Census of Retail Trade published by the U.S. Census Bureau, and the Census Bureau’s

monthly national retail sales estimates. For states with no retail sales tax or where data

were insufficient to support imputations, RFA based its estimates on the historical

relationship between retail sales and retail employment. Data on retail employment by

state are available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Regression estimates relating sales

to employment were benchmarked to the Census of Retail Trade, available at five-year

intervals. Estimates for all states were within five percent of the benchmarks.

       Retail sales can be expected to differ systematically from consumption spending

for several reasons. Clearly, in states with relatively large tourist industries, recorded

retail sales per resident are high. Nevada, for example, with 26 percent of its labor force
                                            15
employed in tourism, recorded the highest level of retail sales per capita though much of

the period.

          To the extent that these systematic differences between retail sales and

consumption are state-specific, they can be accounted for directly in multivariate

statistical analysis. Data on retail sales, house values, and stock market valuation, by state

and quarter, were expressed per capita in real terms using the Current Population Survey

and the GDP deflator.

C.        Financial Wealth

          Estimates of aggregate financial wealth were obtained quarterly from the Federal

Reserve Flow of Funds (FOF) accounts. From the FOF accounts, we computed the sum

of corporate equities, pension fund reserves, and mutual funds held by the household

sector.

          To distribute household financial assets geographically, we exploit the correlation

between holdings of mutual funds and other financial assets. We obtained mutual fund

holdings by state from the Investment Company Institute (ICI). The ICI data are available

for the years 1986, 1987, 1989, 1991 and 1993. In this paper, we added data on years

2008 and 2009. For the years from 1993 to 2009, we interpolated the share of holdings in

each state, linearly, mapping the 1993 figures to the 2008 figures so that each summed to

one. We assumed that for 1978 through 1986:IV, the distribution was the same as

recorded in 1986 and that the weights for 2010, 11, and 12 were the same as they were in

2009.

          We made considerable efforts to check these series against other data, as there are

few alternative sources. The Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) produces regular
                                            16
estimates of household wealth, including stock market wealth, from a stratified random

sample of top wealth holders. Survey data are available for 1989, 1992, 1995, 1998 and

2001, and national aggregate data are published for those years. The staff at the Board of

Governors of the Federal Reserve (Fed) maintain that this survey information is

insufficient to estimate stock market wealth at the level of individual states. However,

Andreas Lehnert of the Fed arranged for special tabulations to be made available to us,

aggregating micro data on stock market wealth to the level of census region for each year

of the SCF survey. These data can be compared to the ICI data available for 1986, 1987,

1989, 1991 and 1993, also aggregated to the nine census regions.

       In the one year common to the two bodies of data, 1989, the simple correlation

between the two series is 0.934; the correlations are also quite high among the data for

other years which do not match. The t-ratios associated with these correlations are large,

but of course, the sample sizes are small. (This is discussed in our previous paper.)

D.     Personal Income

       To control for income, we simply used the Bureau of Economic Analysis’

Personal Income (as reported by Moodys .com).

       Figures 8 through 10 present the raw data for several states after conversion to per

capita terms and deflation using the CPI. The left-hand scale is income, housing wealth,

and financial wealth per capita in 1983 dollars. The right hand scale measures retail sales

in 1983 dollars.

V. Statistical Results

           Tables 3 through 7 report various econometric specifications of the relationship

between income, wealth, and consumption for U.S. states. All specifications include fixed

effects (i.e., a set of dummy variables for each state). These models formed the core of

our original analysis. Model I is the basic specification representing the effects of both

housing and stock market wealth upon consumption. We also include two other

specifications, to explore further the nature of estimated wealth effects and their

robustness. Model II for each specification also includes state-specific time trends. Model

III includes year-specific fixed effects as well as seasonal (i.e., quarterly) fixed effects.



                                                  19
       Note that, when interpreting the estimated coefficients for wealth in Model III, the

effects of an overall change in stock market wealth on consumption are controlled for in

the regressions. Thus, in Model IIII the estimated wealth coefficients reflect only

interregional differences in the growth of wealth.

       Table 3 presents basic relationships between per capita consumption, income, and

the two measures of wealth. As the table indicates, in the simplest formulation, the

estimated effect of housing market wealth on consumption is significant and large. In the

ordinary least squares regressions, the estimated elasticity is between 0.044 and 0.18. In

contrast, the estimated effects of financial wealth upon consumption are a good bit

smaller. In the simpler OLS model, the estimate ranges between 0.028 and 0.075. These

magnitudes are similar to the elasticities reported in our earlier paper.

                                           20
           When the model is extended to allow for first-order serial correlation, the

estimated elasticities for income and for stock market wealth are generally smaller.3 But

the estimated elasticities for housing market wealth are between 0.065 and 0.068, larger

than the same coefficient in our earlier work and much more significant statistically.

           The table also reports the t-ratio for the hypothesis that the difference between the

coefficient estimates measuring housing and financial market effects is zero. A formal

test of the hypothesis that the coefficient on housing market wealth is equal to that of

stock market wealth (against the alternative hypothesis that the two coefficients differ) is

presented, as well as a test of the hypothesis that the coefficient on housing market wealth

exceeds the coefficient on financial wealth. The evidence suggests that housing market

wealth has a more important effect on consumption than does financial wealth. This is the

same qualitative result reported and discussed in our earlier work, but the statistical

significance of the comparison is much larger with the richer panel of data on states.

           Table 4 presents results with all variables expressed as first differences. In the

ordinary least squares formulation, the coefficient on housing market wealth is significant

in all specifications and is two to three times as large as the coefficient on financial

wealth. Consumption changes are significantly dependent on changes in income and both

forms of wealth, housing wealth and stock market wealth. Table 4 also presents the same

first-difference equation when all three models are estimated using a simple instrumental-

variables approach, relying upon lags in income and wealth as instruments for current

income and wealth. In these regressions, the elasticity of spending to changes in housing

    These models rely on sequential estimation using the Prais-Winsten estimator with independent panels.

                                                   21
wealth is estimated to be quite large (0.16). Surprisingly the coefficient or stock market

wealth has a negative sign.4




        Table 5 presents the model in first differences including the lagged (log) ratio of

consumption to income. This is the error-correction model (ECM) often employed in the

presence of unit roots.5 The model represents a co-integrated relation between

consumption and income, where income includes that derived from the stock market and

housing. Note that the lagged ratio of consumption to income has a coefficient that is

negative and significant in all regressions. Thus, transitory shocks, arising from changes

in other variables in the model or the error term in the regression, will have an immediate

effect on consumption but will eventually be offset, unless the shocks are ultimately

confirmed by income changes. Again, the results support the highly significant

 This result persists when alternative lags are used as the instruments in the regression.

was uncovered.

immediate effect of housing market wealth upon consumption; the effect is especially

large relative to that of financial wealth.




        In Table 6, we introduce a lagged stock market response within the ECM

framework. There are certainly reasons to expect some time lags: household inattention,

evaluation of household finances only at periodic intervals (such as annual tax reporting

times), adjustment costs to changing consumption, and habit formation. Some of these

reasons are confirmed by survey data on individual consumers’ decisions. Kennickell and

Starr-McCluer (1997) found that households have only imperfect knowledge of their own
                                              23
financial wealth, and Buck and Pence (2008) report that a great many homeowners do not

know the basic terms of their mortgages. Dynan and Maki (2001) have presented

evidence using household data that the stock market wealth effect, to the extent that it is

measurable, operates as a lagged adjustment process. We amend our preferred

specification to add a lagged term in the regressions. We do not include lags on

household housing wealth, given the strong serial correlation of home price changes.6

The results reported in Table 6, including the lagged change in the stock market wealth

variable, are qualitatively similar to those reported in Table 5. The estimated effect of

housing wealth is also quite similar (0.069).




6
    This is the same specification that is reported in Table 5 of our original paper.

                                                      24
         In our earlier paper, we also investigated the importance of simple demographics

– the age distribution of the state populations – since theory implies that the wealth effect

should be different at different phases of the life cycle. We relied upon estimates of the

age distribution produced annually by the CPS since 1982. We computed the fraction of

the population aged sixty or above by state and year and interpolated to quarters. We

added interaction terms to the regressions reported in Table 6, in an effort to estimate

how the wealth effect is affected by age. The estimated age-interaction-effect variables

were not statistically significant, and regressions extending these non-results are omitted

here.7

         Due to changes in savings and tax institutions, we anticipate that the importance

of the housing wealth effect may have changed over time. The Tax Reform Act of 1986

(TRA86) greatly advantaged the use of housing equity for consumption (by eliminating

the tax deductibility of all other interest payments for consumer credit). Passage of the act

greatly encouraged financial institutions to establish lines of credit secured by home

equity, beginning in the fourth quarter of 1986. Even if homeowners did not plan to

access their home equity for consumption, their knowledge of the possibility may

diminish the precautionary saving motive, a motive which has been shown to be an

important determinant of consumption expenditures (Kennickell and Lusardi, 2004).

         Table 7 presents variants of our preferred statistical models, the first differences

and the ECM models, for the panel of U.S. states. In these regressions, we distinguish


7
  The state data do not exhibit enough variation in age distribution, even over this longer sample period, to
support estimates of the interaction of the wealth effect with age. However, it should be noted that
Campbell and Cocco (2004), using data on individual households, did find evidence that the housing wealth
effect is higher for older households.

                                                  25
between the potential effects of housing wealth on consumption before and after the last

quarter of 1986. In each of the six specifications, the estimated effects of housing market

wealth upon consumption are substantially larger after the passage of TRA86. The point

estimates are substantially larger (elasticity of .118) after the change in the tax law, and

these differences are highly significant statistically.




        Finally, some evidence suggests that housing consumers may react differently to

perceived increases in housing values as compared to perceived declines in asset values.

Genesove and Mayer (2001) have shown that home sellers behave differently, as

suggested by Kahneman and Tversky’s prospect theory, in reaction to declines in home

prices, than in reaction to increases. Apparently the painful regret due to loss of home

value has different psychological consequences than does the pleasant elation due to

                                            26
increase in home value, which frees up new opportunities to consume home equity. Table

8 provides additional evidence, using the same preferred models. (This is the

specification we reported in Appendix Table 3 of the original paper.)




       For each of the six regressions, the results indicate that increases in housing

market wealth have positive effects upon household consumption, but declines in housing

market wealth have negative and somewhat larger effects upon consumption. These

results were not found in our original analysis based on data through 1999. The housing

wealth elasticity in a falling market is estimated to be about 0.10 and in a rising market

about 0.032.

       Appendix Table 1 compares the effects upon consumption of both increases and

decreases in housing market and stock market wealth simultaneously. In each of the six

                                         27
models reported in the table, the effect of increases in housing market wealth upon

consumption is positive and significant; the effect of decreases in housing market wealth

upon consumption is negative and is also significantly larger.




       The statistical models also report a relationship between increases in stock market

wealth and increases in consumption, and a larger relationship between decreases in stock

market wealth and decreases in consumption.

       As emphasized in our original paper, there is always room for skepticism about

the estimation and interpretation of simple macroeconomic structural relations such as

those presented here. (See, for example, Cooley and Leroy, 1981, or Leamer, 1983.)

                                          28
Underlying our analysis is an assumption that it is useful to think of causality as running

from wealth components to consumption, and not that, for example, the two are

determined by some third variable, such as general confidence in the economy. We

believe even more strongly that these new results demonstrate that it is useful to think of

consumption as determined in accordance with the models we have presented. In

consulting this evidence, recall that our measure of housing wealth excludes wealth

changes due to changes in the size or quality of homes, changes that are likely to be

correlated with consumption changes merely because housing services are a component

of consumption. We have alluded elsewhere to others’ evidence using data on individuals

that the reaction of consumption to stock market increases is stronger for stockholders

than for non-stockholders (Mankiw and Zeldes, 1991), and that the reaction of

consumption to housing price increases is stronger for homeowners than for renters. This

lends additional credibility to our structural models when compared to a model that

postulates that general confidence determines both consumption and asset prices.


V. Conclusion

       The importance of housing market wealth and financial wealth in affecting

consumption is an empirical matter. We have examined this wealth effect with a

reasonably long panel of cross-sectional time-series data, one that is more comprehensive

than any applied before, and with a number of different econometric specifications.

       The numerical results vary somewhat with different econometric specifications,

and so any numerical conclusion must be tentative. We find at best weak evidence of a

link between stock market wealth and consumption. In contrast, we do find strong

                                          29
evidence that variations in housing market wealth have important effects upon

consumption. This evidence arises consistently using thirty-one year panels of U.S.

states, and this finding is robust to differences in model specification.

          As for the magnitude of the effects, consider a few of the most recent changes in

housing wealth. The decline in housing wealth from 2005-2009 was roughly thirty

percent (somewhat more in real terms). Estimates of the elasticity of consumer spending

range from 0.03 to 0.18, but those that are estimated with separate coefficients for up

markets and down markets are consistently about 0.10 in down markets.           That figure

implies that a decline of thirty-five percent in housing wealth would lower consumer

spending by 3.5 percent. Consumption is about $10 trillion, and that, in turn, implies a

decline in consumption of about $350 billion annually. To put those figures into context,

consider the effects of the decline in housing production from 2.3 million units to 600

thousand, at $150,000 each. This implies reduced spending on residential capital of about

$255 billion. Either has a large impact on the economy; together they have a very large

impact.

          These calculations should not imply a false precision in the interpretation of our

econometric models. Nevertheless, they do reinforce our conclusion that changes in

housing values continue to exert a larger and more important impact upon household

consumption than do changes in stock market values.
