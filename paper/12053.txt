                                           ABSTRACT

We review the efficacy of three approaches to forecasting elections: econometric models that project

outcomes on the basis of the state of the economy; public opinion polls; and election betting

(prediction markets). We assess the efficacy of each in light of the 2004 Australian election. This

election is particularly interesting both because of innovations in each forecasting technology, and

also because the increased majority achieved by the Coalition surprised most pundits. While the

evidence for economic voting has historically been weak for Australia, the 2004 election suggests

an increasingly important role for these models. The performance of polls was quite uneven, and

predictions both across pollsters, and through time, vary too much to be particularly useful. Betting

markets provide an interesting contrast, and a slew of data from various betting agencies suggests

a more reasonable degree of volatility, and useful forecasting performance both throughout the

election cycle and across individual electorates.

                                     I. Introduction


There has recently been a surge of interest in forecasting election outcomes (Cameron

and Crosby 2000; Fair 2002; Wolfers and Leigh 2002; Leigh 2004a; Jackman 2005;

Wolfers and Zitzewitz 2005b; Cuzán, Armstrong and Jones 2005). Following the 2004

Australian federal election we now have even more valuable data with which to evaluate

competing theories. In light of this new evidence, we assess the relative efficacy of three

approaches: econometric models based on recent economic data; betting markets (also

called “prediction markets”; Wolfers and Zitzewitz 2004), and opinion polling.



Australia’s 2004 poll proved to be especially interesting for several reasons. John

Howard was re-elected with an increased majority – an outcome that few pundits

expected. And we saw important innovations in the application of each of the forecasting

technologies we examine. The 2004 election occurred during arguably the best

macroeconomic times in a generation, and yet even so, Howard’s vote exceeded the

expectations of economic forecasting models. This election cycle also saw the

introduction of several new polling firms and polling technologies, but rising challenges

for pollsters too, such as declining response rates and rising mobile phone penetration.

On net, we find little evidence that polls are becoming more accurate. Finally, election

betting became even more popular, and we now have data from five betting markets run

in Australia and the UK.



To preview our results, we find that economic models provide useful forecasts,

particularly when making medium-term predictions. Consistent with international



                                             2
evidence (Berg, Forsythe, Rietz and Nelson 2001), betting markets provide extremely

accurate predictions, and in this election they not only predicted a Howard victory, but

also the outcome in three-quarters of marginal seats. The performance of the polls was

quite variable, and one’s assessment really depends on which pollster you rely on;

Morgan’s recent poor performance in the 2001 election was repeated again, potentially

casting doubt on their emphasis on face-to-face polling. We also present a method for

converting polling results into an assessment of the likelihood of victory. These results

strongly suggest that the “margin of error” reported by the pollsters substantially

overstates the precision of poll-based forecasts. Further, the time series volatility of the

polls (relative to the betting markets) suggests that poll movements are often noise rather

than signal.



                             II. The 2004 Election Forecasts


Table 1 shows key forecasts from the 2004 election cycle. We begin by presenting

forecasts for the share of the two-party preferred vote won by the Coalition, providing

election-eve forecasts, those taken three months prior to the election, and those taken a

year prior. By construction, forecasts of the vote share of the Australian Labor Party are

equal to 100 minus the Coalition prediction.

Panel A shows several forecasts of the two-party preferred vote share. The Coalition

government was ultimately re-elected with 52.74% of the vote, an increase of 1.79% on

their performance in 2001. The economic models correctly picked the election winner,

but surprisingly (given the strength of the economy) still under-predicted the Coalition’s

performance. That said, these models did predict a swing toward the Coalition: having



                                                   4
predicted the 2001 election almost perfectly, the election-eve economic models suggested

that the improved state of the macroeconomy would lead to a swing in the order of 0.3-

0.7% toward the government. Importantly, these models were all pointing to a Coalition

victory from at least a year prior to the election – a reflection of the stable and robust

macroeconomic conditions during the entire election cycle.



The polls paint a more variable picture. By election eve ACNielsen and Galaxy were

predicting a Coalition victory, Newspoll declared a dead heat, and Morgan predicted a

Labor victory. Three months earlier only Galaxy was predicting a Howard victory, and a

year prior to the election the polls suggested, on average, a dead heat. The variability of

predictions both across polls, and within polls over time, points to the difficulty of using

them to form reliable forecasts.



In Panel B we convert each of our measures into an implied prediction of the probability

of a Howard victory. Doing so requires us to estimate the probability that each indicator

pointing to a Coalition victory is due to chance. For the polls, our numbers are guided by

the estimated margin of error suggested by the polling companies. These estimates

typically refer to sampling error, and given the binomial nature of the elicited voting

intentions (when stated on a two-party preferred basis), the standard error (se) is

                            q (1 − q )
calculated simply as se=               , where q is the proportion of respondents who say
                                n

they will vote for the Coalition, and n is the sample size. For example, assuming only

classical sampling error, a poll with a sample size of 1 000, in which the parties were

evenly matched, would have a standard error of 1.6% (and a corresponding 95%


                                               5
confidence interval of ±3.2%), while a poll with a sample size of 2 000 would have a

standard error of 1.1% (a 95% confidence interval of ±2.2%).



Thus z=(q-0.5)/se yields a normally-distributed test statistic for whether or not a majority

of the population intend to vote for the Coalition. The estimates reported in Panel B are

the p-value for a test of whether the Coalition will receive more votes than the ALP.2 In

simple terms, if we assume only classical sampling error, we can take any two-party

preferred poll result and sample size, and use these two figures to calculate the

probability that the Coalition’s two-party preferred vote exceeds 50%.



We should also note several assumptions inherent in this conversion. Importantly, our

estimates account only for sampling error. Other possible forms of error may exist. For

example, voters may respond to polls strategically rather than truthfully; polling samples

may be skewed towards a particular kind of voter; and it may also be incorrect to assume

that respondents who say that they “don’t know” which way they plan to vote can be

folded into all other respondents. In addition, we do not account for the fact that the

parliamentary election system in Australia (like the electoral college system in the US),


2
    In classical statistics, the p-value describes the probability of observing the polling data given the null

hypothesis, while the statement that we are interested in making refers to the probability that the null

hypothesis is true given the polling data. A Bayesian analysis allows the latter to be computed from the

former. Assuming an uninformative prior yields a posterior for the probability of a coalition victory that in

large samples is well approximated by a normal distribution with mean p and variance p(1-p)/n, and this

provides a more coherent foundation for our probabilistic interpretations of the polls. We thank an

anonymous referee for suggesting this point to us.

means that it is possible to win a majority of the two-party vote but lose the election. This

has occurred in 5 of the 41 Australian federal elections (1954, 1961, 1969, 1990 and

1998). As such, the probabilities implied by the polls should be interpreted as the

probability of winning the two-party preferred vote, rather than the probability of picking

the correct Prime Minister. Finally, it is possible that polls may represent voting

intentions accurately, but these may yield poor forecasts of actual voting behaviour in the

event that voters change their minds between the poll and the election.



A related approach can be applied to convert the voteshare estimates from the economic

models into a probability of winning more than 50% of the two-party preferred vote. In

this case the standard error of the forecast is calculated from past forecast errors, using

the formula se( Forecast ) = s 1 + x j X ' X  (     )−1
                                                          x 'j , where s2 is the mean square error of the

prediction, column vector xj represents the n observations on independent variable xj, and

X is an n x J data matrix.3 These estimates – derived by applying the standard error of the

forecast to a normal distribution to generate a probability – should again be interpreted as

the probability of the Coalition winning a majority of the popular vote.



Finally, betting markets effectively involve trading a binary option on the re-election of

the Howard government. Wolfers and Zitzewitz (2005a) argue that the price of such a

security can be directly interpreted as the probability of the event occurring. Unlike the



3
    The standard error of the forecast is calculated based on a regression assuming homoskedasticity (by

contrast, note that the estimates in Table 2 use robust standard errors).



                                                        7
polls and economic models, this price can be interpreted directly as the probability of a

Coalition Prime Ministership.



We believe that presenting election forecasts as probabilities is useful because it focuses

attention not only on the point estimate of the likely winner, but also on the uncertainty

surrounding that forecast. As such, we believe it important that accounts of polls and

other forecasts focus on their probabilistic interpretations. Equally, the validity of this

exercise depends on the validity of estimates of the errors associated with these forecasts,

an issue we return to below.



We now turn to analysing the new data in somewhat more detail. We begin with

economic models, then turn to prediction markets and finally opinion polls.



                                   III. Economic Models


The logic of the economic models is simple: voters are more likely to re-elect incumbents

who deliver a robust economy. This pattern can be motivated either as voters providing

an incentive for politicians to deliver good outcomes, or as voters using available

information to discern high-ability incumbents. Fair (1978) assembles evidence showing

that the state of the economy was an important factor in US presidential elections. The

subsequent Australian literature includes papers by Jackman and Marks (1994), Jackman

(1995) and Cameron and Crosby (2000).

(b)    Models used are the authors’ preferred specifications: Jackman and Marks (1994) model 4;
       Jackman (1995) model 4 (both of which use elections from 1951 onwards); and Cameron and
       Crosby (2000) model 1.2 (using elections from 1903 onwards).
(c)    Cameron and Crosby’s specification also includes indicator variables for 1906, 1931, 1975, plus
       separate dummies for the two world wars. Replicated specification does not precisely match that
       presented in Wolfers and Leigh (2002), due to the release by the Australian Bureau of Statistics of
       revised GDP figures.
(d)    When estimating the Cameron and Crosby specification on US presidential elections, all variables
       are based on annual data in the election year, or the change from the year before the election to the
       election year. As Cameron and Crosby do for Australia, we include separate dummies for World
       War I (1916 election) and World War II (1940 and 1944 elections). Since unemployment figures
       are first available in 1890, the 1892 election is included in the Cameron and Crosby model only.

We updated these economic models to include all data available prior to the 2004 election

so as to allow a true “real-time” forecast; these estimates are reported in the second

column. Adding the 1996, 1998 and 2001 elections to the sample substantially

undermines the explanatory power of the Jackman and Marks (1994) and Jackman (1995)

specifications. Updating Cameron and Crosby yields smaller changes in their estimates,

reflecting their longer sample.



In general, Cameron and Crosby’s model fits the Australian data well, but at the cost of

parsimony: they include four economic measures, a honeymoon dummy, and five dummy

variables for particular elections or wars. Of the four economic coefficients,

unemployment and inflation are significant and in the expected direction, while real wage

growth has a marginally significant but negative effect. Taken together, these estimates

suggest that incumbents are more likely to be re-elected if inflation is low, and the real

economy (measured in terms of unemployment) is near capacity.



We use these updated models to generate the predictions shown in Table 1. These

different models yields substantially similar predictions, suggesting on election eve a

Coalition vote share of 51.3%–51.7%. These strong predictions reflect the robust state of



                                                   10
the economy during the 2004 election cycle. Even so, they all under-predicted the

performance of the Coalition, suggesting that perhaps these models still under-state the

importance of robust economic conditions. As such, we further update these models in

light of the 2004 election result (column three), and the economic variables become

marginally more important.4



If anything, the real puzzle in these data is how unresponsive Australian voters appear to

be to economic conditions, relative to their American counterparts. To make a more

precise comparison, we estimate each of these econometric models on US Presidential

elections since 1892. These results are shown in column four. Comparing these results

with earlier columns suggests that US voters are more responsive to economic conditions

than Australian voters. This is a particularly surprising result considering that these

specific models were (presumably) estimated to maximize their fit to the Australian data.



                                         IV. Prediction Markets


The 2004 election cycle saw robust interest in election betting, and we have obtained data

from four large Australian bookmakers: Centrebet, International All Sports, SportingBet

and SportsAcumen. We also have data from a British sports betting exchange, Betfair,

which operates in a manner akin to a futures exchange, in that participants buy or sell a

contract paying $100 if a candidate wins.




4
    This is consistent with the findings of Davidson, Farrell, Felvus and Fry (2004), who conclude that

economic conditions are the main factor explaining the outcome of the 2004 election.



                                                       11
Compared with other betting and prediction markets, total volume was substantial:

Betfair saw turnover of $705 544 (£307 601),5 while Centrebet held $1.9 million in bets

(up from $1.5 million in 2001). The other three Australian bookmakers would not

disclose their totals. By way of comparison, the Iowa Electronic Market (which caps bets

at $500) saw total turnover of $438 039 ($US327 384)6 in its winner-take-all market for

the 2004 US Presidential election. Incidentally, increased competition in the election

betting market in 2004 did not appear to have an effect on profit margins. Centrebet’s

overround (or vigorish) was 8% in both the 2001 and 2004 elections.



We convert the betting odds to implied winning probabilities, and show them in

Figure 1.7 Clearly the Coalition was the favourite from July 2003 (when the first election

betting market opened) until polling day.

Did the betting markets predict that Howard would increase his majority? One way of

answering this question is to compare the election-eve odds in this election to those just

prior to the last poll. On election eve in 2001, the markets assessed the Coalition as

having a 60% chance of winning, while on election eve in 2004, the market believed the

Coalition had a 77% chance of winning. Clearly the markets thought it more likely that

the Coalition would be re-elected in 2004 than it did in 2001. While we believe that this

probably reflects a view that the Coalition would increase their majority, alternative

interpretations are that markets were more certain about their ability to assess voting

trends, or that the market under-predicted the 2001 result.



We can also make similar comparisons on a seat-by-seat basis. Twenty-two electorates

were the focus of Centrebet’s attention in both the 2001 and 2004 elections, and as at




                                                             13
election eve on both elections, the Coalition was favourite in 15 of these seats.8 However,

the average probability of a Coalition win in these seats was 55% in 2001 and 60% in

2004. This suggests that the market expected Howard to be returned with an increased

majority.

Four facts are immediately obvious from Figure 2. First, once one takes account of the

over-round (the betting market equivalent of a bid-ask spread), there were very few

arbitrage opportunities during this election cycle.9 Second, these markets respond very

quickly to campaign news, and different bookmakers respond in similar ways. Third, the

betting markets yield predictions that exhibit a plausible degree of volatility; the

probability of a Coalition victory fluctuated from around 60% to around 80%. And

fourth, they appear to respond to identifiably important political news. Consistent with

campaign commentary, the betting markets suggest the importance of arguably

exogenous factors to re-election of the Coalition government, with the Jakarta bombing

in the 2004 election cycle providing a boost the Coalition just as September 11 did in the

2001 election cycle. These data also suggest that the Labor’s Tasmanian forestry

announcement provided the Coalition with a substantial boost.



These four facts provide suggestive evidence in favour of the view that these prediction

market prices are efficient. Table 3 provides further evidence on this score, presenting

several formal statistical tests of market efficiency. We focus on the two prediction

markets for which we have the most data: Betfair and Centrebet. Our Betfair data is

trade-by-trade, and we convert this into daily prices, taking the last trade prior to 4pm

Australian Eastern Standard Time on a given day (on days where no trade occurred, we

treat the market as closed). Centrebet prices are based on the bookmaker’s price at the

end of that day.

    The only arbitrage opportunity we observed was between Centrebet and SportingBet on 5 October 2004,

yielding an expected profit margin of 2%.

In KPSS tests, number of daily lags is chosen by Schwert criterion.

In Panels A and B, we test whether the price of a contract paying $100 if the Coalition

wins the election evolves in a manner consistent with the famous random walk

hypothesis. Panel A shows that we cannot reject the null hypothesis of a unit root (even

at a 10% level of significance), while Panel B tests the alternative null that the price

series is stationary. For Betfair data we can reject this null (at the 1% level); however for

Centrebet data we are unable to reject it even at the 10% level. In Panel C we test weak-

form market efficiency: can one predict today’s price change based on the price history?

We find little evidence of predictable price changes. Panel D presents a specific test of


                                                      16
semi-strong form efficiency: Can we predict today’s price changes on the basis of

publicly available polling data? We implement this test by taking the weighted average

of the last seven days of published polls. In the case of Betfair data, the small and

statistically insignificant coefficients suggest that the market prices this publicly available

information efficiently. For Centrebet, the coefficients are jointly significant – indicating

some lag in the incorporation of polling data – but sufficiently small that they are

unlikely to yield profit-making opportunities from normal movements in opinion polls.



What about the betting odds in the marginal seats? In the 2001 election favourites won in

43 of the 47 seats where Centrebet had allowed punters to place a bet (Wolfers and

Leigh, 2002). This time, Centrebet offered betting in 33 marginal seats.10 Based on the

odds reported on the morning of polling day, the favourite won in 24 seats, and lost in

eight seats, while in one seat (Hindmarsh) there was no favourite, with Centrebet offering

the same odds on the two major parties when the polling booths opened. Figure 3 shows

the explanatory power of these prices when the betting market opened, and when it

closed.

     Centrebet’s total marginal seat betting was approximately $600,000 in 2001 and $350,000 in 2004.

These charts show clearly the forecasting power of the betting markets: on election eve,

most seats were clustered in the bottom left and top right quadrants. The market’s

prediction of the likely winner also predicts actual vote totals reasonably well. Of those

cases where the market-favoured candidate lost, the margin was generally less than a

couple of percentage points. Russell Broadbent’s victory in the seat of McMillan stands

alone as the only case where the underdog won by a substantial margin. The predictive

performance of the markets three weeks prior to the election was substantially poorer.

The improvement in fit over the ensuing three weeks reflects the markets aggregating

possibly new information about voter preferences and the quality of campaigns. We now

turn to evaluating the polling data in greater detail.




                                                                                             18

The most commonly used means of forecasting election outcomes remains opinion

polling. In Australia, three major pollsters have provided regular polls through at least the

last seven elections: ACNielsen (formerly known as AGB McNair), Roy Morgan and

Newspoll. The 2004 election saw the emergence of a fourth major pollster, Galaxy. In

addition, the Australian National University, in conjunction with the Bulletin and the

Nine Network, conducted an experimental internet election poll. We do not deal with the

results of that poll here; a fuller discussion is found in Gibson (2004) and Jackman

(2005).



Of the four major Australian pollsters, all except Morgan conduct their polling by

telephone.11 Although the major pollsters do not publish their response rates, we can

glean some evidence from the results of market research surveys. Bednall and Shaw

(2003) found that the response rate to a short telephone survey (of the type most likely to

be conducted by opinion pollsters) averaged 23%. Another factor is that pollsters do not

typically attempt to contact those with mobile telephones.



Overall, the predictive power of election-eve polls remains low. Goot (2005) notes that

over the seven elections held between 1987 and 2004, the mean absolute error in

predicting primary vote shares of the major parties was 1.8% for ACNielsen, 1.3% for

11
     Morgan typically employs face-to-face polling, but conducted a telephone poll 7-8 October 2004. On a

two-party preferred basis, the results of this poll were only 0.5% different from the Morgan face-to-face

poll conducted on 2-3 October 2004. Both predicted a Labor victory.



                                                     19
Morgan and 1.6% for Newspoll. (The error margin of polls taken months or years before

the election is larger still: Wolfers and Leigh 2002). Since 1993, the major pollsters have

produced two-party preferred estimates, and over the five elections from 1993-2004,

Goot calculates that the mean absolute error was 1.6% for ACNielsen, 2.9% for Morgan

and 1.7% for Newspoll. Averaging these figures, the mean absolute error for the major

Australian pollsters is 2.1% – the same as the mean absolute prediction error of Gallup,

the largest US pollster (Wolfers and Zitzewitz 2004). Given that voting is not

compulsory in the US, this comparison does not favour the Australian pollsters.



Figure 4 shows the major opinion pollsters over the full election cycle, with a solid line

depicting the average result from all polls taken over the previous seven-days, weighted

by their sample size (eg. a poll of 2 000 people would receive twice the weight of a poll

of 1 000 people). The solid line suggests that the Coalition’s fortunes peaked in early-

2003, and again in late-2004, while Labor performed well in 2002, and during the first

half of 2004. The polls concur with the betting markets that the Coalition outperformed

Labor during the election campaign. This remains true even if we ignore the Coalition’s

poll-bounce that followed the bombing of the Australian embassy in Jakarta.

It is also interesting to compare the performance of the pollsters to the betting markets.

We begin by comparing the time series properties of each. In order to put polls and

markets on the same metric, we convert the polls into an implied probability of a

Coalition victory, using the method outlined above (treating the poll average as a

cumulative sample). The implied probability of a Coalition victory is shown in Figure 5.

To smooth out volatility in individual polls, we analyse the probability implied by the

seven-day, sample-weighted poll average.

The most striking aspect of this figure is the extreme volatility of the implied probability

of a Coalition victory suggested by the polls. Specifically, if we believe that polls are

afflicted only with sampling error, then for four months of the last election cycle the

chance of the Coalition being returned was less than 1%, while for nine months of the

election cycle, the chance of the Coalition being returned was less than 3%. It strains

credulity to believe that the Coalition’s probability of winning could have been this low

over a substantial period. It is also difficult to believe what a weighted aggregation of the

polls suggests: that over the course of the six-week election campaign, the Coalition’s

probability of winning rose from 0.7% to 98.3%. By contrast the betting markets suggest

a more reasonable degree of variation in election probabilities (54%–77%).




                                                                22
We interpret the excess volatility of the polls as suggesting that published error margins

are a substantial under-estimate of the true forecast errors.12 As such, we also experiment

with our own guess as to the relevant standard error. The dashed line in Figure 5 uses the

polling results, but we inflate the standard error substantially, simply assuming that it is

10%. In other words, we assume that the true standard error of the polls is equivalent to a

poll of 25 voters that suffered only from sampling error. While this seems a rather

extreme assumption, it generates a far more plausible series than when we take the

pollsters’ estimates of their standard error at face value. The resulting estimate ranges

from 26% to 66%, still demonstrating more movement than the betting markets, but now

moving within a more credible range. Moreover, this estimate appears to move in

lockstep with the betting markets.



Even though this assessment of the polls strikes us as more credible, Figure 5 still

suggests that the polls were systematically more pro-Labor than were the betting markets.

Jackman (2005) contains a thorough assessment of the bias inherent in polls from each of

the major polling organizations.



What does this suggest for those producing and publishing polls in future elections?

Given their low predictive power, we propose that pollsters provide more guidance to

their clients as to their (in)ability to forecast election outcomes. Our results indicate that –

for forecasting purposes – the pollsters’ published margins of error should at least be

doubled. This is true for each of the four major pollsters covered here. At some point in

     For a related discussion of this issue in the US context, see Martin, Traugott and Kennedy (2003).

the 2001-04 election cycle, ACNielsen, Galaxy and Newspoll each published figures

which, if interpreted as a forecast, suggested that the Labor Party had less than a 0.5%

chance of winning, while ACNielsen, Morgan and Newspoll each published figures

suggesting that the Coalition had less than a 0.5% chance of being returned to power.

Consequently the media needs to display substantially greater caution in interpreting

changes from one poll to the next. Indeed, even with the published margins of error, a 1%

movement from one poll to the next is unlikely to be anything more than noise. But with

the margins of error implied by our results, even very large movements are likely to be

mere measurement error. Journalists who write about changes in poll movements without

discussing the margin of error may well be guilty of misleading their readers.13



Comparing the performance of marginal-seat polls and marginal-seat betting also yields

some interesting comparisons. Table 4 provides the full set of comparisons that we were

able to track down. Excluding the seat of Wentworth (where a prominent independent

candidate makes it difficult to compare pollsters and bookmakers), the pollsters correctly

predicted 7/10 seats (mean absolute forecast error=3.0%; root mean square error=3.9%),

while early odds from Centrebet correctly predicted 6/10 seats. In a regression of the final

two-party result on the two sets of predictions, neither pollsters nor bookmakers were

(individually or jointly) a statistically significant predictor of the size of the Coalition’s

this issue as a one of ethics. The Australian Journalists’ Association Code of Ethics begins “Report and

                                          VI. Conclusion


Writing after the 2001 Australian election, we concluded by stating our belief that betting

markets and economic models both merited greater prominence in the media and in

public discourse. In the case of betting markets, we are pleased to see some evidence that

this has occurred. We carried out a citation search across the major Australian

newspapers, looking for the name of the most prominent election betting firm, Centrebet,




                                                  25
plus the name of one of the major political parties: the number of such stories in the three

months prior to polling day more than doubled, from 66 in 2001 to 136 in 2004.14



By contrast, economic models of voting behaviour still languish in relative obscurity.

While a good deal of commentary during each election season is devoted to how the

economy will affect the outcome, such discussion is generally conducted outside the

more rigorous framework offered by the economic voting models. This appears to be

equally true of election commentary proffered by most economists, suggesting that

perhaps the complexity of economic voting models is not the only factor impeding their

growth.



Overall, most election commentary remains dominated by opinion polls, or even more

informal (“finger in the breeze”) methods. A survey of ten experts published on the

Sunday before polling day found that three thought Latham would win, while seven

thought Howard would win, but with a smaller majority than in 2001. None forecast the

true result – a Howard victory with an increased majority. Less poll- and gossip-

dominated journalism would be a boon to Australian election commentary, and might

even free up space for more substantive discussion of policies.

     These figures are the combined results of two searches. First, we used Lexis-Nexis to search five

newspapers: the Advertiser, Australian, Canberra Times, Courier Mail and Mercury. Next, we used the

Fairfax online search engine to search all Fairfax publications. In each case, we searched for stories

containing the word “Centrebet” plus “Labor or ALP or Coalition”. The two date ranges were 10 August

2001-10 November 2001, and 9 July 2004-9 October 2004.

Notes:
(a)          Incumbent vote share from Fair (2002).
(b)          Unemployment rates are annual averages. From 1890-1970, figures are from Hipel and Mcleod (1994); and 1948-
             2004 from Federal Reserve Economic Data (http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/)
(c)          Inflation is the annual inflation rate, from Robert Sahr, “Inflation Conversion Factors for Dollars 1665 to Estimated
             2015”, available at http://oregonstate.edu/dept/pol_sci/fac/sahr/sahr.htm. Sahr uses data from John J. McCusker and
             colleagues for the period 1665 to 1912, and CPI-U data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics for 1913-2004.
(d)          Real GDP growth is the annual change, constructed for 1892-2000 by averaging quarterly GDP from Fair, Appendix
             Table 2; 2004 from Federal Reserve Economic Data.
(e)          Real wage growth is the annual change in real weekly earnings. 1892-1900 from Bureau of the Census (1975, Series
             D735-738, nonfarm employees only), 1904-60 from Bureau of the Census (1975, Series D722-727, real earnings
             when employed), 1964 from Bureau of the Census (1975, Series D722-727, full-time employees only), 1968-2004
             from Bush (2005, Appendix Table B-47, private sector only).
(f)           “Honeymoon” is a dummy variable denoting the first election faced by the party of an incumbent president.
(g)          The Cameron and Crosby model also includes separate dummies for World War I (1916 election) and World War II
             (1940 and 1944 elections).
