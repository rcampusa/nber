This paper evaluates the extent to which the world economy has entered a phase of de-
globalisation, and it offers some speculative thoughts on the future of global value chains in the
post-COVID-19 age. Although the growth of international trade flows relative to that of GDP has
slowed down since the Great Recession, this paper finds little systematic evidence indicating that
the world economy has already entered an era of de-globalisation. Instead, the observed
slowdown in globalisation is a natural sequel to the unsustainable increase in globalisation
experienced in the late 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s. I offer a description of the mechanisms
leading to that earlier expansionary phase, together with a discussion of why these forces might
have run out of steam, and of the extent to which they may be reversible. I conclude that the main
challenge for the future of globalisation is institutional and political in nature rather than
technological, although new technologies might aggravate the trends in inequality that have
created the current political backlash against globalisation. Zooming in on the COVID-19 global
pandemic, I similarly conclude that the current health crisis may further darken the future of
globalisation if it aggravates policy tensions across countries.

Abstract 

This paper evaluates the extent to which the world economy has entered a phase of deglobalisation, 
and it offers some speculative thoughts on the future of global value chains in the postCOVID19 age. 
Although  the  growth  of  international  trade  flows  relative  to  that  of  GDP  has  slowed  down  since  the 
Great  Recession,  this  paper  finds  little  systematic  evidence  indicating  that  the  world  economy  has 
already entered an era of deglobalisation. Instead, the observed slowdown in globalisation is a natural 
sequel  to  the  unsustainable  increase  in  globalisation  experienced  in  the  late  1980s,  1990s  and  early 
2000s.  I  offer  a  description  of  the  mechanisms  leading  to  that  earlier  expansionary  phase,  together 
with  a  discussion  of  why  these  forces  might  have  run  out  of  steam,  and  of  the  extent  to  which  they 
may be reversible. I conclude that the main challenge for the future of globalisation is institutional and 
political in nature rather than technological, although new technologies might aggravate the trends in 
inequality  that  have  created  the  current  political  backlash  against  globalisation.  Zooming  in  on  the 
COVID19  global  pandemic,  I  similarly  conclude  that  the  current  health  crisis  may  further  darken  the 
future of globalisation if it aggravates policy tensions across countries. 

 

1. Introduction 

At  the  time  of  writing,  the  world  is  witnessing  extraordinary  events.  The  COVID19  global  pandemic 
has  brutally  awakened  the  world  from  a  Panglossian  tranquillity  caused  by  decades  of  relatively 
sporadic  and  largely  isolated  epidemic  risks.  The  magnitude  and  nature  of  the  COVID19  shock  has 
quickly spilled over to the global economy, triggering a dramatic decline in economic activity, due both 
to  social  distancing  practices  but  also  due  to  governmentmandated  lockdowns  and  other  mobility 
restrictions.

In describing the unfolding and the consequences of the current COVID19 health crisis, journalists and 
commentators  have  been  using  the  word  "unprecedented"  with  a  frequency  that  is  unprecedented. 
One example of such hyperbolic commentary is the notion that the world economy has now entered 
a  phase  of  deglobalisation  in  which  economic  agents  are  increasingly  severing  their  international 
economic  links  and  are  reshoring  economic  activity  toward  their  domestic  economies.  Is  the  world 
economy really getting deglobalised? 

Ironically,  such  an  unravelling  of  globalisation  would  not  be  unprecedented.  The  last  significant 
episode of deglobalisation occurred in the 20th century during the socalled Interwar Period, a period 
which coincidentally witnessed at its onset one of the most devastating global pandemics on record, 
the  1918  Influenza  Pandemic.1    Of  course,  there  are  a  myriad  of  forces  that  contributed  to  the  de
globalisation  of  the  Interwar  Period,  none  more  important  than  (i)  the  belligerent  and  dysfunctional 
political world order that emanated from World War I, and (ii) a worldwide economic downturn ­ the 
Great  Depression  ­  that  severely  impacted  many  of  the  world's  largest  economies  and  led  these 
countries' governments to institute beggarthyneighbour policies. 

Luckily, the world has not witnessed a truly global military conflict since 1945. Yet, the Great Recession 
of  the  late  2000s  brought  to  an  abrupt  halt  the  process  of  globalisation  that  had  begun  in  the  post
war  period  and  that  had  remarkably  accelerated  in  the  mid1980s.  And,  much  as  it  happened  during 
the  Interwar  Period,  the  recent  Great  Recession  has  rekindled  nationalistic  sentiments  in  many 
advanced  countries,  fuelling  a  political  rhetoric  that  blames  foreigners  for  the  economic  woes  faced 
by the domestic residents of these advanced countries. Although the extent to which this rhetoric has 
materialized  into  actual  policies  has  been  somewhat  limited,  the  recent  trade  disputes  between  the 
U.S. and China and the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union have shaken the 
firm ground over which the process of globalisation appeared to be cemented. To cap it off, since early 
2020,  the  world  economy  has  submerged  itself  into a  global  health  crisis  that,  due  to  its  severity  and 
asynchronous nature, has dramatically impacted the functioning of global value chains.  

In  sum,  in  an  era  like  the  present  one  with  significant  health,  economic,  and  policy  uncertainty,  it  is 
natural  that  some  commentators  have  spotted  the  beginnings  of  a  new  era  of  deglobalisation.2  The 
goal of this paper is to try to elucidate whether the world economy might have indeed already entered 
such  a  phase  of  deglobalisation,  and  more  speculatively,  to  offer  some  thoughts  on  the  future  of 
global value chains in the postCOVID19 age. 

The paper sets off, in section 2, by studying the process of globalisation in recent decades. Unlike the 
view pushed by some commentators, the paper argues that there is no conclusive evidence indicating 
that  the  world  economy  is  significantly  less  global  today  than  it  was  at  the  onset  of  the  Great 
Recession.  It  is  certainly  the  case  that  that  pace  of  globalisation  has  slowed  down  relative  to  recent 
decades  ­  a  process  that  The  Economist  has  referred  to  as  Slowbalisation3  ­,  but  the  anecdotal

that is neither fair nor accurate.

evidence based on individual firms' decisions that is often mentioned to justify the premonition of de
globalisation is not salient enough to  show up in aggregate statistics. The world tradetoGDP ratio ­ 
a standard measure of globalisation ­ has recovered from its late 2008 low, while last year, the share 
of migrants in world population attained its highest level since 1990. The relative importance of capital 
flows  and  multinational  activity  in  overall  economic  activity  has  certainly  gone  down  since  the  Great 
Recession, but these series remain at high levels comparable to those in the early 2000s. The same is 
true for the relative importance of global value chain (GVC) trade in world trade. 

Focusing on the evolution of the ratio of world trade to world GDP in the last fifty years, I find that 80% 
of the growth in this ratio occurred during the subperiod 19862008. Indeed, the ratio of world trade 
to  world  GDP  almost  doubled  (increasing  by  a  factor  of  1.72)  during  that  period  of 
"hyperglobalisation".  Because  many  measures  of  globalisation  are  simple  ratios  or  shares  that  have 
natural  upper  bounds,  I  argue  that  growth  explosions  in  trade  openness  of  the  type  experienced 
during  the  hyperglobalisation  of  19862008  are  simply  not  sustainable.  In  other  words,  a  period  of 
"slowbalisation" was inevitable. 

In order to elucidate why the process of globalisation slowed down, it is thus crucial to study the forces 
that fuelled that earlier expansionary phase. I turn to this task in section 3 of the paper. I identify three 
main developments beginning in the late 1980s that led to a remarkable disintegration of production 
processes  across  borders.  First,  the  information  and  communication  technology  (ICT)  revolution 
allowed  firms  in  industrialized  countries  to  relocate  certain  parts  of  their  production  processes  to 
distant  locations,  while  still  maintaining  a  fluid  flow  of  communication  between  the  different 
production units in GVCs, and also facilitated the design and implementation of efficient supplychain 
management practices. Second, this period also witnessed a significant fall in effective trade costs, a 
reduction caused both by a significant acceleration in the rate of reduction of manmade trade barriers 
(e.g., tariffs and other nontariff barriers), and by the increased reliance on faster methods of shipping 
goods,  such  as  air  freight  shipping.  Third,  political  developments  in  the  world  ­  most  notably  the  fall 
of communism in Eastern Europe and the gradual increased adoption of market economy practices in 
East  and  Southeast  Asia  ­  brought  about  a  remarkable  increase  in  the  share  of  world  population 
actively participating in the process of globalisation.  

In  sum,  at  the  same  time  that  firms  in  industrialized  countries  found  it  easier  and  cheaper  to  set  up 
global  value  chains  sustained  by  large  flows  of  goods  and  information  across  the  globe,  the  world 
capitalist system witnessed a massive labour supply shock, as hundreds of millions of workers (many 
of which highlyqualified workers) suddenly became "employable" from the point of view of firms in 
these advanced economies. I close section 3 by developing a simple theoretical framework to illustrate 
how these forces may have acted in independent but also in complementary ways to generate a fast 
acceleration  in  the  share  of  world  trade  accounted  by  global  production  networks.  The  framework 
also  incorporates  imperfect  competition  and  scale  economies,  and  demonstrates  the  relevance  of 
scale for the decision of firms to slice their value chain across borders.  

Having described some of the key forces that fuelled the hyperglobalisation of 19862008, in section 
4, I turn my attention to studying the extent to which these forces might have run out of steam, and 
more importantly, to assess the extent to which they may be reversible. I first review some of the key 

                                                                                                                     3 
 
technologies  associated  with  the  ICT  revolution  and  argue  that,  although  the  rate  of  technological 
change  does  not  seem  to  be  slowing  down  for  certain  key  technologies  (e.g.,  Moore's  Law  holds  as 
well today as it did in the 1980s and 1990s), sustaining such pace of technological progress is requiring 
increasingly  high  R&D  outlays.  Similarly,  there  are  some  signs  of  diminishing  returns  in  other 
technological  developments  that  were  crucial  for  hyperspecialisation  to  take  off.  For  instance,  the 
number of internet users as a share of world population is still growing but at a noticeably slower pace 
than in the 1990s. 

Next, I reflect on the extent to which other new technologies that have only become widely available 
in  recent  years  might  reduce  rather  than  increase  the  profitability  of  breaking  up  production 
processes.  I  first  discuss  the  role  of  automation,  which  constitutes  an  alternative  to  offshoring  for 
firms in developed countries seeking to lower their labour costs. Because automation and offshoring 
appear to be substitutes, one might expect that that future improvements in automation will naturally 
lead to an increasing amount of reshoring over time, thus fuelling deglobalisation. A similar case has 
been made regarding 3D printing. I argue, however, that both conceptually as well as in light of recent 
empirical  evidence,  the  deglobalising  effect  of  these  technologies  is  much  less  clearcut  in  practice. 
Furthermore, and as I review in section 4, there are an array of novel, cuttingedge digital technologies, 
that have the potential to give hyperglobalisation a second wind in coming decades. 

I  conclude  section  4  by  returning  to  the  conceptual  framework  developed  at  the  end  of  section  3.  I 
argue that, even if the forces that led to hyperglobalisation might have slowed down, and others might 
foster deglobalisation, the large economies of scale associated with modern GVCs might make firms 
reluctant  to  dismantle  them  in  the  face  of  severe  but  temporary  shocks.  More  specifically,  because 
firms  incur  large  sunk  costs  when  putting  in  place  their  global  sourcing  strategies,  their  location 
decisions  are  relatively  sticky.  I  argue  that  this  stickiness  explains  the  fact  that  the  bulk  of  the  trade 
collapse  of  200809  occurred  at  the  intensive  (rather  than  extensive)  margin,  thus  sowing  the  seeds 
for  the  observed  Vshape  recovery  in  trade  flows  in  2010.  The  lesson  is  that  shocks  to  the  world 
economy  are  likely  to  lead  to  important  changes  in  the  geography  of  worldwide  production  only  if 
these shocks are large and perceived to be persistent. 

Stepping away from technological factors, in section 5, I briefly study the potential role of other secular 
longterm  forces  in  potentially  leading  to  a  period  of  deglobalisation.  First,  the  labour  supply  shock 
associated with the transition of communist and socialist countries into market economies will not go 
away, but unit labour costs in less developed economies have grown considerably relative to those in 
advanced  economies,  thereby  eroding  some  of  the  benefits  of  fragmenting  production.  I  argue, 
however,  that  global  value  chains  do  not  always  seek  low  unit  labour  costs,  as  reflected  by  the  fact 
that an important share of GVC trade takes place between advanced economies. Furthermore, given 
the sunk costs associated with the current geography of worldwide production, it will take persistent 
and  significant  shifts  in  competitiveness  for  firms  to  want  to  reshore  activity  to  their  own  domestic 
economies. In section 6, I also discuss the role of various types of compositional factors. In particular, 
I show that investment rates appear to be going down at the world level, and I argue that this might 
put  downward  pressure  on  globalisation  in  the  future,  given  the  disproportionate  importance  of 
capital goods in international trade flows. 


                                                                                                                         4 
 
Although the case for a process of deglobalisation based purely on technological factors is somewhat 
weak,  the  risk  of  policy  factors  leading  to  an  era  of  increased  isolationism  deserves  much  closer 
attention.  Are  we  in  the  cusp  of  a  new  Interwar  Period  in  terms  of  trade  policy?  Although  the  trade 
liberalization  efforts  of  the  postwar  period  are  certainly  reversable,  as  Brexit  or  U.S.­China  have 
vividly  illustrated,  the  effects  of  these  novel  policy  distortions  have  been  limited  to  date.  Building  on 
the  conceptual  framework  with  sunk  costs,  I  argue  in  section  6  that  this  tamed  response  is  largely 
explained  by  the  fact  that  firms  are  uncertain  about  whether  the  restrictions  that  have  been  put  in 
place will be persistent. This leads me to study the underlying forces that precipitated the globalisation 
backlash of the 2000s, with the hope of elucidating the extent to which these forces will themselves 
be  persistent.  More  specifically,  I  discuss  the  role  of  tradeinduced  inequality  and  of  the  limited 
compensation  received  by  those  that might  have  been  negatively  affected by  the  hyperglobalisation 
of 19862008. I argue that technological progress in coming decades might not only give globalisation 
an extra push, but it might also aggravate inequality. As a result, the political rhetoric that has fuelled 
the  backlash  against  globalisation  will  remain  a  challenge  unless  tax  systems  do  a  better  job  of 
providing  a  safety  net  or  offering  active  labourmarket  policies  to  those  individuals  experiencing 
negative traderelated income shocks, such as job dislocations caused by import competition. 

In  section  7,  I  turn  to  the  current  COVID19  health  crisis.  I  first  document  the  effect  it  has  had  on 
international  trade  flows.  Governmentmandated  lockdowns  in  China  led  to  a  first  significant  decline 
in trade flows in late January and in February of 2020, with a disproportionate effect on international 
trade  in  vehicles  (a  canonical  example  of  GVC  trade).  After  a  recovery  in  early  March,  trade  flows 
collapsed again in March and April, with again a much larger response for "GVC" trade than for other 
types of trade. Growth in world trade since May has been steady, however, and had virtually reached 
early  January  levels  by  early  September.  Building  on  the  conceptual  framework  developed  in section 
3 extended to include sunk costs, I hypothesize that the bulk of the response in the early phases of the 
pandemic was at the intensive rather than the extensive margin. To the extent that economic agents 
perceive  the  COVID19  as  a  temporary  shock,  I  conclude  that  the  current  health  crisis  is  not  likely  to 
constitute  a  significant  deglobalisation  force  in  the  near  future.  Nevertheless,  I  anticipate  two 
potential turns of events that could led to a more protracted negative effect of the COVID19 crisis on 
globalisation.  First,  whether  the  shock  is  permanent  or  not  is  not  yet  entirely  clear.  At  the  time  of 
writing a reliable vaccine is not yet available, and there is the widespread perception that international 
business travel (a key input in global production networks) will be disrupted for years to come. Second, 
the  negative  externalities  inherent  in  the  spread  of  the  disease  across  countries,  has  somewhat 
intensified  the  practice  of  "finger  pointing"  between  countries,  which  is  not  auspicious  for  a  future 
easing  of  political  tensions  in  coming  years.  Furthermore,  every  indication  at  this  point  is  that  the 
current  health  crisis  is  likely  to  significantly  increase  income  inequality  worldwide  due  to  the 
differential ability of skilled and unskilled individuals to work from home, and this again does not bode 
well for the future of globalisation. 

 
2. DeGlobalisation? The Facts 
In  this  section,  I  review  the  evolution  of  various  measures  of  globalisation  with  the  goal  of  assessing 
whether the world economy has indeed entered a new era of deglobalisation. Although the process 

                                                                                                                      5 
 
of  globalisation  encompasses  the  integration  of  goods,  labour  and  capital  markets,  it  is  natural  to 
begin our analysis with international trade flows. 

Chart  1  plots  the  evolution  of  the  share  of  world  trade  over  world  GDP  during  the  period  19702018.4 
Several  aspects  of  the  figure  are  noteworthy.  First,  the  ratio  of  world  trade  to  world  GDP  more  than 
doubled, from an initial value of 13.7% in 1970 to 29.7% in 2018. Second, the bulk (close to 80%) of that 
increase  occurred  during  the  twentythreeyear  period  between  1986  and  2008.  Third,  world  trade 
openness fell notably after the onset of the Great Recession, but it has since recovered and, in 2018, it 
reached essentially the same level it had achieved at its peak in 2008.

Does  the  time  series  in  Chart  1  warrant  the  concern  that  the  world  economy  might  have  entered  a 
phase  of  deglobalisation?  The  contrast  between  the  hyperglobalisation  period  19862008  and  the 
more recent period 200918 is certainly noteworthy, but note that the period 197085 also saw a fairly 
restrained  growth  in  this  ratio.  More  significantly,  it  is  natural  to  imagine  that  in  a  world  economy 
converging to a balanced growth path, the ratio of world trade to world GDP will stabilize to a constant 
steadystate value. In other words, one cannot possibly expect the share of world gross output that is 
shipped  across  borders  to  grow  without  bounds  over  time:  it  cannot  possibly  be  higher  than  100 
percent!5  



                                        
4 World trade is defined as half the sum of world exports and world imports. 
5 The upper bound is in fact lower than 100%. For instance, in a world with no intermediate inputs, if bilateral trade flows are 

well  approximated  by  a  gravity  equation  then  / 1   / . Using  2018  GDP 
figures for all countries in the world, this delivers an upper bound for world openness of 90.1%. 

                                                                                                                              6 
 
An  important  caveat  to  this  argument  is  in  order.  World  GDP  and  world  gross  output  are  two  very 
different  objects,  and  the  ratio  of  world  trade  to  world  GDP  could  in  principle  well  exceed  100%,  as  it 
does for certain individual economies such as Hong Kong or Singapore. Still, one would not expect the 
ratio  of  world  GDP  to  world  gross  output  to  grow  at  a  constant  rate  in  a  balancedgrowth  path.  This 
ratio has in fact been quite stable at a value of onehalf in recent decades (see Antràs and Chor, 2018). 

In  Chart  2,  I  explore  the  extent  to  which  the  observed  growth  in  world  trade  in  Chart  1  is  associated 
with the emergence and consolidation of global value chains (GVCs). There are many possible ways to 
measure the extent to which production processes have become globalized in recent years. Borin and 
Mancini (2019) develop a natural measure of the importance of GVC trade in total international trade. 
Building on global InputOutput tables, they identify the share of a country's exports that flow through 
at least two borders.6 These exports encompass two broad types of GVC trade. On the one hand, GVC 
trade  includes  transactions  in  which  a  country's  exports  embody  value  added  that  it  has  previously 
imported  from  abroad.  This  type  of  GVC  participation  is  often  referred  to  as  backward  GVC 
participation. On the other hand, GVC trade also comprises transactions in which a country's exports 
are not fully absorbed in the importing country, and instead are embodied in the importing country's 
exports  to  third  countries.  The  latter  form  of  GVC  participation  is  often  dubbed  forward  GVC 
participation.

As  Chart  2  indicates,  according  to  the  BorinMancini  measure  of  GVC  trade,  the  overall  share  of  GVC 
trade in total world trade grew very significantly during the hyperglobalisation period 19862008, but 
it  appears  to  have  stagnated  or  even  declined  since  the  Great  Recession.  A  natural  conclusion  from 

                                       
6 See also Wang et al. (2013). Other important papers on the measurement of GVC participation include the pioneering work 

of Hummels et al. (2001), Johnson and Noguera (2012), and Koopman et al. (2014). 

                                                                                                                        7 
 
Charts 1 and 2 is that the hyperglobalisation of 19862008 was tightly related to the growth of global 
value  chains,  while  the  slowdown  since  the  Great  Recession  might  also  be  related  to  a  slowdown  in 
GVC activity.7 
As  mentioned  above,  globalisation  is  a  multifaceted  process  that  involves  much  more  than  the  flow 
of goods and services across countries. In Charts 3, 4 and 5, I explore the evolution of three variables 
that  are  often  associated  with  this  process.  In  Chart  3,  I  rely  on  data  from  the  United  Nations 
Population Division to report the stock of international migrants in the world as a percentage of world 
population. Although illegal immigration and the rise of refugees fleeing conflict might complicate the 
interpretation of this figure, it is apparent that the stock of migrants as a share of world population is 
at  its  highest  level  since  1990.  When  looking  at  individual  regions  or  countries,  increases  in  the  stock 
of migrants are observed across the board. For instance, the share of migrants in total population grew 
from  6.9%  to  10.9%  in  Europe,  and  from  9.2%  to  15.7%  in  the  United  States.  In  sum,  despite  a  backlash 
against  immigration  in  several  parts  of  the  globe,  there  is  little  evidence  that  migration  flows  have 
significantly  slowed  down  or  decreased  in  recent  years.  The  current  COVID19  pandemic  and  its 
associated  travel  restrictions  have  brought  migration  flows  to  an  abrupt  stop,  but  the  longterm 
consequences of this shock are yet to be discerned, as I will discuss more extensively in section 7.

7  Due  to  the complexities in  constructing  global  InputOutput  tables,  this  data  only  becomes  available  with a  significant  lag, 

so  Chart  2  measures  GVC  trade  only  up  to  2015.  Despite  their  widespread  use  in  economic  research,  it  is  also  important  to 
emphasize two key limitations of global InputOutput tables. First, because they rely on fairly aggregated InputOutput data, 
the resulting sectoral disaggregation of GVC flows is pretty coarse. Second, in constructing them, researchers are forced to 
impose  strong  assumptions  to  back  out  certain  bilateral  intermediate  input  trade  flows  that  cannot  be  readily  read  from 
either Customs data or national InputOutput tables (see de Gortari, 2019). 

                                                                                                                                            8 
 
Chart 4 turns attention to capital flows across countries as a measure of globalisation. For both foreign 
direct  investment  and  portfolio  investment  flows,  it  is  evident  that  the  importance  of  these  flows 
relative to world GDP peaked right before the Great Recession and, by 2018, they were nowhere near 
to recovering from those peak levels. Still, it is important to remember that the Great Recession was 
triggered by the Global Financial Crisis of 200708, so it is perhaps less surprising that one still observes 
some lingering effects of this crisis. This is for at least three reasons (see Beck et al, 2020): (i) the Global 
Financial  Crisis  naturally  resulted  in  persistently  high  levels  of  risk  aversion;  (ii)  the  crisis  led  many 
governments  to  adopt  macroprudential  policies  that  naturally  restrained  the  inflow  of  capital  into 
their  economies,  and  (iii)  government  bailouts  provided  an  incentive  for  economic  agents  to  lend  in 
their  domestic  economies,  where  the  perceived  (or  conveyed)  probability  of  being  bailed  out  was 
higher.  Although  the  persistence  of  these  factors  might  lead  to  a  protracted  period  of  financial  de
globalisation, this paper will not dwell too much into these set of issues, since they fall well outside my 
expertise.

Partly to alleviate concerns about the fickle nature of capital flows, in Chart 5 I study the evolution of 
foreign direct investment from the operational (or real) side of multinational companies. Building on 
data  from  the  OED  (see  also  Cadestin  et  al.,  2018),  I  plot  an  estimate  of  the  share  of  global  output 
accounted  for  by  foreign  affiliates  of  multinational  corporations.  Although  the  time  frame  for  this 
chart  is  more  limited  than  the  one  in  the  other  charts  in  this  section,  the  figure  again  suggests  a 


                                                                                                                                                                                                     9 
 
sizeable increase in the globalized nature of world production, followed by a marked decline in the last 
ten  years  or  so.  Still,  the  relative  contribution  of  foreign  affiliates  to  world  output  was  larger  in  2016 
than in 2003. As in the case of the ratio of world trade to world output, the remarkable increase in the 
early 2000s was clearly unsustainable, and the decline in recent years points to a retrenchment in the 
relative  importance  of  GVCs  comparable  in  nature  to  the  evolution  FDI  inflows  in  Chart  4  and  of  the 
share of GVC trade in world trade in Chart 2.8

In sum, Charts 1 through 5 demonstrate that, although one could selectively pick certain measures of 
globalisation  to  argue  that  the  world  economy  has  become  deglobalised  since  the  Great  Recession, 
world  trade  flows  (as  a  percentage  of  world  GDP)  are  close  to  their  alltime  highest  levels,  and  GVC 
and  multinational  firm  activity  appear  to  have  only  retreated  to  their  values  in  the  mid2000s.  I 
conclude  that  the  evidence  at  this  point  is  more  consistent  with  the  notion  of  "slowbalisation"  than 
with that of deglobalisation. Furthermore, in order to elucidate why the process of globalisation might 
have  slowed  down  and  could  potentially  reverse,  these  five  charts  suggest  that  it  is  paramount  to 
study  the  forces  that  fuelled  the  expansionary  phase  of  19862008.  I  turn  to  this  task  in  the  next 
section.

3. The Period of Hyperglobalisation 
This section discusses some potential explanations for the extraordinary growth in global value chain 
activity and international trade flows observed during the late 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s. Although 
many  factors  contributed  to  this  growth,  I  will  highlight  three  particularly  relevant  developments:  (i) 
the  information  and  communication  technology  (ICT)  revolution,  (ii)  an  acceleration  in  the  rate  of 
reduction of trade costs, and especially trade costs associated with manmade trade barriers, and (iii) 
political  developments  that  brought  about  a  remarkable  increase  in  the  share  of  world  population 
participating in the capitalist system. 

3.1  The ICT Revolution 
The 1980s and 1990s witnessed a genuine information and communication technology (ICT) revolution 
that  led  to  a  profound  socioeconomic  transformation  of  the  world  economy.  Intel's  386 
microprocessor,  released  in  1985,  had  275,000  transistors,  achieved  clock  speeds  ranging  from  16  to 
33  MHz,  and  was  viewed  as  a  great  feat  of  engineering.  It  sold  for  about  $300  apiece.  Only  twenty
three  years  later,  in  2008,  Intel  introduced  the  iCore7  microprocessor,  with  featured  731  million 
transistors, a clock speed in excess of 3GHz, and sold at $284 apiece. This not an isolated example. The 
processing  power  and  memory  capacity  of  computers  doubled  approximately  every  two  years,  as 
implied by Moore's law, and confirmed in Chart 6. The almost perfectly linear fit in the graph features 
a  slope  equal  to  0.384,  which  is  extremely  close  to  2 0.347.  Contemporaneously,  the  cost  of 
transmitting a bit of information over an optical network decreased by half roughly every nine months 
(a phenomenon often referred to as Butter's law).

Up  to  the  mid1980s,  most  internet  networks  were  purposebuilt,  i.e.,  they  were  intended  for,  and 
largely restricted to, closed communities of scholars. There was hence little pressure for the individual 
networks  to  be  compatible  and,  indeed,  they  largely  were  not.  International  connections  were 
relatively  rare.  Over  the  following  thirty  years,  the  number  of  internet  users  increased  by  a  factor  of 
600,  from  around  2.5  million  users  in  1990  to  more  than  1.5  billion  users  in  2008  (see  Chart  7),  which 
amounts to a doubling of internet users roughly every two years.

As  a  result  of  these  and  other  technological  developments,  the  cost  of  processing  and  transmitting 
information at long distances fell dramatically during the hyperglobalisation period. The ICT revolution 
was  thus  instrumental  for  firms  in  developed  countries  to  contemplate  the  possibility  of  organizing 
and  managing  production  processes  remotely.  A  salient  example  of  this  phenomenon  is  the 
proliferation  ComputerAided  Design  And  Manufacturing  (or  CAD/CAM),  which  permitted  the  spatial 
separation of design and manufacturing, and has been shown to have led U.S. companies to increase 
their  use  of  contract  manufacturing,  especially  within  the  U.S.,  but  also  in  distant  foreign  countries 
with a high enough availability of skilled workers (see Fort, 2017). 

The following thought experiment provides a final illustration of the transformative nature of the ICT 
revolution.  Try  to  envision  how  the  world  would  have  coped  with  the  current  COVID19  global 
pandemic  without  widespread  access  to  powerful  computers  and  fast  broadband  internet 
connections.  In  case  you  need  some  help,  think  about  how,  despite  all  their  imperfections,  video 
communications technology companies such as Zoom have been instrumental in making it feasible for 

                                                                                                                            12 
 
workers in various types of occupations to work from home. Similarly, note how digital retailers such 
as  Amazon  have  facilitated  social  distancing  practices  by  allowing  individuals  to  purchase  many 
consumption goods from the comfort of their home.  

 
3.2  The Golden Age of Trade Liberalization 

During  the  same  period  19862008,  governments  intensified  their  efforts  to  gradually  dismantle  the 
manmade  trade  barriers that  were  erected  in the 20thcentury's  Interwar  Period.  This  process  dates 
back  to  the  initial  signing  of  the  General  Agreement  on  Tariffs  and  Trade  (GATT)  in  1947,  but  it 
experienced a revitalization in the 1990s and 2000s with the signing of several notable regional trade 
agreements. The European Community granted accession to Spain, Portugal and Greece in 1986, and 
its offspring, the European Union, was later enlarged to include several East European countries in the 
2000s. In the Americas, the early and mid1990s saw the formation of the North American Free Trade 
Area  (NAFTA)  between  the  U.S.,  Canada  and  Mexico,  and  the  Mercosur  trade  bloc  in  the  Southern 
hemisphere. In Asia, the ASEAN free trade agreement of 1992 and its later expansions created a trade 
bloc  of  10  East  Asian  nations.  In  parallel  to  this  process  of  regional  trade  integration,  the  WTO 
continued  its  program  of  multilateral  trade  liberalization  by  lowering  MFN  tariffs  (with  the  Uruguay 
Round concluding in 1994 with the creation of the World Trade Organization) and by granting access 
to new members. In the latter sense, China's accession to the  WTO in 2001  was a particularly historic 
event.  

Chart 8 demonstrates that, as a consequence of this wave of trade agreements, the world's weighted 
average  tariff  applied  on  traded  manufactured  goods  fell  precipitously  from  13.6%  in  1986  to  7.5%  in 
2008.  Interestingly,  this  trend  does  not  appear  to  have  reversed  since  the  Great  Recession,  as  the 
unweighted world average tariff had fallen additionally to 5.2% by 2017. 
 
A noteworthy aspect of the process of trade liberalization is that it not only reduced the average level 
of tariffs, but it also reduced tradepolicy uncertainty due to the binding commitments that countries 
made  when  entering  the  GATT/WTO  or  signing  regional  trade  agreements.  In  other  words,  not  only 
were tariffs reduced on impact, but there was also the general sense that the institutions being put in 
place would be effective in precluding the reinstatement of protective trade measures (see Pierce and 
Schott, 2016, Handley and Limao, 2017).  

Beyond  the  gradual  removal  of  manmade  trade  barriers,  the  1980s  and  1990s  also  witnessed 
technological  developments  that  significantly  reduced  the  quality  and  timeadjusted  costs  of 
transporting goods across countries, in large part due to the increased reliance on air freight shipping 
(see Hummels, 2007). For certain industries (such as the hard disk drive industry), whose value chains 
rely on continuous shipments of parts and components featuring high valuetoweight ratios, the time
saving associated with air shipping effectively constituted a large decline in the cost of organizing their 
value chains at the global level.

3.3  The Spread of Capitalism 
The  third  main  lever  of  GVC  growth  during  the  hyperspecialisation  era  was  institutional  in  nature. 
Political  developments  in  the  world  brought  about  a  remarkable  increase  in  the  share  of  world 
population  that  could  feasibly  participate  in  the  process  of  globalisation.  In  Europe,  prior  to  1989, 
millions of workers in the Eastern part of the continent, many of them highly skilled, waited for better 
economic  opportunities  behind  an  "iron  curtain"  instituted  by  communism  (and  enforced  by  the 
Soviet  Union).  In  China,  the  transition  to  a  socialist  market  economy  only  began  in  1978,  when  Deng 
Xiaoping  introduced  his  program  of  "socialism  with  Chinese  characteristics,"  and  foreign investment 
started  pouring  in  soon  after,  exploding  in  the  1990s.  Similarly,  in  1991,  India  initiated  a  process  of 
economic liberalization that eventually turned the country into a freemarket economy.

Table  1  provides  information  on  the  share  of  world  population  in  1990  accounted  for  by  ten  selected 
countries  that  were  socialist  at  that  point  in  time  and  that  have  become  deeply  ingrained  in  global 
value chains in recent decades. Together, they accounted for to 43.5% of world population in 1990. The 
sheer  size  of  this  labour  force  implies  that,  at  the  same  time  that  firms  in  advanced  economies 
recognized  the  increased  possibility  of  fragmenting  production  across  borders  and  thus  increased 
their demand of "foreign" labour, the capitalist system witnessed a massive labour supply shock that 
permitted Western firms to fulfil their demand without quickly bidding up the price of foreign labour.  

It  should  also  be  pointed  that,  even  in  capitalist  countries,  during  this  period  there  was  a  noticeable 
ideological shift to the right in policy making, as exemplified by Ronald Reagan's presidency in the U.S. 
and Margaret Thatcher three terms as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Thus, not only did former 
communist  and  socialist  countries  embrace  mainstream  capitalist  policies,  but  these  policies 
themselves  became  more  friendly  towards  globalisation,  as  exemplified  by  the  deepening  of  trade 
liberalization  described  in  section  3.2,  but  also  by  a  notable  relaxation  of  currency  convertibility  and 
balance of payments restrictions in several low and middleincome countries. 
 
3.4  Why These Forces Mattered: A Simple Conceptual Framework 
Having  loosely  described  the  potential  relevance  of  the  ICT  revolution,  trade  liberalization,  and  the 
expansion of the "capitalist labour force", I  next develop a simple theoretical framework (building on 
Antràs,  2003,  and  Antràs  and  Helpman,  2004)  to  more  formally  study  the  role  of  these  three 
phenomena in explaining the spectacular increase in the growth of GVCs.  

Imagine  a  simple  world  with  just  two  countries,  an  advanced  West  and  a  developing  East.  We  will 
largely be concerned with how a firm headquarted in the West organizes the production of a certain 
good,  which  is  only  consumed  in  the  West.  For  now,  it  is  assumed  that  production  requires  only  two 
stages  of  production:  (i)  headquarter  services  denoted  by  ;  and  (ii)  manufacturing  production, 
denoted  by  .  We  will  assume  that  these  stages  are  used  in  fixed  proportions,  with  a  unit  of  output 
requiring   units of headquarter services and   units of manufacturing production.  

Headquarter services can in principle be produced in either country, but we shall assume that the West 
has a strong enough comparative advantage in the provision of these services to ensure that they are 
always produced in the West. We denote the marginal cost of headquarter services by  , though this 
variable will not play an important role in the analysis below. 

Manufacturing  production  is  carried  out  by  workers  and  can  be  done  in  either  the  West  or  the  East. 
When done in the West, the firm needs to hire one worker per unit of manufacturing output at a cost 
 . It is assumed that because the other stage of production, headquarter services, is always performed 
in  the  West,  the  firm  need  not  incur  any  additional  marginal  costs,  such  as  shipping  or  trade  taxes 
when manufacturing is also carried out in the West. When producing in the West, the firm thus faces 
an overall marginal cost of production equal to                 .  




                                                                                                                    15 
 
When instead the firm chooses to internationally fragment production by moving the manufacturing 
stage  to  the  East,  the  Western  firm  is  assumed  to  require  hiring    1  workers  per  unit  of 
manufacturing  output  at  a  cost      ,  where    .  In  words,  we  assume  that  workers  in  the  less
developed East command a lower wage, but they are also (weakly) less productive than their Western 
counterparts.  In  addition,  the  firm's  marginal  cost  when  manufacturing  in  the  East  is  inflated  by  ad
valorem  communication  costs    1,  shipping  costs    1,  and  tariffs    1.  When  fragmenting 
production  by  manufacturing  in  the  East,  the  firm  thus  faces  an  overall  marginal  cost  of  production 
equal  to                     .9  This  marginal  cost  will  be  lower  than  the  one  associated  with  the 
whole production process staying in the West whenever 

                                                                
                                                              .                                                        (1) 
 
As  equation  (1)  makes  clear,  the  firm  will  only  be  able  to  reduce  its  marginal  cost  by  offshoring 
whenever Eastern productivityadjusted wages are low, whenever communication costs are low, and 
whenever  transportation  costs  (i.e.,  shipping  costs  and  tariffs)  are  low.  This  equation  thus  illustrates 
very  simply  the  relevance  of  the  ICT  revolution  described  in  section  3.1  (a  reduction  of    )  and  of  the 
reductions  in  trade  costs  documented  in  section  3.2  (indicating  lower  values  for    and    ).10 
Furthermore, it is also natural to interpret the spread of capitalism to Eastern Europe and to Southeast 
Asia  as  the  emergence  of  a  new  "Eastern"  labour  force  offering  lower  unit  labour  costs  (lower 
    to Western firms contemplating offshoring manufacturing production to the East. 

I  have  so  far  focused  on  a  discussion  of  the  marginal  costs  associated  with  different  locations  of 
manufacturing. Yet, distinct global value chain strategies naturally also entail different levels of fixed 
(or  overhead  costs)  associated  with  the  corresponding  location  choices  of  production.11  Let  us  then 
incorporate  fixed  costs  associated  with  setting  up  manufacturing  production  units,  with  the  natural 
assumption that the fixed cost is larger when setting the plant up at a distance (i.e., in the East) than 
in  the  West,  or        ,  where    is  associated  with  domestic  manufacturing  and    with  offshore 
manufacturing.  Antràs,  Fort  and  Tintelnot  (2017)  indeed  estimate  fixed  costs  of  global  sourcing  that 
increase in distance with an elasticity of around 0.2 for U.S. manufacturing firms in 2007. I also assume 
that  the  firm  has  some  degree  of  market  power,  both  because  this  is  a  realistic  assumption  and 
because it will allow firms to cover the fixed costs of production by charging a markup over marginal 
cost. Adopting the monopolistic competition cum loveforvarietyCES preferences that is standard in 
the international trade field, we can express operating profits as a simple function of the marginal cost 
to  a  negative  power  ­  1   ,  where    is  the  price  elasticity  of  demand  faced  by  the  firm.12  The 
condition for the firm to want to offshore manufacturing is now hence given by: 
                                           
9  We are implicitly  assuming  that  the  good  manufactured  in  the East is  shipped back  to  the  West,  where  it  is  combined  with 

headquarter services into final assembly and distribution. It would be straightforward to study the case in which the good is 
instead  assembled  in  the  East,  so  transport  costs  are  instead  associated  with  shipping  headquarter  services  from  the  West 
to the East, and with shipping the final good back to the West. 
10 Note that the ICT revolution also potentially reduced trade costs    due to the role of technology in enhancing the efficiency 

of supplychain management. 
11  As  I  have  emphasized in  my  own  work,  marginal  and fixed  costs  of  production  associated  with  different  configurations of 

global value chains may also be shaped by the organizational decisions of firms, most notably, by whether they internalize or 
not foreign production processes (see Antràs, 2015, for a review). 
12 This formulation originates in the work of Dixit and Stiglitz (1980) and became mainstream in the trade field with the work 



                                                                                                                                        16 
 
                                                                                                                           ,               (2) 

where    is  a  term  associated  with  the  level  of  demand  faced  by  the  firm,  which  is  in  turn  positively 
affected by how much consumers value the firm's output and negatively affected by competition from 
other firms in the industry.  

Equation (2) confirms the role of foreign marginal labour costs, communication costs, and trade costs 
in shaping the profitability of offshoring vis à vis domestic manufacturing. The main novel insight from 
equation (2) is that even when the condition in equation (1) is satisfied, a firm may not find it profitable 
to  offshore  if  the  difference        is  large  and  if  the  scale  of  the  firm  is  not  sufficiently  large.  In 
words,  because  offshoring  entails  higher  scale  economies  than  domestic  production,  it  will  typically 
be a strategy that only sufficiently large firms can profitably sustain.13 

It  is  also  interesting  to  study  a  variant  of  the  model  in  which  the  production  process  entails  several 
production  stages  rather  than  just  two.  In  particular,  imagine  that  manufacturing  production 
encompasses    distinct  production  stages,  each  leading  to  a  distinct  component,  with  the   
components  then  combined  with  headquarter  services  to  assemble  the  final  good  in  the  West.  The 
firm  now  faces  the  choice  of  whether  to  offshore  or  produce  domestically  each  of  these   
components.  Assuming  that  final  good  production  entails     units  of  headquarter  services  and    
units  of  each  of  the  manufacturing  components   1, ... ,  we  can  express  profits  of  a  given  global 
value chain strategy as: 

                                                                                                                                           (3) 
 
In this expression,   is an indicator function taking a value of 1 when component   is offshored, and 
a value of 0 when it is sourced domestically. Note also that we allow crossinput heterogeneity in the 
extent  to  which  transport  costs  and  communication  technologies  affect  the  productivity  of  foreign 
labour versus domestic labour.  

As Antràs, Fort and Tintelnot (2017) stress, this multiinput variant of the model illustrates the presence 
of  interesting  complementarities  in  the  global  sourcing  strategies  of  firms.  Technically, 
whenever            ,  the  profit  function  in  (3)  features  increasing  differences  in  (1 , 1 )  for  all 
,   1, . . . ,    and  .  This  result  in turn  implies  that  the  marginal benefit  (in terms  of  firm profits) 
of  offshoring  any  component    can  only  be  increased  by  the  decision  of  the  firm  to  offshore  some 
other component  .14 Intuitively, whenever offshoring reduces marginal costs, firms will increase their 
optimal  scale  of  operation,  and  this  will  put  them  in  a  better  position  to  amortize  the  fixed  costs 
associated  with  further  investments  in  offshoring.  This  result  provides  an  amplification  mechanism 

                                             
of Krugman (1980) and Melitz (2003), among many others. 
13  Although  the  residual  demand  level     is  endogenous  to  the  industry  equilibrium  associated  with  the  model,  its 

determination would  not undo  the comparative  statics described above.  For  instance,  when all firms are identical, it is easy 
to  invoke  a  freeentry  condition  to  show  that  all  firms  will  offshore  when              is  sufficiently  low,  and  they  will  all 
manufacture domestically when this composite foreign cost term is high. 
14 Clearly, if               no firm would find it profitable to offshore that component  , so the result is irrelevant for that 
set of inputs.  

                                                                                                                                           17 
 
that  helps  explain,  for  instance,  the  magnified  response  of  gross  trade  flows  to  observed  changes  in 
trade  costs  (see  also,  Yi,  2003).  It  is  also  consistent  with  the  notion  that  the  combination  of 
improvements  in  communication  technologies,  trade  liberalization  and  the  adoption  of  market 
economy practices in socialist countries produced a combined effect on the geography of worldwide 
production that was larger than the sum of the individual effects that these forces would have had in 
isolation.15 

Another implication of introducing fixed costs of offshoring is that they naturally lead to rationalisation 
in  the  global  sourcing  strategies  of  firms.  Although  firms  would  prefer  to  rely  on  several  suppliers  to 
obtain a given component ­ both for diversification purposes as well as to extract a more favourable 
price  ­,  in  practice  multisourcing  involves  fixed  costs  that  are  too  large  for  most  firms  to  bear  (see 
Antràs, Fort and Tintelnot, 2017). 

I close this section with a final extension of the model, inspired by the work  of Antràs and de Gortari 
(2020),  that  illustrates  the  relevance  of  the  sequential  nature  of  production  in  many  GVCs.  I  again 
consider  the  case  of  multiple  manufacturing  components,  but  I  now  assume  that  they  need  to  be 
produced in a deterministic order dictated by engineering constraints. At each stage, the producer of 
that  stage's  component  combines  labour  and  the  good  produced  up  to  the  prior  stage  in  fixed 
proportions.  For  simplicity,  I  assume that  there  are  only  two  components   1  and   2,  that there 
are no frictions to communication nor any shipping costs across countries (so     1), and that the 
inputs  are  fully  symmetric  except  for  their  position  in  the  GVC.  In  terms  of  its  location  decisions,  the 
firm  thus  only  decides  whether  to  offshore  component  1,  component  2,  both,  or  neither.  The  profit 
function  associated  with  each  of  these  potential  global  sourcing  strategies  can  be  compactly 
expressed as: 
 
                                                1       1                                                           1      

                              2                                
 
Note that the third marginal cost term associated with the second stage is unchanged relative to the 
case of multiple (but nonsequential) components, but the one associated with the first stage is more 
involved. The reason for this is that profits not only depend on production costs, but also on the total 
transport  costs  associated  with  each  particular  path  of  the  global  value  chain.  To  demonstrate  the 
implications of this feature, notice that if stage 2 is produced in the West ( 0 , then the first stage 
will  be  offshored  to  the  East  only  if    /  ,  while  if  stage  2  is  produced  in  the  East  (1 1 ,  the 
first  stage  will  be  offshored  to  the  East  only  if      .  The  latter  is  obviously  a  weaker  condition 
than the former. In sum, trade costs and sequentiality of production give rise to complementarities in 
the  colocation  of  inputs  that  may  again  lead  to  interesting  interdependencies  across  the  offshoring 


                                            
15  The  above  complementarity  relies  on  the  degree  of  substitution  of  inputs  being  low  relative  to  the  elasticity  of  demand 

faced  by  the  firm.  This  condition  is  naturally  met  when  inputs  are  perfect  complements,  as  in  the  simple  model  above,  but 
the  result  generalizes  to  higher degrees  of  input  substitutability  and  is  consistent  with  empirical  evidence  (see  Antràs,  Fort 
and Tintelnot, 2017). 

                                                                                                                                          18 
 
decisions of firms, with the potential to explain the remarkable growth in offshoring during the period 
of hyperspecialisation (see also Baldwin and Venables, 2013). 

As mentioned in section 3.3, the hyperglobalisation of the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s brought about 
not only an accelerated process of trade liberalization but also a relaxation of constraints to the free 
mobility  of  capital  across  countries.  It  is  natural  to  imagine  that  this  mechanism  also  contributed  to 
the  growth  of  offshoring  by  reducing  the  cost  of  capital  in  countries  that  were  eager  to  host  GVC 
activity.  Although  it  would  be  straightforward  to  add  physical  capital  into  the  model  to  capture  this 
force,  the  static  framework  developed  above  is  admittedly  too  crude  to  capture  the  role  of  financial 
capital flows on GVC activity. 
 
4. DeGlobalisation and Technological Factors  
Having developed a better understanding of some of the key forces that led to the process of hyper
globalisation of the late 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s, I next turn to assessing why these factors might 
have  run  out  of  steam  in  the  last  ten  years,  and  more  importantly,  to  speculating  on  the  extent  to 
which they might be reversible. This section will focus on technological factors, while sections 5 and 6 
will cover other longterm factors and political/institutional factors, respectively. 
 
4.1  Is the ICT Revolution Over? 
As  discussed  in  section  3.1,  the  hyperglobalisation  period  witnessed  the  advent  of  a  series  of 
technological  developments  that  revolutionized  manufacturing  and  facilitated  the  fragmentation  of 
production across countries. Is the slowdown in world trade associated with a slowdown in the pace 
of technological progress? I do not intend to provide a thoroughly researched answer to this question, 
but  the  almost  perfect  fit  in  Chart  6  up  to  2018  is  highly  suggestive  that  the  pace  of  technological 
progress  in  semiconductors  has  not  slowed  down.  Furthermore,  we  continue  to  witness  ever 
increasing  speeds  of  information  transmission  over  fiber  optic  cables.  Nevertheless,  it  also  seems 
intuitive  that  the  marginal  benefit  of  these  innovations  for  the  international  organization  of 
production  might  have  reached  diminishing  returns.  Being  able  to  transmit  information  at  long 
distances  was  crucial  at  the  onset  of  the  phenomenon,  but  once  the  internet  achieved  high  enough 
speeds  to  sustain  smooth  communication  of  international  production  teams  (e.g.,  via 
videoconferences),  the  return  to  further  improvements  in  these  technologies  is  likely  to  have  gone 
down. Similarly, it is also important to point out that the amount of R&D spending required to sustain 
Moore's Law is much higher today than it was in the 1970s and 1980s (see Bloom et al., 2020).  

Chart 7 is also revealing in this respect. Although the diffusion of the internet has still a long way to go 
(the World Development Indicators estimates that only 49% of the world population used the internet 
in 2017), this Chart shows that the rate of increase of internet adoption has significantly slowed down 
in  recent  years,  as  one  would  have  expected  from  the  fact  that  this  share  cannot  possibly  be  higher 
than 100%.

4.2  A New Technological Revolution?  
Perhaps the key drivers of the ICT Revolution might have slowed down over time, but a more intriguing 
possibility  relates  to  the  extent  to  which  new  technologies  that  have  become  widespread  in  recent 
years might prove to be more conducive to deglobalisation than the technologies that fuelled the ICT 
Revolution. 

The  example  of  industrial  automation  and  robotics  is  a  case  in  point.  At  first  glance,  automation 
constitutes an alternative to offshoring for firms in advanced economies seeking to lower their labour 
costs.  Because  automation  and  offshoring  appear  to  be  substitutes,  one  would  then  expect 
improvements  in  automation  to  lead  to  an  increasing  amount  of  reshoring  over  time.  Furthermore, 
large multinational companies typically design their production processes with their domestic market 
factor  prices  in  mind,  so  even  when  they  engage  in  offshoring,  they  might  set  up  manufacturing 
processes  involving  large  amounts  of  automation  in  their  host  countries  (see  Rodrik,  2018).  This 
phenomenon  is  particularly  concerning  for  less  developed  economies,  which  might  view  automation 
as a threat to their ability to leverage their cheap labour to get a foot in the door of GVCs. 

Nevertheless,  the  substitutability  between  automation  and  offshoring  is  much  less  clearcut  in 
practice.  Automation  by  firms  in  advanced  economies  tends  to  decrease  their  costs,  enhance  their 
productivity and increase their optimal scale, thereby increasing their demand for intermediate inputs, 
many of which continue to be sourced from less developed economies. Whether automation increases 
or  reduces  the  extent  to  which  firms  in  less  developed  economies  participate  in  GVCs  is  thus  an 
empirical  matter.  Artuc  et  al.  (2018)  and  the  World  Development  Report  (2020,  Chapter  6)  present 
industrylevel  evidence  suggesting  that  automation  in  industrial  countries  appears  to  have,  in  fact, 
boosted  imports  from  developing  countries.  In  more  recent  work,  Stapleton  and  Webb  (2020)  have 
confirmed these findings with much richer firmlevel data from  Spain, while  Wang (2020) is currently 
exploring the same mechanism using detailed U.S. Census data. 

Conveniently,  it  is  relatively  straightforward  to  illustrate  the  potential  complementarity  between 
automation  and offshoring with the conceptual framework developed in section 3.4 (see also Wang, 
2020).  In  particular,  consider  the  version  of  the  model  with  multiple  inputs  and  nonsequential 
production,  but  now  expand  the  range  of  strategies  available  to  firms  by  giving  them  access  to  the 
possibility of automating stage   at a fixed cost            , which allows manufacturing of stage   in the 
West at cost          . With this assumption, the profit function of Western firms becomes 
 

                                                                                                              


                                                                     . 

 
In this expression,  is an indicator function taking a value of 1 when component   is automated and 
0  otherwise.  Focusing  on  a  particular  component  i,  it  is  clear  that  the  new  possibility  of  automation 
reduces the range of parameter values for which offshoring will be optimal. But because automating 

                                                                                                                  20 
 
component i reduces marginal costs and thus increases the optimal scale of the firm, it is also the case 
that the probability that offshoremanufacturing dominates nonautomated domestic manufacturing 
is  increased  for  components  satisfying            .  In  sum,  automation  of  certain  stages  of 
production may well increase the demand for offshore components that are harder to automate, and 
may well increase the propensity to offshore manufacturing at the firm level, in line with the findings 
of Artuc et al. (2018) and Stapleton and Webb (2020). 

Automation  is  often  associated  with  industrial  robots,  but  there  has  recently  been  a  more  focused 
debate  on  the  role  of  3D  printing  in  fuelling  deglobalisation.  The  mechanisms  at  play  here  are  very 
much  similar  to  those  applying  to  automation  more  broadly.  The  direct  tradereducing  effects  of  3D 
printing  are  obvious,  but  one  should  also  take  into  account  the  positive  effect  of  this  innovation  on 
productivity  and  thus  input  demand,  and  the  fact  that  3D  printers  do  not  print  goods  out  of  thin  air. 
Indeed,  the  relevance  of  this  scale  mechanism  is  consistent  with  the  findings  of  Freund  et  al.  (2018), 
who  show  that  the  dramatic  shift  of  production  of  hearing  aids  from  standard  manufacturing  to  3D 
printing increased international trade in hearing aids by roughly 60 percent. 

Having discussed the role of automation, I next speculate on the consequences for global value chains 
of  the  advent  of  an  array  of  new  technologies,  that  though  being  the  natural  offspring  of  the  set  of 
innovations  that  triggered  the  ICT  revolution,  have  some  distinctive  features  that  might  make  them 
particularly prone to fostering a new wave of hyperglobalisation in coming years. 

Consider  first  the  case  of  digital  technologies.  It  is  clear  that  global  value  chains  are  rapidly  changing 
under  the  pressure  of  digital  innovation.  First  and  foremost,  digital  technologies  encourage  GVC 
participation  by  reducing  many  of  the  barriers  that  firms  face  when  attempting  to  join  GVCs.  For 
instance,  digital  platforms  (such  as  Amazon,  Alibaba  or  Mercado  Libre)  facilitate  the  matching  of 
buyers and sellers, thus reducing the initial fixed costs associated with GVC participation.16 Extending 
access  to  highspeed  internet  and  expanding  ecommerce  thus  has  the  potential  to  greatly  facilitate 
increased  GVC  participation  by  relatively  small  firms,  and  also  for  firms  in  countries  with  bad 
infrastructure  (which  now  gain  the  ability  to  specialize  in  segments  of  global  value  chains  related  to 
the  provision  of  services  via  digital  technologies  rather  than  the  provision  of  physical  goods  via 
transport infrastructure). These same technologies also enhance the management of inventories, and 
of logistics more broadly, thereby improving participation even in manufacturing segments of GVCs. 

Furthermore,  rating  systems  in  digital  platforms  and  open  distributed  ledgers  (such  as  blockchain) 
enhance verification and monitoring in firmtofirm relationships, thus reducing informational frictions 
and  opening  the  door  for  countries  with  weak  institutions  to  bypass  a  key  factor  limiting  their 
participation in GVCs. Similarly, in situations in which language barriers remain significant (e.g., in the 
provision  of  certain  services),  the  application  of  artificial  intelligence,  big  data  and  machine  learning 
techniques has the potential to provide much more efficient translation services (see Brynjolfsson et 
al.,  2019).  In  sum,  it  does  not  seem  particularly  improbable  that  the  unstoppable  advance  of  digital 
technologies might provide a new tailwind to ensure the continuing growth in GVC activity worldwide.

Despite  my  somewhat  optimistic  take  on  the  role  of  technology  in  continuing  to  promote 
globalisation,  I  should  point  out  that  many  of  the  technologies  I  have  described  above  are  "General 
Purpose  Technologies",  and  these  type  of  technologies  throw  a  long  shadow  on  economic  activity, 
with their full impact taking many years to materialize (see Helpman, 1998). We should thus treat the 
available empirical evidence as tentative at best. 
 
4.3  Sunk Costs and the Stickiness of Global Value Chains 
I conclude this section with a more conceptual and focused discussion of the role of scale economies 
in shaping the short to mediumterm response of global value chains to shocks to the world economy. 
This framework will be of particular relevance for the discussion of the consequences of the COVID19 
health  crisis  in  section  7,  but  since  it  centres  on  the  role  of  technological  aspects  of  GVCs,  it  seems 
natural to develop the arguments here. 

The main conceptual point I will make is that many of the fixed costs associated with organizing global 
value chains are sunk in nature, and that this has very significant implications for how GVCs should be 
expected  to  react  to  shocks  to  the  world  economy.  To  better  understand  this,  consider  the  type  of 
investments that a firm needs to carry out before being able to source parts, components and services 
from  a  producer  in  a  foreign  country.  First  of  all,  it  needs  to  gather  information  on  a  set  of  potential 
suitable  suppliers  in  that  country,  or  in  the  case  of  greenfield  investment,  it  needs  to  figure  out  a 
suitable  location  for  a  new  plant.  Next,  the  firm  and  its  supplier  need  to  invest  in  physical  assets  (a 
factory,  specialized  equipment  capital,  etc.)  that  are  often  customized  to  the  needs  of  both  parties. 
Finally,  in  an  environment  with  imperfect  contracting,  the  firm  and  its  supplier  will  need  to  invest  in 
"relational" capital, to ensure that the perceived contractual security of all agents in the transaction is 
sufficiently  high.  These  costs  are  nontrivial,  they  are  largely  fixed  in  nature,  and  they  are  likely  to  be 
larger  for  more  distant  buyerseller  relationships.  Furthermore,  and  crucially  for  the  purposes  of  this 
section,  these  costs  are  likely  to  be  sunk  in  nature:  relationshipspecific  physical  assets  are  not  easily 
sold or redeployed, while relational capital and search costs are naturally forfeited when abandoning 
a relationship or a host country altogether. 

The  key  implication  of  the  sunk  nature  of  many  fixed  costs  of  production  in  GVCs  is  that  the  exante 
decision  to  offshore  parts  of  the  production  process  is  not  equivalent  to  the  expost  decision  to 
reshore  these  same  stages.  More  precisely,  in  terms  of  the  simple  conceptual  framework  developed 
in  section  3.4,  exante,  when  first  deciding  on  how  to  organize  production,  offshoring  is  a  relatively 
high  fixed  cost  of  option  (      ),  so  it  will  only  be  chosen  if  it  is  sufficiently  more  profitable  than 
domestic sourcing. This is a fortiori true if, at the point at which the firm is contemplating the possibility 
to offshore, it is already manufacturing in the West, and would thus forfeit the sunk cost   if it chose 
to offshore. Nevertheless, expost, when the firm has already set up a global network of suppliers, the 
fixed  cost   is  sunk,  while  reshoring  is  likely  to  require  significant  additional  fixed  costs,  at  the  very 
least to set up new factories that can carry out the production processes that had been offshored up 
to that point in time. 

We  can  easily  illustrate  this  result  in  the  simplest  version  of  our  model  in  section  3.4,  when 
manufacturing  only  entails  a  single  process  or  component.  Assume  further  that  there  are  only  two 

                                                                                                                        22 
 
periods,  0 (exante) and  1 (expost), and that fixed costs are fully sunk. As in section 3.4, the 
condition for the firm to find offshoring profitable in the first period is given in equation (2), but in the 
second period, this condition becomes  
 
                                                                                             ,              (4) 
 
where   takes a value of 1 if the firm chose to offshore in the first period, and a value of 0 otherwise. 
Clearly  domestic  manufacturing  (reshoring)  will  require  a  much  higher  erosion  of  foreign 
competitiveness expost than exante. 

Equation  (4)  was  derived  under  the  simplifying  assumption  that  there  are  only  two  periods.  It  is, 
however, straightforward (and illuminating!) to consider an extension of the framework in which the 
firm  anticipates  that  the  operating  profits  associated  with  domestic  sourcing  and  offshoring  will 
remain  unaltered  during  T  periods  after  period  1.  In  such  a  case,  we  can  rewrite  the  secondperiod 
condition for offshoring to be profitable as 
 
                                                          1                                                     1 
                                                                                                                           
                                                          1                                                     1 
 
where   is the rate at which the firm discounts future cash flows, and where   again takes a value of 
1  if  the  firm  is  currently  offshoring  to  the  East,  and  0  if  it  is  manufacturing  domestically  in  the  West. 
The obvious implication of this condition is that the larger is T, the lower the weight the firm will put 
on sunk costs. Or in other words, the less persistent shocks to profitability are expected to be, the less 
likely will be the probability that the geography of value chains will be affected by shocks.  

Equation (4) also imposed the restriction that there is only one manufacturing process to be offshored 
or  not.  As  described  in  section  3.4,  with  multiple  production  stages,  there  are  natural 
interdependencies  in  the  sourcing  decisions  associated  with  distinct  components,  with  those 
interdependencies  being  particularly  rich  when  global  value  chains  are  sequential  in  nature.  How  do 
these features shape the incentives to reshore manufacturing process to the West in the presence of 
a negative shock to competitiveness in the East? The complementarities identified in section 3.4 would 
appear  to  suggest  that,  in  the  same  manner  that  there  could  be  "waves  of  offshoring"  during  the 
hyperglobalisation  era,  a  decrease  in  the  relative  competitiveness  associated  with  offshoring  might 
lead to a "wave of reshoring" and an accelerated deglobalisation.  

Matters  are,  however,  not  so  straightforward  when  fixed  costs  are  sunk  in  nature.  In  that  case, 
remember that reshoring a particular stage will necessarily entail higher fixed costs than when the firm 
sticks to offshoring. Thus, for reshoring of one component to foster reshoring of other components, 
it  needs  to  be  the  case  that  the  change  in  relative  competitiveness  that  made  that  original  reshoring 
decision profitable in turn reduces the firm's marginal cost of production, and thus increases optimal 
scale.  This  is  likely  to  apply  to  situations  in  which  the  firm  automates  a  particular  stage  (therefore 
decreasing the marginal cost associated with manufacturing in the West), but it will typically not apply 
to  situations  in  which  reshoring  is  the  response  to  wage  increases  in  the  East  or  to  increased  trade 
barriers  (which  I  will  discuss  in  sections  5  and  6,  respectively).  In  the  latter  cases,  reshoring  may  be 

                                                                                                                         23 
 
profitable even when it increases the marginal cost of production, but such a decision will make it less 
likely that the firm will reshore other parts of production that are currently offshored and that do not 
face the same type of losses in competitiveness. 

With sequential production, reshoring decisions are interdependent in additionally complex manners. 
As I demonstrated in section 3.4, firms have an incentive to colocate contiguous production stages to 
minimize  trade  costs,  but  in  an  environment  in  which  the  firm  is  offshoring  various  stages  of 
production,  it  may  make  it  particularly  costly  for  the  firm  to  reshore  some  stages  of  production  but 
not others (due to increase crosshauling of parts  and components between the East and the West), 
particularly when the fixed costs of reshoring are too large for the firm to be able to reshore the entire 
production process. 

The above arguments are somewhat abstract, but they connect with a body of empirical work that has 
documented  the  sticky  nature  of  global  value  chains.  This  literature  has  further  associated  this 
stickiness with the sunk nature of many of the investments made by firms organizing their value chains 
globally, especially in circumstances in which the imperfect enforceability of international contracting 
leads firms to invest in nontangible forms of capital, such as reputational capital. For instance, building 
on ideas related to those exposited above, Martin et al. (2019), construct a measure of what they call 
"relationship  stickiness"  using  detailed  firmtofirm  export  data  from  France.  More  specifically,  they 
measure the duration of individual buyerseller relationships in French trade statistics and estimate the 
average duration for more than 4,000 HS6 products. Their measure is positively correlated with widely 
used measures of relationshipspecificity and contract complexity, such as the Rauch (1999) and Nunn 
(2007)  measures.  In  related  work,  Monarch  (2020)  and  Monarch  and  SchmidtEisenlohr  (2020)  have 
documented a remarkable degree of persistence in buyerseller links in U.S. trade: 80 percent of U.S. 
imports  occur  in  preexisting  firmtofirm  relationships,  and  Monarch  and  SchmidtEisenlohr  (2020) 
structurally estimate that the value of longterm relationships is substantially higher than that of new 
relationships.  Relatedly,  Fillat  and  Garetto  (2015)  argue  that  the  stickiness  associated  with  the  large 
sunk costs inherent in multinational activity and GVCs explains the fact that multinational corporations 
exhibit significantly higher stock market returns and earning yields than nonmultinational firms. 

An interesting case study ­ and a particularly relevant one when assessing the potential consequences 
of  the  COVID19  pandemic  for  the  future  of  GVCs  ­  is  the  reaction  of  world  trade  flows  to  the  Great 
Recession of 200809. As is visible to the naked eye in Chart 1, right at the onset of the Great Recession, 
world trade experienced a collapse that far exceeded in magnitude the observed drop in world GDP, 
with a subsequent very rapid, Vshaped recovery. What explains that quick recovery? 

The answer is found in a series of studies that have documented that the bulk of the "Trade Collapse" 
was  at  the  intensive  rather  than  the  extensive  margin.  This  is  illustrated  in  Chart  9,  borrowed  from 
Bricongne  et  al.  (2012),  which  indicates  that  the  Trade  Collapse  did  not  significantly  impact  the 
evolution of the number of exporters in France (which was already on a mild downward trend), while 
the  total  volume  exports  fell  quite  dramatically  during  this  period,  following  more  than  four  years  of 
steady growth. Overall, Bricogne et al. (2012) conclude that the extensive margin accounted for slightly 
over 20% of the trade collapse, a result that they ascribe to the fact that export entry costs "had already 
been incurred". Behrens et al. (2014) found even starker results for Belgium, where more than 97% of 

                                                                                                                  24 
 
the  adjustment  for  both  exports  and  imports  was  at  the  intensive  margin,  while  Hadad  et  al.  (2010) 
also  document  very  muted  responses  of  the  extensive  margin  when  using  productlevel  (not  firm
level)  information  on  imports  by  Brazil,  the  European  Union,  Indonesia,  and  the  United  States.17  One 
might  worry  that  these  patterns  were  driven  by  the  special  nature  of  the  Global  Financial  Crisis,  but 
the findings of Bernard et al. (2009) suggest the external validity of these findings, as they document 
similar patterns in U.S. exports to and U.S. imports from several Asian countries during the 1997 Asian 
Financial Crisis.

In sum, the stickiness of the extensive margin of trade was instrumental in permitting a swift recovery 
from the  Trade Collapse. Once the crisis subsided, exporters and importers did not need to incur the 
large investments that would have been required to reinstate any broken links, so activity could quickly 
pick up. 

Although  these  findings  suggest  that  global  value  chains  are  remarkably  resilient  to  shocks,  an 
important  caveat  with  these  studies  is  that  they  do  not  focus  on  the  resiliency  of  firmtofirm 
transactions. In that respect, a more relevant contribution is the work of Huneeus (2018), who studies

response to larger shocks. Despite the fact that large shocks have the potential to lead to significant 
reorganizations  of  production,  the  evidence  from  the  Asian  Financial  Crisis  and  the  Trade  Collapse 
indicates  that  even  very  sizeable  global  shocks  have  been  associated  with  very  fast  recoveries.  The 
preliminary  evidence  I  will  present  in  section  7  related  to  the  COVID19  crisis  is  consistent  with  this 
conclusion.  
 
5. DeGlobalisation, Cost Convergence and Other LongTerm Factors 
Having  discussed  technological  factors  in  the  last  section,  I  now  turn  to  studying  other  longterm 
factors that may contribute to a future stagnation of globalisation. I will begin by reviewing the often
mentioned convergence hypothesis, indicating that higher wage growth in less developed economies 
relative  to  advanced  economies  has  eroded  the  competitiveness  of  the  former  set  of  countries  as 
hosts  of  GVC  activity.  Competitiveness,  however,  is  a  function  of  productivity  as  much  as  of  factor 
costs,  so  in  section  5.2,  I  will  turn  to  discussing  technology  diffusion  and  how  it  may  impact 
globalisation.  Finally,  in  section  5.3,  I  will  analyse  other  longrun  factors  related  to  structural 
transformation. 
 
5.1.  Wage Convergence 
As explained in section 3.3, the transition of many countries from inwardlooking socialism or outright 
communism to market capitalism constituted a massive labour supply shock from the point of view of 
firms in advanced countries, as a large pool of lowpaid, skilledlabour force became available for these 
firms to hire. At some level, it is evident that this shock was unique and will not be repeated any time 
soon.  Although  there  are  certainly  many  countries  in  the  world  that  are  still  not  fully  integrated  into 
GVCs,  they  do  not  account  for  as  large  a  share  of  world  population  as  the  countries  listed  in  Table  1, 
and more importantly, they are not as skilledlabourabundant as the countries in that list are.  

At  the  same  time,  the  increased  labour  demand  sustained  over  a  period  of  thirty  years  has  gradually 
put  upward  pressure  on  the  wages  of  countries  that  are  recipients  of  GVC  activity,  thus  naturally 
eroding the competitiveness of many of these economies. This is visible in Chart 10, where we see that 
unit  labour  costs  in  manufacturing  have  grown  much  faster  in  China  than  in  other  countries,  despite 
the marked increase in labour productivity experienced by that country since 1990. More specifically, 
the figure plots an index of unit labour costs expressed in U.S. dollars for China, Germany, Mexico and 
the  United  States.  The  index  demonstrates  that,  since  1990,  Chinese  unit  labour  costs  have  grown 
about 2.5 times as fast as those in Germany and the United States. Conversely, the figure shows that 
despite being host to a significant amount of GVC activity, Mexican unit labour costs have not grown 
significantly  faster  than  in  the  United  States  or  Germany.  As  a  result,  many  manufacturing  processes 
continue to be much cheaper to undertake in Mexico than in the U.S.  

Mexico  is,  however,  largely  an  exception.  Many  developing  countries  have  experienced  wage 
pressures  similar  to  those  in  China,  and  thus  there  is  now  a  lower  incentive  to  move  simple 
manufacturing  production  processes  offshore  than  there  was  in  the  late  1980s  and  1990s.  Likewise, 
there  is  now  a  higher  incentive  to  reshore  processes  that  are  no  longer  performed  at  significantly 

                                                                                                                      26 
 
lower  cost  abroad.  Will  cost  convergence  then  lead  to  deglobalisation?  It  is  evident  that  it  will  be  a 
contributing force, but as highlighted in section 4.3, there is a natural asymmetric response of firms to 
relative costs shocks depending on whether they are already engaged in GVC activity or whether they 
have  never  offshored  before.  More  specifically,  in  the  presence  of  sunk  cost  of  offshoring,  the  latter 
type of firms will need to perceive large and persistent losses of competitiveness to decide to reshore. 
In  other  words,  even  if  relative  costs  shocks  (perhaps  due  to  exchange  rate  movements)  appear  to 
make  production  in  a  particular  location  unprofitable,  it  is  not  obvious  that  firms  in  advanced 
economies  will  want  to  relocate  production  right  away.  Instead,  only  when  relative  cost  trends  are 
viewed to be secular trends will firms give serious thought to abandoning locations that have become 
prohibitively expensive.

Importantly,  even  when  firms  decide  to  abandon  production  in  certain  countries  that  have  lost 
comparative advantage in the processes firms used to undertake there, this does not necessarily imply 
that  these  processes  will  be  reshored  to  these  firms'  domestic  economies.  This  is  exemplified  by  the 
fact that a significant amount of GVC activity that used to be carried out in China has already migrated 
to lowerwage countries in South East Asia. 

Finally,  it  is  also  worth  remembering  that  the  bulk  of  multinational  firm  activity  takes  place  between 
countries  with  similar  relative  factor  endowments  and  factor  prices.  The  common  consensus  a  few 
years  ago  was  that  this  reflected  the  dominance  of  marketseeking  (or  horizontal)  FDI  in  overall 
multinational  activity  (see  Carr  et  al.,  2001,  Blonigen  et  al.,  2003).  Nevertheless,  work  by  Alfaro  and 
Charlton  (2009)  challenged  this  view  and  demonstrated  that  most  FDI  flows  between  advanced 
economies  have  a  vertical  (inputoutput)  dimension  to  them.  At  some  level,  this  should  not  be  too 

                                                                                                                    27 
 
surprising. The gains from specialization do not rely solely on factor price differences across countries, 
but  can  also  stem  from  idiosyncratic  crosscountry  differences  in  productivity  in  different  goods,  as 
the  classical  Ricardian  model  of  trade  beautifully  illustrates.  In  that  sense,  the  possibility  of 
fragmenting production across borders gives rise to a finer international division of labour and greater 
gains from specialization: GVCs allow resources to flow to their most productive use, not only across 
countries and sectors, but also within  sectors across stages of production.  A suitable example of the 
prevalence  of  fragmentation  of  production  between  relatively  similar  countries  is  Boeing's  global 
production of the 787, which entails 70 percent of its parts being sourced from 50 suppliers located in 
8  developed  economies  other  than  the  United  States  (Japan,  Italy,  South  Korea,  France,  Sweden, 
Canada,  United  Kingdom,  and  Australia).  To  sum  up,  there  are  good  reasons  to  believe  that 
convergence  in  factor  prices  and  in  production  costs  across  countries  may  not  necessarily  translate 
into a degobalisation of the world economy. 
 
5.2  Technology Transfer 

Despite  the  growth  in  manufacturing  unit  labour  costs  in  China,  Chinese  labour  productivity  has 
increased dramatically since 1990.18 This has allowed firms in the West to continue to find that country 
a suitable location of production for many industrial processes. Yet, Chinese technological absorption 
has  also  generated  a  fair  amount  of  anxiety  in  advanced  economies,  as  is  exemplified  by  President's 
Trump's frontal opposition to China's quid pro quo policy ­ a policy that makes technology transfer a 
precondition for foreign firms to be able to operate in China. I will offer some brief thoughts below on 
the  specifics  of  the  U.S.­China  technology  war,  but  I  will  first  consider  more  broadly  the  effects  that 
technology transfer may have on the future of globalisation. 

Should  advanced  economies  fear  the  technological  advance  of  less  developed  economies?  Will  it 
undermine  the  future  of  globalisation?  Although  focused  on  somewhat  distinct  aspects,  these  two 
questions are at least partly intertwined. To see this, and relying on the classical analysis of technology 
transfer  in  neoclassical  trade  theory  (see  Johnson,  1955),  it  is  well  known  that  technological 
improvements in foreign countries are typically beneficial for a specific country. The only exception is 
whenever  foreign  countries  improve  upon  technologies  related  to  goods  for  which  that  specific 
country  had  comparative  advantage  before  the  technological  catchup.  The  reason  for  this  is  that  in 
those  situations,  productivity  growth  abroad  worsens  the  specific  country's  terms  of  trade.  The  flip 
side of this effect is that such a form of technology transfer erodes the gains from specialisation and 
reduces  gross  trade  flows  across  countries.  In  sum,  technological  change  abroad  is  detrimental  to 
advanced countries precisely when it leads to deglobalisation. 

The  mid  2000s  witnessed  a  heated  debate  ­  involving  the  almost  nonagenarian  Paul  Samuelson  and 
Jagdish Bhagwati and coauthors ­ concerning the extent to which offshoring by U.S. companies had 
fuelled  exportbiased  technological  change  by  lessdeveloped  economies.  Samuelson  (2004)  argued 
that  this  was  a  theoretical  possibility  and  offered  a  carefully  chosen  numerical  example  in  which 
offshoringinduced productivity growth in China completed kills off trade between the U.S. and China! 

                                          
18  The  same  Conference  Board  International  Labour  Comparisons  Program  data  used  in  Chart  10  indicates  that  real  value 

added per employed person was almost 14 times larger in 2018 than in 1990 (link). 

                                                                                                                                   28 
 
Bhagwati  et  al.  (2004)  admitted  the  theoretical  argument,  but  argued  that  the  phenomenon  of 
offshoring  should  be  better  thought  as  one  in  which  processes  that  in  the  past  had  not  been  able  to 
be  sliced  across  countries,  suddenly  became  tradable,  thereby  improving  welfare  worldwide.  As 
stimulating  as  this  debate  was,  and  as  pointed  out  by  Dixit  and  Grossman  (2005),  there  was  no 
evidence that the U.S. terms of trade had deteriorated significantly, so the debate faded as quickly as 
it had flared up. 

Anxiety  over  technological  advancement  in  China  has  erupted  again  in  recent  years,  with  many 
governments  in  advanced  economies  demanding  that  China  take  a  tougher  stance  on  intellectual 
property rights (IPR) protection. President Trump has been particularly forceful about this, criticizing 
the Chinese quid pro quo policy and specifically targeting certain Chinese companies (such as Huawei, 
WeChat  or  TikTok)  with  specific  restrictions  or  bans.  What  is  the  likely  effect  of  these  demands  for 
stronger IPR protection? Will they lead to more reshoring and contribute to a deglobalized world? 

In  order  to  answer  this  question,  it  is  worth  pausing  to  carefully  delineate  the  precise  role  for 
government  intervention  in  this  particular  situation.19  When  an  American  firm  willingly  forms  a  joint 
venture  with  a  Chinese  firm,  what  externality  is  the  U.S.  company  not  internalizing?  Presumably,  the 
company  understands  that  because  IPR  protection  in  China  is  not  as  strong  as  in  the  United  States, 
that  joint  venture  increases  their  risk  of  the  technologies  they  share  with  their  Chinese  counterpart 
being  leaked  to  other  producers  in  China.  If  the  firm  correctly  anticipates  the  probability  of  leakage, 
and I see no reason to believe why it would not, then it would internalize the loss in the net presented 
discounted value of its future profits associated with the higher probability of technological theft. Still, 
the  cost  advantage  or  marketaccess  benefits  associated  with  joint  ventures  in  China  lead  some  U.S. 
firms  to  find  it  optimal  to  operate  there,  though  they  might  do  so  without  sharing  their  stateofthe 
arts technologies.  

Against  this  backdrop,  if  the  ongoing  spat  between  China  and  other  advanced  economies  results  in 
China  putting  in  place  stronger  IPR  protection  laws,  it  is  very  far  from  obvious  that  this  will  trigger  a 
process of reshoring. On the contrary, such stronger IPR protection might provide incentives for new 
firms  to  slice  their  value  chains  and  operate  in  China,  especially  for  firms  that  are  unwilling  to  share 
their technologies in a joint venture in the current environment. Indeed, this is in line with the findings 
of  the  literature  on  the  effects  of  tightening  of  IPR  protection  on  U.S.  multinationals  operations.  In 
particular,  Branstetter  et  al.  (2006)  and  Bilir  (2014)  found  that  patent  law  reforms  that  improved  IPR 
protection abroad are associated with U.S. multinational transferring more technology to their foreign 
affiliates,  with  the  effects  being  disproportionate  in  sectors  with  long  product  life  cycles.  In  sum, 
although  the  current  tension  between  the  U.S.  and  China  have  fuelled  concerns  about  de
globalisation, it is far less obvious that the "U.S.­China technology war" will be hugely detrimental to 
U.S. multinational activity in China.20 
                                              
19  I  focus  here  on  the  role  of  technological  spillovers,  but  governments  may  still  play  a  useful  role  in  the  absence  of  such 

externalities. For instance, if the "quid pro quo" policy is viewed as a "tax" on U.S. multinationals operating in China, and if 
the U.S. government is in a better position than  U.S.  firms to convince the Chinese government  to reduce  or eliminate that 
tax, then such government pressures might be beneficial. 
20 A telling illustration of this claim is the decision by Tesla to begin assembling their electric cars in China once the company 

was assured that it could maintain whole ownership of their factories in that country. 

                                                                                                                                              29 
 
  Let  me  conclude  this  section  by  stressing  that  my  thoughts  above  on  the  technological  wars  have 
  focused  on  positive  rather  than  normative  aspects.  Even  if  one  concedes  that  investments  by  U.S. 
  firms in China are privately optimal, it is far less obvious that they will be socially optimal. In particular, 
  firms may not internalize the effects that their technological leakage might have on other U.S. firms, 
  or  on  the  U.S.  more  broadly,  as  has  been  highlighted  by  commentators  that  have  warned  about  the 
  cybersecurity issues associated with global value chains. 
   
  5.3  Structural Transformation, Investment, and Capital Goods 
  In  this  section,  I  briefly  touch  upon  additional  longterm  forces  that  may  potentially  contribute  to  a 
  process of deglobalisation.  

  First, consider the role of structural transformation, which involves a secular shift of economic activity 
  from  manufacturing  to  services,  much  like  the  structural  transformation  that  turned  agrarian 
  economies into industrialized ones. Because manufacturing goods are more easily tradable than many 
  services,  it  would  appear  that  as  a  higher  percentage  of  world  GDP  is  accounted  for  by  services,  the 
  ratio  of  world  trade  to  world  GDP  will  necessarily  face  downward  pressure,  thus  confirming  fears  of 
  deglobalisation. This argument, however, holds the relative tradability of manufacturing and services 
  being  constant  over  time,  while  I  have  argued  in  section  4.2  that  new  technologies  have  and  will 
  continue  to  enhance  the  ability  of  economic  agents  to  trade  services  at  long  distances.  Indeed, 
  consistent  with  the  counterbalancing  effects  of  these  two  forces,  panel  A  of  Chart  11  demonstrates 
  that the ratio of service exports to GDP has grown much faster (from 4% in 1995 to almost 7% in 2018) 
  than the ratio of overall services in GDP (which grew from 55% to 65% in the same period).

A  second  secular  trend  is  associated  with  the  notion  that  the  pattern  of  economic  growth  across 
countries  has  changed  since  the  Great  Recession,  and  relatively  open  economies  now  grow  slower 
than  relatively  more  closed  economies.  If  this  were  a  fact,  world  openness  would  be  expected  to  be 
on a downward trend, as relatively more closed economies capture a larger and larger share of world 
trade. Nevertheless, as  panel B of Chart 11 indicates, there is virtually no correlation between the cross
section of GDP growth rates in the period 20092018 and the crosssection of exports to GDP ratios in 
2007.21 In words, it does not seem that the premise for this mechanism holds in the data.

The  last  secular  force  I  will  elaborate  on  is  more  intriguing  and  relates  to  the  marked  decline  in 
investment rates in many countries in recent years. It has been a matter of debate whether this decline 
will  be  a  permanent  one  or  transitory,  but  panel  A  of  Chart  12,  borrowed  from  GarcíaSantana  et  al. 
(2020),  indicates  that  the  relationship  between  countrylevel  investment  rates  and  the  level  of 
development  (measured  by  log  GDP  per  capita)  exhibits  a  clear  invertedU  shape  in  the  data  for  the 
period  19502011.  Furthermore,  aggregate  world  GDP  per  capita  currently  features  a  value  well  in 
excess of $7,125, which corresponds to the value of GDP at which investment rates peak according to 
the  cubic  fit  in  the  figure.  Indeed,  as  panel  B  of  Chart  12  shows  the  aggregate  world  investment  rate 
has been on a clear downward trend in the last 50 years. This phenomenon is particularly relevant for 
world  trade  because  investment  goods  (capital  goods,  machinery,  transport  equipment,  etc.) 


                                             
21 The relationship is mildly negative and turns a bit more negative when dropping countries with export shares higher than 1. But 

as soon as one weights the observations by GDP or population in 2007, the relationship turns mildly positive (though insignificant). 

                                                                                                                                 31 
 
constitute  about  forty  percent  of  merchandise  trade.  A  secular  slump  in  investment  is  thus  likely  to 
reduce the share of world trade flows in the overall level of economic activity in the world.22 
 
6. DeGlobalisation and Policy Factors 
In section 4, I have fleshed out a series of arguments questioning the view that technological factors 
(such  as  automation)  are  likely  to  constitute  a  secular  force  fostering  a  retreat  in  globalisation  in 
coming  decades,  while  in  section  5  I  have  studied  the  plausibility  of  additional  secular  nonpolicy 
drivers of deglobalisation. In this section, I will instead focus on the role of policy factors in potentially 
leading to an era of increased isolationism, much as it occurred in the 20thcentury Interwar Period.  

It is intuitively clear that the policy and institutional factors that fuelled the  era of hyperglobalisation 
are  much  more  reversable  than  the  technological  ones.  Although  it  is  hard  to  imagine  that  Eastern 
Europe  will  again  fall  behind  an  iron  curtain  or  that  China  will  abandon  market  economy  practices, 
trade policies (and economic policies more broadly) can easily turn much more protectionist than they 
have  been  in  the  recent  past.  In  principle,  multilateral  and  regional  trade  agreements  were  designed 
in  ways  that  they  cannot  easily  be  reversed,  but  recent  events  have  undoubtedly  eroded  the  notion 
that freer trade is necessarily here to stay. How likely is it that the next few years will bring a policy or 
institutionallydriven  process  of  deglobalisation?  The  rest  of  this  section  will  provide  tentative 
answers to this question. 
 
6.1  Stalling Liberalization and Burgeoning Protectionism 
Scepticism about the sustainability of the liberalized environment that was so conducive to the growth 
of global value chains is justified by at least three types of recent developments. 

First,  it  is  evident  that  the  multilateral  liberalization  agenda  under  the  umbrella  of  the  WTO  is  at  an 
impasse. The current round of negotiations, the Doha round, began in November 2001, and has yet to 
reach a conclusive agreement. Admittedly, the round began with an already very low average level of 
protection  (see  Chart  8),  and  it  attempted  to  tackle  very  sensitive  issues,  such  as  the  removal  of 
agricultural subsidies in the U.S. and the European Union. Yet, the lack of substantial progress in close 
to  twenty  years  has  led  many  countries  to  lose  faith  in  the  ability  of  the  WTO  to  further  push  the 
liberalization agenda.  

Second,  the  process  of  regional  liberalization  has  also  largely  stalled,  and  more  worryingly,  it  shows 
signs of being in retreat. The decision of the United Kingdom to leave the EU, voted in referendum in 
June of 2016 and ratified in January of 2020, is an evident example of this trend. At the time of writing, 
it is not entirely clear what the implications of Brexit will be for the ease of flow of goods and services 
between the UK and the other members of the EU, but it is undoubtedly clear that Brexit will reduce 
their  economic  interdependence.  Another  example  is  President  Trump's  insistence  on  renegotiating 
                                             
22  A  lingering  question  is:  will  investment  rates  continue  to  permanently  fall  in  the  future?  Given  available  estimates  of  the 

elasticity of substitution between capital and labour, the transitional dynamics of the "good old" neoclassical growth model 
indeed  predict  that  investment  rates  will  feature  the  invertedU  pattern  in  panel  C  of  Chart  11  (see  Antràs,  2001,  2004).  The 
recent revival of the admittedly much sexier secular stagnation hypothesis (see Summers, 2011) also predicts a secular decline 
in investment for years to come. 

                                                                                                                                             32 
 
NAFTA,  culminating  in  the  signing  of  the  United  StatesMexicoCanada  Agreement  (or  USMCA,  for 
readers  inclined  to  pronounce  institutions  by  their  acronyms  ­  good  luck  with  this  one!).  Much  has 
been  written  about  the  provisions  in  the  new  agreement  regarding  rules  of  origin  in  the  automobile 
industry and labour standards in Mexico, but a particularly worrisome aspect of this agreement is the 
socalled "sunset clause," which stipulates that the agreement must be reviewed by the three nations 
every six years, and that it will expire after sixteen years unless it is unanimously decided to extend it. 
Naturally,  this  makes  future  trade  integration  between  the  U.S.,  Canada  and  Mexico  much  more 
uncertain than it was under NAFTA. Even before the election of President Trump in 2016, appetite for 
the  signing  of  the  Transatlantic  Trade  and  Investment  Partnership  (TTIP)  and  the  TransPacific 
Partnership  (TPP)  had  largely  waned  in  the  United  States,  as  exemplified  by  the  fact  that  the 
Democratic  candidate,  Hillary  Clinton,  did  not  support  the  signing  of  these  agreements  either. 
Relatedly, free trade agreements have become more difficult to negotiate due to the many additional 
provisions that have become part and parcel of such agreements: in the lingo of trade economists, we 
live in the age of "deep" rather than "shallow" trade agreements.

A third, much more worrisome development is the recent U.S.­China trade war. Starting in early 2018, 
President Trump enacted a series of tariff increases on specific products and countries, with China as 
an explicit target. Import tariffs increased from 2.6% to 16.6% on 12,043 products covering $303 billion 
(12.7%) of annual U.S. imports (see Fajgelbaum et al., 2020). As a result, and as Chart 13 shows, average 
(weighted) U.S. tariffs more than doubled in 2018. In response to these unilateral measures, U.S. trade 
partners (and China, in particular) imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports. Beyond the increases in

an institution to restore order to the current situation. 
 
6.2 Underlying Forces 
What  triggered  the  recent  political  backlash  against  globalisation?  Answering  this  question  is 
particularly  important  if  one  wants  to  understand  the  extent  to  which  the  forces  that  led  to  this 
escalating protectionism are only temporary or are instead secular.  

A  first  obvious  but  important  point  is  that  recent  protectionist  spats  have  not  been  triggered  by 
idiosyncratic  decisions  of  particular  individuals  or  political  parties.  Nigel  Farage  might  have  played  a 
singular role in Brexit, and President Trump's blunt approach to policy making might have precipitated 
the  U.S.­China  trade  war.  But  these  individuals,  as  well  as  many  other  champions  of  protectionism 
around the globe (such as Bolsonaro in Brazil or Orban in Hungary) are elected officials who reached 
powerful positions because their electoral platforms appealed to a broad share of their electorates. 

Consistent with this, data from surveys of people's perception of the consequences of trade for their 
economies  suggests  that  the  last  few  years  of  the  hyperglobalisation  period  witnessed  a  significant 
share  of  people  voicing  concerns  about  the  consequences  of  trade  integration.  Chart  14  provides  an 
illustration  based  of  the  perceived  effects  of  foreign  trade  in  the  United  States.  More  specifically, 
Gallup  has  been  asking  Americans  for  close  to  thirty  years  the  question:  "What  do  you  think  foreign 
trade  means  for  America?  Do  you  see  foreign  trade  more  as  an  opportunity  for  economic  growth 
through increased U.S. exports or a threat to the economy from foreign imports?" As the left panel of 
Chart  14  shows,  in  the  early  2000s,  the  share  of  people  responding  that  trade  was  good  for  the 
economy  declined  from  56%  in  2000  to  41%  in  2008,  with  the  flip  side  of  this  being  an  increase  in  the 
share of people viewing trade as an economic threat increasing from 35% in  2000 to 52% in 2008. The 
increasing  discontent  with  globalisation  was  widespread  along  the  political  spectrum.  As  the  right 
panel  of  Chart  11  shows,  support  for  globalisation  fell  dramatically  in  200008  for  both  Republican  as 
well as Democratic voters.  
Given  the  patterns  in  Chart  14,  it  is  not  entirely  surprising  that  the  2010s  witnessed  a  proliferation  of 
politicians and political parties catering to these increased demands for protectionism. Ironically, Chart 
14  also  demonstrates  that  perceptions  of  the  consequences  of  trade  for  the  U.S.  economy  have 
dramatically  changed  since  2008,  and  last  year,  prior  to  the  COVID19  crisis,  74%  of  respondents 
revealed  seeing  trade  in  a  positive  light,  and  only  21%  characterized  it  as  a  threat.  The  recent  trend 
might  reflect  improving  economic  conditions  up  to  the  COVID19  shock,  but  Gallup  also  found  that 
many  more  respondents  (45%)  indicated  that  the  U.S.­China  trade  war  was  harmful  to  the  economy 
rather  than  beneficial  (31%),  despite  the  fact  that  62%  described  China  as  engaging  in  unfair  trade 
practices. 
 
Although  support  for  protectionism  might  be  much  lower  today  than  it  was  in  the  aftermath  of  the 
Great  Recession,  it  is  worth  analysing  the  underlying  causes  of  the  growing  discontent  in  the  early 
2000s, so as to better understand whether this discontent is likely to continue to wane in coming  years 
or whether it may instead reinflame.

As many commentators have pointed out (see Pavcnik, 2017, Rodrik, 2020), a key source of resentment 
is related to the distributional effects of international trade. During the hyperglobalisation period, not 
only  did  economies  become  much  more  interconnected,  but  many  of  these  economies 
contemporaneously experienced a significant rise in income inequality. For instance, during 19792007, 
the  Gini  coefficient  associated  with  the  distribution  of  U.S.  market  income  grew  dramatically  from  a 
level  of  0.48  all  the  way  to  0.59.  Furthermore,  as  is  clear  from  the  left  panel  of  Chart  15,  trade 
integration  and  inequality  grew  very  much  in  parallel  even  at  fairly  high  frequencies.  The  extent  to 
which  these  two  phenomena  are  causally  related  has  been  the  subject  of  intense  academic  debates, 
but it is by now a widely accepted view that trade integration has been a nonnegligible contributor to 
increased income inequality in the U.S., in many other industrialized, and even in developing countries 
(see Krugman, 2008, Goldberg and Pavcnik, 2007). A couple of landmark academic papers in the 2010s 
­ Autor, Dorn and Hanson (2013) and Pierce and Schott (2016) ­ further singled out trade integration 
with China as a particularly salient contributor to the decline in U.S. manufacturing employment in the 
1990s and 2000s. 
 
Tradeinduced  increases  in  inequality  need  not  generate  discontent  as  long  as  those  that  may  be 
harmed  by  trade  integration  are  properly  compensated.  Have  the  losers  from  globalisation  been 
compensated?  In  Antràs,  de  Gortari  and  Itskhoki  (2017),  we  estimate  the  average  degree  of  tax 
progressivity in the United States taxtransfer system and found a very significant decline in the degree 
of  tax  progressivity  over  the  same  period  19792007  in  which  the  U.S.  economy  became  much  more 
integrated  in  world  markets  and  was  experiencing  a  marked  increase  in  inequality  in  the  distribution 
of  market  (pretax)  income  (see  panel  B  of  Chart  15).23  In  sum,  in  a  period  during  which  import 
                                            
23  To  compute  this  index  of  tax  progressivity,  we  used  information  on  the  distribution  of  adjusted  gross  income  in  public 

samples  of  U.S.  IRS  tax  returns,  as  well  as  CBO  information  on  the  tax  liabilities  and  transfers  received  by  households  at 

                                                                                                                                           35 
 
competition was putting significant pressure on real wages and employment, the U.S. safety net was 
being  pulled  out  from  under  U.S.  workers'  feet.  Because  median  real  weekly  earnings  grew  very 
meagrely  in  the  1980s,  1990s  and  2000s  (see  Acemoglu  and  Autor,  2011),  it  is  natural  that  a  growing 
share  of  U.S.  workers  felt  alienated  by  the  process  of  globalisation,  despite  the  fact  that  aggregate 
real income in the U.S. grew significantly during this period.24

Although globalisation might have created some discontent, it is less clear the extent to which trade
induced inequality directly contributed to the emergence of the protectionist and isolationist policies 
we have seen put in place in the last few years. A recent literature, both theoretical as well as empirical, 
has  studied  such  a  link.  On  the  theoretical  side,  Grossman  and  Helpman  (forthcoming)  borrow  tools 
and  insights  from  social  psychology  to  argue  that  increased  income  inequality  may  generate 
endogenous  changes  in  social  identity  that  generate  a  protectionist  bias  in  trade  policy.  On  the 
empirical  front,  Autor  et  al.  (2020)  and  Colantone  and  Stanig  (2018a)  establish  a  causal  link  between 
the  China  (import  competition)  shock  and  (i)  a  rise  of  political  polarization  in  the  U.S.,  and  (ii)  an 
increase  in  support  for  nationalist  and  isolationist  parties  in  15  Western  European  countries, 
respectively.  A  couple  of  spinoffs  of  these  papers  ­  Autor  et  al.  (2017)  and  Colantone  and  Stanig 
(2018b)  ­  have  further  directly  linked  the  China  shock  to  the  outcomes  of  the  2016  U.S.  Presidential 
election and the 2016 Brexit referendum vote, respectively.

    Even  from  a  utilitarian  social  welfare  perspective,  the  welfare  gains  associated  with  international  trade  would  be  about 
20% lower than as implied by aggregate real income (see Antràs, de Gortari and Itskhoki, 2017).

6.3  Implications for the Future of Globalisation 
With  this  background  in  mind,  we  are  now  ready  to  revisit  the  main  theme  of  this  paper,  which 
concerns the future of globalisation. What would the consequences be of persistent trade wars across 
countries? Are the forces that fuelled the backlash against globalisation in the early 2000s likely to re
emerge  in  coming  years  and  indeed  make  policy  spats  persistent?  And  might  the  ongoing  COVID19 
health  crisis  spark  an  intensification  of  the  resentment  against  globalisation?  I  will  postpone  tackling 
the last question until section 7, which will focus on the current global pandemic, but we can attempt 
to isolate an answer to the first two questions by (hypothetically) rolling back time to January of 2020. 

Let  me  first  discuss  how  the  persistence  of  trade  wars  would  impact  the  future  of  globalisation.  The 
answer  here  is  fairly  clear,  as  the  Interwar  Period  reminds  us,  but  it  is  worth  commenting  on  a  few 
nuances.  

First,  it  will  not  be  immaterial  whether  trade  wars  continue  to  be  bilateral  in  nature,  as  is  largely  the 
case with the current U.S.­China trade, or whether the situation escalates into an allout world trade 
war. In the former case, and as some studies have already shown (see Flaaen et al., 2020), production 
might relocate to (third) countries unaffected by the bilateral trade war rather than being reshored to 
domestic  economies.  If  tensions  turn  multilateral  in  nature,  however,  a  scenario  with  significant  de
globalisation would become much more likely.25  

Second,  because  of  the  relevance  of  sunk  costs,  the  perceived  persistence  of  trade  disputes  will  be 
key for the extent to which production will relocate across countries. In this sense, the outcome of the 
November  3rd  Presidential  election  in  the  U.S.  is  encouraging  and  suggests  a  decrease  in  policy 
isolationism in the U.S. (although, frankly the stance of the future Biden administration on U.S. trade 
relationships  with  China  remains  somewhat  unclear).  Nevertheless,  to  the  extent  that  continuing 
pressures  for  nationalist  trade  policies  lead  to  the  weakening  or  potential  disbandment  of  the  WTO, 
we  could  well  face  a  very  serious  threat  to  the  architecture  that  underpinned  the  process  of  trade 
liberalization in the postWWII era.  

A third relevant factor is that recent developments have not only increased the average level of tariffs 
but  have  also  generated  a  lot  of  trade  policy  uncertainty.  Such  uncertainty  is  likely  to  weigh  on  the 
decision of firms to make new investments in China, and might also lead some firms to diversify their 
sourcing strategies (possibly involving partial reshoring) in situations in which they are able to afford 
the fixed costs associated with more complex, multisourcing strategies.  

Finally, it is worth mentioning an additional potential ramification of the current SinoAmerican trade 
tensions. As some commentators have pointed out, there is the real risk that geopolitical and strategic 
imperatives drive a decoupling and a fragmentation of the world economy into hostile political blocs, 

                                        
25 Empirical work on the economic impact of the U.S.China trade war is still at its infancy, but a slowly emerging body of work 

seems to indicate that the increased trade barriers in Chart 13 and the retaliation they triggered from China, has harmed both 
U.S. consumers (see Amiti et al., 2019, Fajgelbaum et al., 2020) and also the U.S. manufacturing sector (see Flaaen et al., 2020, 
Handley et al., 2020). 

                                                                                                                              37 
 
with  a  potential  bifurcation  of  technology  standards  that  would  undermine  much  of  the  digital 
integration achieved in recent decades. A world partitioned into two "internets", a Western one and 
a Chinese one, where the latter would only allow users and apps that sign on to China's regulatory and 
compliance standards would pose a serious threat to the process of global integration. 

Having  outlined  the  consequences  of  persistent  trade  tensions,  I  next  turn  to  the  arguably  more 
fundamental second question of whether the backlashgenerating forces discussed in section 5.2 are 
likely to persist in the next few years. From the vantage point of January 2020, the key consideration 
for answering this question was: will we continue to see tradeinduced inequality in the coming years, 
and will redistribution systems continue to insufficiently compensate the losers from globalisation? In 
this respect, it is honestly hard to be optimistic. I have argued in section 4.2 that recent technological 
developments  (such  as  automation  and  the  proliferation  of  digital  platforms)  might  well  give 
globalisation  a  second  wind,  but  it  also  seems  likely  that  these  technological  developments  will 
aggravate  income  inequality  in  both  advanced  and  less  developed  economies.  Consider  the  case  of 
automation. Although I have argued that industrial robots, 3D printing and other automated forms of 
production  might  well  lead  to  the  growth  in  trade  in  complementary  inputs  of  production,  it  is  also 
evident (and has been empirically established) that they tend to reduce the demand for workers (and 
particularly  production  workers)  in  advanced  economies  (see  Acemoglu  and  Restrepo,  2020,  
Acemoglu  et  al.,  2020).  Furthermore,  while  automation  might  have  a  positive  effect  on  offshoring  in 
less  developed  economies  (as  documented  by  Artuc  et  al.,  2018,  or  Stapleton  and  Webb,  2020),  it  is 
likely that the increased demand for foreign labour will be biased in favour of skilled workers in those 
less  developed  economies,  in  line  with  the  vast  literature  documenting  the  skilledlabour  intensity  of 
GVC  activity  (e.g.,  Verhoogen,  2008).  In  sum,  automation  is  likely  to  increase  inequality  both  by 
reducing  the  labour  share  of  income,  but  also  by  giving  a  higher  share  of  that  labour  income  to 
relatively skilled workers worldwide. 

In  the  case  of  digital  platforms,  despite  their  enormous  potential  to  enhance  the  efficiency  of 
international  trade  in  consumer  goods  and  intermediate  inputs,  the  same  reputation  mechanisms 
GVCs  rely  on  to  verify  seller  and  buyer  quality  may  foster  concentration,  thus  making  it  harder  for 
entrants  to  compete.  Within  existing  firmtofirm  GVC  links,  novel  technologies  might  also  have 
implications for the relative bargaining power of the different participants in GVCs. For instance, digital 
platforms might allow large buyers in rich countries to gain information on a larger number of potential 
suppliers,  thus  enhancing  their  ability  to  have  these  suppliers  compete  with  each  other.  This  in  turn 
may  lead  to  better  terms  of  trade  for  lead  firms  in  rich  countries,  at  the  expense  of  a  lower  share  of 
the  gains  from  GVCs  accruing  to  producers  in  less  developed  economies.  Furthermore,  digital 
platforms  themselves  have  been  accumulating  vast  amounts  of  information  on  the  users  of  their 
platforms, and this certainly enhances their ability to use this information to their advantage, either by 
locking  in  buyers  with  particularly  welltailored  recommendations,  or  by  price  discriminating  in 
particularly effective ways. As a result, digital platform firms also pose new challenges for regulators 
seeking to ensure fair competition and prevent abuse of market power.  

Concerns  about  growing  market  power  of  firms  engaged  in  GVC  activity  are  compounded  by  the 
widespread  profitshifting  practices  of  these  companies,  which  have  found  it  relatively  simple  to 


                                                                                                                       38 
 
exploit loopholes in international taxation laws to increase the share of their profits that are accrued 
in locations with particularly low (or even zero) corporate tax rates.  
The  inability  of  regulators  to  adequately  tackle  the  issue  of  profitshifting  also  resonates  with  the 
inability  (or  unwillingness)  of  many  governments  to  put  in  place  sufficiently  progressive  tax  systems 
to  ensure  that  the  gains  from  economic  growth  and  international  trade  are  widely  spread  in  the 
population.  Although  discontent  over  globalisation  and  inequality  has  given  rise  to  populist 
governments  in  many  parts  of  the  globe,  in  most  cases,  those  governments  have  been  rightwing 
rather than leftwing, so if anything they have been less inclined to increase the progressivity of their 
tax systems (see Rodrik, 2020). 

Despite  these  pessimist  views,  remember  that  recent  Gallup  surveys  show  a  marked  increase  in 
support for globalisation since 2008, at least in the U.S. This indicates that views on globalisation are 
strongly  correlated  with  economic  cycles,  regardless  of  how  widely  spread  the  benefits  of  economic 
growth  are.  As  puzzling  as  this  may  be,  it  suggests  that  as  long  as  the  world  avoids  long  recessions, 
we may also avoid deglobalisation. 

Now, in the last few paragraphs, I had hypothetically turned back time to January of 2020, but it is now 
time to tackle the big elephant in the room. 

 
7. The COVID19 Crisis and the Future of GVCs 
I conclude the paper with a discussion of how the main themes of this paper interlace with the global 
pandemic the world is actively fighting at the time of writing. What has been the immediate impact of 
the COVID19 pandemic on global integration and GVC activity more narrowly? What are the likely mid 
to longrun implications of this crisis for the future of globalisation and of GVCs? Although answering 
these  questions  satisfactorily  would  require  an  essay  of  its  own,  and  could  also  benefit  from  a  few 
more  months  (or  even  years)  of  enhanced  perspective,  I  will  attempt  to  provide  some  tentative 
answers below appealing to the insights offered earlier in this paper. 
 
7.1  The COVID19 Health Crisis 
The background of the COVID19 (or Coronavirus) global pandemic is well known by now. The epidemic 
originated in Wuhan, China, where the first cases were identified in December of 2019. By January 2020 
there  was  a  widespread  awareness  that  this  was  a  serious  epidemic  with  the  potential  to  turn  into  a 
global  pandemic.  Indeed,  on  January  21,  2020,  the  first  humantohuman  infections  of  COVID19  in 
Europe  are  presumed  to  have  taken  place  in  Starnberg,  Germany,  when  a  local  car  parts  supplier 
(Webasto)  organized  a  training  session  with  a  Chinese  colleague  from  its  operation  in  Wuhan.  The 
epidemic  grew  quickly  in  Europe  during  February  and  March  of  this  year,  with  a  particularly  heavy 
death  toll  in  Italy  and  Spain.  The  first  few  cases  in  the  United  States  were  diagnosed  in  late  January, 
but  the  disease  only  became  an  epidemic  in  March.  A  wellknown  focus  of  infection  was  a  biotech 
conference  in  Boston,  Massachusetts,  on  February  2223,  2020,  which  is  believed  to  have  spread  the 
disease  to  at  least  six  states  in  the  U.S.  and  three  European  countries,  and  caused  close  to  100 
infections  in  Massachusetts  alone.  By  March  11th,  2020,  the  epidemic  had  spread  to  essentially  all 


                                                                                                                      39 
 
corners of the world, and the World Health Organisation declared COVID19 a global pandemic. At that 
point  in  time,  only  around  4,300  people  had  died  worldwide.  At  the  time  of  writing,  early  November 
of 2020, the death toll of the COVID19 pandemic had reached 1.3 million deaths, with no clear end to 
the epidemic in sight despite gargantuan efforts to develop an effective vaccine. 

As  we  have  emphasized  in  Antràs,  Redding  and  RossiHansberg  (2020),  globalisation  and  pandemics 
are closely intertwined. Not only was the rapid spread of the disease an obvious consequence of the 
globalized  nature  of  economic  activity  and  of  GVC  activity  more  narrowly  ­  as  the  Starnberg  and 
Boston examples above illustrate ­ but the global pandemic has had a severe impact on the workings 
of the global economy. Most notably, the flow of people across borders has essentially come to a halt 
both  due  to  government  restrictions  but  also  due  to  purposeful  social  distancing  practices  by 
individuals. But beyond migration flows, the profound and asynchronous nature of the COVID19 shock 
has also had an immediate impact on world trade flows, as the next section will overview.  
 
7.2  ShortTerm Effects 
Although  at  this  point  in  time  the  data  we  have  at  hand  is  somewhat  tentative  in  nature,  Chart  16 
attempts  to  provide  a  preliminary  diagnostic  of  the  impact  of  the  global  pandemic  on  the  flow  of 
goods across countries. In Panel A, I use data from the CPB (Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy 
Analysis)  to  illustrate  the  dramatic  decline  in  world  trade  in  recent  months.  Relative  to  its  level  in 
August  of  2019,  world  trade  reached  a  bottom  in  May  of  2020,  when  it  had  reached  a  cumulative 
decline of 17.6%. In June, July, and August however, trade flows grew at a fast pace, and by the end of 
August, the yearonyear decline in trade had been reduced to a much more moderate 4.4%. The figure 
shows  that  although  industrial  production  also  markedly  declined  during  the  crisis,  the  response  of 
world trade has been slightly larger. It is important to emphasize, however, that the current pandemic 
is affecting the service sector much more than the industrial sector, so it is quite likely that, by the end 
of 2020, the ratio of world trade to world GDP will be significantly higher than it was at the end of 2019. 

Panel B of Chart 16 further decomposes the evolution of world trade during the current calendar year 
into  different  types  of  goods.  The  data  originates  in  the  creative  work  of  Cerdeiro  et  al.  (2020),  who 
use  data  from  radio  signals  emitted  by  global  vessels  for  navigational  safety  purposes  to  construct 
estimates  of  world  seaborne  trade  (in  terms  of  metric  tons)  based  on  the  dimensions  and 
characteristics of the ships. The data is available at a very highfrequency (daily) and with a short lag, 
so  despite  its  imperfect  nature,  it  provides  a  valuable  angle  on  the  recent  decline  in  trade.  A  few 
patterns in the figure are noteworthy. First, the chart illustrates clearly a "doubledip" in world trade, 
first  in  February  and  then  again  in  April  and  early  May,  reflecting  lockdowns  (and  social  distancing) 
first  in  China,  and  then  in  Europe  and  North  America.  Second,  although  world  trade  was  11%  lower  in 
early  June  than  in  early  January,  by  early  October,  world  trade  had  fully  recovered  to  its  level  at  the 
beginning  of  the  year,  thus  confirming  that  world  trade  is  recovering  much  faster  than  world  GDP. 
Third, information on the type of vessel used for transport allows one to decompose the evolution of 
world  trade  into  various  components  associated  with  bulk  carriers,  oil/chemical  tankers,  general 
cargo/container ships and vehicle vessels. The chart then demonstrates that world trade in vehicles, a 
prototypical  example  of  GVC  trade  experienced  a  much  larger  initial  decline  (at  some  point  a 
cumulative  decline  of  50%)  than  other  types  of  trade.  Nevertheless,  this  type  of  trade  also  recovered 

                                                                                                                      40 
 
faster  than  other  components  of  trade,  and  by  early  September,  it  had  reached  early  January  levels. 
Whether the disproportionate rise and fall of vehicles in panel B reflects the peculiarities of GVC trade 
or  the  durable  nature  of  the  goods  being  shipped  is  an  open  question,  but  in  any  case,  the  figure 
demonstrates that standard indices of globalisation based on trade statistics are not likely to provide 
ammunition  for  those  commentators  advocating  for  the  advent  of  an  era  of  deglobalisation  in  the 
near future.

Why  has  world  merchandise  trade  recovered  so  quickly  from  the  May  lows?  Unfortunately,  the 
characteristics of the data we have at hand at this point in time is not conclusive, but the conceptual 
considerations  developed  in  section  4.3  of  this  paper,  as  well  as  empirical  evidence  from  the  Great 
Recession and the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis reviewed in that same section, leads me to  hypothesize 
that the trade collapse in Chart 16 has not operated, at least up to this point, at the extensive margin. 
This  conjecture  also  explains  the  rapid  recovery  in  world  trade  from  May  to  September,  and  it  also 
suggests  that  as  long  as  the  global  pandemic  is  not  perceived  to  be  a  highly  persistent  shock,  the 
mediumrun  implications  of  the  current  health  crisis  for  world  trade  will  be  muted.26  On  the  latter 
matter, and even if we are still in the midst of much uncertainty about the timing and effectiveness of 
a COVID19 vaccine, it seems reasonable that this shock is still widely perceived to be more transitory 
than  the  Great  Recession.  As  a  result,  it  is  then  natural  that  firms  are  at  this  point  unwilling  to  sever 
international ties and reshore activity domestically.  
      

                                         
26 This is indeed consistent with the calibration results in Antràs, Redding and RossiHansberg (2020). Furthermore, preliminary 

evidence from Spanish Customs data suggest indeed that less than 5% of the decrease in Spanish exports during MarchAugust 
of 2020 relative to MarchAugust of 2019 was explained by the intensive margin (see Minondo, 2020). 

                                                                                                                                   41 
 
 
 
7.3  MediumtoLongTerm Effects 
Even  if  in  the  shorttomedium  run  merchandise  trade  recovers  to  preCOVID19  levels,  it  is  worth 
pausing  to  elucidate  whether  the  current  global  pandemic  might  sow  the  seeds  for  an  intensified 
phase of deglobalisation. To answer this question, it is useful to again separate effects working largely 
through technology, and effects working through policy. 
On  the  technological  front,  there  are  reasons  to  believe  that  the  decline  in  facetoface  interactions 
experienced in recent months is likely to persist (though obviously in a less dramatic manner) for years 
to come. On the one hand, it is hard to gauge the state in which the airline industry will leave the crisis, 
but it seems inevitable that international travel will be less pleasant and more expensive for years to 
come. On the other hand, even with a vaccine in place, the willingness of people to share tight places, 
like  airplanes,  with  other  individuals  is  likely  to  remain  depressed  for  some  time.  To  the  extent  that 
facetoface  interactions  and  international  business  travel  are  important  inputs  into  the  well
functioning  of  GVCs,  it  seems  reasonable  to  expect  a  reshoring  of  economic  activity  in  ways  that 
diminish the need for longdistance travel. Indeed, there is a small but fruitful empirical literature that 
has  demonstrated  the  role  of  international  business  travel  in  facilitating  international  trade  (see 
Cristea, 2011, Blonigen and Cristea, 2015, and Startz, 2018), and more generally, in fostering economic 
development (see Campante and YanagizawaDrott, 2018).  

It  is  pertinent,  however,  to  mention  two  caveats  to  this  argument.  First,  the  marginal  return  to  face
toface  interactions  is  likely  to  be  larger  when  initiating  trade  relationships  than  when  maintaining 
them,  so  I  would  expect  the  effect  of  depressed  international  business  travel  on  world  trade  to 
operate largely at the entry margin rather than at the exit margin. In plain words, business executives 
are  unlikely  to  shut  down  existing  offshore  plants  due  to  increased  nuisances  in  international  travel, 
but  they  are  likely  to  take  these  matters  into  consideration  when  considering  the  location  of  new 
plants.  As  a  result,  the  adjustment  might  only  materialize  gradually.  Second,  it  may  perhaps  be  naïve 
to  ignore  the  possibility  that  future  technological  developments  will  enhance  virtual  interactions  in 
ways  that  make  them  much  more  of  a  substitute  for  facetoface  interactions.  Such  developments 
would  of  course  tilt  the  balance  toward  a  more  globalised  world  economy  (albeit  with  less 
international travel). 

These  technological  considerations  are  however  secondorder  relative  to  the  impact  of  the  political 
landscape post COVID19 on GVCs. Will the current pandemic add fuel to the fire in the current political 
tensions  between  the  U.S.  and  China?  Or  will  a  global  coordinated  effort  to  eradicate  the  global 
pandemic produce some goodwill that can then be used to ease tensions in the future? The answer to 
these questions in part depends on the stance of the future Biden administration in the United States, 
but at this point in time I see two main reasons for pessimism. 

First, the pandemic has brought about a number of diplomatic disputes related to the exact origin of 
the  COVID19  crisis,  with  President  Trump  making  a  concerted  effort  to  publicly  refer  to  it  as  the 
"Wuhan  virus"  or  the  "China  virus."  Tensions  have  also  flared  up  in  Europe,  where  the  passing  of  a 
massive  aid  package  was  delayed  until  late  July  and  only  after  many  heated  rounds  of  negotiations 

                                                                                                                   42 
 
and  mutual  recriminations.  These  types  of  finger  pointing  and  blame  games  are  not  likely  to  be 
conducive to healthy international relations in the future, and they do not bode well for the future of 
global  organizations,  such  as  the  WTO  (which  incidentally  has  been  without  an  interim  Director
General for more than two months at the time of writing). 

A second reason for concern relates to the highly regressive nature of the economic recession caused 
by  the  global  pandemic.  As  highlighted  by  the  results  of  Chetty  et  al.  (2020)  and  others,  every 
indication  so  far  points  to  this  recession  having  a  much  larger  impact  on  the  economic  wellbeing  of 
poor households than on that of rich households. This is in large part due to the fact that the types of 
jobs performed by lowwage earners are likely to demand much higher facetoface interactions than 
the  types  of jobs  associated  with  highwage  earners  (see Dingel  and  Neiman,  2020).  Furthermore,  as 
of early November, the stock market has recovered much faster than the "real" economy, which again 
naturally  benefits  richer  individuals  much  more  than  poorer  ones.  In  sum,  if  income  inequality  brews 
isolationism, slowbalisation may well turn quickly into deglobalisation. 


8. Concluding Remarks 
This paper has attempted to contribute to the debate over whether the world economy entered a new 
phase  of  deglobalisation  in  the  aftermath  of  the  Great  Recession  of  200809.  I  have  first  scrutinized 
and rejected the claim that the data already indicate that the world is deglobalising. Many informative 
measures  of  globalisation  indicate  a  decline  in  the  growth  rate  of  globalisation  ­  a  process  that  The 
Economist  has  cleverly  labelled  as  "slowbalisation"  ­  but  this  slowdown  is  not  particularly  surprising 
given the remarkable and unsustainable period of hyperglobalisation of the late 1980s, 1990s and early 
2000s. I have then analysed the various factors that had led to that earlier expansionary phase,  and I 
have speculated on the extent to which these forces have lost steam or might actually be operating in 
reversal. It is particularly hard to conclude that technological developments are likely to fuel an era of 
deglobalisation,  but  there  are  certainly  more  reasons  for  concern  with  regards  to  policy  factors.  In 
other  words,  the  main  challenge  for  the  future  of  globalisation  is  institutional  and  political  in  nature 
rather  than  technological,  although  new  technologies  might  aggravate  the  trends  in  inequality  that 
have created the current political backlash against globalisation. I have concluded the paper with some 
even  more  speculative  thoughts  on  the  current  global  pandemic  and  the  extent  to  which  it  may 
aggravate  policy  tensions  across  countries  and  further  contribute  to  a  new  era  of  significant 
isolationism, much as the world witnessed in the 20thcentury's Interwar Period. 

Throughout  the  paper,  I  have  attempted  to  draw  my  conclusions  based  on  what  economic  research 
has  taught  us  in  recent  years  on  how  the  world  economy  ­  and  international  trade  and  GVCs  in 
particular  ­  responds  to  economic  crises.  When  it  comes  to  the  COVID19  shock,  however,  the  data  I 
have  used  is  certainly  incomplete  and  imperfect,  and  thus  much  will  be  learned  from  more  detailed 
future studies of the event. The same is true, to some extent, about the recent U.S.­China trade war 
of 201819, the effects of which will be sorted out by trade economists for years to come. In any case, 
and as I have pointed out repeatedly above, the international political landscape in the postCOVID19 
age  is  likely  to  be  crucially  affected  by  the  outcome  of  the  very  recent  presidential  election  in  the 
United  States,  so  my  views  on  the  topic  are  likely  to  be  shaped  by  it  as  well.  As  Keynes  reminded  us 
long ago, it is advisable to let one's opinions change when the facts change.                                                

                                                                                                                     43
