                                           ABSTRACT

We use linked birth and education records from Florida to investigate how the identification of
childhood disabilities varies by race and school racial composition. Using a series of
decompositions, we find that black and Hispanic students are identified with disabilities at lower
rates than are observationally similar white students. Black students are over-identified in schools
with relatively small shares of minorities and substantially under-identified in schools with large
minority shares. We find similar gradients among Hispanic students but opposite patterns among
white students. We provide suggestive evidence that these findings are unlikely to stem from
differential resource allocations, economic characteristics of students, or achievement differences.
Instead, we argue that the results are consistent with a heightened awareness among school
officials of disabilities in students who are racially and ethnically distinct from the majority race
in the school.

1. Introduction

       Disparities across racial groups in economic and educational outcomes have been

stubbornly persistent in the United States. Recent evidence using novel data sources has shown

that the economic mobility of black individuals lags far behind their white peers (Chetty,

Hendren, Jones and Porter, 2018; Bhattacharya and Mazumder, 2011), while large black-white

wage gaps have been documented for decades (e.g., Neal and Johnson, 1996; Oettinger, 1996;

Trejo, 1997; Black et al., 2006; Fryer, Pager, and Spenkuch, 2013; Kriesman and Rangel, 2015).

Some of the disparities in adult outcomes can be traced to early life experiences, including

educational attainment and achievement gaps (Bond and Lang, 2013; Rothstein and Wozny,

2013; Reardon & Galindo, 2009; Card and Rothstein, 2007; Todd and Wolpin, 2007; Fryer and

Levitt, 2004, 2006; Jencks and Phillips, 1998).

       In this study, we focus on another potential early driver of racial gaps in adulthood –

special education identification. Roughly 6.4 million public school students in the U.S. receive

special education services annually, at an estimated cost of nearly $40 billion (National Center

for Education Statistics, 2015). Special education provides a vehicle for accommodations and, in

many cases, treatment for students with learning disabilities. A range of conditions are covered

under the special education umbrella, including speech and language disorders, Autism Spectrum

Disorder (ASD), intellectual disabilities, specific learning disabilities, developmental delay,

Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), sensory disorders, emotional disorders, and

physical disabilities. Students who have one of these disabilities are provided with an

“individualized education plan” (IEP) which outlines the services and accommodations to which

they are legally entitled under the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (IDEA).




                                                  2
         We examine the extent of identification gaps across racial groups conditioning on a rich

set of health and economic endowments, with a focus on how the gaps vary by the racial

composition of schools. The bulk of the previous research in this area considers whether special

education identification rates differ across racial groups in terms of simple means or using basic

control variables. This is in part due to how the Federal government regulates identification gaps,

commonly also referred to as “disproportionality”. The IDEA defines disproportionality based on

ratios of identification rates for different racial groups in a school (or a district). 1 For example, if

15 percent of black students in a school are identified as disabled, compared to 10 and 12 percent

of white and Hispanic students, respectively, IDEA’s 3 pairwise measures of disproportionality

are 1.5, 1.2, and 1.25 (15/12). States have some latitude to determine what defines “significant

disproportionality”. For example, in 2010-2011, Florida’s threshold was 3.5 with a one-year

trigger – meaning that a school must take corrective action if any pairwise ratio was greater than

3.5 in a single year. As a result, 15 of the state’s 72 districts (67 county-level and 5 special) were

forced to implement corrective action in that year (GAO, 2013).

         The existence of disproportionate identification rates in special education by race had

been a concern long before the 1997 amendments to the IDEA first required states to address

disproportionality. Earlier studies consistently showed that black students, in particular, were

often identified with disabilities at higher rates than white students (e.g. Dunn, 1968; National

Research Council, 1982; Chinn and Hughes, 1987; Coutinho & Oswald, 2000). Recent work has

shown that this story becomes more complex after conditioning on economic factors. Studies

using aggregate data typically find evidence of overrepresentation conditional on basic

observable characteristics (Sullivan, 2011; Skiba et al., 2005; Oswald et al., 1999), while


1

relating to disproportionality.

                                                           3
estimates based on individual survey data imply conditional underrepresentation (Morgan et al.,

2012, 2013, 2015, 2017; Shifrer et al., 2011; Hibel et al., 2010).

         To further our understanding of racial disproportionality in disability identification, we

use a rich data source that links education records to birth certificate records for every child born

in Florida between 1992 and 2002. 2 These data provide us with the ability to perform several

novel analyses. First, the birth records include a large set of information on health endowments

and baseline demographics. Previous work has only limited information, if any, on health and

economic endowments. 3 It is also worth noting that controlling for contemporaneous

characteristics, as in some previous studies, runs the risk of introducing endogeneity because

awareness of a child’s disability may influence her parents’ economic and schooling decisions.

The nature of the birth certificate data allows us to condition on initial endowments, substantially

mitigating this concern. Further, it allows us to test whether our estimates are driven by ex-post

school switching of parents by assigning a student to a “pseudo-school” based on their birth

residence.

         Second, the size of our data, which encompasses a decade of births in Florida, allows us

to examine specific disability categories. We estimate gaps for intellectual disabilities,

developmental delays and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), speech/language impairments,

specific learning disabilities (SLD), physical disabilities, and other disabilities.

         Finally, we consider the role that racial segregation plays in the development of

identification gaps. One lingering question in establishing which factors drive disability



2
  We use “special education identification” and “disability” synonymously throughout, following studies such as
Avchen, Scott, and Mason (2001).
3
  For example Morgen et al. (2015) include only an indicator for whether a child was low birth weight, while Hibel
et al. (2010), Shifrer et al. (2011), and Skiba et. al. (2005) do not have access to health information. Morgan et al.
(2012) use the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study – Birth Cohort and are able to include several measures of
health, but they are only able to study placement in early childhood (pre-Kindergarten) programs.

                                                           4
identification is how peers and larger social environments affect who is identified. For example,

Elder and Lubotsky (2009) and Elder (2010) show that a substantial number of ADHD diagnoses

are driven by a child’s age relative to his or her peers in the same grade and school. In this paper,

we focus on the role of a school’s racial composition. Previous work has shown that schools with

high percentages of black students are characterized by low achievement among minority

students (e.g., Hanushek, Kain and Rivkin, 2009), while Bohrnstedt et al. (2015) show evidence

of positive associations between segregation and achievement gaps. However, to our knowledge

there has been no systematic analysis of how segregation across schools relates to racial gaps in

special education identification. Apart from the potential role of resource differences, if the

determination of special education identification is a function of one’s health relative to one’s

peers, and if minorities have relatively poor health endowments, segregation could lead to

underrepresentation of minorities in heavily-minority schools and overrepresentation in heavily-

white schools.

       Through a series of Blinder-Oaxaca decompositions (Blinder, 1973; Oaxaca, 1973), our

estimates show that by fourth grade, black students are no more likely to be unconditionally

identified for special education than are white students. However, the actual disability rate

among black students is 13 percent lower in fourth grade (and 27 percent lower in Kindergarten)

than it would have been if they were identified at the same rate as white students with similar

economic and health endowments. For Hispanics, the overall identification rate is 8 percent

lower than predicted in fourth grade (and 38 percent lower in Kindergarten). These overall gaps

mask substantial heterogeneity across disability categories, with extensive overrepresentation in

some cases and underrepresentation in others.




                                                  5
        We then turn to considering how identification gaps vary with a school’s racial

composition. We find a strong negative association between black and Hispanic identification

rates and the minority share (which we measure as the fraction of students who are black and / or

Hispanic) of the student body. Black and Hispanic students in schools with few minorities tend

to be overrepresented in special education relative to their predicted rates but are

underrepresented in heavily-minority schools. This gradient is particularly large for black

students: in fourth grade, a black student in a school with more than 90 percent minorities is

roughly 9 percentage points less likely to be identified as disabled than an observationally

identical black student in a school with fewer than 10 percent minorities. This is a strikingly

large gradient, given that the overall disability rate among black students is roughly 15.7 percent.

White students exhibit the opposite pattern, in that they are slightly more likely to be identified

as disabled, conditional on their observable characteristics, when they attend heavily-minority

schools than when they attend schools with few minorities.

        Finally, we provide suggestive evidence that the gradient in identification gaps with

respect to school racial composition is a racial phenomenon per se, rather than reflecting

underlying economic factors. For example, to consider the potential role of resources, we study

how gifted identification rates relate to a school’s racial composition, based on the logic that

gifted classifications are similar to disability classifications in that they require additional

resources. We find that, in contrast to the results for disabilities, gifted classifications are sharply

increasing with school minority shares among all racial groups. Further, we find that little of the

gradient in identification gaps with respect to minority shares among black students can be

explained by school-level measures of free/reduced-price lunch (FRL) rates or mothers’

educational attainment. While the gaps are declining in FRL unconditionally, among black



                                                   6
students, the FRL gradient disappears entirely after conditioning on minority shares. Taken

together, these patterns are inconsistent with a large role for resource constraints in the gradients

of identification gaps with respect to school minority shares in Florida, particularly for black

students. We posit that, instead, schools are either more likely to notice actual disabilities or tend

to incorrectly apply disabilities to normal behaviors in students who are racially distinct in

comparison to the student body as a whole.

       Regardless of potential mechanism, our estimates suggest that minority students in

heavily-minority schools are underrepresented in special education relative to their underlying

incidence of disability. If so, their long-term educational outcomes could suffer, as Hanushek,

Kain, and Rivkin (2002) find significant positive effects on mathematics achievement for

students in special education. Similarly, Ballis (2018) finds that marginal students who are

denied special education services are less likely to complete high school and enroll in college.

Nonetheless, a limitation of this study is that the “optimal” identification rate is inherently

unobservable, so we are unable to show definitively whether under- or over-representation is a

problem from the standpoint of improving student performance. We instead follow the existing

literature and focus on the magnitude of differences in identification rates across observationally

identical students. Even so, our results suggest that the implications of underrepresentation for

academic performance among minority students could be substantial.



2. Background on Socioeconomic and Racial Issues in Special Education Identification

       The literature on questions of how the socioeconomic status of students affect the

likelihood of a special education diagnosis is decidedly mixed, which is part of what motivates

our study. While some studies find that low income children are more likely to be referred for



                                                  7
special education (Achilles et al, 2007; Frey, 2002), others find the opposite when accounting for

a variety of other student characteristics (Skiba et al, 2005). However, Elder, Figlio, Imberman

and Persico (2019) compare twins and siblings and show that a variety of neonatal health

characteristics (but particularly birth weight) strongly predicts the likelihood of childhood

disability across socioeconomic conditions, implying that socioeconomic status alone does not

drive disability status.

        Another factor that could influence disability referral is the race match between students

and teachers. While there are few papers on whether black students are more likely to be referred

for special education when taught by a white teacher than when taught by a black teacher, two

qualitative studies find that the best predictors of teachers’ referral judgments for special

education are the presence of behavioral problems and academic competence. Students’

demographic characteristics were not statistically significant predictors of special education

referrals (Abidin and Robinson, 2002; Gottlieb and Weinberg, 1999). On the other hand, a

qualitative study by Tobias (1982) finds that teachers are more likely to recommend special

education referrals for students whose ethnic background differed from their own. Studies using

random assignment have showed that teachers exhibit bias in their special education evaluations

of non-white children (Prieto & Zucker, 1981; Zucker & Prieto, 1977).

        While there is some evidence that there could be differences in the stigma associated with

some types of disabilities across ethnic categories (Harry, 1992; Mascayano et al, 2016), the

evidence is again mixed. For example, Zuckerman et al (2014) shows that in some cases

providers dismissed Hispanic parents’ concerns about their children’s development. While other

studies document stigma regarding disability diagnoses in Hispanic communities, it is unclear

whether the same level of stigma exists in white communities. Unfortunately, we are unable to



                                                  8
test whether stigma or teacher bias are mechanisms that drive our results since we lack data on

both teacher race and how communities interpret diagnoses with various disabilities. However,

some of these factors might explain the results we find below.


3. Special Education in Florida

         The IDEA requires the provision of a “free and appropriate public education” to students

with special needs. This phrase, and the wider law, is the lynchpin for special education services

in the U.S. Nonetheless, states vary considerably in how they direct special education funding,

the services provided, and how students are evaluated. In Florida, as in most states, identification

for special education, which is established by the production of an individualized education plan

(IEP), is jointly determined by parents, teachers, and administrators. Often the process is initiated

at the request of a parent or teacher, which leads to the possibility that parents who are more

active in their children’s schooling would be more likely to advocate for an IEP. Further,

teachers may differ in their propensity to identify disabilities. For example, Sideridis et al. (2008)

find that male teachers are twice as likely to identify a student with a learning disability as are

female teachers. These factors suggest that there is likely a substantial amount of variability in

identification relative to the underlying incidence of disability.

         Funding for special education in Florida comes from a mix of local and state sources.

Since 2001 each district receives a lump-sum amount called the “Exceptional Student Education

(ESE) Guaranteed Allocation.” 4 The exact amount provided to each district is based on projected

growth in exceptional student population relative to overall student population rather than actual

enrollment. Districts also receive an additional per-student allotment for students with



4
  The State of Florida uses the term “exceptional students” to include both students with an IEP and students
identified as gifted and talented.

                                                          9
exceptionally severe disabilities. These funding formulas substantially limit the incentives of

districts to increase special education identification for marginal students to secure additional

funding, as the district is essentially responsible for the entire marginal cost of providing services

to a student. Further, even for the average ESE student, the state covers a relatively small portion

of the additional costs. In 2009, the most recent year for which data on spending by ESE status is

available, the average school spent $6,117 more on an ESE student than on a regular program

student. In that year, the Guaranteed Allocation only provided an average of $2,081 per ESE

student. 5

         Rules regarding racial gaps also vary by state, but as noted above, IDEA requires states to

monitor and correct disproportionality. Prior to 2004, districts with significant disproportionality

were mandated to review their policies and adopt new policies to reduce the disproportionality.

However, in 2004 the law was amended to require school districts exceeding the thresholds to set

aside 15% of their IDEA funding to provide early intervention services, with the goal of reducing

identification rates in highly-identified groups. This financial penalty can be a substantial – in

Florida, IDEA funding accounted for $604 million in 2010-11, which was 34% of all Federal

funding. 6 Hence, districts have strong financial incentives to limit the size of identification gaps

by reducing identification rates in overrepresented groups. 7 These incentives may generate

suboptimal outcomes if overrepresentation of a racial group reflects students who would

  Research has previously shown that special education identification is influenced by financial incentives (Cullen,
2003), while seemingly innocuous regulations that require interventions if special education rates exceed thresholds
have the unintended effect of reducing rates through manipulation of diagnoses (Ballis, 2018; Rosenthal, 2016).

potentially benefit from special education services but do not receive those services when

districts respond to IDEA.

         In sum, the funding environment in Florida in the period that we study does not provide

schools with incentives to identify students with disabilities if the school does not view them as

genuinely disabled. Combined with the incentives embedded in IDEA, theoretically we would

expect schools and districts to attempt to reduce identification rates among minority groups.



4. Data and Descriptive Statistics

         Our data include a unique merger of information from the Florida Education Data

Warehouse, maintained by the Florida Department of Education, and birth records from Florida’s

Bureau of Vital Statistics. The linked records include all children born in the state of Florida

from 1992 to 2002 who were enrolled at any time from the 1995-96 through 2012-13 school

years. These data were merged based on last name, first name, date of birth, and Social Security

Number, and all records were de-identified before being provided to the research team.

Ultimately, 80.7% of birth records were later matched to a record in the education data. Figlio et

al. (2014) and Autor et al. (2015) provide further details on the match quality and matching

algorithm. Both of these studies compare the matched data to information in the American

Community Survey and the Census of Population from 2000 to 2009 and find that the match

rates are close to the proportion of students born in Florida who subsequently enroll in public

schools in Florida (80.9%), suggesting a high match quality. 8




8
 Note that the denominator in the Census / ACS analysis does not include children who were born in Florida but
subsequently left the country, while the denominator in the Florida analysis necessarily does, as we do not know
where Florida-born children live if they are not enrolled in public schools in Florida. As a result, the two groups are
not identical.

                                                          11
         In total, the data includes 1.6 million individual students. However, we restrict our

analysis samples to include only singletons observed in both Kindergarten and fourth grade in

order to maintain a balanced sample across grades, leaving us with 869,000 students. 9 Using

these data, we focus on characteristics of children at birth, including both health and economic

variables, along with detailed data on the identification of students for special education services

under various categorizations. 10 The birth certificate data includes a wealth of information about

both child and maternal health status at birth and during the pregnancy. This information

includes birth weight, gestational age, APGAR scores (a test of a newborn’s responsiveness at

one and five minutes after birth), the mother’s prior births, and diagnosis codes for congenital

anomalies, abnormal conditions, complications during delivery, and the mother’s pregnancy-

related health diagnoses. 11

         The birth records also include demographic and economic characteristics of both the

child and the mother, which we use to control for economic endowments. These characteristics

include child gender, month and year of birth, mother’s marital status, mother’s educational

attainment, mother’s race, mother’s immigration status, language spoken at home, and the

mother’s zip code of residence when the child was born. 12 For child’s race, we use racial

indicators from education records, which include mutually exclusive indicators for black, white,




9
  A concern with restricting to those students observed in Kindergarten is that Kindergarten attendance is optional in
Florida. This does not appear to have any impact on our results, as models that restrict to being observed in first and
fourth grade provide nearly identical estimates.
10
   A student is defined as being in special education if he or she has an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) under
the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act.
11
   By restricting to public school students, we are missing a subset of students who tend to have higher
socioeconomic status. While most studies that rely on education records cannot show this pattern directly, the birth
records allow us to do so. Online Appendix Table A1 shows estimates of the relationship between being included in
the education sample and economic and health measures in the Vital Statistics data. Children of lower educated,
minority, and unmarried mothers are more likely to be in the sample, as are children who have longer gestational
terms.
12
   All of these variables come from the vital statistics except for home language, which comes from school records.

Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, and Native American. For this study, we exclude the small

numbers of Asian/Pacific Islanders (2.0% in 2004) and Native Americans (0.3% in 2004) so that

we only examine the gaps between white, black and Hispanic children. It is important to note

that we must restrict our analyses to native-born children; this limitation is particularly important

for estimating identification gaps for Hispanics, as we necessarily exclude a large portion of the

Hispanic population who are themselves immigrants.

       Table 1 provides health and economic endowment statistics for our sample by racial

category, revealing some notable differences by race / ethnicity. First, black students have an

average birth weight of 3170 grams, which is roughly 6-7 percent lower than the average birth

weights among Hispanic and white students. Elder, Figlio, Imberman, and Persico (2018) show

that a birth weight deficit of this size implies a 0.8 percentage-point increase in disability rates,

suggesting that disparities in health endowments across race / ethnicity may play a substantive

role in special education gaps. Relative to white students, black students also have slightly lower

gestational ages, higher rates of maternal anemia, and higher rates of meconium in gestational

fluid. On the other hand, white students have higher rates of assisted ventilation (which may

reflect higher-quality medical care rather than worse health) and breech births. For Hispanics,

health endowments are generally better than those for both black and white students. In terms of

socioeconomic measures, as expected, black students have the lowest education levels, age at

birth, and marriage rates, followed by Hispanics and then whites. Hispanics have by far the

lowest level of English as the home language.

       To measure disability status, we use information on the child’s special education

identification in each year from Kindergarten through fourth grade. Figure 1 shows a listing of

the disability categories used by the Florida Department of Education during our sample period.



                                                  13
Since many of these conditions are relatively rare, we aggregate them into a six larger categories:

intellectual disabilities (W); physical disabilities (C - “orthopedically impaired”; H - “deaf or

hard of hearing”; I - “visually impaired”); speech and language impairments (SLI) include F -

“speech impaired” and G -“language impaired”; specific learning disabilities (SLD) correspond

to code K; developmental delays or Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) correspond to codes T and

P; and finally we aggregate all remaining classifications other than “gifted” into a single “other”

category. Note that in Florida, attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity

disorder are typically placed in category V (“other health impairments”), which we include in

this residual category.

       Table 2 provides disability rates by race along with school racial compositions. We

calculate racial composition as the percent of a student’s Kindergarten cohort that belongs to

each racial / ethnic group. We focus on the Kindergarten cohort rather than the student’s current

composition to minimize the risk of ex-post endogenous movements of students to new schools

in response to disability diagnoses (we return to this issue below). On average, black students

attend schools that are heavily black, while Hispanic students attend schools that are heavily

Hispanic. However, Figure 2 provides more detailed context to these school-level racial

distributions while highlighting a key source of variation used in this study. The figure shows

that black, Hispanic, and white students in Florida experience a wide distribution of experiences

in terms of racial composition of their schools. Importantly, there appears to be substantial

density of all races in schools with low or high same-race or combined black/Hispanic shares.

       Returning to Table 2, disability rate differences by race depend on grade and type of

disability. For any disability, black and Hispanic students start out with lower rates than white

students in Kindergarten, but by fourth grade white and black students are roughly at parity, with



                                                 14
Hispanic disability rates slightly lower. Nonetheless, minorities are less likely than white

students to be identified for speech and language impairment (SLI / ASD) but more likely to be

identified with an SLD. Other conditions do not substantially vary across races in Kindergarten,

but by fourth grade black students have substantially higher intellectual and “other” disability

rates than both whites and Hispanics.



5. Empirical Methods

         To measure the effects of race and school racial composition on special education

placement rates, we start with simple linear probability models that relate child-level special

education indicators to the characteristics described above. Consider the following model:

(1)      𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖 = 𝑿𝑿𝒊𝒊 𝜱𝜱𝒓𝒓(𝒊𝒊) + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖 ,

where 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖 is an indicator for whether student i is placed into special education (or a specific

category thereof). The vector 𝑿𝑿 denotes the socioeconomic and health characteristics of the

student derived from birth certificate and schooling data, and 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖 represents unobservable

determinants of special education placement. 13

         Our goal is to compare “predicted” and actual special education identification rates across

racial / ethnic groups and by school composition. To do so, we follow the approach of Blinder-

Oaxaca decompositions and estimate race-specific parameters 𝚽𝚽𝒓𝒓(𝒊𝒊) . Taking as an example the

decomposition of the black-white gap, we denote ΦB and 𝚽𝚽𝑾𝑾 as the vector of parameters for



13
  In our full models, the variables in 𝑿𝑿 include a quartic in birth weight; gestation length; indicators for Apgar
scores of 8 or lower, 9 or 10, or missing for both 1 minute and 5 minute tests; indicators for requiring assisted
ventilation for less than or greater than 30 minutes; other birth abnormalities; maternal anemia, diabetes,
hypertension, or other pregnancy related health conditions; meconium; premature membrane rupture; breech birth;
other labor/delivery complications; any congenital anomalies; indicators for parity up to 4th plus or missing; a
quadratic in mother’s age; child gender; mother’s immigration status; mother’s education – HS, some college,
college grad; and whether the mother is married.

                                                         15
black and white students, respectively. We decompose the gap in average special education

placement rates as follows:

(2)              𝐸𝐸(𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖 |𝑟𝑟(𝑖𝑖) = 𝐵𝐵) − 𝐸𝐸(𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖 |𝑟𝑟(𝑖𝑖) = 𝑊𝑊)
                           = [ 𝐸𝐸(𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖 |𝑟𝑟(𝑖𝑖) = 𝐵𝐵) − 𝐸𝐸(𝑿𝑿′ 𝒊𝒊 |𝑟𝑟(𝑖𝑖) = 𝐵𝐵)𝜱𝜱𝑾𝑾 ] +
                                              [𝐸𝐸(𝑿𝑿′ 𝒊𝒊 |𝑟𝑟(𝑖𝑖) = 𝐵𝐵)𝜱𝜱𝑾𝑾 − 𝐸𝐸(𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖 |𝑟𝑟(𝑖𝑖) = 𝑊𝑊)].

The first term to the right of the equality in (2) captures how much of the gap is due to

differences in the coefficients, i.e., the unexplained component. 14 This term reflects the average

difference between actual identification rates for black students and the predicted rates – based

on observable characteristics – if they had been white instead. The last term in (3) is often

described as the “explained component”, which in this context measures how much of the gap

can be explained by differences in observable characteristics, as scaled by the white students’

coefficients 𝚽𝚽𝑾𝑾 .

        In our model, 𝑿𝑿 includes a large number of health and economic endowments. For health

endowments we use a quartic in birth weight, gestational age, APGAR scores at 1 and 5 minutes,

birth abnormalities (assisted ventilation for less than 30 minute, for more than 30 minutes, and

other abnormalities), mother’s pregnancy-related health (anemia, diabetes, hypertension, other),

labor and delivery complications (meconium, premature membrane rupture, breech birth, other),

and congenital anomalies. Economic variables include mother’s educational attainment, mother’s

immigrant status, and mother’s marital status. All models also include indicators for child’s

gender and parity (birth order), a quadratic in mother’s age, and indicators for birth cohort and

birth month. We also provide models that include zip code of birth fixed effects.




14
   As Blinder (1973) and Oaxaca (1973) both describe, the decomposition shown in expression (2) is not unique.
One obvious alternative decomposition involves using black students’ coefficients to measure the endowment effect.
For our purposes, however, the use of white students as a “baseline group” arguably makes more sense than the
alternatives.

                                                           16
        Our primary interest lies in assessing the extent to which racial differences in economic,

social and health characteristics “explain” racial differences in special education classification. In

order to do so, we first estimate specification (1) using white students only, then we calculate

predicted special education placement rates for black or Hispanic students. Specifically,

estimates of 𝚽𝚽𝑾𝑾 allow us to predict the probability of identification for each black and Hispanic

student based on their demographic and health characteristics, using white students’ mapping

from these characteristics to placement rates. We next subtract the predicted identification

likelihood from the actual identification incidence for each black or Hispanic student and

average across all students. These “unexplained” identification gaps tell us how much higher or

lower we would expect the identification rate for a group of minority students to be if they were

identified at a rate similar to white students with the same characteristics – that is, the extent of

the conditionally disproportional identification. Positive values indicate that the racial group is

overrepresented, so that identification rates are higher than predicted, while negative values

indicate the group is underrepresented. In order to conduct inference on the estimated explained

and unexplained gaps shown in (2), we use clustered bootstraps, resampling at the school

district-birth cohort level in each replication.

        Our analyses based on specification (2) do not imply causal effects on disability

identification, but are instead linear prediction exercises. Specifically, unobservable determinants

of disability identification might be related to the corresponding observable characteristics. Most

importantly, white and minority students with identical observable characteristics might have

systematically different latent needs for special education services. We return to this issue below

in Section 7, in which we explore the extent to which unobservable differences across




                                                   17
observationally identical groups of students might generate misleading inferences about the role

of race in disability identification.

        Along with estimating how identification rates vary with race, we seek to assess whether

gaps in identification relate to the racial composition, economic composition, and resource

allocations of schools and districts. Specifically, we ask whether two observationally identical

students have different identification likelihoods if they are enrolled in different schools. There

may be systematic differences across schools and districts in the identification of special

education students, and such differences may be partly responsible for variation across schools

and districts in racial achievement gaps.

        An important issue arises when comparing identification patterns across schools:

students’ latent need for special education services might lead parents to choose schools based on

the available resources for addressing special education needs. If so, students who need special

education services would attend schools with more resources, inducing spurious correlations

between the likelihood of special education identification and school characteristics (such as

racial distributions). To address this complication, below we use the location of the student’s

residence at birth to generate measures of predicted school racial composition. The key insight to

this strategy is that residence of birth is measured prior to parents’ knowledge of a child’s

disabilities, so it is arguably exogenous to those aspects of school choice that are driven by

disabilities. 15 The Florida data include location of residence at the zip code level. Because school

and zip code boundaries are not coterminous, we generate predicted school-level variables by zip

code as a function of the share of students born in each zip code who attend each school,



15
   One exception to this would be a congenital anomaly like Down syndrome that can be diagnosed while the child
is in the womb. Nonetheless, this is arguably a negligible concern since it is unlikely that parents would change
residences prior to birth in order to ensure receipt of services five years later.

                                                        18
including both traditional public and charter schools. We then use these predicted values in place

of the actual school composition. This strategy allows us to abstract from non-random sorting

into schools by students and parents in response to how well schools and districts serve students

with disabilities.



6. Results

A. Average Identification Gaps

        We start our analysis by investigating Blinder-Oaxaca decompositions of racial gaps in

special education identification for the full Florida sample. We study identification in

Kindergarten and fourth grade, two points that span most of primary school and potentially

capture different disability conditions. In both of these grade levels, we are assured of having all

of the birth cohorts linked to education records; not all birth cohorts appear in grades five and

beyond. Table 3 shows our disproportionality estimates for black students relative to what we

would predict if they were identified at rates of observably similar white students. Starting with

any disability, columns (1)-(3) show that unconditional identification rates in Kindergarten are

2.5 percentage points lower among black students than white students, indicating that blacks are

underrepresented in special education overall.

        We next estimate predicted identification rates among black students if they were

identified at the same rate as white students with the same observable characteristics. Column (4)

shows that this predicted identification rate is 0.125; this is larger than the actual identification

rate among whites of 0.116 shown in column (2), reflecting that black students are disadvantaged

on the basis of observable characteristics that predict identification among white students. As

column (5) shows, the gap between the actual and predicted black identification rates is -0.034,



                                                  19
which is roughly 38 percent of the baseline identification rate of 0.090 among black students. In

other words, estimates from specification (1) suggest that black students are underrepresented by

38 percent, given their observable characteristics. 16

         Turning to fourth grade, columns (1) and (2) of panel B show little evidence of a raw

black-white identification gap. However, the predicted gap in column (5) is -0.023. Overall, after

accounting for observable health and economic differences between black and white students,

there is modest but statistically significant underrepresentation of black students in special

education in fourth grade equal to 15 percent of the baseline black rate, consistent with the

findings of recent literature. 17

         The remaining rows of Table 3 consider the gaps in specific categories of disability.

Focusing on fourth grade, most disabilities fall into the categories of SLI and SLD. Black

students are conditionally underrepresented in SLI, SLD, ASD, and physical disabilities by

roughly similar proportions. 18 For intellectual disabilities, however, black students are noticeably

overrepresented. Accounting for the health and economic characteristics reduces the size of the

raw black-white gap by one-fifth, but the remaining unexplained gap is 44 percent of the baseline

identification rate. It is possible that unobserved black-white endowment differences may explain

overrepresentation in this category, but such differences would have to be both large and

fundamentally different from Hispanic-white differences; as we show below, there is essentially




16
   Throughout the paper, we interpret negative values as underrepresentation and positive values as
overrepresentation.
17
   We also estimated models that include zip code fixed effects. These fixed effects, while accounting for additional
socio-economic differences, also may remove some variation in underlying disability rates that are correlated with
geographic clustering into schools. Hence, our preferred models do not include them. Nonetheless, inclusion of these
fixed effects have little impact on the estimates in Table 3. In particular the estimates for any disability are -0.026
and -0.021 for Kindergarten and 4th grade, respectively.
18
   Developmental delay identifications are universally removed or changed after first grade, so all fourth grade
students in this category have an Autism Spectrum Disorder identification.

                                                          20
no Hispanic-white gap in intellectual disability rates, in spite of Hispanics being relatively

disadvantaged along many of the same dimensions as black children.

         In sum, black students appear to be underrepresented overall in special education in

Florida relative to observably similar whites, but they are considerably overrepresented in

intellectual disabilities. In the two most empirically relevant disability categories, SLI and SLD,

conditioning on the information available on students’ birth records increases the implied

underrepresentation.

         In Table 4, we repeat this analysis with Hispanic students. The patterns for Hispanic-

white gaps are largely similar in direction to those for the black-white gaps, but the gaps are

smaller in magnitude in fourth grade. For any disability, we estimate that there is

underrepresentation of 3.0 percentage points in Kindergarten (40 percent of the baseline rate for

Hispanics), but only 1.1 percentage points in fourth grade (8 percent). 19 The small overall gap in

fourth grade primarily reflects underrepresentation in SLI and a slight overrepresentation in

SLD. Further, unlike black students, Hispanics are not overrepresented in intellectual disabilities.

The fact that Hispanics are substantially underrepresented in SLI may reflect difficulties schools

have in assessing these concerns for foreign language speakers. Nonetheless, overall, while the

estimates are statistically significant and sizable for certain conditions, there is little indication of

consistent underrepresentation or overrepresentation of Hispanics relative to whites conditional

on health and economic endowments.



B. Racial Segregation and Identification Gaps




19
  When zip code fixed effects are included, the estimates are smaller but qualitatively similar at -0.016 and -0.006
for Kindergarten and 4th grade, respectively.

                                                         21
       We now examine how disproportionalities in special education identification vary across

the racial composition of schools. We focus on fourth grade hereafter, providing results for

Kindergarten in the Online Appendix. Figure 3 shows results for students with any disability.

The top panels show how actual (solid line) and predicted (dotted line) disability rates vary with

the percent of a student’s Kindergarten cohort who are minorities (black or Hispanic). We

estimate the predicted values from decompositions using the variables described in Section 4.

The bottom panels combine these to show the identification gaps (actual minus predicted) with

95% confidence intervals generated from 100 bootstrap replications. Negative values indicate

underrepresentation while positive values indicate overrepresentation. We show these values

separately for black, Hispanic, and white students. Note that since the decomposition uses the

white group as the baseline, on average there is no difference between actual and predicted rates

for white students; however, gaps can emerge within subsets of schools such as those defined by

different racial compositions.

       Importantly, we intentionally exclude racial composition from the conditioning set in the

decomposition. We do so in order to have a consistent baseline comparison across schools in

order to assess the role that racial composition plays in the appearance of identification gaps.

That is, by excluding these measures, the gap estimates for two observationally identical black

students in schools with different racial compositions are relative to the same observationally

equivalent white student. If we included racial composition, then the gap for a black student in a

heavily-minority school would be defined relative to observationally equivalent white students in

heavily-minority schools, while the gap for a black student in a mostly-white school would be

defined relative to observationally similar white students in mostly-white schools. As a result, we

could not make meaningful comparisons between the two estimated gaps.



                                                 22
         The left panels of Figure 3 shows the results for black students. The identification gap

exhibits a clear negative gradient. In schools with fewer than 10 percent minority students, a

black student is 3.8 percentage points more likely to be identified as disabled than an

observationally equivalent white student. This value steadily decreases as the minority share of a

school grows, so that a black student in a school with more than 90 percent minority students is

5.3 percentage points less likely to be identified than an observationally equivalent white student.

The gradient is roughly linear, implying that for every 10-point increase in the minority share,

underrepresentation among black students increases by approximately 0.9 percentage points.

Black students tend to be underrepresented in special education in mixed and heavily minority

schools (with 40 percent or higher minority shares) and overrepresented in schools with few

minority peers.

         The middle columns of the figure show results for Hispanics. As was the case for black

students, we find evidence of overrepresentation in schools with few minorities and

underrepresentation in schools with relatively high minority shares, but the gradient is flatter.

Students in schools with fewer than 10 percent minority peers are overrepresented by 2.0

percentage points – roughly half the analogous figure for black students – while those in schools

that are 90 percent or more minority are slightly underrepresented by 2.0 percentage points. 20

         We turn to white students in the final column. Note that the overall average gap for white

students is zero by construction, but because we do not condition on minority share in the school

in the decompositions, there can be differences in the estimated gaps for different racial




20
  One potential explanation for why the gradient for black students is steeper than for Hispanic students is that black
students are more likely to be native English speakers. In Figure A1 of the Online Appendix, we examine whether
there are differences in the gradients for both black and Hispanic students by whether their home language is
English. While there are shifts in the level of disproportionality, there are no changes in the gradients for either black
or Hispanic children, implying that English ability is unlikely to be driving the differences shown in Figure 3.

                                                           23
compositions. Interestingly, we see the little difference in predicted gaps for white students in

high or low minority schools. Across the school racial distribution, the difference between the

largest and smallest gap estimates is 2.1 percentage points; this is in contrast to 4.1 and 9.1

percentage points for Hispanics and black students, respectively.

         In sum, Figure 3 shows that minorities tend to be overrepresented in special education in

schools where there are few minorities, but there is little gradient for white students. 21 Further, it

appears that conditional under/overrepresentation of white students in special education is far

less sensitive to racial composition than that for Hispanic and black students.

         In all of these cases, we use white students as the baseline group for the decomposition.

In Online Appendix Figure A4, we examine the sensitivity of our findings to the choice of

alternative baselines. The left panels show results using black students as the baseline, while the

right panels use Hispanic students as the baseline. While there are some level shifts in

comparison to Figure 3, there is little change in the gradient with respect to minority share for all

three racial groups. Similarly, in Online Appendix Figure A5, we restrict the baseline group to

only those white students in schools with fewer than 10% minority students, which allows us to

use a relatively homogenous baseline group that experiences little variation in school racial

composition. Again, we see similar gradients to those shown in Figure 4.

         Figures 4 and 5 show analogous results for the two largest categories of disability in

fourth grade, specific learning disabilities (SLD) and speech and language impairments (SLI).

Figure 4 shows that for black students much of the negative association between identification



21
   Figure A2 in the Online Appendix shows analogous results based on models that include zip code fixed effects.
The overall patterns shown there are similar to those shown in Figure 3, though the Hispanic gap gradient is slightly
weaker. Figure A3 shows results for Kindergarten. In general, the gradient is flatter for black students and similar
for Hispanics and whites but show the same general patterns. Further, we see no overrepresentation in Kindergarten
for any minority share.


                                                         24
gaps and school minority shares is driven by SLD. While there are small negative gradients for

SLI and other disabilities, these are much smaller than that for SLD. It is also worth noting that

both ASD and physical disabilities show little evidence of significant under- or over-

representation (shown in Online Appendix Figures A6 and A8). Although we are wary of

drawing firm conclusions from these relatively rare conditions, both are severe and arguably

more “objectively” defined than conditions such as SLD. Thus, most of the racial composition

gradient appears to operate through relatively subjective conditions.

       For Hispanics, on the other hand, SLD play a relatively small role in the racial

composition gradient, which operates almost entirely through SLI. Hence, the primary difference

between black and Hispanic students is that black identification rates for SLD, intellectual and

emotional/behavioral disabilities (shown in Online Appendix Figures A7 and A9) are

particularly sensitive to the racial composition of the school. Finally, for white students, there are

small positive gradients with respect to minority shares for ASD and “other” disabilities (in

Online Appendix Figure A10), and a negative gradient for SLI.

       In Figures 6 and 7, we explore the dynamic patterns of racial gaps in special education

for black students. In Figure 6 we show models that first restrict to students who are not disabled

in the given grade, then estimate predicted values for all black students using white students as

the baseline group, and finally generate actual minus predicted gaps by minority share in the

school. Thus, the figure considers the rate at which black students are identified for any disability

relative to predicted rates, given that they were not already identified. While the identification

hazards in mostly-white schools do not evolve much over time, in heavily-minority schools black

students become increasingly under-represented over time through third grade. That trend

slightly reverses in fourth grade.



                                                 25
        Figure 7 instead conditions on students who are identified in the given grade – thereby

providing de-identification hazards. These patterns mirror those in Figure 6, in that black

students exit special education relative to their predicted rate far more slowly in low-minority

schools, so that they are over-represented by grades 3 and 4. Overall, these figures show that

black students in heavily-minority schools are less likely than black students in mostly-white

schools to be placed in special education if they are not identified early and are kept in special

education longer if they are identified early. 22



C. Contributions of Different Background Variables

        Figure 8 shows the estimated identification gaps by minority share when different subsets

of the conditioning variables are included in the decomposition. This allows us to investigate

what roles each type of variable might play in the identification gaps. The left panel shows

results for black students. Focusing first on gap estimates with no conditioning variables (i.e., the

average black identification rate for each minority share minus the grand mean, labeled “No

Controls” in the figure), students in only the highest minority-share schools tend to be identified

at lower than average rates. However, as one accounts for observable characteristics, this

underrepresentation emerges at lower and lower minority shares. Accounting for observables

shifts the identification gaps downward by 2 to 3 percentage points across the minority share

distribution. This is a sizable shift given that baseline identification rates are 15 percent, and it

suggests that our conditioning variables account for a substantial amount of variation in special




22
 Results for Hispanics are provided in Online Appendix Figures A11 and A12 and show qualitatively similar, but
much more muted, patterns with generally statistically insignificant differences by racial composition.

                                                      26
education identification. While the observables have a noticeable effect on identification of black

students, they do not appear to change the overall gradient with respect to minority share. 23

         Considering the roles of specific sets of controls, the health variables account for nearly

the entire downward shift shown in the “All controls” line. Economic variables, basic

demographics, and zip code fixed effects contribute as well, but neonatal health appears to have

its own independent contribution beyond these economic and demographic factors. This

highlights the importance of being able to account for health factors when measuring

disproportionality.

         Panel B shows the same results for Hispanics. Using all conditioning variables except for

zip code fixed effects shifts the gap in the same direction as for black students. Nonetheless,

some variables work in different directions: basic demographics (parity, mom’s age, gender)

shift the gaps downwards (towards more underrepresentation), while economic factors and

cohort and month effects shift the gaps upwards (toward more overrepresentation). While zip

code of birth provides little additional information for black students beyond the basic economic

measures, for Hispanics they are important, particularly in heavily-minority schools. As a result,

accounting for residence at birth substantially reduces the underrepresentation estimates for

Hispanics in heavily-minority schools.

         We further break these estimates down in Online Appendix Figure A14, which highlights

the value of the birth records by investigating the contributions of the various health measures.

The figures show that after conditioning on baseline characteristics, the inclusion of birth weight


23
   In Online Appendix Figure A13 we show these breakdowns for three categories – SLD, intellectual disability, and
“other” disabilities – where the observables appear to have the most explanatory power. In all three of these cases,
the health and economic variables generate large downward shifts for black students. For Hispanics, there are large
changes for SLD and intellectual disabilities, but the shifts vary in sign. Two notable patterns emerge. First, as in the
“any disability” figures, there are no changes in the slope of the gradient except for when we condition on zip code
fixed effects for Hispanics. Second, for Hispanics the observables play only a minor role in “other disabilities,”
which includes behavioral/emotional disabilities and ADD/ADHD, but they play large roles for black students.

                                                           27
shifts the gaps downward considerably for black students, though additional health variables

have little further impact. For Hispanics the health variable contributions are considerably

smaller. It is also worth noting that the health variables seem to affect the level but not the

gradient with respect to school minority shares.

         Online Appendix Figure A15 also shows how observable characteristics of students relate

to school racial compositions. Based on five observable maternal and birth characteristics, the

figure shows that average socioeconomic conditions worsen for all groups as minority shares

increase. For example, for black children, estimates from linear plots imply that a 50 percentage-

point increase in minority share is associated with a 0.24-year decrease in average maternal age

at birth, 0.35 fewer years of average maternal education, and a 6.5 percentage-point reduction in

maternal marriage rates at birth. The analogous values for Hispanic children are even larger than

for black children. On the other hand, the gradients with respect to both birth weight and

gestational age are no larger for Hispanics than for black children.



D. Ex-Post Selection

         One potential source of bias that could affect our estimates is that parents may change

schools after they discover their child has a disability in order to better match the student’s

needs. 24 If the tendency to change schools is related to racial composition of the school, this

could introduce spurious correlations between disability rates and school characteristics. We are

able to use a unique feature of our data – information on the zip code of residence at birth – to

address this source of potential bias. To do this, we create “pseudo schools” based on where


24
  A related issue is that school switching itself could affect identification. Our data show mixed evidence of this
phenomenon. While transition rates into special education are lower for students who switch than those who stay in
the same school (0.84% vs. 1.29%), exit rates out of disability status are higher for switchers than stayers (1.07% vs.
0.67%). It is unclear what implications these patterns have for the role of mobility in classification.

                                                          28
students would have enrolled had they remained in the school local to their birth residence.

Because zip codes are not coterminous with school zones, we assign the student a weighted

average of racial compositions for Kindergarten cohorts across all students born in the same zip

code and year. Specifically, we calculate

(3)      𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑧𝑧𝑧𝑧 = ∑𝐽𝐽𝑗𝑗=1 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑧𝑧𝑧𝑧𝑧𝑧 𝑥𝑥 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 .

Thus, the pseudo-school race share is calculated by multiplying the share of students in each zip

code z and birth cohort c who attend a given school j, 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑧𝑧𝑧𝑧𝑧𝑧 , by

𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 , the share of students in that school who are of a particular race / ethnicity,

and then summing over all schools in the zip code. For example, to create the fraction of black

students in a pseudo-school, we calculate a weighted average of the fraction of black students in

each actual school, with weights given by the share of students who attend that school in

Kindergarten. Because the vast majority of disabilities are diagnosed after birth, this measure

provides us with estimates of school-level racial shares that are exogenous to parental decisions

that respond to disability status.

        Figure 9 provides the results from these analyses. We present results for pseudo-schools

with minority shares up to 80 percent because few pseudo-schools have minority shares above

that level. Nonetheless, the patterns for black students are similar to those shown in Figure 3.

Specifically, there is a sizeable negative gradient in the raw-predicted gap, implying

overrepresentation for black students in low-minority schools and underrepresentation in

heavily-minority schools. For Hispanics, the negative gradient is smaller, but apparent for

pseudo-schools with more than 10 percent minorities. For white students, the estimated actual-

predicted gaps disappear regardless of the school racial distribution. This suggests that ex-post

school switching is likely more common for white students, which could reflect that white


                                                                    29
families have resources that facilitate residential moves. More importantly, our results for black

and Hispanic students appear to be robust to accounting for ex-post residential movement in

response to disability diagnoses.


E. Race versus Economic Conditions

       To this point, we have focused on how identification gaps vary by the racial composition

of the school. While there is a clear negative gradient between identification net of predicted

rates and minority shares, a school’s racial composition might be a proxy for other school

characteristics. While we cannot rule out all potential factors for which race is a proxy, the most

likely measures would be economic conditions and resources available to schools. In Figure 10,

we illustrate this possibility by plotting achievement gaps relative to the share of students eligible

for free or reduced-price lunch (FRL). While all three gaps are relatively flat among schools that

are less than 50% FRL, a negative gradient for both blacks and Hispanics emerges for schools

that are more than 50% FRL, while a positive gradient emerges for white students. The apparent

similarity of Figures 3 and 10 highlights the possibility that some of the minority share gradients

reflect economic conditions.

       In order to further investigate the roles of racial composition and economic conditions,

we generate two new variables. First, we generate residuals from a regression of percent FRL in

a school-cohort on quartics in the minority share to create “residualized percent FRL”. Second,

we regress the minority shares in a school-cohort on the percent of mothers who are college

graduates, the percent of mothers who are college dropouts, and a quartic in the percent FRL to

create “residualized minority shares”. If racial factors drive the patterns in Figure 3, we would

expect to see the same patterns using residualized (rather than raw) minority shares. Instead, if




                                                 30
economic factors play a major role, we would expect to see similar patterns for residualized

percent FRL.

       Figure 11 presents the results from these decompositions. Panel A shows disability rates

and gaps as a function of residualized percent FRL (because the residualized measure is mean-

zero by construction, we add the overall sample mean of the percent FRL measure to all values

when creating the figure). While a negative gradient remains for Hispanics, suggesting that the

Hispanic gap primarily stems from school-level economic factors, for black students – where the

racial composition gradient is most pronounced – the gradient is actually positive. Specifically,

black students in poorer schools net of racial composition are identified at rates equal to

observationally-equivalent white children, while black children in relatively wealthy schools

(again, net of racial composition) tend to be underrepresented. Panel B shows the results for

residualized minority shares. In this case, we see a strong negative gradient for black students,

with little gradient overall for Hispanic or white students. These figures strongly suggest that

underrepresentation of black students in heavily-minority schools is due to factors more closely

aligned with racial composition than with economic status, at least as measured by school-level

measures of FRL status and maternal education. On the other hand, the opposite case can be

made for both Hispanic and white students.


F. Race versus Resource Constraints and School Achievement

       Another possible explanation for the relationship between school racial composition and

identification gaps is that schools with larger minority shares are under-resourced compared with

schools that serve largely white populations. At the same time, heavily-minority schools may

have larger proportions of students that could potentially benefit from special education services.

If so, the rules for identifying children may vary systematically across schools as administrators


                                                 31
consider the marginal costs and benefits of identifications; specifically, the “threshold” disability

level that triggers an identification may be substantially higher in heavily-minority schools than

in heavily-white schools.

       In order to investigate this possibility, we use an additional source of information that

schools may use to determine disability status: achievement test scores. Our linked birth-

education records include individual students’ scores from the Florida Comprehensive

Assessment Test (FCAT), which was first administered to third and fourth grade students in the

1997-98 school year. We excluded achievement from our central specifications above because it

is potentially endogenous to disability status, i.e., receipt of special education services likely

influences learning for those children who would otherwise struggle in the absence of special

education. Nonetheless, achievement may play an important role in producing the racial

composition gradients shown above in Figure 3.

       In addition, we hypothesize that disability identifications may depend not only on a

student’s achievement, but also on her place in the within-school achievement distribution. We

thus estimate models analogous to specification (1) above in which we control for a student’s

own lagged (third grade) math and reading FCAT scores, as well as deciles of the school’s

lagged math and reading FCAT distributions. We show the results of these decompositions in

Figure 12.

       In the upper-left panel of Figure 12, the predicted disability rate declines as the school

minority share increases, in contrast to the analogous panel in Figure 3. This difference stems

from the fact that the within-school test deciles are predictive of disability identifications – for a

given value of a student’s own score, identification rates increase as the distribution of her

schoolmates’ test scores shifts to the right. In addition, black students in heavily-minority



                                                  32
schools tend to score higher in their within-school test score distribution than do black students

in heavily white schools. For example, the average score among black students in a school with

more than 90 percent minority students is close to the median of the within-school score

distribution in those schools. In contrast, the average score among black students in a school with

fewer than 10 percent minority students lies at roughly the 30th percentile of the within-school

distribution in those schools.

         Because the “predicted value” series in Figure 12 is negatively sloped for black students

(unlike the analogous series in Figure 3), while the two “raw” series have roughly the same slope

in the two figures, the “raw minus predicted” gap series in Figure 12 is slightly less negatively

sloped than that in Figure 3. 25 Nonetheless, the “raw minus predicted” gap still declines

noticeably with school minority shares, implying that achievement – both absolute and relative to

one’s schoolmates – accounts for some, but not all, of the gradient found in Figure 3.

         One other notable difference between Figures 3 and 12 is that the level of the “predicted

value” series for black students is substantially higher in the latter figure than in the former. For

example, the predicted disability rate among black students in schools with more than 90 percent

minority students is roughly 22 percent in Figure 12, compared to 18 percent in Figure 3. This

difference emerges because a student’s own FCAT scores are predictive of identification among

white students, and black students have lower average FCAT scores than do white students at all

values of the school minority share. As a result, when FCAT scores are included in the

conditioning set, black students are identified at lower rates than would be predicted throughout

the distribution of school racial composition.


25
   The “raw” series in the two figures are not identical because we do not require students to have valid test score
data to be included in Figure 3, while Figure 12 necessarily includes only students with non-missing FCAT scores.
Those with missing FCAT scores have higher rates of disability, so the raw disability rates in Figure 12 are slightly
lower than those in Figure 3.

                                                         33
         Turning to the Hispanic gaps, we find little evidence that controlling for own and peers’

FCAT scores influences the gradients with respect to school racial composition: the “raw minus

predicted” gaps have similar slopes in Figures 3 and 12. As was the case for black students, those

gaps are shifted downward in Figure 12 relative to Figure 3, reflecting that Hispanic students are

identified at lower rates than would be predicted once we condition on FCAT scores. However,

the downward shift is less pronounced than it was among black students, reflecting that Hispanic

students have higher average FCAT scores than do observationally similar black students. In

addition, the “raw minus predicted” gaps for white students are roughly similar in the two

figures.

         Finally, we consider another setting in which achievement may play a central role: the

identification of gifted students. As with disabilities, there is a substantial amount of subjectivity

in how gifted students are identified. 26 If resource constraints influence identification for both

gifted and disabled students, we might expect similar minority share gradients for both sets of

students – gifted rates will be lower in heavily-minority schools than among observationally

equivalent students in richer, heavily-white schools. To assess this possibility, we repeat the

above decomposition analysis using fourth grade gifted status as an outcome, providing the

results in Figure 13. The figure shows the opposite patterns from those in Figure 12: for all three

sets of students, the “raw minus predicted” gifted identification gaps increase in school minority

shares. 27




26
   Universal testing programs for gifted and talented students as studied in Card and Giuliano (2016) are rare. More
typically, districts identify students for screening based on subjective measures (such as teacher recommendations)
and then proceed with formal testing.
27
   We note that measures of school resources in the Florida data are only weakly related to school racial
composition. Specifically, minority shares are negatively correlated with teacher experience but positively correlated
with the proportion of teachers with Masters’ degrees and teacher / pupil ratios. In sum, we find little evidence of a
systematic relationship between school racial composition and observable measures of school resources.

                                                         34
         The striking differences in the patterns shown in Figures 12 and 13 are inconsistent with

a setting in which resource constraints play significant roles in both disability and gifted

identification. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that a number of factors may play a role in the

development of racial gaps in gifted education, so the interpretation of these results is not

straightforward. We consider these findings to be supportive but certainly not dispositive

evidence that resource constraints do not drive the central results above.

         Overall, the results in this section imply that resource constraints and achievement levels

– both relative and absolute – may explain some, but not all, of the gradients in identification

gaps among minority students with respect to school minority shares. We stress an important

caveat with this interpretation, though: unlike information available at the time of a child’s birth,

which is obviously determined prior to special education identification, achievement may be

endogenous with respect to special education services. 28


7. Discussion

         Our results establish clear negative gradients in special education identification gaps with

respect to school minority shares for black and Hispanic students. Black students in schools with

high minority shares are likely to be underrepresented in special education conditional on their

observable characteristics, while they are overrepresented in schools with few minority students.

We observe a similar, but more muted, pattern for Hispanic students. While we cannot be sure of

the underlying mechanisms that drive these patterns, we provide some evidence that it is unlikely

to be school resource constraints or economic factors.


28
   In order to circumvent concerns due to the endogeneity of achievement with respect to disability and gifted
identification, in Section B of the Online Appendix we estimate specifications in which we condition on third grade
test scores and analyze the racial composition gradients in fourth grade disability and gifted status, conditional on
not being identified before fourth grade. While the gradients in those specifications are smaller than those in our
main specifications above, a small negative disability gradient still exists for black students, while modest gifted
gradients exist for black, Hispanic, and white students.

                                                         35
       This leaves a few possibilities for potential mechanisms. First, it is possible that the

identification of disabilities is peer reference-dependent. For example, suppose that each school

community (including parents, students, and school employees) determines a threshold health

level under which students are identified as disabled. Ideally, this would be a fixed value that is

unrelated to contextual factors. However, it is possible that stakeholders use students’ peers as a

basis of comparison, so that if there are more students in a school with underlying disabilities,

the likelihood of identification goes down for a particular student. In our data, we do see some

evidence that both on average and within minority share bins, black students have worse

neonatal health characteristics than both Hispanic and white students, with Hispanics students’

health on average being similar to those of white students. For all three racial / ethnic groups we

consider, observable factors that are related to child health (such as maternal education or birth

weight) are negatively related to school minority shares.

       Although peer reference dependency may play an important role in our central findings, it

is inconsistent with the slight positive association between minority shares and disability rates

among white students. An alternative, and potentially complementary, explanation is that school

communities are more likely to notice disabilities – or perceived disabilities – when students

appear dissimilar to their peers. For example, black and Hispanic students may “stand out” in

schools comprised of mostly white students, making their perceived disabilities more readily

noticed in comparison to identical students in schools with large black and Hispanic populations.

Such a phenomenon would lead to overrepresentation (underrepresentation) for the minority

(majority) group in the school, consistent with the patterns shown in Figure 3.

       Finally, although we have access to an unusually rich set of health characteristics, along

with measures of both economic resources and achievement, it is possible that important



                                                 36
unobserved determinants of disability identification are correlated with school minority shares.

In Section A of the Online Appendix, we present estimates intended to gauge the potential

importance of such determinants. Following the analyses of Altonji et al. (2005, 2008; hereafter

“AET”), we ask what the implied gradient of disability gaps would be if the relationship between

unobserved characteristics and school minority shares is similar to the analogous relationship

between observed characteristics and minority shares. In light of our findings above that students

in heavily-minority schools are disadvantaged along observable dimensions compared to

students in heavily-white schools – regardless of the student’s own race – our estimates based on

the AET approach suggest that students in heavily-minority schools may have much worse latent

health and SES characteristics than students in schools with low minority shares. Thus, we would

expect that disability rates would be strongly increasing in minority shares; in other words, our

central estimates may understate the extent of underrepresentation of black and Hispanic students

in schools with high minority shares. In order for us to attribute the negative gradient in

disability gaps entirely to unobservables, the association between minority shares and

unobserved characteristics would have to be both powerful and of the opposite sign as the

association between minority shares and observed characteristics. 29

         It is worth noting that our findings have potentially important implications for how

disproportionality is determined. Fundamentally, the Individuals with Disabilities in Education



29
   The Online Appendix also describes an additional analysis into sorting on unobservables based on eventual
Advanced Placement (AP) course-taking rates. Our primary concern with the AET analysis presented above is that,
even though students in schools with low minority shares have observable characteristics that are negatively
associated with underlying disabilities (compared to students in schools with high minority shares), it may be the
case that these students’ parents are more likely to pursue disability identifications, conditional on underlying health.
We use eventual AP course taking as a proxy for parents’ willingness to advocate on behalf of their children, and we
find essentially no relationship between school-level AP course taking and school-level disability identification rates
among black and Hispanic students. These patterns suggest that the gradients in identification gaps with respect to
minority shares do not stem from a systematic relationship between minority shares and minority parents’
willingness to advocate for their children.

                                                           37
Act considers racial disproportionality to be an outcome in and of itself that requires remediation

– hence the focus on unconditional racial differences in several previous studies. Our findings,

however, add to an increasing body of literature that suggests that failing to account for health

differences could lead disproportionality rules to unintentionally induce schools and districts to

reduce access to special education services for those students who may benefit from them

(Morgan et al., 2012, 2013, 2015, 2017; Shifrer et al., 2011; Hibel et al., 2010).

       Our analysis adds an important element to this debate by showing the substantial

heterogeneity in disproportional representation with respect to school racial composition. While

we establish that this heterogeneity exists, we are unable to identify which students are on the

margin from benefitting from special education services. Thus, while Hanushek, Kain and

Rivkin (2002) and Ballis (2018) find evidence of positive effects of special education, we cannot

determine with certainty what the effects on outcomes are among students impacted by

disproportionality remediation.


8. Conclusion

       Using a unique panel of data from the State of Florida that links the universe of birth

records with education records over a decade of birth cohorts, we provide new evidence about

the extent to which minority students are disproportionately placed in special education. One of

our key contributions is the use of detailed data on economic and health endowments – such as

birth weight, gestational age, and complications and abnormalities at birth – not typically

available in the national surveys used in prior work. Using Blinder-Oaxaca decompositions, we

generate predicted disability rates for minorities if they were identified at the same rates as white

students with similar observable characteristics. Because we have large samples covering the




                                                 38
universe of children born in Florida between 1992 and 2002, we are also able to disaggregate

identification into specific disability categories, some of which are relatively rare.

        Our initial results confirm the findings of recent work by Morgan et al. (2015), who used

the ECLS-K to argue that black and Hispanic students are underrepresented in special education.

We find underrepresentation by 3.4 percentage points (38 percent of the baseline identification

rate among black students) in Kindergarten and 2.3 percentage points (15 percent) in fourth

grade. For Hispanics, we find underrepresentation of 3.0 percentage points (40 percent of the

baseline Hispanic identification rate) in Kindergarten and 1.1 percentage points (8 percent) in

fourth grade. We find substantial variation in these overall results by disability condition. In

fourth grade, both Hispanic and black students are significantly underrepresented in speech /

language impairments, and black students are underrepresented in specific learning disabilities,

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and physical disabilities. In contrast, we find that black

students are substantially overrepresented in intellectual disabilities, by 44 percent of the

baseline identification rate.

        Our primary focus involved assessing how special education identification gaps vary with

the racial composition of schools. We estimate disability gaps by the share of a student’s

Kindergarten cohort (called the “school” for simplicity) that is black or Hispanic and find a clear

negative gradient for black students, who are overrepresented in schools with relatively small

minority shares and underrepresented in schools with large minority shares. The gradient is

roughly linear, implying that every 10 percentage-point increase in the minority share is

associated with a 0.9 percentage-point decline in the disability gap. The implied difference in the

disability gaps between the schools with over 90 percent minority populations and those with

under 10 percent minority populations is more than half of the overall fourth grade identification



                                                  39
rate of 14.9 percent. Specific learning disabilities, which may represent the most malleable and

subjectively defined disabilities, drive most of the gradient for black students. In contrast, the

negative gradient for Hispanics stems primarily from the speech and language impairment

category.

        Our analyses do not necessarily imply a causal relationship between school segregation

and disability identification, as the racial composition of a school could be a proxy for a number

of other factors. Nonetheless, we address several alternative mechanisms that potentially play

significant roles. First, we utilize the fact that we have residential location at birth to generate

pseudo-schools for students based on where they were born. The concern is that parents might

change schools in response to their child’s disability, and such transitions may be systematically

related to the racial compositions of the “origin” and “destination” schools. Our estimates for

black and Hispanic students are largely insensitive to whether we use pseudo-schools or the

schools that students actually attend, suggesting that ex-post residential movement in response to

disability diagnoses is not responsible for our central results. On the other hand, the gradient for

white students disappears when we use pseudo-schools, perhaps because non-minority families

are relatively more likely to move in response to child disabilities.

        We next investigate whether our central findings simply reflect differences across schools

in economic conditions, rather than differential treatment by race. We first verify that

identification rates are systematically related to the fraction of students eligible for free or

reduced-price lunch (FRL) in the school. We then use racial composition residualized by school-

level economic variables (including the percent eligible for FRL) to investigate whether our

results are sensitive to purging the racial composition of a substantial portion of the economic

variation. While the gradient largely disappears for Hispanics, suggesting that much of the



                                                  40
pattern for Hispanics is related to economic status, the gradient for black students remains large.

Such a pattern is arguably incompatible with a setting in which resource constraints drive the low

overall identification rates in these schools.

       We also consider the identification of gifted students, arguing that if resource constraints

influence the identification of disabled students, we might expect similar impacts on gifted

identification. Instead, we find positive associations between gifted identification gaps and

school minority shares for black, Hispanic, and white students. These findings again suggest that

resource constraints are not the principal mechanism underlying the gradients in disability gaps.

       Given that ex-post school switching, economic factors, and resource constraints explain

little of the strong relationship between identification gaps and racial composition, at least for

black students, we offer some potential explanations. First, it is possible that identification for

special education is reference-group dependent – if a school’s student population is relatively

healthy, then the threshold impairment level for what defines a “disability” falls, inducing

diagnoses among children who would not be identified as disabled in schools with less healthy

peers. An alternative explanation is that the distinctness of students’ race might play a role; for

example, teachers and administrators may pay particular attention to a black student in a school

with very few black students merely because that student is relatively unique. As a result,

teachers may notice exceptional traits in these students that would go unnoticed in other students.

       Finally, we acknowledge that we are unable to account for all determinants of disability

identification. However, if the association between school minority shares and unobservable

determinants of identification is similar to the association between school minority shares and

observable determinants of identification, we would expect that disability rates would be

strongly increasing in minority shares – in sharp contrast to what we actually find. As a result,



                                                  41
our central estimates may understate the underrepresentation of disability among black and

Hispanic students in schools with large minority populations.

The solid line in the top panel shows the raw average identification rates by student race and 10 percentage point bins of black/Hispanic share in the
student’s Kindergarten cohort. The dotted line provides the predicted values from a regression restricted to white students of identification rates on
the variables included in equation (1) in the text. The bottom panels show the results of the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition by plotting the difference
between the solid and dotted line in the top panels. Confidence intervals are derived using the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the distribution of
estimated gaps from 100 bootstrap replications (resampled at district-cohort level) of the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition.

student’s Kindergarten cohort. The dotted line provides the predicted values from a regression restricted to white students of identification rates on
the variables included in equation (1) in the text. The bottom panels show the results of the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition by plotting the difference
between the solid and dotted line in the top panels. Confidence intervals are derived using the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the distribution of
estimated gaps from 100 bootstrap replications (resampled at district-cohort level) of the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition.

The solid line in the top panel shows the raw average identification rates by student race and 10 percentage point bins of black/Hispanic share in the
student’s Kindergarten cohort. The dotted line provides the predicted values from a regression restricted to white students of identification rates on
the variables included in equation (1) in the text. The bottom panels show the results of the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition by plotting the difference
between the solid and dotted line in the top panels. Confidence intervals are derived using the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the distribution of

Each point reflects the difference between raw average identification rates and predicted values from a regression restricted to white students of
identification rates on the variables included in equation (1) in the text. Estimates are calculated separately by racial composition conditional on not
being disabled in listed grade. Confidence intervals are derived using the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the distribution of estimated gaps from 100
bootstrap replications (resampled at district-cohort level) of the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition.

The solid line in the top panel shows the raw average identification rates by student race and 10 percentage point bins of black/Hispanic share in the
student’s pseudo Kindergarten-cohort, which is determined as the weighted average of Kindergarten-cohorts of all children born in the same school-
entry year and zip code. See text for more details. The dotted line provides the predicted values from a regression restricted to white students of
identification rates on the variables included in equation (1) in the text. The bottom panels shows the results of the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition by
plotting the difference between the solid and dotted line in the top panels. Confidence intervals are derived using the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the
distribution of estimated gaps from 100 bootstrap replications (resampled at district-cohort level) of the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition.

The solid line in the top panel shows the raw average identification rates by student race and 10 percentage point bins of free/reduced-price lunch
eligibility share in the student’s Kindergarten cohort. The dotted line provides the predicted values from a regression restricted to white students of
identification rates on the variables included in equation (1) in the text. The bottom panels shows the results of the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition by
plotting the difference between the solid and dotted line in the top panels. Confidence intervals are derived using the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the
distribution of estimated gaps from 100 bootstrap replications (resampled at district-cohort level) of the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition.

The solid lines in the top panel show the average identification rates by student race across the residualized free/reduced price lunch eligibility share
(left panel) or the residualized minority share (right panel) in the student’s Kindergarten cohort. The dotted line provides the predicted values from a
regression restricted to white students of residualized identification rates on the variables included in equation (1) in the text. The bottom panels
shows the results of the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition by plotting the difference between the solid and dotted line in the top panels. Confidence
intervals are derived using the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the distribution of estimated gaps from 100 bootstrap replications (resampled at district-

The solid line in the top panel shows the raw average identification rates by student race and 10 percentage point bins of black/Hispanic share in the
student’s Kindergarten cohort. The dotted line provides the predicted values from a regression restricted to white students of identification rates on
the variables included in equation (1) in the text, as well as individual and school-level deciles of FCAT reading and mathematics scores. The bottom
panels shows the results of the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition by plotting the difference between the solid and dotted line in the top panels.

The solid line in the top panel shows the raw average gifted rates by student race and 10 percentage point bins of black/Hispanic share in the
student’s Kindergarten cohort. The dotted line provides the predicted values from a regression restricted to white students of gifted rates on the
variables included in equation (1) in the text, as well as individual and school-level deciles of FCAT reading and mathematics scores. The bottom
panels shows the results of the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition by plotting the difference between the solid and dotted line in the top panels.
Confidence intervals are derived using the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the distribution of estimated gaps from 100 bootstrap replications (resampled
at district-cohort level) of the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition.
