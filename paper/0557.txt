                       Capital MohiUty- and, Devaluation in an
                    Optimizing Model with Rational Expectations




                                  Abstract



     This paper examines the effects- of exchange-rate policies when indi-

viduals maximize lifetime utility on the basis of rational expectations

about the future.     The institutional framework is a small economy in which

 the central bank holds the exchange rate fixed at each moment in time, but

- allows it to depreciate over time according to a pre-announced schedule.

 In this setting, an unanticipated, discrete devaluation of the cur-

rencyhas no real effects.     It occasions only a tranfer of interest-bearing

 foreign assets from the public to the central hank.     An unanticipated,

permanent increase in the rate of devaluation, in contrast, causes a

 sharp fall in consumption, a current-account surplus, and a long-run de-

cline in the reserves of the central bank.

     This paper examines the effects of exchange-rate policies when individ-

uals maximize lifetime utility on the basis of rational expectations about

the future.    The economy studied is one in which the authorities allow free

mobility of capital under a crawling-peg exchange-rate regime.     Many indus-

trializing economies have adopted a crawling peg as a means of reconciling

disparate inflation rates at home and abroad, and some recent efforts to use

the rate of crawl as an instrument of anti-inflation policy have attracted

considerable interest (see Carlos D1az Alejandro).    Tools similar to those em-

ployed here have been applied by Guillermo Calvo (1979a) to study this type of

exchange-rate management under conditions of capital immobility.

     An   advantage of the explicit optimization framework is the light it throws

on the interaction between private economic decisions and the balance sheets of

the government and, particularly, the central bank.    Although the literature on

open-economy financial policy has largely ignored such considerations--the ex-

ceptions include papers by Alan Stockman and myself (1979, 1980a)--the extent

to which the public internalizes official asset holdings has obvious conse-

quences for the efficacy of official intervention in asset markets.     An impli-

cation of the model explored below is that the stock of central-bank reserves,

when allowed to earn interest, will be perceived by the public as part of its

own wealth.    In this setting, devaluation loses its real effects, for a dis-

crete rise in the price of foreign exchange occasions a proportional issue of

central-bank money, a transfer of interest-bearing foreign bonds from the public

to the bank, and nothing more.

     The optimization hypothesis, as applied here, eliminates the inde-

terminacy typically associated with models assuming rational expectations or

perfect foresight.    This is an additional advantage, as it provides a firm

ground for convergence assumptions that must usually go unjustified. The explicit

specification of agents' objective functions leads also to a natural welfare

analysis of alternative policies.

I.   The Model

        The economy I consider is inhqbited by a representative household, which

derives utility from consuming a single composite commodity and holding real

money balances.         Household wealth is divided between high-powered money hold-

ings (there is no banking system) and holdings of an internationally-traded

bond having a fixed foreign-currency face value.          The economy is small, and

therefore can influence neither the (positive) world bond rate, P, nor the

foreign-currency price of the consumption good, P*, both of which are taken

to be fixed. l     The domestic-currency price of consumption, P, is linked to

the world price by the relationship P        =   EP*, where E, the exchange rate, is

the price of foreign money in terms of domestic money.

     The central bank causes the exchange rate to depreciate according to a pre-

announced schedule by standing ready at each instant to trade home currency for

foreign exchange on the pre-announced terms.          This type of exchange-rate regime

has been studied, in somewhat different contexts, by Calvo (1979a, 1979b), Paul

Krugman, Jorge de Macedo, Carlos Rodriguez, Sweder van Wijnbergen, and others.

It is assumed that the official schedule calls for a constant, non-negative rate
                                                                        .
of devaluation,E, which must equal the domestic inflation rate, Pip, at all times.
     The representative household's instantaneous utility function is written

as Ut    = u(ct,mt ),   where c t is the family's consumption rate and mt represents

its nominal money holdings, Mt , deflated by Pt.         The function u(·,·) is posi-

tive, twice continuously differentiable, increasing in both its arguments, and

strictly concave.        Both consumption and money services are normal goods.

the constant world interest rate p, I will adopt instead the approach of

Hirofumi Uzawa, in which the instantaneous discount rate at time s is a positive

function of the contemporaneous utility level:



                                                                                                   ( 3)




It is convenient to endow 0(·) with the properties



          o'(u), o"(u), o(u) - uo'(u) > 0,                                                         (4)


                                                                                                          ..

tion problem, but are in no way intrinsic to the notion of an endogenous rate

of time preference.

          In maximizing (1), the family is bound by three constraints.                      The first is

a (stock) wealth constraint, which states that marketable real assets at time t,

at, must equal the sum of real bond holdings b                           and real balances:
                                                                     t

                                                                                                   ( 5)

The second is a (flow) savings constraint,



                                                                                       (6)

where y is the economy's (fixed) output, Ltnet/transfers from the government,

and em           the inflation tax on cash balances.   The final constraint is the
         t
intertemporal budget constraint,

                   co



                                                                                       (7)

                  o


             The consolidated budget constraint of the government and central

bank plays a key role in the developments below.           It embodies the very

important assumption that central-bank reserves earn interest at the world

rate, p.          The government makes net transfer payments to domestic residents,

but does not consume goods.          In the absence of interest-bearing government

debt, any excess          of transfer payments over central-bank foreign interest earn-

ings must be financed by domestic credit creation.           The latter will in general

be accompanied by changes in the foreign source component of the money supply,

and sO,cannot be identified with monetary growth.            I assume that the level

of government transfers is continuously varied in such a way that the rate of

real domestic credit expansion equals lODe per cent of the stock of real bal-

ances at each moment.          This implies a public-sector budget constraint of the form



                                                                                     ( 8)

II.   The Perfect-Foresight Equilibrium Path

subject to the constraints (5)-(7) yields the household's preferred paths

for consumption ({c
                                             t }),         real balances ({m

                                                                                                                  t }),
together with an implied path for central-bank reserves ({r
                                                                                                     t }).   The econ-

omy's perfect-foresight equilibrium path has the property that {T }, {m

and {r*}

         are mutually consistent, in

       The first step in finding this path is to derive necessary conditions

for an optimal household plan, contingent on an assumed path {T } of trans-

variables from t to                              ~    in (1) and (6).        The resulting Hamiltonian is



      H       = e (uu (c,
                      (c ,m)

where A    =      A~       is the co-state variable and y                          = y~    is the Lagrange multiplier

associated with the wealth constraint.                                         Necessary conditions for an optimal

      The perfect-foresight assumption is imposed by adding to (10) - (12)

the requirement that anticipated transfers {T } and actual transfers

{pr t + gmt} coincide.              The resulting system of diff~rential equations satisfies

both the conditions necessary for optimality and the consistency condition

linking expected transfers and the government budget constraint.                         Using the

definition of       9, the system is described by the equations

where f   =b    + r denotes the stock of claims on foreigners owned by the coun-

asset accumulation as the difference between national income and absorption.

It is derived by noting that ~                       =b   + m, while ~ must equal ; because dom-

estic credit expansion just compensates money-holders for the real deprecia-

initiated by consumption levels below     Co   are feasible, but are not optimal

from the household's standpoint, given the associated path of expected

future transfer payments.     The convergent trajectory can be shown to be

optimal as well as feasible.      It must, therefore, be the economy's   perfect~

foresight equilibrium path.      For a given initial stock of external claims,

the equilibrium consumption level is unambiguously determined.



III.   Exchange-Rate Policies

        To illustrate the workings of the model, I consider in this section

two types of exchange-rate policy, a one-time, unanticipated devaluation of

the currency        (a discrete increase in E) and a permanent, unanticipated

increase in the rate of devaluation, E.        These are the two policies compared

by Calvo (1979a) for a utility-maximizing economy in which domestic money

is the only privately-owned asset.
       An unanticipated devaluation leaves the two schedules in figure I

unchanged, and has no effect on the national        stock of foreign claims, which

can change only over time.      The devaluation thus leaves the economy at its

long-run equilibrium position:      it has no real consequences.    Just as in

the traditional one-asset framework (see Rudiger Dornbusch and Calvo (1979a»,

the devaluation brings about a sharp rise in the price level and fall in

real balances.   But in a setting of capital mobility,      the   fall in real

balances is only momentary.     An incipient excess demand for money exerts

downward pressure on the exchange rate, and this forces the central bank to

intervene in the asset market, purchasing foreign bonds and issuing money

until the public's real balances have been restored to their initial level.

       It is important to realize why this tranfer of bonds from the public

to the central bank reverses the wealth effect on consumption typically as-

sociated with the fall in the real value of privately-held, marketable assets

(see, e.g., Jacob Frenkel and Rodriguez).        Reserves acquired by the bank
                                                                                      9




continue to earn interest that must be returned to the public in the form

of higher transfer payments.       The public, in turn, anticipates and capital-

izes this income stream, and so, perceives no change in its overall wealth when

real balances are again at their initial level.        Accordingly, the devaluation

does not alter consumption.    While there is an instantaneous increase in reserves,

there ensues no flow surplus in the halance of payments or current account. 5

      In contrast, an unanticipated increase in the rate of devaluation

does have real consequences, for it shifts the c
                                                      . = 0 locus.     By (12), the

economy's stationary utility level u brings its rate of time preference into

equality with the world interest rate, and is thus independent of the policy pa-

rameter e.   The increase in   £   raises the opportunity cost of holding real

balances, inducing a long-run substitution of consumption for real balances

along the utility contour u.       This means that the c
                                                         . = 0 locus must shift
to the right, as shown in figure 2.       In the new stationary state, the
                                     \
higher consumption level is financed by       a    higher stock of interest-bearing

foreign claims.   Money is not super-neutral under the present assumptions. 6

      What are the characteristics of the transition path?           As figure 2

shows, the saddlepath relevant after the increase in         £   passes below the

original long-run equilibrium, (c,f).       If the economy is initially at rest,

there is a sharp fall in consumption, from c to       c~,   as the new optimal

trajectory is attained.   Together with the fall in the real return on money,

this occasions a drop in real money demand,       acco~odated      by central-bank

sales of foreign-exchange reserves to the public.

      The instantaneous equilibrium      (c~,f)   isa position of current-account

surplus; consumption and the national stock of foreign assets grow along

the path to (c',f'), the new long-run equilibrium.          Necessary condition

(11) shows that desired real balances grow as well during the adjustment pro-

cess.    The central bank accommodates this growing demand for money by continu-

ous intervention in the foreign exchange market, thereby preventing any devi-

ation of the exchange rate from its announced path and also inducing a rising

path of official.reserves.     Ultimately, however, the reserves gained during

the transition do not make up for those lost during the initial portfolio

adjustment in reaction to the change in E.     A higher asymptotic level of re-

serves would be inconsistent with the requirement that real balances be lower

in the new stationary state than in the original one.

        This time path of reserves and consumption stands in interesting con-

trast to the one found by Calvo (1979a) in a context of capital immobility.

When there is only one asset, there can be no portfolio shift in response to

an increase in the rate of depreciation, and so a discrete fall in real bal-

ances is precluded.     Rather than overshooting their eventual, lower levels,

real money and reserves decline monotonically over time.     From an initial

position of long-run equilibrium, consumption must rise on impact to induce

the implied current-account deficit.

        In the present setting of capital mobility, the integral of discounted

utilities, (1), is lower along the transition path following a rise in     E

than it would have been along the original stationary-state path.      This fol-

lows from the observation that the household's instantaneous utility falls

when E is raised,       returning to its initial level only in the long run.

Thus, an increase in the rate of devaluation has a negative effect on the

welfare of economic agents.

5.   These conclusions naturally require modification when reserves bear no

interest, when some international lending is denominated in domestic

currency, or when economic units have finite lives and leave no bequests.



6.   This type of monetary non-neutrality has been studied by Robert Lucas and

Stanley Fischer inaggregative, closed-economy, rational-expectations models.

Portfolio substitution from money to capital provides the mechanism through

which anticipated monetary growth affects real variables.
