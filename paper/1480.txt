  I.    Introduction

        After the breakdown of the Bretton
                                             Woods system and the adoption of
 floating exchange rates by the major industrial
                                                     countries in March 1973, it
 was widely believed that the new
                                     exchange system would allow each of these
 countries to insulate its money
                                    supply from foreign influences. The view
 that monetary independence was attainable may have encouraged
                                                               some of the
 countries during the l970s to pursue a policy of monetary targeting ——

 establishing   a preannounced target growth rate, or band of growth rates, of

 some monetary aggregate.

       Experience in the decade since floating
                                                 exchange rates were adopted
 suggests that independence of national money supplies has not been

achieved.' Moreover, a number of countries that adopted
                                                        some form of mone-
tary targeting have had considerable
                                        difficulties, especially in recent
years, in achieving their targets.2

       In this paper we consider the case of Canada whose experience under

floating exchange rates provides an example of unanticipated monetary

interdependence and disappointing performance
                                                  in monetary growth targeting.
Canada sought independence from the United States, even before the
                                                                    collapse
of the Bretton Woods
                     system, by allowing the exchange rate to float

    In late 1979 —— about the time U.S.        interest   rates began to exhibit


increased variability ——   nadian       money growth began to fluctuate sharply

relative to its behavior in the preceding few years (see figure la). Since

of Canada that it abandoned money growth targets (see also figure ib, which

shows the behavior of the money stock relative to the target level).

Another feature of the Canadian experience is that the regression for the

short—run demand for       ——   of   the type used by the Bank of Canada ——

exhibits   exceptionally large residuals since 1979 that appear to resemble

deviations of money growth from the target rates of growth (compare figures

 Ia and ic).
                                                           has always used short—term
     The Bank of Canada, like many central banks,

 interest rates as its principal mechanism in executing monetary policy.

 According to the conventional view of interest rate control that appears to

 underlie the Bank's approach, the money stock would be determined by money

 demand, which the Bank can influence by setting an appropriate interest
                                                   of the erratic behavior of the
 rate. This view suggests two explanations

 exchange rate policy. Concern        with   avoiding exchange rate fluctuations

 leads the Bank to respond to movements in U.S. interest rates in setting

 the Canadian interest rate. Thus large fluctuations in U.S. interest

 rates since late i979 could have brought about variability in Canadian

 money growth tbrhugh   their    positive effect on Canadian interest rates

 (through an interest rate policy reaction function) and then a negative

 effect on the money stock (through the money demand function).        However, a

 problem with this explanation is that it implies a negative association

 between U.S. interest rates and Canadian money growth rather than the

observed positive association.

    A second explanation of the behavior of Canadian money growth —-- one

that the Bank of Canada itself has emphasized ——    is   that the demand for

N1 in Canada has become less stable since 1979. 6    One   reason   suggested for

the instability during this period is the impact of financial innovations,

possibly induced by high interest rates.7 The instability in money demand

could account for both large residuals in the demand equation as well as

large fluctuations in money growth. However, this explanation does not

account for the positive correlation between Canadian money growth and U.S.

interest rates.

    This paper proposes an alternative explanation of the triple incidence

of money growth variability, the apparent money demand instability in

Canada, and the positive dependence of Canadian money growth on U.S.

interest rates. Our   explanation   is related to two strands in the

literature: (1) Brunner and Meltzer's credit market approach to the money

supply process (19Th); and (2) the buffer stock view of money recently

emphasized by Laidler (1984).8 We argue that movements in U.S. interest

rates cause shifts i-n the demand for domestic credit in Canada which, under

interest rate control -of the money supply process, produce changes in

Canadian money growth. Changes in U.S. interest rates through this mecha-

nism have a positive effect on Canadian money supply growth, providing a

channel for monetary interdependence additional to the one arising from the
                                  —4—

Bank of Canada's exchange rate management policy. According to the buffer

stock view, money supply disturbances automatically affect money demand in

the short run and thus these shocks appear as shifts of the money demand

function.

    The plan of the paper is as follows. In section II we discuss the Bank

of Canada's approach to the determination of money growth under interest

rate control. According to this approach, the money stock can deviate from

its target value either because of unexpected changes in the demand for

money or because the Bank occasionally places greater importance on other

objectives, such as the exchange rate. Although both factors have been

important sources of divergence of the money stock from its target values,

our interpretation of the first factor differs from that of the Bank. In

section III we present a framework of money growth under interest rate

control that supplants the Bank's approach. We first develop a money

supply process which highlights the role of the credit market and its sen-

sitivity to foreign shocks as well as the Bank of Canada's intervention in

the exchange market. We then discuss interaction between the money supply

and money demand functions by incorporating the determinants of the money

supply process into the short—run mechanism by which actual money balances

adjust to desired money balances. Section IV presents evidence consistent

with the money supply process we describe and supports the view that money

supply disturbances, such as those produced by variability in foreign

interest rates, exert an important influence on the short—run demand for

money function. Section V summarizes the conclusions and implications of

the paper.

 II. Money Growth Under Interest Rate Control: The Bank of Canada's Approach


       The Bank's approach is based on the conventional view that interest rate

control implies a money supply function which is perfectly interest elastic

at the fixed interest rate, and that the stock of money is determined where

the money demand function intersects the elastic supply function.9

According to this view, knowledge of the demand for money can he used to

manipulate the interest rate in order to determine the behavior of the money

stock. In this approach, the rate of money growth would deviate from the

desired rate only to the extent that changes in money demand were unan-

ticipated at the time the rate of interest was set. If the unanticipated

changes are not large, interest rate control would be a viable method for

money growth targeting in the sense that it would be technically feasible

to keep money growth close to the target path. We discuss below how such a

policy would he implemented and then examine to what extent the Bank has

followed this policy.

       An essential ingredient in the Bank's approach is an econometric esti-

mate of the demand for money. Most of the empirical work on demand for Ml

in Canada uses an equation which combines a long—run demand function with

a real partial adjustment mechanism following Chow (1966). A simple but

representative form of the long—run demand function is


         =        +            +
             a0       a1           a2r + u, a1>      a2 < 0,                              (1)

where m*, y and            r   represent logarithms of the   desired   real stock of money,

real   income,     and the shortterm         interest rate, respectively;    u is   the
                                            —6—

error term. Adding the Chow mechanism, we have


         =        + (1 - X)              < A < 1,                             (2)
             Xm                ni1, 0

where m is the logarithm of the actual real stock of money.

     The demand for money based on equations (1) and (2) can be rewiitten

as

             Mt_i
                    =     —         +

where N and P are the logarithms of the nominal money stock and the price

level.

     Let Mt represent the logarithm of the mid—value of the target money

stock announced for period t.'1 Let r be the interest rate that would

make the expected value of Mt equal to M, According to the money demand

function (3), r would satisfy

     When the Bank of Canada announced its targeting policy in 1975, it was

assumed initially that the Bank would attempt to achieve its target by

setting the interest rate at r in each period.'2 The Bank, however,

made it clear later that money growth targets were not its sole concern and

that it would be influenced by other considerations in determining the

interest rate.'3 e special concern of the Bank has been preventing

large noverients in the exchange rate. For this reason the Bank may have

been reacting to the U.S. interest rate to avoid letting a substantial dif—

         To explore the Bank of Canada interest rate reaction function, we con-

interest        rate. X a vector representing other oblectives (II a corresponding
vector of coefficients) and v an error term. The above model allows for
the possibility that the desired long—run rate may equal                    (0 = 1), rus
(0   =   0), or a weighted average of the two rates. Moreover, the model per-
mits     the interest rate to be adjusted gradually towards the desired rate

(p K 1) and for other objectives (included in X) to play a role in the

short—run determination of the interest rate.

       To estimate the model, we developed a measure of r as follows.

First, the demand function for Canadian M1, based on (1) and (2), was esti-

mated for the floating exchange rate period, 1970111—19831, using quarterly

data; OLSQ estimates of the function are presented in row 1 of Table 1.

(As significant serial correlation of the error term is not indicated,

the Cochrane—Orcutt adjustment is not used.) Next, values of                      —

and y       were generated from forecasting equations, developed according to a

procedure suggested by Mishkin                 (1983).16   Then r was calculated according

to   (4).
     Making use           of the    above measure of r, we estinated an int:erest—

rate reaction function for the Bank of Canada, based on (5) and (6). The

function was estimated for the floating exchange rate period 1970111—
19831,17 using a dummy variable to distinguish between subperiods with

and without the targeting policy. Three variables —— the expected rate

of inflation, the expected rate of unemployment, and the (actual) rate

of exchange rate appreciation —— were considered as possible candidates to

represent the set X.'8 None of these variables proved to be signifi-

cant.19 After dropping these variables from the reaction function, the

regression estimates are as follows:


r —

            (—.58) (4.28) (1.84)

                                                               (7.72)
                                                                            —
                                                                                r1)
              —
                   .l4(r — r1)D,
            (—1 .39)

            p =    .14,    R2 =       .79,   DW =   2.13,   SEE = .0074,                   (7)
                  (1.92)

where D is a dummy variable for the targeting period (equal to 1 for

1975111—1982111, equal to zero in the remaining period)., and t—values are

shown below the coefficients.

     The regression equation shows that although r has exerted some influence

on the Canadian interest rate, the effect of the U.S. interest rate has

been much stronger.2° The magnitude of the effect of the U.S. interest

rate in the targeting period, moreover, has been less than but not signifi-

cantly different from its effect in the nontarget period. The evidence

suggests that the targeting policy had only a marginal influence on the

Bank of Canada's reaction function.21

      The reluctance of the Bank of Canada to follow a pure targeting

strategy of setting r =           r   could account for the divergence of             from Mt.

Rowever, even if r had been set exactly equal to r in each period, the money

stock could still have diverged from its target value because of errors in
                                              —9—

forecasting inflation and output, and unforeseen shifts in money demand.

To examine the relative importance of these factors, we subtracted (4) from

(3) and let u        0 (based on the absence of serial correlation in our

estimates of money demand) to get


         —     =      —

                                                                     Xu.                   (8)

    it   is possible to decompose the variance of Mt —
                                                                     Mt
                                                                           into variances

and covariances of the terms on the right—hand side of the equation. For

the period 1975111—1982111 during which the targeting policy was in force,

we find that the sum of the first two terms accounted for only 6.8 percent

of the variance of            —         while the third term was responsible for 46.0
                                  Nt,
and the last term for 59.5 percent of the variance.22 (The sum of the

covariance terms was thus equal to —12.3 percent of the variance.)

According to these estimates, the deviation of r from r played an important

role in causing the divergence of M from Mt. However, money demand resi-

duals were also a major source of the divergence. This evidence would

appear to support the Bank of Canada's explanation that its difficulties

with controlling money growth have arisen from money demand instability.

    We do not agree with this explanation. We                 present in the    next section

a framework alternative to the one             the   Bank has adopted that we believe is a

more accurate analysis of the dynamics               of   interest rate control of money

growth. In     the   fo].Iowing section we present an          interpretation     of the

results from the.     first       regression in Table 1 that suggests that the

observed     residuals in the money demand regression reflect an inadeuacy in
                                  — 10 —


the conventional specification of the short—run adjustment mechanism rather

than instability in the long run demand for money.


III. Money Supply and Demand Under Interest Rate Control:
      An Alternative View

   In this section we first present a view of how the stock of money is

determined under interest rate control that differs from the Bank's view,

and then go on to discuss the interaction between money supply and demand.

   Under interest rate control, the central bank attempts to fix the yield

on (a certain class of) government securities by being ready to absorb any

excess demand or supply at the fixed price. This policy amounts to

making the supply of central bank domestic credit (assets of the central

bank excluding international reserves) perfectly interest elastic. In

addition, interest rate control generally provides commercial banks free

access to reserves at a fixed interest rate.23 If banks can freely vary

their reserves, commercial bank credit (assets pf banks excluding bank

reserves) would also become perfectly interest elastic.24 In this case,

the entire banking sector could be viewed as willing to accommodate the

demand for domestic credit (defined as the sum Of commercial bank and

central hank domestic credit) by the nonbanking public at the fixed rate.

A change in the demand for domestic credit would then automatically produce

a change in the money supply as a result of the nonbanking public's tran-

sactions with the banking sector. A change in the demand for domestic cre-

dit, moreover, need not produce a matching change in money demand. Thus

if, according to the buffer stock approach, the money market does not clear

instantaneously, then the tock of money would not be demand—determined and

the conventional view would he undermined. The view we present below is
                                    — 11 —


one in which the stock of money is determined largely by the demand for

domestic credit.25

    The demand for domestic credit depends on the rates of return on alter—

native assets.26 If these alternatives are very good substitutes for

assets included in domestic credit, the demand for domestic credit would be

sensitive to changes in rates of return on the substitutes and thus not

likely to be very stable. Instability in the demand for domestic credit

for this reason may produce considerable volatility in money supply under

interest rate control.

    For a country like Canada whose financial markets are well integrated

with U.S. markets, movements in the foreign rate relative to the controlled

domestic rate can trigger large changes in the demand for domestic credit.

To highlight the role of shifts between domestic and foreign securities,

consider a simple framework which abstracts from differences in securities

due to risk, term of maturity, and other characteristics. Assume that all

interest—bearing assets take the form of a riskless one period bond. Let r

and us represent the yields on domestic and U.S. bonds, respectively.

Also, let   be the expected rate of change in the exchange rate (the price

of U.s. dollars) so that rUS + 0 is the expected rate of return on the U.S.

bond (in terms of domestic currency). In this simple framework, domestic

credit (DC) would equal (for simplicity, we omit the time subscripts from

equations (9) through (13) below)


                              DC = B — B                             (9)


where B represents the total stock of domestic bonds and B° is the stock

held by the nonbank public.
                                    —12—

    As the money supply (MS) uld equal the sum of domestic credit and inter-

national reserves (IR), we can express the rate of money growth as27


    LMS/MS = DC/MS + iIR/MS.                                           (10)



Under interest rate control, ADC would equal the change in the demand for

domestic credit. According to (9), moreover, the change in domestic credit

would equal the difference between the change in the total supply of

domestic bonds (SB) and that in the demand by the nonbank public (LB11).

While the flow of public and private borrowing would determine AB, shifts

between domestic bonds and other assets, especially foreign bonds, would
         n
affect AB

    We present below a simple relationship explaining the change in

domestic credit (divided by the money stock). Our purpose is to highlight

the sensitivity of domestic credit to rates of return on domestic and

foreign bonds. We expect an increase in rUS +    to cause a shift from

domestic to foreign bonds and induce the sale of domestic bonds to the

banking sector by the nonbank public and thus lead to a decrease in B11.

Similarly, an increase in r would be expected to cause an increase in B11.

Assuming that AB1 dominates the behavior of ADC, we posit the following

relationship:

    ADC/MS =      + 'S (rlS + a) + 62r + w1 ,                                 (11)
                61 > ,   6   < 0,

where w1 is an error term representing the influence of other factors.28

    Changes in international reserves (divided by the money stock) also

represent another source of money growth. These changes would arise

because of exchange—market intervention by the Bank of Canada. The primary
                                     — 13 —



objective   of the Bank's intervention activity appears to be to smooth move-

ments in the exchange rate.29 Thus, we expect changes in international

reserves to be inversely related to changes in the exchange rate. The

amount of exchange market intervention may also depend on other objectives

such as inflation or unemployment. As discussed above, movements in

rUS + relative to r would induce shifts between domestic and foreign

bonds and thus put pressure on the exchange rate to move. The change in

the exchange rate due to this source may be perceived by the Bank to be

temporary, since according to the Bank's interest rate reaction function, r

would he adjusted to rus almost completely in the long run. The Bank

therefore may intervene in the exchange market in response to movements in

rUS + c and r (in addition to its response to the actual exchange rate

change).

    We thus consider an intervention function of the following form:


    lR/MS =       +     (rUS + o) + 2r + X2 + w2,                      (12)

                  < '   2>
where X is a vector (identical with that in the interest—rate reaction

function (6)) representing other objective variables including the rate of

change of the exchange rate, 2 a vector of coefficients, and w2 the error

term in the relationship. Adding (11) and (12), we get the following

'money supply" function:
                                        — 14 -



    MS/MS =      K0 + K1(r + o) + K2r + XQ          +

                 K1 = a1 +   >   , k   =
                                           a2
                                                +       < 0,                 (13)


where w =        + w2. Note that rUS +          exerts a positive effect on money
            w1

growth through the domestic credit function, but a negative effect through

the intervention function. On the other hand, r would exert a negative

effect on money growth through the domestic credit function and a positive

effect through the intervention function. Under a managed float, we would

expect the net effect of r'5 + c to be positive, while that of r to be

negative, so that K1 would be positive and K2 negative. To explain these

signs, consider, for instance, an increase in rUS that causes an excess

supply of domestic bonds and a matching excess demand for foreign bonds.3°

Under interest rate control, the excess supply of domestic bonds would be

fully accommodated and lead to an equal increase in DC. The extra demand

for foreign exchange (arising from the excess demand for foreign bonds)

would also equal the change in DC, but under a managed float would not be

fully accommodated. In this case, the change in IR would be less (in abso—

lute value) than the change in DC and thus intervention would provide a

partial offset to the effect of domestic credit.

    We now consider the interaction between the foregoing money supply

function and the demand for money function discussed earlier. According to

the buffer stock view, excess money balances would be run down gradually

over time. On an individual level, one reason for the slow adjustment may

be that in the presence of uncertainty, it is economical to take some time

to search for information relevant to portfolio and spending decisions.31

However, while individuals can reduce their money balances, the community
                                  — 15 —


as a whole cannot. The aggregate demand for money can adjust but the

adjustment may be slow if the arguments of the demand for money change

sluggishly. Although inertia in the price level and, to a lesser extent,

in output is generally recognized, the critics of the buffer stock view

argue that the interest rate would adjust rapidly to clear the money

market. Under interest rate control, however, even this variable is tem-

porarily fixed and cannot be relied on to eliminate excess money balances
           32
rapidly.

    Although the conventional specification of short—run money demand

includes a partial adjustment mechanism, the mechanism does not adequately

represent the buffer stock view, The basic problem is that while the par-

tial adjustment mechanism incorporates gradual adjustment in the desired

real stock of money to changes in the arguments of money demand, it does
                                                                       33
not allow for such adjustment in response to changes in money supply.

Carr and Darby (1981) have suggested that money supply shocks

(unanticipated money) should be included in the partial adjustment mecha-

nism. One problem with that approach, however, is that even some antici-

pated money may be held temporarily if the price level does not adjust

fully to anticipated changes. Another issue is that unanticipated money

would be correlated with the residual in money demand, which would make it

difficult to obtain unbiased and consistent estimates of the effect of

money supply shocks.34

    As an alternative approach, we introduce the determinants of the money

supply function (13) into the partial adjustment mechanism and rewrite this

mechanism as:
                                         — 16 —


     = Xmt* + (1 —    X)mti + 1(r + o) + 2 r + z,
             > '      < 0,                                                     (14)


where z is an error term which we expect to be correlated with w, the error

term in the money supply function. Note that                has the same sign as

K1 and 2 the same sign as K2.5

      To examine the implications of the modified partial adjustment mecha-

nism for the short—term demand for money, we combine (14) with (1) and get


         =         + 'y + 12r + 13(r + a) + 14mi + e,

                    1'
                                                                               (15)
             Ii =        2 =     +
                                     2' 13 =   ], 14    1 —   A e = Xu + z.

As (15) shows, the term e would now reflect the error term in the demand

for money as well as that in the supply function.36 Moreover, the effect

of r in (15) represents its influence through both the demand and supply

functions. Finally, one interesting testable implication of (15) is that

(rUS + o) would exert a positive effect on

     The portfolio balance approach to the demand for money in an open eco-

nomy suggests that the variables rS and 0 may also influence the desired

stock of real balances. However, as explained below, the direction of the

possible effect of rUS and o via the demand for money would be opposite to

that via the supply side. The long—run demand for money, according to the

open—economy portfolio balance approach, can be written as (see Cuddington

1983):


      a0 +           + a2r + a3(r + o) + a4c +
                                                       u,
      a1 > °' a2 < 0, a3       0, a4 ( 0.                                     (16)

In   (16), a3   would be negative if foreign bonds and domestic money are gross
                                                 — 17 —


substitutes           and equal zero if there is no direct substitution between these

assets. Similarly, a4 would be negative if currency substitution is pre-

sent and equal zero otherwise. Now, if we combine (14) with (16), we can

rewrite short—run money demand as

      =
          10
               +
                    yy    +
                              l2r ÷ 13   r   +     + y4rn   1
                                                                +   e,
                                                                                             ('7)
               -
                    Xa+        13 - X(a3 + a4) +
where y, I2 14 and e are the same as in (15). Thus, estmation of the short—

short—run money demand function would provide a clear—cut test of the pre-

sence of rUS and a on the supply side, regardless of whether the true form

of the function is given by (15) or (17). If                        =    0,   13 = 0 in (15) while
                                                      37

          0 and               0, according to (17).



IV.       Empirical Evidence on the Money Supply Process and the Short—Run
          Demand for Money

      In this section we present evidence on supply functions explaining

money growth and its components, and on the short—run demand for money

incorporating the modified partial adjustment mechanism.

      Each equation is initially estimated, using OLS. To avoid simultaneous

equation bias, the key equations are reestimated using a two—stage least

squares procedure. The instruments used in this procedure were based on

the model of the Bank's reaction function discussed in section II above.

      One problem with estimating both the supply and demand functions for

money is that no reliable measure of a is available. As a proxy for a, we

used f—s where f and s denote, respectively, the logarithms of forward

and    spot        exchange rates. As is well recognized, this rieasure              would he
subject to error in the presence of a risk premium. Thus, when using this
                                      — 18 —


measure, the coefficient of a was not constrained to be equal to that of

r.38 other potential difficulty with the use of f—s along th r and

rUS is that interest rate arbitrage would lead to a high degree of multi—

collinearity among these variables. This problem, however, was not severe

in the data set we used. The simple correlation between r and (rUS + f—s)

was .91, and thus not very close to a perfect linear relationship.39

    Table 2 presents the supply side regressions for the flexible exchange

rate period 1970111—19831. Row 1 of the table shows OLS estimates of the

domestic credit equation (11). All variables in this equation are highly

significant and have the expected signs. In estimating the intervention

function, we first tried a conventional form in which AIR/MS depends only

on the X variables, representing the expected rate of inflation, the rate of

change in the spot exchange rate and the expected unemploent rate.4°

Of these only the first two variables, AP and As, were significant, and

the estimated equation including these variables is shown in row 3 of the

table. Then we estimated an extended intervention function according to
                           us                   41
(12), which also includes r ,   r,   and f—s.        As shown in row 4 of the

table, the additional variables are significant and have signs opposite to

those in the domestic credit equation.

    To facilitate a comparisonbetween the international reserve and the

domestic credit equations, we also introduce AP and As into the latter

equation in row 2 of the table. As the estimates show, although these

additional variables are insignificant, their effect on ADC/MS is of the

opposite sign and about the same magnitude as that on AIR/MS. Comparing

rows 2 and 4, it is also clear that the coefficients of the three

variables, r, rus, and f—s are all larger, in terms of their absolute
                                       — 19 —



values,   in the domestic credit than in the international reserve equation.

The results confirm the hypothesis that under a managed float, the effects

of r, rUS, and f—s operating through the domestic credit function would

dominate the money supply process.

    The estimates of the money growth equation with the same variables as

in rows 2 and 4 are shown in row 6 of the table. As discussed above, the

net effect of LP and s on money growth is close to zero. The money growth

equation excluding these variables is shown     in   row 5. As r and f—s are

endogenous variables, we also estimate this equation using two—stage least

squares and present the estimates in row 7 of the table. The instrumental

variables used to obtain these estimates represent the variables entering

the Canadian interest rate reaction function (ri, rUS, , and D) and the

lagged value of f—s.42       The effect of r and rus now becomes larger (in

absolute value) and remains significant. The effect of f—s, however, is

not significant. This result may reflect the measurement error problem

mentioned above.

    Next we examine the role of the supply side factors in the demand for

mtmey.    In   table 1 we present estimates of the short—run money demand

equation of the form (15) in rows 2 and 3, using the ordinary least squares

and two—stage least squares procedures, respectively. As y represents an

additional endogenous variable in the money demand relationship, the list

of instrumental variables now includes additional variables relevant to

predicting y. The additional variables represent yUS (U.S. output measured

in logarithms) as well as the lagged values of certain Canadian variables

used in the forecasting equation deveioped in section II to measure r.
                                                                         —43

    The results reported in table 1 support the view that supply—side con—
                                      20 —


siderations   matter in the adjustment mechanism. As the results show,

rUS exerts a positive and significant effect on the real stock of money.

This evidence is inconsistent with the conventional closed—economy for-

mulation in which r'5 would be absent from the money demand function. It

is also inconsistent with the conventional open—economy variant where

r would have a negative effect on the demand for money. The f—s variable

which did not survive the two—stage money supply regression was also found

not significant in the two—stage money demand regression. Finally, it is

interesting to note that the introduction of rUS in the money demand

regression increases the absolute value of the coefficient of r. In the

two—stage regression, this coefficient is equal to —1.33. In the absence

of supply side factors in the adjustment mechanism     =
                                                           2   =   0),   such a

value would imply a long—run interest elasticity equal to —1.23 (at the

average value of the interest rate over the the given period).44 This

estimate of the long—run elasticity would appear to be too large in rela-

tion to previous estimates.45 If the modified adjustment mechanism is

used, however, the coefficient of r would also include the supply side

effect (recall 12 =      +     and the implied long—run interest elasticity

could be considerably lower.


V. Conclusions and Implications

   Three conclusions emerge from the study of the Bank of Canada's use

of an interest rate control procedure to determine monetary growth. The

first conclusion is that under the interest rate procedure, for an open

economy such as Canada, foreign shocks cause disturbances to the money

supply through the domestic credit market. Canada's use of an interest
                                    — 21 -


rate   as its policy instrument for controlling money growth thus leads to a

hitherto unrecognized channel of interdependence. When interest rates rise

in the United States, the Canadian nonbank public will switch from domestic

to foreign bonds. Under interest rate control, the authorities and the

banking sector will buy all domestic bonds that are offered by the public,

with expansionary effects on money growth. This effect represents a chan-

nel that is additional to the Bank of Canada's direct response to changes

in U.S. interest rates through a domestic interest rate reaction function

—— a well understood channel of interdependence.

   A second conclusion is that variability in money growth attributable to

foreign shocks can easily be misinterpreted as instability in the demand

for money. The reason for the misinterpretation is that the conventional

specification of the short—run mechanism by which actual real money balan-

ces adjust to desired real money balances is inadequate. We argue in the

paper that money supply disturbances should be included in the adjustment

mechanism, and that these disturbances could account for apparent shifts in

the demand for money.

   A final conclusion is that use of an interest rate as the policy

instrument is a mechanism that may be incompatible with the objective of

stable money growth. The basic problem is that the demand function in the

credit market is likely to be very sensitive to the differential between

the rate the authorities set and the rate of return on close substitutes.

Movements in rates of return on substitutes relative to the controlled

interest rate would shift the demand function for credit and change the

money stock. In an open economy, foreign securities are a close substitute

for domestic credit and changes in rates of return on foreign assets are an
                                     — 22 —



important   source of monetary variability.

   The foregoing considerations suggest that a policy of money growth

targeting through the use of an interest rate control procedure is doomed

to failure even if there is no conflict with other objectives. Even if the

central bank takes into account the role of domestic credit in the deter-

mination of money growth, large movements in money growth could still occur

because of large unanticipated changes in the demand for domestic credit in

response to changes in the rate of return on alternative assets.

   This paper implies that the behavior of money growth would be different

under reserve control. Suppose that the Bank's money supply procedure were

based on reserve control. It would provide the banks the reserves that

would be adequate to support the growth rate of the money supply that it

deemed appropriate. If it ignored the movements in U.S. interest rates,

Canadian nationals might still choose to switch from domestic to foreign

bonds with initially higher U.S. interest rates, but the nonbank public

would not find ready buyers in the banking sector for their domestic bonds.

The yields on domestic bonds would therefore rise to match the U.S.

interest rate, and money supply growth would be unaffected.

   Again, under reserve control, the effect of exchange rate management on

the money supply could be completely sterilized, but the Canadian interest

rate would have to move to clear the credit market.46 In those circumstan-

ces, there would be no link between U.S. interest rates and Canadian money

growth. With exchange market intervention not fully sterilized, reserve

control would be weakened.

   All things considered, in our judgment if the objective of the Canadian

monetary authorities is to achieve control of the money supply process, the
                                    — 23 —


interest   rate procedure is a self—defeating means. For an open economy,

that procedure will heighten interdependence.

    'According to DeGrauwe and Fratianni (1984, Table 5), for example,

correlations of the average annual growth rates of Ml of 7 major countries

increased in 1971—81 compared to 1960—70. Also see McKinnon (1982, 1984),

and Dornbusch and Fischer (1984).

    2Some examples are Canada, Germany and the U.K. See Federal Reserve

Bank of New York (1983), pp. 102—4, 22—4, 54—9.

    3me Bank of Canada announced: "It would not seem appropriate for the

time being to have an underlying rate of monetary growth below 10 per cent

per year, but that on the other hand, an underlying rate of 15 per cent

would be too high" (statement by Governor Bouey in testimony before the

House of Commons Standing Committee on Finance, Trade and Economic Affairs,

November 6, 1975). Courchene (1977), p. 27. Subsequent announcements gra-

dually lowered the average target rate to 6% by February 1981. The target

range was also narrowed from 5 to 4 percentage points.

    4The simple correlation of quarterly Canadian M1 money growth with U.S.

short—term interest rates is .58 for 19791V to 19831.

    5The standard deviation of the quarterly rate of change of the U.S.

3—month T—bfll rate increased from .012 1970111 — 1979111 to .029 19791V —

19831.   In October 1979, the Federal Reserve System changed its monetary

control variable, substituting nonborrowed reserves for the Federal funds

rate. It is widely believed that this change in the monetary control

variable is responsible for wider variability in both U.S. money growth and

interest rates. (See Friedman (1984), Mascaro and Meltzer (1983).

    6See, for instance the Governor's Remarks (Bank of Canada Review,
                                   — 27


September 1982):

       "Notwithstanding the contribution of monetary targeting in getting

monetary policy to a better track, practical problems have emerged in

Canada, and I expect other countries as well, which have reduced the use-

fulness of these targets as policy guides       .Perhaps the most trouble-

some problem in Canada is that the relationship between our target monetary

aggregate——N1—--and the level of spending has not turned out to be as stable

s it ppearc.d in fh micl—1970's"

    7See e.g. Lucas (1984).

    8See Carr and Darby (1981) for a related shock—absorber view of money.

See also Judd and Scadding (1981) and White (1981).

    9See, for instance, White (1979) for such an interpretation.

   '°See, for instance, Clinton (1973), Gregory and Mackinnon (1980),

Poloz (1980), Bordo and Choudhri (1982).

   The Bank actually announced target rates of growth measured with refer-

ence to a specified base period. it is possible, however, to calculate

   as follows: Mt = Mt_n ÷ gn, where M_ is the logarithm of the money

stock in the base period t — n and g is the mid value of the announced

target range.

   '2See Parkin (1981). Also see Courchene's (1979) discussion of the

Bank's approach.

   '3According to the Bank (1982a, p. 27), "The Bank thus never regarded

its Ml target system as some sort of automatic pilot for monetary policy.

In the short run it was something to be taken into account along with other

considerations."
                                        28 —



   14Since the Bank of Canada believes that it "can exert a substantial

degree of influence over interest rates at the short end of the maturity

spectrum" (Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 1983, P. 100), in our empiri-

cal work we use a representative short—term interest rate ——       the sime rate

that we use in the demand for money regressions below. Representative

short—term rates include the Treasury bill rate, the rate on 90—day finance

company paper, and the call money rate.

   '5To test the possibility that postal strikes during this period had a

significant impact on the demand for money, we reestimated the demand for

money regressions with dummy variables for major postal strikes. Although

some postal strike dummies were significant, they did not affect the

results much. We have omitted them from the regression equations shown in

the table to simplify the presentation.

   '61n the forecasting equations, we used first differences of quarterly P

and y. LP and iy were both regressed on their own four lagged values as

well as four lagged values of a number of Canadian macro variables. In

addition to LiP and Liy, we included Lir, LiM, Lis and LiU, where s is the

logarithm of the spot exchange rate and U the unemployment rate. The four

lagged values of these variables were retained in the forecasting equation

only if they were jointly significant at the 5% level. (The forecasting

equation for Liy included lagged values of tiM and AU in addition to own

lagged values. The equation for LiP, however, did not retain any variable

except   own lagged values.) The predicted value of y is defined as
     plus the predicted value of Ay.

   '7We used quarterly data because the estimates of the money demand func—
                                        — 29 —


tion   discussed above are quarterly.

   18We assume that while the exchange rate is observed immediately, the

information on the rates of inflation and unemployment becomes available to

the Bank with a lag. The expected rates of inflation and unemployment,

however, were estimated according to the procedure discussed in note 16

which assumes a one quarter information lag. As the actual information lag

may have been shorter, we also introduced unexpected rates of these

variables in the regression but found these to be insignificant.

   -9Expected changes in the unemployment rate as well as the inflation

rate were also tried but turned Out to be insignificant.

   200ur measure of r would, of course, not be exactly the same as the r

that the Bank may have utilized. In some respects, we may have assumed

that too little information was available to the Bank, but in other

respects, too much. Information lags, on the one hand, may be considerably

less than one quarter, but on the other hand, the estimates of money demand that

we used are based on the data for the whole period. It is also possible that

rather than basing r on r, the Bank may have followed a policy simply of

reacting to the last—period deviation of the money stock from its target

value (see Courchene 1979). In an alternative version of the reaction

function, we replaced (r —   ri) by (Mi — Mtl)     but found that the

latter target variable produced similar results.

   21See also Gregory and Reynauld (1985) who reach similar conclusons

using a different form of the reaction function.

   22The relative importance of the money demand residual in explaining the

deviation of     from    is very similar in the period since late 1979. For
                                     — 30 —


the period 19791V to 1982111, the variance of Xu accounts for 58% of the

total variance of M —        as compared to 44% for the third term and 8% for
                        Mt
the sum of the first two terms in (8).

   231n the Canadian system, less emphasis is placed on open market opera-

tions than in the United States. The Bank of Canada sets Bank Rate at

which recognized money market dealers —— as in the United Kingdom —— can

borrow from the central bank. The Bank can alter bank reserves by the use

of government deposit transfers, augmenting reserves by transfers of the

deposits to chartered banks, diminishing reserves by transfers of the depo-

sits to the Bank. With fewer than a dozen chartered banks, the Bank can

also rely on moral suasion. Chartered banks are subject to a fixed 12%

primary reserve ratio on demand Canadian dollar liabilities and 4% on

savings deposits. A secondary reserve ratio —— the ratio of the sum of

Treasury bills, call loans, and cash in excess of the primary reserve

requirement to total Canadian dollar liabilities ——    to   which the chartered

banks are subject, may be varied by the Bank from 0% to 12%. If actual

reserves of the chartered banks fell short of the reserves provided by the

Bank, the chartered banks could reduce their call loans and force the money

market dealers to borrow from the Bank. The chartered banks could also buy

Treasury bills in the open market to meet any secondary reserve deficiency.

See Courchene (1976, pp. 11—31).

   24The term commercial bank credit is sometimes used to refer to bank

loans. Here we do not emphasize the distinction between bank loans and

other earning assets of commercial banks.

   25See Laidler (1980) who refers to the conventional view as the money—

market view and the alternative view as the credit—market view.
                                       — 31 —


   26Alternative     assets refer to financial assets other than those included

in the balance sheets of the consolidated banking sector. These alter-

natives would include equities and would represent foreign as well as

domestic assets.

   271n the empirical work discussed below, MS is defined as narrow money.

Tittie deposits are thus being aggregated with other interest—bearing assets.

   28As our main concern is with the role of r and rUS + a in the domestic

credit function, we did not explore, in our empirical estimation of (11)

below, the possible influence of other variables such as an index of

wealth. We did, however, consider the possibility that if the adjustment

of actual 'to the desired stock of domestic credit is completed in each

period, the change in the demand for domestic credit may depend on first

differences rather than levels of the rates of return. We tried a domestic

credit function with L(r'5 + a) and tr as the arguments, but found that

this variant did not perform as well as (11) above.

   29See Canada. Department of Finance (1982), and Federal Reserve Bank of

New York (1983, p. 103), for a discussion of the Bank of Canada's reaction

to movements in the Canadian exchange rate relative to the U.S.     dollar.
   30We   exclude   from this simple example a shift from domestic money or

equities into foreign bonds.

   3'It has been argued that while there may be significant transactions

costs of switching from broad money to other assets, these costs are low

for shifts between narrow money and time deposits. See, for example,

Coodfriend (1984).

   32As Laidler (1984) suggested, even if the interest rate is flexible, it
                                      — 32 —


could clear the credit market but need not imply clearing of the money

market, if some other market, such as the capital goods market, does not

clear rapidly and is therefore characterized by excess demand or supply.

   33An alternative interpretation of the partial adjustment mechanism,

suggested by Goodfriend (1984), is that the mechanism could represent

errors in the measurement of the arguments in the demand for money.

   34See McKinnon and Milbourne (1984).

          crrt      iv         P      -        I           I - A disriissd in
the next section, X variables in (13) did not turn out to be significant

and thus we have not included them in (14).

   36Note that the residuals in the regression equation in row 1 of table 1

would now represent not only e but also the effect of the omitted term

rus +c.
   37A positive effect of rS on m would also be implied by currency—

substitution models which assume r_rS to be a measure of . For instance,

in the special case of perfect interest arbitrage and zero risk premium, r—

r'8 would exactly equal a. Substituting 0 =    rru5       in (17) and rearranging,

the coefficient of rUS would equal:       —               which would be positive
                                                   Xct,
with      < 0. However, if there are departures from the above special case,

the currency—substitution model can be discriminated from the supply—side

effects by estimating the money demand function of the form (17), which

includes a as well as r and        In this form, the coefficient of r'8 must

be negative or zero according to the currency—substitution model when the

supply—side effect is absent. Also see note 38 below.

   38Note that if f—s is a poor proxy for a because of the presence of the
                                            — 33 —


risk    premium, (r_rUS) uld also be a poor proxy for .                 For instance, let

f—s = ci+p, and r_rUS = f—s+c, where p is the risk premium and c represents.

departures from perfect interest rate arbitrage. It follows that r_rlS

a+p+c. As there is no reason to suspect a systematic negative association

between p and c, r_rUS in fact would provide a noisier signal on a than f—s.

   39me implied departure from interest rate arbitrage may be due to tran-

sactions costs. There may also be measurement errors in that the reported

data for f and s may not represent the true transaction values.

   40me expected values were estimated using the procedure discussed in

note 16. Because of the caveat discussed in note 18, unexpected rates of

inflation and unemployment were also considered as additional variables in

the regressions but these variables were not significant.

   41me coefficients of the reaction function were stable betwen sub—

periods with and without the target policy, according to the F—test at the

5% level.

   42The lagged value of f—s was significant in a regression of f—s on r
        us
and r

   43The complete list of instrumental variables for this regression

includes r, r, D, (f)                US              and four lagged values of

        and Lyt.

   441n the semilog money demand function that we use, the long—run elasti-

city at r0 would equal a2 r0. From (15) (with 82               0), a2 =               The

value of the interest elasticity in the text is calculated using estimates

of 12 and X from       regression   3 in   table   1 and letting
                                                                   r0     .097 (the
average      value of r over the period).
                                   — 34 —



   45Previous studies tend to find the long—run elasticity of money demand

(defined as a positive value) considerably less than one. See, for

example, Laidler (1977).

   461t is interesting to note, however, that under interest rate control,

exchange rate management may not be inferior on grounds of money growth

variability, since in the absence of such a policy, the differential bet—

ween Canadian and U.S. interest rates might be greater leading to greater

monetary variability.
