                                           ABSTRACT

We document several empirical regularities regarding the evolution of urban structure in the largest
U.S. metropolitan areas over the period 1980-1990. These regularities relate to changes in resident
population, employment, occupations, as well as the number and size of establishments in different
sections of the metropolitan area. We then propose a theory of urban structure that emphasizes the
location and internal structure decisions of firms. In particular, firms can decide to locate their
headquarters and operation plants in different regions of the city. Given that cities experienced
positive population growth throughout the 1980s, we show that firm fragmentation produces the
diverse set of facts documented in the paper.

   The internal structure of U.S. metropolitan areas has evolved dramatically over the last
three decades. This evolution exhibits striking patterns that hold for a wide range of cities.
If one divides metropolitan areas into a center county and edge counties, employment and
residential population have increased both at the center and at the edge. However, over this
period, we also observe an important increase in the share of city residents, employment, and
establishments at the edge. This shift in economic activity to the edge of the city is more
pronounced for non-management occupations than for managers. In addition, the size of
establishments decreased in both areas throughout this period. The first part of this paper
is devoted to documenting these changes in U.S. cities.
   What accounts for the evolution of U.S. urban structure over this period? Much of the
urban literature attributes the migration of residents to the edge to decreases in transport
costs. Explanations of this type, however, are generally not consistent with the migration of
workers and firms to the edge.1 Furthermore, there exists a more fundamental problem with
all available explanations for subsets of these phenomena. Specifically, such explanations rely
on mechanisms that decrease agglomeration forces at the center thereby explaining how the
share of economic activity can increase at the periphery, but not the simultaneous increase
in the level of economic activity at the center. These theories are also silent on the issues of
functional (management versus non-management) and establishment shifts.2
   This paper proposes a simple theory aimed at addressing the full set of facts we have
just described. The key concept we emphasize relates to firms’ ability to break down their
production process into headquarters and production plants, where either can locate in dif-
ferent sections of the city: firm fragmentation. Given this margin, we show that increases
in population lead to changes in organizational structure such that a larger proportion of
firms choose not to integrate their operations. In particular, standard agglomeration forces
motivate firms to keep only those workers at the center who benefit from interactions in
downtown locations (i.e. those arising from knowledge spillovers or, more generally, pro-
duction externalities). Consequently, as city population increases, employment rises at the
center but this rise is driven primarily by increases in managerial population and, therefore,
establishments. In addition, since each manager at a headquarter supervises several work-

and Burchfield et. al.(2004) for a recent empirical study of urban sprawl in the US.
    2
      In theories developed by Fujita and Ogawa (1982), or Lucas and Rossi-Hansberg (2002), a decline in
transport costs tends to disentangle the location of business and residential areas and can lead to employment
concentration at the center. Because these theories incorporate a richer spatial dimension, the implications
of commuting costs, or changes in externality parameters, depend on exactly how one defines the city center.
These theories do not incorporate occupational choices or firms’ integration decisions.

ers, and the production plants of these new firms are located more remotely, employment
growth is even more pronounced at the periphery. These changes immediately translate into
a decline in the share and a simultaneous increase in the level of employment in the central
region of the city.
   Because land rents are lower nearer the city’s outskirts, population growth implies that
more firms will integrate their operations away from the center. Therefore, increases in
population also lead to an increase in managerial employment at the periphery, reenforcing
the decline in the share of center employment. Ultimately, however, the combined set of
changes resulting from a rise in city population implies a concentration of managers at
the center. Furthermore, consistent with the data, rising urban population also leads to a
decrease in the share of establishments at the center, and a decrease in establishment sizes
as more establishments form part of non-integrated firms.
   The objective of the paper is in part to underscore, as clearly and cleanly as possible, the
usefulness of the firm fragmentation margin in simultaneously explaining diverse changes in
urban structure. Thus, our theory abstracts from other urban forces necessary to make the
theory a useful quantitative tool. In particular, we assume that managers only control one
operation plant, that they need to rent one unit of land per worker, but that headquarters
do not use land. These assumptions greatly simplify the analysis, but can be completely or
partially relaxed without overturning the substance of our results.
   One interpretation of the theory we present, and the empirical evidence more broadly, is
that with firms sending their larger and more routine operations to the periphery, city centers
are steadily becoming management or administrative hubs. Examples of firms breaking
up their operations geographically within a given metropolitan area are ubiquitous across
industries. For instance, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York moved its cash and check
processing center to neighboring East Rutherford, NJ in 1992; the Washington Post moved
its printing operations away from its headquarters in downtown Washington to neighboring
Springfield, VA in 1999; the tire manufacturer Michelin, headquartered in Greenville, SC,
located its rubber production operations in nearby Anderson County in 2000; and Home
Depot is currently moving a distribution center to McDonough Georgia outside Atlanta, the
location of its corporate headquarters. More comprehensive evidence related to the physical
separation of firm headquarters and production facilities in cities is provided in Ono and
Henderson (2005), who also point out that doing so increases the costs of managing plant
activities. These costs increase non-trivially with distance but, by locating its headquarters
in a metro area, the firm also gains in the ability to gather information.3

    Kim (1999) presents evidence of the increase in firm fragmentation in in overall U.S. manufacturing.
He argues that firm fragmentation grew significantly between 1958 and 1987. In 1987, 21.9% of firms had



                                                   3
   In a related paper, Chatterjee and Carlino (2001) argue, using a theory of a system of
cities, that the deconcentration of U.S. metropolitan employment stems from an increase
in aggregate employment. The theory they present is one where an aggregate increase in
employment raises densities faster in small metropolitan areas than in larger ones, since
large metropolitan areas already have high employment densities and cannot accommodate
the new workers cheaply enough. Our paper shares with Chatterjee and Carlino (2001) the
focus on population growth as the main engine driving the structural change of U.S. cities. In
contrast to their work, however, we model a representative city, rather than the interaction
between cities, and focus on its internal structure. That is, we study the spatial allocation
of employment within a city. We also analyze the location decisions of establishments and
agents in diﬀerent occupations. The new set of facts we uncover leads us to emphasize firms’
integration decisions, which we argue can rationalize observed changes in city structure as a
result of population growth alone.
   Along a diﬀerent line of work, Duranton and Puga (2004) argue that cities have moved
from being sectorally specialized to becoming functionally specialized. They contend that
decreases in the cost of communication between headquarters and plants have lead to the
location of headquarters in cities and the location of production plants in smaller towns. Our
view of the changes in city structure shares many elements with their work. In particular,
Duranton and Puga (2004) also model explicitly the firm’s decision to integrate its headquar-
ters and production plants. In their view, this integration decision has implications across
metropolitan areas. In fact, we argue that firms’ ability to separate headquarters and plants
is also key in explaining changes in the internal structure of cities. Our paper diﬀers from
Duranton and Puga (2004) in that we do not view changes in communication technology as
the force underlying changes in urban structure, but instead show that the latter changes
emerge simply from rising population. Further, our framework has implications for the share
of establishments located in diﬀerent sections of the city that are consistent with the data.
Davis and Henderson (2004) provide evidence that complements our findings. They observe
that firms take advantage of services and production externalities (which decline with dis-
tance) at the city’s business sectors by locating their headquarters at the center and their
operation plants elsewhere in the city.
   Finally, the notion of shifts in economic activity away from city centers has also been
addressed from the standpoint of city governance considerations. Perhaps the most famil-
iar argument being that suburban residents benefit from city-produced public goods and
infrastructure (e.g. transportation systems, museums) while at the same time not contribut-
ing, or contributing very little, to the financing of such infrastructure. Thus, as cities raise
multiple plants, and these firms accounted for 73.1% of total employment.

their taxes or lower their public services, because of weak city fiscal institutions or other
motives, mobile firms and households leave the city.4 Our theory implies a move in eco-
nomic activity away from city centers quite independently of these fiscal considerations and
provides a new dimension to the debate.
   The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our data organized in nine
diﬀerent stylized facts. Section 3 presents a simple urban framework that incorporates the
firm’s integration decision. Section 4 shows that increases in population lead to changes in
city structure consistent with the diverse stylized facts we present, and Section 5 concludes.

       2. SOME FACTS ON THE EVOLUTION OF CITY STRUCTURE

   This section documents a set of regularities in the evolution of city structure that we care
to rationalize with the simple theory proposed in this paper. We document these facts for
the decade spanning the 1980s, although most of the empirical regularities hold from 1970
to 2000. The reason is that for some of these regularities, in particular the ones that involve
the location of agents with diﬀerent occupations, we do not have data covering a longer
period. Thus, we chose to homogenize the time period and document our stylized facts over
the same decade.
   Given our focus on the structure of cities, we separate the city into two locations: center
and edge. The center is the area encompassed by the central county of the city. The edge is
the set of counties that surround the central county. The central county always includes the
central business district of the city, or the downtown area, and is generally much larger than
just the downtown area. Our study relies on the 50 largest U.S. Metropolitan Areas according
to their 1999 population. In particular, for each city, we use the most extensive definition
of metropolitan area available, either Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or Consolidated
Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA), as defined by the Oﬃce of Management and Budget.
Our focus on counties as the smallest unit of analysis stems partly from data limitations.
One should be cognizant that the size of counties can vary significantly across US cities,
which implies that the central county includes a larger fraction of the city in some cases
than in others. However, given that our focus is on changes in urban structure, that county
definitions did not change during the period we study, and that the facts we document always
apply to all or most of the cities under consideration, cross-sectional variations in county
size is not a primary concern.5
   4
     See Haughwout and Inman (2002) for a study of this phenomenon and its implications. Interestingly,
they show that the resulting loss in scale externalites in city centers feedbacks into the performance of
suburban locations and adversely aﬀects it.
   5
     We do control for county size when computing the correlation of population growth with changes in



                                                   5
   Our data originates from four sources: the Census Bureau “Commute to Work” data, the
Census County Business Patterns, the Housing and Urban Development State of the Cities
database, and the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) Regional Economic Information
System. Importantly, since the theory we propose is that of a city rather than a system of
cities, and we wish to abstract from idiosyncratic city characteristics, our analysis focuses
only on time changes in city structure during the 1980s, and not on the cross-section of city
structures at a given point in time.

2.1 Changes in Absolute Population Levels

  The first set of facts we mention are well known. As shown in Figure 1, overall population
increased throughout the 1980s in all but one city in our sample. City population growth
averaged 21.3% over that period, while Pittsburgh’s population contracted by 0.38%. All
averages presented in this section are weighted averages using population shares, and are
shown as horizontal lines in the bar graphs and circles in the scatter plots. Moreover,
population in most cities increased both at the center and at the edge.

  To illustrate this point, Figure 2 plots population changes in these areas from 1980 to
1990. In almost all cities, changes are positive both at the center and at the edge and, for
some cities, very large. The population of Las Vegas, for example, grew by more than 80%
in the edge counties and more than 50% at the center. A 1% increase in population at the
edge is associated with a 0.6% increase in population at the center. The correlation between
changes in population at the center and at the edge is 0.69. All 50 cities in our sample grew
in terms of edge population, and only 7 declined in terms of population at the center. In
urban structure.

by 12.8% at the center, but increased by 9.7% at the edge.

   Figures 1 and 2 are indicative of overall city population growth, and the fact that this
population locates both at the center and in peripheral counties. A question which then
arises is: has city population growth led to a change in the link between employment location
and residential location? As cities become larger, one might expect residential sprawl (i.e.
residents locating at the boundary of the city) and employment concentration at the center
(see Fujita and Ogawa [1982] and Lucas and Rossi-Hansberg [2002]). In general, our view
of the data is that this phenomenon did not dominate in the U.S.: changes in employment
are in general paralleled by changes in the number of residents in both areas of the city.


                                                                   7
A fact consistent with this view is that net commuting between the center and the edge,
as a percentage of total population, hardly changed throughout the 1980s. Net commuting
represented 8.98% of total MSA population in 1980 and 8.38% in 1990. Average residential
growth in the 1980s amounted to 15.4% at the center and 25.7% at the edge. Similarly,
average employment growth in the 1980s was 14.8% at the center and 28.3% at the edge. This
similarity in the size of changes in employment and residents across city areas is surprising,
and suggests that the link between employment and residential location is a key component
of urban structure. In addition, this evidence suggests that commuting costs did not decline
in any significant way during the 1980s.
   Figure 3 depicts employment growth across all cities in our sample (resident growth is
identical to population growth, which is presented in Figure 2). The figures indicate that
residential population and employment grew in the majority of cities during this period.
More specifically, resident and employment growth is positive at the edge in all cities. At
the center, employment growth is negative in only nine cities while resident growth is negative
in only seven cities.

2.2 Changes in Population Shares Across City Areas

  The facts we have just presented relate to absolute, not relative, employment and resident
growth. We now address changes in the shares of residents and employment at the edge
during the 1980s. Our data show that the shares of both residents and employment have
generally increased at the edge. That is, while levels grew everywhere, the share of population
has shifted from the center to the edge of U.S. cities. The average increase in the share of
employment at the edge during the 1980s was 3.11% while the average increase in the share
of residents at the edge was 2.64%. Put simply, economic activity in the U.S. is moving
to the periphery. Figure 4 depicts changes in resident and employment shares at the edge
during this period. It is clear from the graph that in most U.S. cities, the share of individuals
who both reside and work at the edge increased.
  Given the shift in employment shares towards the periphery, one might wonder whether
the increase in edge employment was driven by particular industries. In other words, the
facts above could have resulted from specific industries moving away from city centers while
other industries, perhaps less labor and land intensive, moved to the city center. This does
not appear to be the case. The average employment share at the center declined from 0.42
to 0.38 in manufacturing and from 0.47 to 0.43 in services. That is, average employment
shares declined by about the same percentage in both sectors.

2.3 Changes in the Location of Managers

   To gain further insight into the change in employment shares at the center, we examine
the change in employment across occupations. In particular, we divide employment into two
classes: management and non-management occupations. The first class includes managers
and professional workers. The second includes what the Housing and Urban Development
State of the Cities database classifies as non-management workers.6 The latter category
includes technicians, sales, administrative support, precision workers, laborers and machine
operators, and service workers.
   The ratio of managers to non-managers at the center increased in all but 7 cities in our
sample. The average change in this ratio during the 1980s was 10.16%. The ratio of managers
to non-managers at the edge also rose in all but a handful of cities during this period, with
an average increase of 7.48%. Although these facts are informative about changes in city
structure, comparisons related to the relative location of managers and non-managers are
also telling. Figure 5a compares the change in the ratio of managers to non-managers at the
center with the change in the same ratio at the edge. Note that the number of managers
relative to that of non-managers increased more rapidly at the center than at the edge in 84%
of the cities throughout the 1980s.7 There are only 8 cities (out of 50) where the reverse is
   6
     The definition of center and edge in the HUD database diﬀers somewhat from our previous breakdown
in terms of counties. These data divide the city into a business center (defined by the geographical city
boundary) and the CMSA/MSA area outside of it. For consistency, we extend the business center area to
that of the central county, using the assumption that densities of managers and non-managers are constant
within each area.

     The ratio of managers to non-managers increased both at the center and at the edge in every city.

true. Increases in manager to non-manger ratios were on average 2.68% larger at the center
than at the edge.

   In general, therefore, our interpretation of the data is that city centers are becoming man-
agement or administrative hubs, with managers heading operation plants at the boundary
of the city where land is cheap. In fact, we shall use this interpretation of Figure 5a in the
model we develop below. Observe that although managers were generally more concentrated
in city centers throughout the 1980s, every single city over this period saw an increase in the
overall ratio of managers to population. In other words, cities as a whole are also evolving
towards administrative functions. Figure 5b illustrates the change in the ratio of manage-
ment to population, with a mean of approximately 4.13% across all cities. The evidence
presented in Figure 5b only reinforces the findings in Duranton and Puga (2004) who argue
for the functional specialization of cities.

2.4 Changes in the Location and Characteristics of Establishments

   Having set out some facts regarding changes in population location within U.S. cities, we
now turn to the location of establishments in diﬀerent parts of the city. Consistent with over-
all population and employment growth throughout the 1980s, the number of establishments
also increased in all but three U.S. cities, both at the center and at the edge. The number
of establishments grew on average by 30.1% at the center and by 50.5% at the boundary.
Hence, while the net entry of firms or plants is more pronounced at the city edge, firm entry
is also substantial at the center. The correlation between establishment net entry at the
center and edge is 0.45.
   Figure 6 illustrates these changes. Note that in some cities, net entry of establishments at
the edge exceeds 80% over our sample period and, in some cases, reaches as high as 110%.
Although central counties experienced significant net establishment entry throughout the
1980s, more establishments located at the boundary over that period. Indeed, the change
in the share of establishments at the center is negative in all but a few cities, as Figure 7
illustrates. The average change in the share of establishments located at the center is -3.65%.
In 64% of the cities, the share of establishments was larger at the center than at the edge in
1980, with an average establishment share of 54.9% at the center.



                                       Figure 6: Establishment Growth at the Center and at
                                                       the Edge, 1980-1990

  Therefore, while more than one half of the establishments were located at the center in
1980, many new firms chose to locate near the city’s outskirts during the subsequent decade
which lead to a significant decrease in the share of firms residing at the center.

   How were establishment sizes, measured in number of employees, aﬀected during this
period? In general, we find that establishment sizes declined over the 1980s. This finding
is consistent with other evidence in the literature regarding the average size of firms in the
U.S. (see Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg [2004]). Establishment sizes declined on average by
4.08% at the center and 3.92% at the edge. Figure 8 shows changes in establishment sizes
both at the center and at the edge. We can see that for most cities, establishment sizes fell
in both regions. This finding, however, does not hold for all cities.

  About half of the cities in our sample experienced a decline in average establishment size
in both regions simultaneously. Establishments tend to be larger at the center than at the
boundary, with 21.4 employees per establishment at the center versus 17.1 employees per
establishment at the edge in 1980.

                                                                         12
   The last characteristic of urban economic activity that we wish to establish in this section
concerns the relationship between changes in the number of managers and the number of
establishments across cities. Figures 9a and 9b illustrate this relationship. Observe that the
number of establishments and managers are highly correlated: the correlation is 0.81 at the
center and 0.62 at the edge. At the center, a 1% increase in the number of managers is associ-
ated with a 0.89% increase in the number of establishments, where the fit is characterized by
a surprisingly large R2 statistic, 0.65. In contrast, at the edge, a 1% increase in the number
of managers is associated with only 0.57% more establishments, with the relationship having
a much lower R2 . This evidence suggests that the number of establishment per manager at
the center is larger than at the edge, and that changes in the number of establishments are
more tightly related to changes in managers at the center than at the edge.

  Although our measure of managers also includes professional workers, the fact that man-
agers and establishment are so closely linked gives us some confidence that many of these
agents are in fact performing administrative or managerial roles.

2.5 Stylized Facts on Urban Structural Change

  We now summarize the set of stylized facts presented for the fifty largest U.S. cities over
the 1980-1990 decade. Throughout the paper, we shall refer to these stylized facts by the
number we assign to each below.

  1. Overall population growth.

  2. Resident population growth at the center and at the edge of cities.

  3. Employment growth at the center and at the edge of cities.

  4. A similar reduction in resident and employment shares at the center.

      (a) Present both in services and manufacturing.

  5. City centers increasingly becoming management or administrative hubs:

      (a) An increase in the ratio of managers to non-managers at the center compared to
          the same ratio at the edge.
      (b) An increase in the total number of managers relative to total employment.

  6. An increase in the number of establishments at the center and at the edge of cities.

  7. A decline in the establishment share at the center.

  8. A decline in establishment size both at the center and at the edge of cities.

  9. The number of establishments and managers are more tightly related at the center
     than at the edge.

   In the next section, we propose a simple model of city structure and explain how Fact 1
alone can lead to stylized Facts 2 through 9. Put another way, it is possible to think of the
changes in residents, employment, occupations, and establishments described above as the
result of urban population growth. At the heart of the theory we present lies a decision on
the part of firms to either integrate their operations in one location or separate them into
headquarters and production plants. We argue that adding this additional margin to urban
models is crucial in explaining the diverse set of changes observed in the internal structure
of U.S. cities.

                                      3. THE MODEL

   This section presents a theory of the internal structure of cities simple enough to remain
analytically tractable yet rich enough to address the diverse set of facts outlined in the
previous section. Since our goal is to illustrate the main forces that lead to these empirical
regularities, we model cities as consisting of only two areas: the center of the city and what
we call the edge. We think of these two areas as the model equivalent of the central and edge
counties in the data. Given this parallel, we assume that the central area of the city is given
exogenously by Lc > 0. The edge area is endogenous, and we denote it by Lb > 0, where
b stands for the city boundary. We assume that residential land rents at the edge are given
by an agricultural land rent, R ≥ 0, that represents its opportunity cost. Land rents at the
center of the city are endogenous and determined in equilibrium. Total city population, P , is
exogenously given. In fact, we shall argue below that the theory we develop can rationalize
the set of stylized facts presented above simply as the result of population growth. Our
theory, therefore, is a partial equilibrium theory that takes as given two key elements from
national economic behavior, namely, agricultural land rents and city population sizes. Any
theory of city structure must take a stand on the variables to be determined at the aggregate
rather than the city level, and our choice is driven by the set of facts that we seek to explain.
   The key insight of our model is that allowing firms to separate their location into head-
quarters and production plants implies that city growth leads to a set of empirical regularities
regarding urban structure. Headquarters develop knowledge and, therefore, experience exter-
nal eﬀects from other headquarters. Knowledge transactions are carried out in headquarters
which tend to agglomerate in high rent areas of the city. Production plants, in contrast,
carry out more routine tasks that do not lead to knowledge spillovers and, consequently,
tend to locate in areas where land rents are low. Production plants in our framework can be
interpreted as either manufacturing plants, retail stores, or other production facilities.

3.1 Firms

   The city produces and consumes one good, the price of which we normalize to one. A firm
is made up of a manager who hires workers to produce. The manager and her workers can
locate at either the center or the edge of the city. We refer to the location of the manager as
the firm’s headquarters and the location of her workers as the firm’s production plant. The
number of workers a manager can hire is determined by whether the firm is located in only
one location (an integrated firm), or whether the headquarters and production plants reside
in diﬀerent locations. In the former case, the manager finds it less costly to communicate
and interact with workers that are located close by so that she can oversee a larger set of

                                               15
workers, ncc = nbb = αδ > 1, where nij denotes the number of employees of a firm with
headquarters in area i and production plant in area j. In contrast, if the manager decides
to set up a non-integrated firm, she needs to spend additional resources to monitor and
interact with her workers, who are physically removed, and her span of control is given by
ncb = nbc = αδ > 1, where δ < δ. This assumption is motivated by Fact 9 above. In other
words, in the data, changes in the number of managers are clearly positively correlated with
changes in the number of establishments both at the center and at the edge. In fact, the
correlation between changes in managers and changes in the number of establishments is
significantly higher at the center than at the edge in the 1980s, which is consistent with a
constant number of managers per firm (abstracting from composition eﬀects which are not
present at the center).8
   In our model, the location of a firm’s headquarters matters significantly in that it deter-
mines its productivity. In particular, firm productivity depends on the number of managers
located in the area of the city where the firm’s headquarters are located: a production ex-
ternality. Total output of a firm with headquarters in area i and production plant in area
j is given by AEi nij , where Ei denotes the number of managers in i and A is a city-wide
productivity parameter. A firm has to pay labor costs given by a city-wide wage w > 0
(since all agents in the city are assumed identical) times the number of workers it hires, nij ,
as well as land rents. We assume that the firm needs to hire one unit of land per worker
in order to operate, so that total land rent paid by this firm is given by Rj nij .9 Firms are
owned by managers whose earnings are given by firms’ profits. It follows that a manager
who owns the firm we have just described earns

                                      Fij = (AEi − w − Rj )nij .                                      (1)

The problem of a manager is then to choose the location of the firm’s headquarter and
production plant to solve

                         F = max {Fij } for i, j ∈ {c, b} and subject to
                               ij
                              ⎧
                              ⎨ αδ if i = j
                        nij =                .
                              ⎩ αδ if i 6= j

Put alternatively, managers decide whether to locate at the center or at the edge of the city
and, from that location, whether to operate integrated or separate production facilities.
   8
     See Garicano (2000), and Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg (2003), for organizational models that yield
smaller team sizes as communication costs increase.
   9
     Note that managers do not require land. Relaxing this assumption implies that we need to relax some
other assumptions as well since, if not, employment at the center is fixed by the amount of units of land.
One possibility is to allow for some substitution between land and labor.

                                                   16
3.2 Individuals

   A population P of identical agents lives and works in the city. Agents consume the only
good produced in the city and live where they work. The latter assumption is justified by
the fact that in the data, employment and residents in both areas of the city have moved to
the edge in similar proportions, as summarized in Fact 4. Recall also that the share of net
commuters between the center and edge stayed remarkably constant throughout our sample
period. Hence, although commuting is potentially important in explaining the cross-section
of urban structures in the U.S., it is not a driving force underlying observed changes.
   Consumers order consumption according to a linear utility function. Therefore, given that
the price of consumption goods is normalized to one, they solve
                                                  ©     ª
                                           U = max F , w .                                             (2)

Since all agents are identical and, in equilibrium, some agents become managers while others
become workers, F = w. Furthermore, the fact that all agents have the option to set up
integrated or non-integrated firms in any set of locations yields, in equilibrium, F = Fij for
all operating firms with headquarters in i and production plants in j.10

3.3 Equilibrium

  We denote by Eij the number of managers operating firms with headquarters in i and
operation plants in j. Hence, the total number of managers at location i, Ei , is given by

                                            Ei = Eii + Eij .                                           (3)

Since the number of units of land at the center is exogenously given by Lc , and firms rent
one unit of land per worker, the number of workers at the center is given by

                                         Lc = Ecc ncc + Ebc nbc .                                      (4)

Analogously, the number of workers at the edge is also given by the number of units of land
used at the boundary,
                                 Lb = Ecb ncb + Ebb nbb .                                (5)

Land use at the edge, however, is endogenous and the area occupied by the city expands or
contracts as the economic environment changes. It follows that the total number of workers
  10
    We abstract from diﬀerences in agents’ human capital or ability that may lead to diﬀerences in wages or
managerial rents. We could introduce these diﬀerence only to reproduce our findings in terms of eﬃciency
units of labor.


                                                    17
in the city is given by W = Lc + Lb . Total city population is given by these workers plus
those individuals who become managers of firms with headquarters at the center and at the
edge. Therefore, labor market equilibrium requires that

                                         Ec + Eb + W = P.                                          (6)

  We are now ready to define a competitive equilibrium for this city:
  A competitive city equilibrium is a set of scalars {Ec , Eb , Ecc, Ebb , Ecb , Ebc , Lb , Rc , w, F ,
Fcc, Fbb , Fcb , Fbc } such that:

   1. Agents solve (2), managers solve (1), and w = F = Fij for all firms of type ij that
      operate in location, i, j ∈ {c, b} .

   2. Equilibrium conditions (3), (4), (5), and (6) are satisfied.

   3. Population size is given by P , land available at the center by Lc , and land rates at the
      boundary by Rb = R.

  The number of establishments at the center is given by

                                       Sc = Ecc + Ecb + Ebc ,                                      (7)
                                            | {z }
                                                 Ec

where Sc counts integrated production units at the center, Ecc , headquarters at the center
used by managers who operate plants in the periphery, Ecb , and production plants at the cen-
ter run by managers residing at the boundary, Ebc . Similarly, the number of establishments
at the edge is defined as
                                   Sb = Ebb + Ebc + Ecb .                                 (8)
                                        | {z }
                                                 Eb

   Within the framework of our model, average establishment sizes at the center and at the
edge are given by (Lc + Ec )/Sc and (Lb + Eb )/Sb respectively. Establishments are of only
three sizes: size one in the case of headquarters of non-integrated firms, size αδ in the case of
the operation plant of a non-integrated firm, and size 1 + αδ in the case of integrated firms.
   The model we have just laid out potentially yields diﬀerent types of equilibria. These
types correspond to diﬀerent sets of firms (i.e. integrated or not) operating in diﬀerent areas
of the city. The fact that spans of control diﬀer across integrated and non-integrated firms
rules out equilibria where all types of firms coexist. In essence, if diﬀerences in spans of
control are such that a firm finds worth it to locate its headquarters at the center and its
production plant at the edge, then the reverse cannot be true. We formalize this result in
the next proposition. Proofs of all propositions are included in the Appendix.

                                                  18
Proposition 1 There are no equilibria where both integrated and non-integrated firms op-
erate at all locations.

  Of the remaining cases, the one corresponding to the type of city encountered in the data
has most headquarters locating at the center (which in fact defines what we call the center
and what is defined as a central county in the data). We now show that this case exists as
an equilibrium of our model under a mild parameter restriction. In this equilibrium, there
are no firms whose headquarters are at the edge but whose production plants reside at the
center. Thus, the equilibrium we have just described is such that

                           F = Fcc = Fcb = Fbb = w and Fbc < F ,                          (9)

so that Ecc , Ecb , Ebb > 0 and Ebc = 0. Because land rents are much lower at the edge than at
the center in the data, firms that have operation plants at the center and headquarters at
the edge are indeed very rare. Perhaps the most compelling reason to focus on this type of
equilibrium is Fact 9. This fact shows that the number of managers is very tightly connected
to the number of establishments, especially at the center where the number of managers and
establishments move almost one for one in Figure 9a. In fact, in the model equilibrium with
Ebc = 0, the number of establishments and managers does move one for one at the center
since Sc = Ec from (7). This will not be the case at the edge, however, as Sb = Eb + Ecb
in (8), where Ecb captures establishments that are stand-alone operation plants. As in Fact
9, therefore, this equilibrium of the model implies that changes in managers are less closely
related to changes in establishments at the edge than at the center. Thus, we prove all
results below only for this case.

3.4 Equilibrium Allocation

  Given the restriction Ebc = 0, we now construct an equilibrium allocation for our model.
From (3), we know that Eb = Ebb since Ebc = 0, and that Ecb = Ec − Ecc where, by equation
               ¡ ¢
(4), Ecc = Lc / αδ . Then, the number of workers in the city is given by

                                        Lc + Lb = W

so that                        µ      ¶

                                    δ
  Condition (9) implies that integrated and non-integrated firms at the center earn equal
profits,
                         (AEc − w − Rc )αδ = (AEc − w − R)αδ,                        (11)

                                             19
as do integrated firms across locations,

                          (AEc − w − Rc )αδ = (AEb − w − R)αδ.

These relations implicitly link the number of managers working at the center and boundary
according to
                                               R − Rc
                                     Eb = Ec +        .                              (12)
                                                 A
  Equality between rents and wages then implies that

                                  (AEc − w − Rc )αδ = w.                               (13)

From equations (11) and (13), we further have that

                        (AEc − w − Rc )αδ = w = (AEc − w − R)αδ.

so that Rc > R under our maintained assumption regarding the span of control, δ > δ.
That is, land rents are larger at the center than at the edge, an implication which follows
from the assumption that Ebc = 0. The fact that most cities see land rents decrease as
one moves away from the center is well known and reinforces our focus on an equilibrium
with this feature. Note that the diﬀerence in land rents is simply the diﬀerence in managers
per worker between integrated and non-integrated firms times the city wage. Hence, when
diﬀerent types of firms coexist in equilibrium, the advantage that an integrated firm gains
by locating at the center in terms of lower management costs (i.e. a low manager/worker
ratio) is oﬀset by higher rents at that location.
   From equation (13), and substituting for Rc using (14), we obtain, after some manipula-
tions,
                                        1                1

                                     A         A      A         A
which implies Ec0 (w) > 0; the number of managers at the center increases with city wages.
Using (14) and equation (12), we can solve for the set of managers at the edge as a function
of wages,                                µ ¶           1

                             Eb = Ec +         w=          w+ .                         (16)
                                           A         A         A
Therefore, the number of managers at the edge also increases with wages, but at a slower
rate since the rent diﬀerential decreases with wages and reduces the incentives to locate at
the boundary.

greater externalities are associated with more managers in both areas of the city, the demand
for workers increases as profits rise. The supply of workers is given by

vate more agents to become managers, the supply of workers decreases with profits. The

which ensures that w > 0. This restriction essentially requires city population densities
that are large enough to make the creation of a city profitable given land rents at the
edge. Population densities must also be large enough so that agglomeration eﬀects guarantee
that some non-integrated firms’ headquarters choose to locate at the center. The following
proposition obtains directly from the equilibrium wage derived above.


                                             21
Proposition 2 The equilibrium wage, w, is an increasing function of population size, P ,
and city-wide productivity, A. It is a decreasing function of the supply of land at the center,
Lc , the span of control parameter, α, and edge land rents, R.

   Note that the wage increases with population size. While this finding matches the fact
that wages are generally higher in larger cities, it nevertheless seemingly conflicts with the
standard intuition that wages fall as the supply of workers increases. There are two char-
acteristics of our setup that contribute to overturning this intuition. First, the wage is the
compensation of workers, but since all agents in the city are identical, it also represents
profits of entrepreneurs or managers. Hence, since an increase in overall population creates
new managers, the demand for workers also increases. Second, the production externality
in our framework implies that the more managers operate in a given location, the higher
the productivity (output per worker) of all firms in that location. As population grows, and
more firms operate in the city, this eﬀect contributes to raising manager rents and worker
wages. As we have just mentioned, the prediction regarding wages and city size can be di-
rectly contrasted with data. In 2003, for instance, the average wage in the largest five cities
in our sample was $42,976, as compared to just $34,340 for the five smallest cities.11
   The eﬀect of the model’s other parameters on wages are more standard. Wages increase
with city-wide productivity and decrease with the amount of land available at the center.
The latter result reflects the fact that more firms at the center become integrated as Lc
rises. This eﬀect reduces the number of managers per worker at the center and, therefore,
externalities in that location and manager profits (wages). As rents at the boundary increase,
the advantage of setting up a non-integrated firm falls, which again reduces externalities at
the center and wages. Finally, as firms’ span of control, α, increases, firms become larger,
less agents become managers, and externalities fall along with wages and managerial rents.

                        4. ADDRESSING THE STYLIZED FACTS

   This section shows that the model we have developed naturally leads to the changes in city
structure laid out in Section 2. From Fact 1, we know that population growth was positive
in virtually all cities in our sample. Recall that the first set of facts referred to population
size both at the center and at the edge. Since, in our model, agents live and work in the
same location, the model’s predictions concerning the growth in residents and employment
are identical. Therefore, if we can show that as population grows, employment increases
both at the center and at the edge (Fact 3), then the model will immediately satisfy Fact 2.
   To address Fact 3, observe that two eﬀects emerge as population grows. First, the number
 11
      See Lee (2005) for recent evidence on the urban wage premium.


                                                    22
of managers at the center increases, as a result of the rise in agglomeration eﬀects, which
raises population at the center (recall that the worker population at the center is pinned
down at level Lc by assumption). Second, since managerial population also increases at the
boundary with urban growth, again as a result of larger externalities, so does the number
of workers given the fixed span of control. Therefore, total employment must also increase
at the edge. A portion of the additional workers at the boundary will work for managers
that head firms with headquarters at the center. Ultimately, this reasoning implies that the
model is consistent with Fact 2.
   Total employment at the center and at the edge is given by Ec +Lc and Eb +Lb respectively.
Simple diﬀerentiation then leads to the following proposition, consistent with Facts 2 and 3.
All proofs in this section are relegated to the Appendix.

Proposition 3 An increase in population implies an increase in total employment at the
center, Ec + Lc , and at the edge, Eb + Lb .

   The proposition above provides conclusions regarding the level of employment in both
areas of the city. However, we are equally interested in the share of employment in each
area. We have already argued that as population grows, managerial population increases
at the center. All new center managers, however, lead non-integrated firms. The reason is
that the number of workers at the center cannot expand given the fixed amount of land and
the technology that requires one unit of land per worker. Managers choose non-integrated
rather than integrated firms because rents at the boundary do not grow with population,
since they are pinned down by the opportunity cost of land, R. At the same time, since
the center land area of the city is constant, the price of land increases at the center which
again motivates some managers to send their operation plants to the edge. In fact, rents at
the center rise such that the number of center managers who choose to operate integrated
firms remains constant, which must hold in order for land markets to clear. We can show
that given a large enough population share at the center, the increase in center employment
(caused solely by the increase in managerial population) is always smaller than the increase
in managers and workers at the edge. This result implies that the employment share at the
center falls with population growth, consistent with Fact 4. We formalize this reasoning in
the next proposition.

Proposition 4 An increase in population implies a decrease in the employment share at the
center, EcP+Lc , if and only if
                                                         1

                                          αδ                         αδ



                                               23
   The lower bound on the share of population working at the center amounts to restrictions
on αδ and αδ that turn out to be very mild (the proof of the proposition in the Appendix
includes a parallel restriction expressed only in terms of the exogenous parameters). To see
this, recall that the average employment size of establishments in 1980 was 21.4 at the center
and 17.1 at the edge. Therefore, we can conjecture that αδ ≤ 17.1 since αδ represents the
smallest establishment size at the edge (the edge also encompasses integrated firms but of
size 1 + αδ). Furthermore, it also follows that 1 + αδ ≥ 21.4 since 1 + αδ is the largest
establishment size at the center. Note that the restriction set out in Proposition 4 becomes
more diﬃcult to meet as αδ falls. Thus, suppose that we very conservatively set αδ = 10
and αδ = 20.4. Then Proposition 4 indicates that the share of employment at the center
decreases with overall population whenever the share of center employment exceeds 3.2%, a
condition that is easily met by all cities in our sample.12
   To summarize thus far, an increase in overall city population leads to findings for the levels
and shares of employment in diﬀerent areas of the city that are consistent with the data. In
particular, population growth leads to an increase in employment levels everywhere, but also
to a shift in employment from the center to the edge in shares. These results follow directly
from firms having the opportunity to break up their operations geographically.
   It is diﬃcult to understand how observed changes in levels and shares of population in
diﬀerent sections of the city could be the result of forces that are not related to an overall
expansion in size (i.e. population growth). If other forces were responsible for these changes,
and since one needs to introduce scale eﬀects in order to generate cities, reductions in the
share of employment at the center will generally lead to reductions in the level of employment
as well. Hence, it seems that two elements are needed to obtain models that can reproduce
these dimensions of the data. First, one needs models where these changes are the result of
city growth. Second, these models should also allow for endogenous employment densities.
Evidently, if densities were not endogenous, given that the center county area has not changed
in the data, employment at the center would necessarily be predicted to remain constant.
   The advantage of writing down a model in which agents’ occupations are explicitly consid-
ered is that it has predictions for the eﬀect of changes in exogenous variables on the location
of diﬀerent occupations within cities. In Section 2, we presented a set of facts that are
related to the locations of agents working in diﬀerent occupations. Specifically, we showed
that the change in the manager to non-manager ratio was larger at the center than at the
edge (Fact 5a). This fact implied that managers are increasingly concentrated at the center
  12
     If one actually uses αδ= 17.1 and αδ = 21.4, the lower bound required in Proposition 4 becomes even
less severe at 2.5 percent.




                                                  24
relative to the boundary.13 In addition, Fact 5b showed that the fraction of urban population
in management positions increased during the 1980s. While our model is consistent with
this last fact, other forces working at a more aggregate level — such as changing transport
and communication costs across cities, or between cities and rural areas — may have helped
increase the total number of managers in the city beyond that implied by population growth
alone (as in Duranton and Puga [2004]). Hence, we first describe the predictions of our
model regarding diﬀerences in manager to non-manager ratios between the center and edge
that are driven by city population growth (Facts 5a).
   The analysis we just carried out suggests that population growth leads to an increase in
the number of managers at the center. In fact, it also leads to an increase in the number
of managers at the boundary. Some of the new managers establish themselves at the center
because of the production externalities generated by managers in that section of the city.
Others take advantage of the larger spans of control, as well as lower rents, at the boundary.
As we argued earlier, all employees under the supervision of new entrepreneurs at the center
work in operation plants located at the periphery. In addition, all new managers at the
boundary head integrated firms.
   Because, at the center, the number of managers increases with population while the number
of workers is fixed, it is clear that the ratio of managers to non-managers increases in that area
of the city. At the edge, since the number of workers increases in part because of the increase
in managers of non-integrated firms headquartered at the center, this ratio always decreases.
Together these results directly lead to Fact 5a. Furthermore, as population increases, all
new managers at the center run non-integrated firms. Given that non-integrated firms have
fewer workers per manager (smaller spans of control), this leads to an increase in the share
of city residents that become managers, as in Fact 5b. These results are stated formally in
the next proposition, consistent with Fact 5.

Proposition 5 An increase in population implies an increase in:

       • The diﬀerence in the ratio of managers to non-managers between the center and the
         edge, Ec
               Lc
                  −Eb
                   Lb
                      .
                                                      Ec +Eb
       • The number of managers per resident,            P
                                                             .

  It should be remarked that the model implies a decrease in the ratio of managers to
non-managers at the edge which is actually counter-factual. Specifically, the theory over-
  13
     We expressed this fact in terms of diﬀerences in ratios between the center and the edge, and not in term
of levels or ratios directly. Since our model focuses on only one city and not a system of cities, it is silent
on level diﬀerences across cities. In our framework, these cross-sectional diﬀerences would in principle stem
from diﬀerent values of Lc , R, α, or A across cities.

                                                      25
emphasizes the concentration of managers at the center. This implication can be attenuated
by requiring that managers rent land at the headquarter’s location. This extension, however,
would come at the cost of a much more complicated setup. Moreover, we view the increase
in manager to non-manager ratio at the edge as resulting partly from the overall increase in
the number of agents in management occupations, as in Fact 5b. An alternative formulation
where operating plants also require managers would also lead to a prediction for changes in
the edge ratio of managers to non-managers consistent with the data.
   Our model evidently also has predictions for the number of establishments at the center
and at the edge of the city. First, recall that at the center, the number of establishments
is equal to the number of managers since establishments at that location are either head-
quarters or non-integrated firms, but under our assumptions never just operation plants. It
follows immediately that the number of establishments at the center increases with popu-
lation growth. Furthermore, since new managers at the center operate only non-integrated
firms, the boundary sees an increase in operation plants. The latter two findings are consis-
tent with Fact 6. Because every new manager at the center is associated with an additional
operation plant at the edge, and the edge also experiences entry of new integrated firms
following population growth, the number of establishments at the edge must increase and,
in fact, must increase by more than the increase in center establishments. This implies that
the share of establishment at the center must fall, as in Fact 7.

Proposition 6 An increase in population implies:

   • An increase in the number of establishments located at the center and at the edge, Sc
     and Sb , with the number of establishments increasing more rapidly at the edge than at
     the center.
                                                                  Sc
   • A decrease in the share of establishments at the center,   Sc +Sb
                                                                       .

   Finally, we derive the implications of our framework for changes in establishment sizes
stemming solely from city population growth. As pointed out earlier, establishments are of
three diﬀerent sizes in our set up: Headquarters of size one, operation plants of size αδ, and
integrated firms of size 1 + αδ. Hence, the specific combination of firms of each type in a
given region of the city determines average establishment size in that region. Since there
are no operation plants at the center, firms can only be of size one or 1 + αδ in that section
of the city. As population increases, the number of managers at the center increases and so
does the share of establishments of size one. Therefore, population growth contributes to a
decrease in average firm size in the center region, as in Fact 8. In contrast, the boundary
comprises only establishments of size αδ and 1 + αδ. First, this implies that the average size

                                             26
of establishments is larger at the edge than at the center, unless most firms are production
plants and many integrated firms reside at the center. The latter case would make our model
consistent with the larger establishment sizes at the center observed in 1980. As population
grows, the set of establishments that are production plants increases at the edge, and so
does the set of integrated firms. In the next proposition, we show that the increase in the
number of production plants dominates, thereby leading to a decrease in firm size at the
edge, consistent with Fact 8.

Proposition 7 An increase in population implies a decrease in the average size of estab-
lishments at the city center and edge, EcS+L
                                           c
                                             c
                                               and EbS+L
                                                       b
                                                         b
                                                           , respectively.

   Thus, our model predicts that population growth reduces establishment sizes in both
regions following simple composition eﬀects. The data, however, shows that changes in
establishment size are negative in both regions for slightly more than half of the cities in our
sample. What factors may explain the behavior of establishment size in the remaining cities?
Given the theory we have just laid out, a possible answer is that lower communication costs
have led to larger spans of control (an increase in α) and, therefore, larger firms throughout
the city. The evidence suggests that this phenomenon did not dominate changes in average
firm size in most cities in the 1980s, but may nevertheless be significant in more recent
time periods for several cities (as argued by Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg [2004] for the late
1990s).

           5. ROBUSTNESS OF THE THEORY: LABOR MOBILITY

   Our analysis to this point has focused on a theory where land rents at the boundary
are given by some alternative country-wide non-urban land use. Wages and profits in the
city were therefore endogenously determined. In a model of a system of cities, this would
be equivalent to assuming a perfectly elastic supply of urban land at R and high moving
costs that impede the mobility of workers between cities. One might instead imagine an
alternative construct where wages are fixed at some economy wide level, w, exogenous to the
city. Heterogeneity in the quality of land in diﬀerent regions would then attract a certain
population which in turn would determine all land prices in the city. This section establishes
that all propositions derived in the previous sections continue to hold using this alternative
interpretation, provided a mild restriction on parameters.
   The model remains as in Section 4, except that condition (20) now determines land rents
at the edge instead of wages,

                                                 2 + αδ + αδ
It is straightforward to check that ∂R/∂P > 0, ∂R/∂Lc < 0, and ∂R/∂w < 0, consistent
with Proposition 2. We can then prove that results replicating Proposition 3 through 7
continue to hold. The derivations for a subset of these results requires that the number of
managers per establishment at the boundary be greater than one half, Eb /Sb > 1/2.14 Figure
9b suggests that this is likely the case in the data, where a given percentage change in the
number of establishments is associated with approximately twice that percentage change in
the number of managers. These results are formalized in the next proposition.

Proposition 8 With exogenous wages, w, and endogenous land rents at the edge, R̄, an
increase in population implies:

       • i) An increase in total employment at the center, Ec + Lc , and at the edge, Eb + Lb .

       6. CHANGES IN CITY STRUCTURE AND POPULATION GROWTH

  In Section 2, we presented a set of stylized facts on the evolution of city structure. We
then argued in the three subsequent sections that observed increases in population alone
could help rationalize those facts. At this stage, therefore, it is natural to ask whether
one could establish the implications of our model more directly in the data? As a first
pass, we can use the data to assess whether the changes in city structure presented in
Facts 2 through 9 are in fact correlated with population growth. However, one needs to be
cautious in the interpretation of such an empirical exercise. First, the theory predicts that
  14
    However, since a diﬀerent price is now taken as given from the city’s standpoint, the restriction on the
share of center population in Section 3, Proposition 4, is no longer necessary.



                                                    28
the eﬀect of changes in population size should lead to Facts 2 through 9 only if cross-sectional
characteristics of cities are properly controlled for. In particular, the theory has predictions
for the sign of these correlations after controlling for center county land sizes (Lc ), land rents
at the boundary (R), spans of control (α, δ and δ), and productivity (A), as well as any
changes in these variables during the 1980s. At this point, we do not have residential land
rents at the boundary for 1980, or a suitable proxy. However, we can control for land area
Lc and, to some degree, for productivity as well as spans of control using the 1980 level of
per capita income and ratio of managers to population respectively. Since our theory also
abstracts from available city infrastructure and other idiosyncratic city characteristics, we
take city age into consideration by using the decade in which the city became one of the
largest 50 cities in the U.S. This last variable helps but cannot obviously capture all cross-
sectional characteristics omitted from the model. Because of the size of our sample, we do
not control for changes in any of these variables. Finally, a key problem with calculating
simple correlations is that our theory does not predict a linear response of city structure to
population changes. Despite these caveats regarding the mapping between these correlations
and our theoretical results, Table 1 presents encouraging results that are consistent with the
framework introduced in this paper.
   Table 1 presents correlations between population growth and the residuals obtained from
running an OLS regression of the various changes in city structure laid out in Section 2
against the controls discussed above. Observe that all but the last two correlations, the
ones related to establishment size, have the sign predicted by our theory. Some of these
correlations are admittedly low. Nevertheless, our framework does surprisingly well given
that increases in only one independent variable, namely population growth, are shown to
be consistent with eleven diverse changes in the internal structure of cities.15 The incorrect
sign on the correlation between center/edge establishment sizes and population growth is
somewhat disappointing, and indeed the model does not contain a force that would lead to
larger firms in larger cities. Here, firms are larger only if they decide to integrate but there
are no diﬀerences across integrated firms. In practice, larger cities have larger firms partly
because demand for firms’ varieties is larger, a dimension from which we have abstracted.
Changes in information technology that have lead to larger spans of control could also help
account for these correlations.
  15
    If we eliminate from the sample the four fastest growing cities (Orlando, Las Vegas, Austin, and Phoenix),
correlations related to occupations increase substantially (both become larger than 0.22). This result only
reinforces the notion of non-linear responses to population growth in our model.

                                    6. CONCLUSIONS

   This paper makes three distinct contributions. First we document a set of facts regarding
changes in urban structure experienced by U.S. cities in the 1980s. These facts include
overall population growth; an increase in residents and employment at the center and city
boundaries; a reduction in the share of employment and residents in the center region of
cities; a concentration of managers relative to non-managers at the center; an increase in
establishments in both areas of the city but a decrease in establishment shares at the center;
and a decline in establishment size both at the center and at the edge of cities. Second, we
propose a theory that incorporates firms’ location and integration decisions and characterize
the implications of such a theory for urban structure. Third, we show that population growth
alone is consistent with the set of changes observed in the 1980s, thereby highlighting the
eﬀects of population growth on urban structure, through firm fragmentation.
   The theory we present has urban policy implications that diﬀer from more standard models
of urban structure. In particular, we provide a framework that could potentially be used to


                                               30
analyze the kinds of policies aimed at “reviving city centers” that have been put in practice
in many cities across the U.S. Given that our framework includes agglomeration forces in the
form of externalities, some urban policies may improve equilibrium allocations in our setup.
However, the specific type of policy in place is critical. For example, Au and Henderson
(2004) show that restrictions on urban migration have had important eﬃciency costs in
China. For now, the question of whether zoning restrictions or location subsidies, as in
Rossi-Hansberg (2004), are optimal in our setup, and in general the design of these policies,
is left to future research.
   In order to underscore the importance of firms’ location decisions, as well as their decision
regarding whether or not to integrate their operations, our model abstracts from important
elements of cities typically emphasized in the urban literature. One such element is a spatial
setup in which multiple sub-centers may arise (see Fujita and Ogawa [1982], and Lucas and
Rossi-Hansberg [2002]). Other dimensions, such as the eﬀect of durable housing structures,
as in Glaeser and Gyourko (2004), and urbanization patterns in a system of cities, as in
Henderson (2003), and Henderson and Wang (2004), are undoubtedly important. In addi-
tion, our theory focuses on one particular type of agglomeration force. However, as argued
by Rosenthal and Strange (2003), diﬀerent agglomeration forces interact in metropolitan
areas. One could, in principle, study any of these forces along with the firm’s location and
integration decisions we emphasize. The explanatory power gained by incorporating these
firms’ decisions with respect to the facts we document in this paper will, hopefully, push the
urban literature to add these margins to the rich set of frameworks available.

  Proof of Proposition 1
  The proof proceeds by contradiction. Suppose that both integrated and non-integrated firms
exist in both areas of the city. Then by (2), it must be the case that

                                           Fbb = Fcc = Fcb = Fbc .                           (22)

The fact that Fcc = Fbb implies that

                            (AEc − w − Rc )αδ = (AEb − w − R)αδ or

                                       AEc − AEb = Rc − R.                                   (23)

Similarly, the fact that Fcb = Fbc implies that

                            (AEc − w − R)αδ = (AEb − w − Rc )αδ or

                                    AEc − AEb = R − Rc .                                     (24)

Equations (23) and (24) can only hold if Rc = R = R, in which case Ec = Eb = E. It follows
that profits for an integrated firm are (AE − w − R)αδ while those of a non-integrated firm are
(AE − w − R)αδ. That is, Fcc = Fbb > Fcb = Fbc which contradicts (22).¥

The sign of the last term is guaranteed since the span of control of integrated and non-integrated
firms is greater than αδ > αδ > 1.¥

     Proofs of Proposition 8

     i) At the center, we have

where D0 = 2 + αδ + αδ. With respect to the edge, we have

                                      Eb + Lb = 1 + αδ Eb + αδEc − αδEcc .

  iii)
  a) Ec /Lc − Eb /Lb increases in P .
  We have that                    ³                 ´
                              ∂       Ec
                                           −   Eb                        µ                  ¶
                                      Lc       Lb         1 ∂Ec   1          ∂Eb      ∂Lb
                                                        =       − 2              Lb −     Eb .
                                       ∂P                 Lc ∂P  Lb          ∂P       ∂P
But since ∂Ec /∂P > 0, it is suﬃcient to show that
                                                        ∂Eb      ∂Lb
                                                            Lb −     Eb < 0.                     (25)
                                                        ∂P       ∂P
Note that Lb = (Ec − Ecc ) αδ + Eb αδ so that ∂Lb /∂P = αδ∂Ec /∂P + αδ∂Eb /∂P . Then the LHS
of (25) becomes
                                                             µ              ¶

                               µ                           ¶
                                 ∂Eb      ∂Eb       ∂Ec
                          = αδ       Ec −     Ecc −     Eb

                            D0
since ∂Ec /∂P = ∂Eb /∂P = 1/D0 > 0. It then follows that (25) holds if Ec − Ecc − Eb < 0, or
equivalently, Ecb < Eb , which holds whenever
                                                                Eb  1

since Sb − Eb = Ecb .

If more than half of the firms in the economy are integrated, (Ec + Eb ) /P < 1/(1 + αδ/2 + αδ/2).
Hence the above expression is positive if

                                           2               1

which is trivially satisfied with equality. Observe also that when Eb /Sb > 1/2, and since Ec = Sc ,
then

  iv). The total number of establishments at the center is given by Sc = Ec + Ebc = Ec . Thus, we
have

Similarly, the total number of establishments at the edge is
                                           ∙              ¸
                                         1        1     1     2   Lc

It follows that

                                      ∂Sc        ∂    R    1

                                                and
                                                    µ    ¶
                                      ∂Sb        ∂    2      2

                                      ∂P        ∂P A        D

which also implies that ∂Sb /∂P > ∂Sc /∂P. To show that the share of establishments in the center
declines with population, observe that

which is always the case as shown in Proposition 6.

Therefore (28) reduces to Ecb < Eb , which holds when Eb /Sb > 1/2.¥
