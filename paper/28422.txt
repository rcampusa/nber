The Incidence of Extreme Economic Stress: Evidence from Utility Disconnections

                                         ABSTRACT

This paper uses monthly zip code-level data on electricity disconnections to document the
socioeconomic correlates of extreme economic distress among 5 million customers in Illinois. In
2018-2019, customers in Black and Hispanic zip codes were about 4 times more likely to be
disconnected for non-payment, 2-3 times more likely to be on deferred payment plans, and 70%
more likely to participate in utility-based low-income assistance programs, controlling for zip
code distributions of income and other demographic characteristics. During the COVID-19
pandemic, there has been a nine-fold expansion in low-income assistance to pay utility bills, but
disconnections were double and deferred payment plans triple their historical averages in October
2020. Disconnection notices were served to 2.5% of commercial and industrial accounts, and
3.4% of residential accounts each month in late 2020. About 20% of all accounts were charged
late fees. The odds for each of these measures were multiples higher in minority and low-income
zip codes.

1   Introduction
Having one's power cut due to non-payment ceases access to modern life's basic necessities: light,
refrigeration, telecommunications, and often heat to name a few. Beyond mere conveniences, access
to heating and cooling are important predictors of mortality (Barreca et al. (2016); Chirakijja et
al. (2020)). This is especially the case during the COVID-19 pandemic (Jowers et al. (2021)) as
utilities constrain one's ability to stay at home (Wright et al. (2020)). Lack of electricity also has es-
pecially acute consequences for children during periods of remote, computer-based education. While
definitions of extreme poverty typically focus on dollar-based income and consumption thresholds
(the widely-cited World Bank global poverty line is $1.90 per person, per day), there is a reasonable
case to be made that lack of electricity is a sufficient condition. This paper tracks the incidence of
electricity disconnections and other utility-based indicators of economic stress at the monthly-zip
code level in Illinois and documents the disproportionate burden experienced by low-income and
minority communities.
    Both survey-based and administrative approaches to measuring extreme economic distress have
distinct shortcomings. Surveys increasingly suffer from non-response, as well as the under-reporting
of income and transfers (Meyer et al. (2015)). Administrative datasets may miss those who are
disconnected from formal employment and the social safety net. A recent major undertaking to
link survey responses to administrative data has sought to improve the quality of data on extreme
poverty in the United States (Medalia et al. (2019); Meyer et al. (2021)), but high-frequency and
spatially disaggregated measurements remain elusive. Given the general preference for consumption-
rather than income-based measurements of poverty (Meyer and Sullivan (2003)), the foundational
role electricity plays in the consumption of a bundle of essential goods highlights the potential value
of power disconnections as an indicator of extreme economic distress.1
    I connect zip code-level data on disconnections, deferred payment agreements (DPAs), and par-
ticipation in utility-based low-income assistance programs from Illinois' two largest utilities with
demographic data from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey for over 1,300 zip
codes. These data cover roughly five million households. I study two distinct periods, 2018-2019, and
from September-December during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using logistic regressions that control
for zip code distributions of income and other demographic characteristics, I find that the odds of
being disconnected for non-payment are four times higher for customers in Black and Hispanic zip
codes. Customers in these zip codes are 2-3 times more likely to be on deferred payment plans, and
70% more likely to participate in low-income assistance programs for electricity.
    There has been a troubling increase in disconnections and deferred payment agreements during
the COVID-19 pandemic. Though utilities announced a voluntary extension of disconnection mora-
toria for customers in economic distress, nearly 1% of all accounts were disconnected for non-payment
in October 2020 (twice the usual amount). There has been a three-fold rise in deferred payment
agreements. These increases have occurred in spite of a nine-fold expansion in low-income assis-
tance. Utilities have been reporting additional outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic, including
details for 600,000 commercial and industrial customers. Each month from September-December
   1 Disconnections are a flow measure of the gross increase of customers without power (a stock). Absent an initial

number of customers without power and statistics on reconnections, the stock is unobserved. However, disconnections
become a better measure of the size of the disconnected population when long-term reconnection rates are high.
Historical data from Commonwealth Edison report that about 75% of disconnections for non-payment are reconnected
within 12 months.

2020, about 20% of all accounts were charged non-payment fees, and disconnection notices were
served to 3.4% and 2.5% of residential and commercial/industrial accounts, respectively. For each
of these outcomes there is a strong disproportionate burden on minority communities.
    This paper reinforces recent work that has found the economic burden of the COVID-19 pandemic
has fallen disproportionately on low-income and minority communities (Chetty et al. (2020); Baum
et al. (2020); Couch et al. (2020); Han et al. (2020)) and documented an expansion of the social
safety net (Cox et al. (2020)) that failed to buffer the impact for some of the most needy (Bitler et
al. (2020)). It is also complementary to recent surveys on energy insecurity during the pandemic
(Carley and Konisky (2020); Graff and Carley (2020)). The data from electric utilities, however, yield
greater statistical power than surveys (to allow fine geographic mapping of outcomes, in particular),
higher reporting frequency than annual administrative data, and broader coverage than electronic
payment-based surveillance systems. Collection from additional states is underway.
    To be clear, this study does not reveal bias in utilities' treatment of poor and minority customers:
Individual usage, payments, and balances are unobserved. My results would be consistent with
utilities determining disconnections based upon billing and payments alone if customers in low-
income and minority communities are more likely to fall farther behind on their utility bills holding
the distribution of income fixed and other demographic variables. Instead of identifying any potential
unequal treatment by utilities, this study reveals the disproportionate economic stress experienced
in these communities, both in normal times, and especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.
    The paper is organized as follows: I first describe the data sources in section 2, then the econo-
metric methods I employ in section 3. The fourth section presents the results, and the final section
concludes.
2   Data
In March 2020 the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) issued 20-NOI-01, "Notice of Inquiry Re-
garding Energy Affordability." It requires public utilities to file monthly reports with the commission
that document economic stress among customers. At the zip code level, utilities report outcomes
including the number of residential customers who are behind on their bills, disconnections for non-
payment, and participation in programs that provide assistance to low-income households.2 The
first submissions required historical tallies going back to 2013, and have since been updated monthly
during the pandemic, though the reports through August were mostly zeroes due to moratoria on
disconnections and non-payment fees. Recent submissions include additional information, including
disconnection notices and statistics for commercial customers. This paper uses data from Common-
wealth Edison (ComEd) and Ameren, the two largest electric utilities in the state, with nearly five
million residential customer accounts between them.
    Table 1 provides summary statistics of the utility data, focusing on the month of October from
2018-2020.3 Roughly 20% of customers were levied some form of fee for late payment in October
2020, regardless of customer class. Unfortunately, this statistic was not reported in prior years, so it
is not possible to say whether this is unusually high. Disconnection notices were also not reported
   2 These programs are a combination of federal- and state-funded initiatives to provide heat and electricity bill

assistance.
   3 I focus on October for these statistics because it is the last month before the winter/cold temperature shut-off

moratoria kicked in, and a COVID-related moratorium was in effect through the summer of 2020. I use the years
2018-2020 because municipal aggregation programs affected the number of customers in earlier years (see Deryugina
et al. (2020) for a recent evaluation of this episode), and zip code-level customer counts were only reported in 2020.




                                                          2
pre-pandemic, but it is nonetheless worrisome that nearly 4% of residential customers and 2-3% of
commercial and industrial customers were on the brink of disconnection in October. Comparisons
with historical statistics are possible for residential disconnections, which nearly doubled in October
2020 for ComEd customers, and were six times historical averages in Ameren territory.
   ComEd has begun reporting arrearage statistics,4 showing 10% of residential customers have
balances past due, twice the rate of December 2019. The average arrearage amount among those
behind on their bills has increased over 50%, to about $300/customer past due. Over 5% of com-
mercial and industrial accounts are past due, with an average outstanding balance of $1200. These
balances add up to $120 million in residential arrearage, and $29 million due from commercial and
industrial customers. This is a 65% increase over ComEd's total arrearages in December 2019.
   The rises in residential customers with deferred payment agreements were about four- and six-
fold for ComEd and Ameren, respectively. There was also a large expansion in programs to assist
low-income customers during the pandemic. 0.5% of customers were on such programs in 2018-2019,
while over 4% participated in 2020. An important part of low-income assistance programs involves
debt forgiveness, so it makes sense that a significant share of customers on these programs were
also deferring payment to future dates. A curiously high 11% of ComEd customers on low-income
assistance were served disconnection notices in October 2020, while the analogous figure was less than
1% for Ameren customers. This is also striking because Illinois utilities ostensibly extended their
disconnection moratoria through March 2021 to customers who call the utility and claim economic
hardship (Crawford (2020)).
   Figure 1 shows that there has been an unprecedented increase in difficulty paying utility bills
during the COVID-19 pandemic. It plots aggregate statistics for the three outcomes that are re-
ported by both ComEd and Ameren back to 2013. The totals are expressed as a percent of the
number of residential customer accounts in 2020, as Ameren does not report historical customer
counts (and neither utility reports the historical number of accounts at the zip code level). Data in
2020 are only reported in June and September-November. There are strong seasonal trends in all
three outcomes. Assistance for low-income households is concentrated in the winter months, par-
ticularly during winter disconnection moratoria.5 Deferred payment agreements peak once winter
moratoria are lifted. There is strong evidence that these moratoria are binding, with large increases
in disconnections each April. The historical patterns are entirely disrupted with the onset of the
COVID-19 pandemic. In line with the summary statistics in Table 1, assistance, deferred liabilities,
and disconnections are all multiples of their historical averages in 2020.
   The wide dispersion of these outcomes is evident in Figure 2, which presents a snapshot of
outcomes for October 2020. For disconnections, there are 28 zip codes (with 16,000 customers) where
over 4% of residential customers were disconnected in October, while 172 zip codes (with over 25,000
customers) had none at all. The figure also makes clear that Ameren has been more aggressively
disconnecting customers in 2020 than ComEd overall: The mid-state break in disconnection rates
corresponds to the territorial boundary between the companies. The south and west sides of Chicago
are hard-hit relative to the surrounding suburbs, but there are zip codes throughout the state with
comparable outcomes, or worse. For disconnection notices, there are roughly similar numbers of
   4 At the time of writing, the ICC has added arrearage statistics to their monthly requests, but only ComEd has

submitted current statistics, covering the month of December for 2019 and 2020.
   5 Shutoffs in Illinois are forbidden annually between December and March, as well as when the temperature is

forecast to drop below 32o F , or exceed 95o F during the 24-hour period in which the disconnection is scheduled.

people (100,000) in zip codes with more than 10% and less than 1% on notice. In panel (B), the
widespread prevalence of customers behind on their electricity bills is striking. With one out of five
households levied late fees overall, about 200,000 people live in zip codes where the number is one
out of three.
   To explore the distributional incidence of these hardships, I merge the utility reports with zip
code-level demographic and economic characteristics from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Com-
munity Survey (ACS). These estimates are based on data collected between 2015 and 2019, and were
released in December, 2020. Table 2 presents summary statistics separately for Ameren and ComEd
service territories, with statistics weighted by the number of residential customers in 2020. ComEd
serves the Chicagoland area, with roughly three times the population spanning one third as many
counties as Ameren. It has a larger minority composition, and the economy is more service sector-
oriented, with much less agriculture than downstate. ComEd zip codes have roughly similar shares
of households earning less than $15,000/year, but double the share earning more than $150,000/year.
All told, the data reported to the Illinois Commerce Commission span over 1,300 zip codes in 111
counties.

3    Methods
I evaluate how indicators of economic stress correlate with zip code demographic and economic
characteristics. This is a descriptive analysis using cross-sectional variation in differences across zip
codes to estimate disproportionate burdens, holding the distribution of income fixed.
   At the individual account level, these indicators are binary outcomes: either an account is dis-
connected for non-payment, or it is not. Each zip code c in month t has nct residential accounts,
and there are yct accounts that experience the outcome of interest. Assuming that outcomes are
determined by zip code characteristics Xct and a logistic error term yields the log likelihood function:

                                                exp(Xct  )                                 1
               l( ) =                yct ln                      + (nct - yct ) ln                              (1)
                           c    t
                                              1 + exp(Xct  )                         1 + exp(Xct  )

    I estimate equation (1) via maximum likelihood separately for pre- and post-pandemic periods.
                                                     ^
Reported odds ratios are calculated as ej . For characteristics expressed as shares, this represents
the predicted relative odds between a zip code entirely composed of the characteristic of interest and
one completely lacking. Note that the odds ratio is invariant to the levels of the other neighborhood
characteristics.6 Estimates regarding the share of the population within household income bins
are estimated relative to the share of households earning between $35,000-75,000 to avoid perfect
collinearity.
    Because the probability of each outcome of interest has changed significantly during the pandemic,
changes in odds ratios do not reflect changes in the disproportionate burdens experienced by various
groups. I therefore also report marginal probabilities, or the predicted change in probabilities when
characteristic xj goes from zero to one, and the other characteristics are held at their sample means.7
    To allow for within-county correlation in outcomes (due, for example, to county-level differences
in policy), I calculate standard errors clustered at the county level. Results report 95% confidence
intervals, which are asymmetric around the logit point estimates. They are based on the clustered
standard errors.
4    Results
Table 3 presents estimates for neighborhood correlates with participation in utility-based low-income
assistance programs. The mean probabilities at the bottom of the table reflect the massive expansion
during the COVID-19 pandemic, going from 0.5% during 2018-2019 to 4.5% during the reported
months of 2020. Zip codes with larger fractions of high income households are, of course, negatively
associated with participation, with marginal probabilities predicting essentially zero enrollees in
wealthy neighborhoods. The odds of participation are much higher in lower income neighborhoods,
thought he standard errors are quite large. Minority neighborhoods were about 70% more likely to

participate in these programs, while larger shares of non-citizens are less likely to receive benefits.
Relationships with the other demographic variables are all modest and not statistically different from
zero. Controlling for demographic differences, ComEd was about half likely to provide assistance
under these programs before 2020. Comparing earlier years with the pandemic, the relative likelihood
across groups is strikingly similar, while the breadth of participation has widely expanded.
   Table 4 finds that deferred payment agreements (DPAs) are also more common in minority
neighborhoods, though not with the share of non-citizens. While the lowest income neighborhoods
appear less likely to have DPAs, they are employed more often in zip codes with more children
per household. The expansion of DPAs in 2020 amounts to a significant rise in debt owed by
these households. An additional 4-6% of households in minority neighborhoods would be sufficiently
behind on their electricity bill to require deferred payment.
    Table 5 presents the main estimates for residential electricity disconnections. All estimates are
based on the month of October to keep estimates comparable across years with various disconnection
moratoria in place during 2020. Controlling for the income distribution and other demographics,
customers in minority neighborhoods were four to five times more likely to have their power discon-
nected, both in normal times and during the COVID-19 pandemic. An additional 2% of accounts
are estimated to have been disconnected in minority zip codes, all else equal (over a mean of 0.9% in
Illinois). It is also interesting that low-income zip codes are not more likely to be disconnected during
the pandemic, relative to neighborhoods with earners between $35,000-75,000. The combined forces
of expanded assistance to low-income households and disconnections in middle-income zip codes has
worked to essentially eliminate the gradient that exists in normal times. High income zip codes
continue to have few disconnections, if any. Disconnection policies between utilities appear to have
changed during the pandemic, as ComEd used to be nearly twice as likely to disconnect residential
accounts, but has been 40% less likely during the pandemic.
    In the final two tables I examine correlates of disconnection notices and fees, and am able to
include commercial and industrial accounts in the analysis. These outcomes were not provided in
the historical data submissions, so I am unable to say how these relationships have changed during
COVID-19 relative to historical averages. Both tables show a continued pattern for low-income
and minority communities of being disproportionately likely to have trouble paying electric bills.
Businesses in these communities are also more likely to be behind on utility bills, on the order of 2-4
times more likely in Black and Hispanic zip codes. Interestingly, commercial accounts in zip codes
with high shares of non-citizens are also modestly more likely to be served disconnection notices and
charged late fees, while this characteristic is otherwise negatively associated with non-payment for
residential accounts.
5   Discussion
In 2019, the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners codified a set of best practices
for the collection and dissemination of data on utility arrearages, disconnections, and low-income
assistance participation (NARUC (2019)). The Illinois Commerce Commission has recently applied
these principles, making available a wealth of data by zip code and month. As major real-time
economic data collection efforts are underway (U.S. Census Bureau (2020b); Buffington et al. (2020);
Han et al. (2020)), utility disconnections provide a valuable complementary resource. These data
are the by-product of utilities' standard accounting operations, and generally not subject to business
confidential dissemination constraints. Provided at the zip code level, they allow finer geographic

little to say about homeless populations (as is the case for many benchmark consumption surveys
(Meyer et al. (2021))), they provide greater coverage of groups that lack access to traditional banking
or electronic payments.
   The picture that emerges from Illinois is a troubling one. Nearly 50,000 residential customers
were disconnected for non-payment in October 2020, in spite of a voluntary moratorium that would
exempt households experiencing financial hardship. Over 16,000 customers live in zip codes where
more than 4% of households were disconnected that month. There is a strong neighborhood income
gradient to these outcomes. Even after accounting for the distribution of income, these burdens fall
disproportionately on minority communities--both in normal times and during COVID-19. Looking
forward, 3.4% of residences and 2.5% of businesses were served disconnection notices on a monthly
basis in late 2020 before the regular winter disconnection moratorium began in December. An
additional 3-5% of residences and businesses in minority zip codes is estimated to have received
disconnection notices each month in late 2020. With deferred payment agreements accumulating
balances due and higher residential consumption during the pandemic (Cicala (2020)), there is a
significant risk of mass disconnection when moratoria expire at the end of March, 2021.
