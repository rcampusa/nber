Measuring Real Consumption and CPI Bias under Lockdown Conditions

NBER Working Paper No. 27144
May 2020
JEL No. C43,E21,E31

                                         ABSTRACT

Millions of goods and services are now unavailable in many countries due to the current
coronavirus pandemic, dramatically impacting on the construction of key economic statistics used
for informing policy. This situation is unprecedented; hence methods to address it have not
previously been developed. Current advice to national statistical offices from the IMF, Eurostat
and the UN is shown to result in downward bias in the CPI and upward bias in real consumption.
We conclude that the only way to produce a meaningful CPI within the lockdown period is
through establishing a continuous consumer expenditure survey.

                      “The CPI is a critical input to economic policy making,
                       particularly during periods of economic uncertainty.”

1. Introduction

The coronavirus pandemic has led to widespread lockdowns 1 of non-essential retail
outlets and many service industries such as regular restaurant services, tourism activities,
sporting events, gyms, international air travel and most types of personal services. There
are significant consequences of the sudden unavailability of many consumer goods and
services for the measurement of inflation and real consumption.


A lockdown of economic activity means that there is a massive disappearing products
problem. Countries base the construction of their Consumer Price Index (CPI), the main
index of inflation, on a fixed basket of goods that people typically buy. But with
lockdowns, the fixed basket becomes almost totally irrelevant as many of those typical
items are no longer available; see Carvalho et al. (2020) and Dunn, Hood, and Driessen
(2020) for evidence of dramatically changing consumer expenditure patterns arising from
the pandemic. If consumer prices cannot be measured accurately, then real consumption
cannot be measured accurately either. Policy makers and the public will eventually lose
confidence in such indexes. This creates a crisis for policy and business decisions that
rely heavily on these statistics.


Advice to national statistical offices (NSOs) from the International Monetary Fund,
Eurostat and the United Nations for dealing with this problem is to simply implement a
carry-forward methodology; the price for a commodity for the period prior to the
lockdown is used (with some adjustment for inflation) when an item is missing; see IMF
(2020), Eurostat (2020), UNECE (2020) and the summary in Appendix A. With the
missing prices restored, index number construction can continue as before with the fixed
consumption basket. We show that following this advice leads to a downward bias in

 The term “lockdown” is used to indicate a spectrum of restrictions which have different effects on the
availability of products and the associated impacts on consumer behaviour.

estimating changes in the cost of living and an upward bias in estimating changes in real
consumption.


With a lockdown, we have the opposite of the new products problem: a product is
available for purchase in the current period but was not available in the previous period.
We take the reservation price approach for the treatment of new products, which was
developed by Hicks (1940; 114) and adapt it to cover the case of disappearing products
following Hofsten (1952; 95-97). 2 Reservation prices are those that correspond to zero
demand for the products. The unavailability of goods and services under a lockdown will
lead to a substantial drop in welfare. Using the economic approach to index number
theory in order to measure these declines in welfare, it is likely that the reservation prices
for unavailable products will have to be much greater than the corresponding prices in the
previous period. This approach allows us to identify biases from the approaches currently
being recommended by international agencies.


We also provide a broader review of the price and quantity indexes that statistical
agencies are likely to produce during lockdown conditions. The options open to an NSO
will depend on its access to current household expenditure data.


Our conclusions for constructing the most informative prices indexes in this context can
be summarised as follows:
    1. In the short run, collect whatever prices are available and supplement these from
        scanner data and web scraped prices to make up for missing prices due to changes
        in price collection methodology. 3 For prices which are still missing, use inflation
        adjusted carry forward prices, consistent with current advice from the
        international agencies.
    2. At the same time, put in motion some method for getting current expenditure
        weights for the consumption basket. This would require either a continuous

de Haan and Krsinich (2012) (2014) and Diewert, Fox and Schreyer (2017).
3
  Some NSOs already make extensive use of scanner data from retail chains and are relatively well placed
in this regard; see e.g. Australian Bureau of Statistics (2017). Problems remain, however, for broader
categories of goods and services.
                                                                                           4

            consumer expenditure survey or the use of new sources of data. These new
            sources could include credit card companies and companies that produce
            household expenditure data from households scanning barcodes of purchased
            items (“Homescan” data).
       3. Once the new consumer expenditure information becomes available, produce a
            new analytic CPI. This would be revisable while the new methodology was
            developed further. This would supplement the existing CPI, which would likely
            be heavily compromised due to the treatment of missing prices and use of out-of-
            date expenditure weights.


For what follows, it is important to explain why the Fisher price index is preferred to the
Laspeyres or Paasche price indexes. The Laspeyres price index prices out the basket of
goods and services that is consumed in the base period at base period prices and at
current period prices. The Laspeyres price index PL is the ratio of these two costs using
the prices of the current period in the numerator and the prices of the base period in the
denominator. The Paasche price index prices out the basket of goods and services that is
consumed in the current period at base period prices and at current period prices. The
Paasche price index PP is the ratio of these two costs using the prices of the current period
in the numerator and the prices of the base period in the denominator. Both indexes are
equally plausible and intuitively easy to understand. But the Laspeyres index will tend to
show a greater increase in prices than the corresponding Paasche index.


Good statistical practice suggests that when one has two equally plausible measures of
the same phenomenon, it is better to take an average of the two measures to give a single
measure of the phenomenon. The geometric average of the Laspeyres and Paasche price
indexes is a useful average of PL and PP which is equal to the Fisher price index. The
Fisher index satisfies the important time reversal test (and many other tests) so that
inflation measured going forward is the reciprocal of inflation going backwards. The
good test performance of the Fisher index 4 explains why taking the geometric average of
PL and PP is preferred rather than taking some other form of average of PL and PP. Thus

    See Diewert (1992) for a listing of the tests that the Fisher price index satisfies.
                                                                                        5

the paper will focus on how to measure lockdown bias which we define to be the
difference between a Laspeyres or Lowe (or fixed basket) CPI and the Fisher price index.


The paper is organised as follows. In section 2, we study how the sudden unavailability
of many goods and services affects the measurement of real consumption; that is,
quantity indexes for household consumption. It may seem odd that in a paper that is
focussed on potential bias in a CPI that we first look at the problems associated with the
measurement of real consumption (and by extension, with the measurement of real GDP).
However, construction of a consumer price index goes hand in hand with the construction
of a corresponding measure of real consumption. In the end, economists and governments
are concerned with the welfare implications of the pandemic on real consumption. It
proves to be convenient to look at the problems associated with the measurement of real
consumption during lockdown conditions before we look at the associated CPI
measurement problems. In sections 3 and 4, our focus shifts to consumer price indexes.
Section 3 looks at comparisons between the Laspeyres, Paasche and Fisher price indexes
under pandemic conditions while section 4 examines the properties of a fixed basket or
Lowe price index, which is used in construction of the CPI in many countries. Section 5
looks at the advantages and disadvantages of using various “practical” price and quantity
indexes that statistical agencies are likely to produce during lockdown conditions. We
note that the way forward will depend on what types of data are available to the NSO.


Section 6 looks at the problem of a lack of matching product prices at the elementary
index level. Seven possible methods for dealing with this problem are discussed,
depending on the availability of data. Section 7 takes a brief look at other practical
measurement problems that an NSO may encounter when it attempts to produce a
meaningful CPI under pandemic conditions. Section 8 concludes.


Appendix A provides a brief survey of the methods suggested by various statistical
agencies. Appendix B specializes the algebra explained for the many commodity case in
the main text to the case of only two commodities. The advantage of this simplification is
that the various concepts can be illustrated in a simple diagram. Appendix C provides
                                                                                                    6

some theoretical guidance on how to construct generalized reservation prices when some
market consumer goods and services are provided by the government or businesses to the
household at zero cost (or at a highly subsidized prices) as responses to the pandemic. For
example, how should a temporary rent holiday be treated in a CPI? The reservation price
for the household in this situation is equal to its willingness to pay for this good or
service and the Appendix indicates how in theory this price could be estimated using
econometric techniques.


2. Measuring Real Consumption when Transitioning to a Lockdown Economy


Suppose that the period prior to the lockdown is period 0 and the first lockdown period is
the subsequent period 1. The period of time could be a month or a quarter. We initially
assume that data on prices and quantities that are in scope for the CPI are available to the
statistical agency. We divide the CPI goods and services into two groups: Group 1 prices
and quantities are available in periods 0 and 1 and Group 2 prices and quantities are only
available in period 0. 5 Denote the period t price and quantity vectors for Group 1
products by pt ≡ [p1t,...,pMt] >> 0M and qt ≡ [q1t,...,qMt] >> 0M for t = 0,1. 6 The Group 2
price and quantity vectors for period 0 are P0 ≡ [P10,...,PN0] >> 0N and Q0 ≡ [Q10,...,QN0]
>> 0N. We take the Group 2 quantity vector for period 1 to be a vector of zero
components; i.e., we assume that:


(1) Q1 ≡ 0N.


It is not clear how to define the period 1 price vector P1 for the products that are not
available in period 1. In these notes, we will apply the economic approach to index
number theory and assume that the appropriate definition for the missing prices are the


5
  The methodology to be developed below can be applied to a subset of the CPI; i.e., to an elementary
category. However, the category has to be broad enough so that it contains some continuing commodities
or products and some commodities that have disappeared due to the lockdown. The algebra that follows
assumes that information on (unit value) prices and the corresponding quantities are available for the
commodities in scope during period 0.
6
  Notation: pt >> 0M ( ≥ 0M ) means that all components of the M dimensional vector pt are positive
(nonnegative). The inner product of the vectors pt and qt is defined as pt⋅qt ≡ Σm=1M pmtqmt.
                                                                                                           7


relevant Hicksian reservation prices; i.e., P1* ≡ [P11*,...,PN1*] >> 0N where Pn1* > 0 is the
price for commodity n that will cause the corresponding period 1 consumer demand Qn1
to equal 0 for that commodity for n = 1,...,N.


In most cases, it is safe to assume that the reservation price for product n in period 1, Pn1*,
will be considerably larger than the actual price for product n in period 0, Pn0; i.e., it is
reasonable to assume that: 7


(2) P1* >> P0.


It is important to understand why the reservation price for a product that is suddenly
unavailable is likely to be greater than the prevailing price in the prior period when it was
available. In the most extreme form of lockdown, individuals are confined to their houses
or apartments. If they live in a small apartment, the resulting confinement is very similar
to being in prison. Individuals are typically willing to pay large sums of money to avoid
going to prison (think of high lawyer fees). Going to jail or being subject to a strict
lockdown decreases welfare to a very substantial degree. A way of measuring the
decrease in welfare is to use the reservation price concept. In order to get a substantial
drop in welfare due to a lockdown, the reservation prices for unavailable goods and
services will have to be much greater than the corresponding prices in the previous period.


Before we look at the implications of our assumptions for the construction of a Consumer
Price index going from period 0 to 1, we look at the implications for the measurement of
real consumption. The “true” overall Laspeyres quantity index, QL, is defined as
follows: 8




7
  In Appendix B, we assume M = 1 and N = 1. Using the economic approach to index number theory, it is
possible to show that it must be the case that P1* ≥ (p1/p0)P0 where p0 and P0 are the observed period 0
prices for the two commodities, p1 is the period 1 price for the continuing commodity and P1* is the period
1 reservation price vector for the unavailable commodity. P1* will equal (p1/p0)P0 only if the two
commodities are perfect substitutes. Note that (p1/p0)P0 is the inflation adjusted carry forward price vector
for the unavailable commodity. See Appendix C for information on how to define reservation prices.
8
  Note that the reservation prices P1* do not enter the definition for QL.
                                                                                                             8


(3) QL ≡ [p0⋅q1 + P0⋅Q1]/[p0⋅q0 + P0⋅Q0]
        = p0⋅q1/[p0⋅q0 + P0⋅Q0]                                                      using assumption (1)
        = [p0⋅q1/p0⋅q0]{p0⋅q0/[p0⋅q0 + P0⋅Q0]}
        = QLqsq0


where the Laspeyres quantity index for always present commodities QLq is defined as


(4) QLq ≡ p0⋅q1/p0⋅q0.


The period 0 expenditure share of always present commodities is sq0 defined as


(5) sq0 ≡ p0⋅q0/[p0⋅q0 + P0⋅Q0].


Thus overall Laspeyres real consumption growth, QL, is equal to Laspeyres consumption
growth of always available commodities QLq times the share of always available
commodities in period 0, sq0. Note that QL, QLq and sq0 depend on observable data and, in
principle, can be constructed by the statistical agency. This is not the case for the Paasche
quantity index.


The “true” overall Paasche quantity index, QP*, is defined as follows: 9


(6) QP* ≡ [p1⋅q1 + P1*⋅Q1]/[p1⋅q0 + P1*⋅Q0]
         = p1⋅q1/[p1⋅q0 + P1*⋅Q0]                                                   using assumption (1)
         = [p1⋅q1/p0⋅q0]p0⋅q0/[(p1⋅q0/p0⋅q0)p0⋅q0 + (P1*⋅Q0/P0⋅Q0)P0⋅Q0]
         = [p1⋅q1/p0⋅q0]sq0/[PLqsq0 + PLQ*sQ0]
         = PLqQPqsq0/[PLqsq0 + PLQ*sQ0]                                        since p1⋅q1/p0⋅q0 = PLqQPq


9
  Note that the reservation prices P1* do enter the definition for QP: the bigger is the gap between P1*⋅Q0 and
P0⋅Q0, the smaller QP* becomes. Thus in order to compute real consumption (using either the test or
economic approaches to index number theory), it is absolutely necessary to compute the Paasche quantity
index (or an approximation to it) in addition to the Laspeyres quantity index which misses the effect of
higher reservation prices in period 1. The Fisher quantity index will usually provide an adequate
approximation to the change in welfare due to the lockdown; see Diewert (1976) (2020a).
                                                                                                          9

        = QPqsq0PLq/[PLqsq0 + PLQ*sQ0]


where the Paasche quantity index for always available commodities QPq is defined as


(7) QPq ≡ p1⋅q1/p1⋅q0 .


The Laspeyres price indexes for the always available and unavailable commodities, PLq
and PLQ* respectively, are defined as follows:


(8) PLq ≡ p1⋅q0/p0⋅q0 ;
(9) PLQ* ≡ P1*⋅Q0/P0⋅Q0 .


The period 0 expenditure shares of the available and unavailable commodities are sq0 and
sQ0 defined as


(10) sq0 ≡ p0⋅q0/[p0⋅q0 + P0⋅Q0];
(11) sQ0 ≡ P0⋅Q0/[p0⋅q0 + P0⋅Q0] .


Note that definition (9) for the Laspeyres index for the unavailable commodities, PLQ* ≡
P1*⋅Q0/P0⋅Q0, depends on the vector of period 1 reservation prices P1* for these
products. 10 Thus formula (6) for the true overall Paasche quantity index, QP* =
QPqsq0PLq/[PLqsq0 + PLQ*sQ0] would seem to be of only theoretical interest. However, it is
possible to provide some very rough estimates for P1*.


Suppose that the Laspeyres inflation for unavailable products was equal to Laspeyres
inflation for the continuing products; i.e., suppose that P1*⋅Q0/P0⋅Q0 = p1⋅q0/p0⋅q0. This
means that the reservation prices P1* are such that:


10
   The fact that the true Laspeyres price index PLQ* for unavailable commodities has an asterisk superscript
is meant to alert the reader that the index depends on the reservation prices for the unavailable products
which are not directly observable. Since the true overall Paasche quantity index, QP*, depends on PLQ*, we
have added an asterisk superscript to QP as well.
                                                                                                          10

(12) PLQ* = PLq.


Assumption (12) sets Laspeyres type inflation PLQ* for the unavailable goods and services
equal to the actual Laspeyres inflation for the always available products PLq. This is
consistent with a form of inflation adjusted carry forward pricing for unavailable
products; i.e., if we set P1* = PLqP0 = (p1⋅q0/p0⋅q0)P0, then assumption (12) will be
             11
satisfied.        Under this assumption, define the corresponding overall Approximate
Paasche quantity index, QPA, as follows: 12


(13) QPA ≡ QPqsq0PLq/[PLqsq0 + PLqsQ0]                      using definition (6) and assumption (12)
             = QPqsq0
             > QPqsq0PLq/[PLqsq0 + PLQ*sQ0]                 if PLQ* > PLq
             = QP*.


since the period 0 expenditure shares sum to 1; i.e., we have sq0 + sQ0 = 1.


The relationships in (13) show that the practical approximation to the true Paasche
quantity index defined by QPA is equal to the Paasche quantity index for continuing
commodities, QPq, times the expenditure share of continuing commodities in the base
period sq0. The implication of the equality in (13) is that the practical Paasche index QPA
has an upward bias relative to the true Paasche quantity index QP* provided that the true
Laspeyres price index for unavailable commodities PLQ* is greater than the Laspeyres
price index for continuing commodities PLq. 13 For many countries experiencing massive
shutdowns of various industries, it is almost certain that PLQ* is very much bigger than
PLq so that the upward bias in QPA relative to QP is likely to be very large indeed.




11
   From Appendix B, it can be seen that in general, these inflation adjusted carry forward reservation prices,
PLqP0, will be too low from the perspective of the economic approach to index number theory.
12
   The superscript A was added to QP to indicate that the resulting overall Paasche quantity index is only an
approximation to the true Paasche quantity index, QP. However, QPA does not depend on the unobservable
reservation prices P1* and so QPA is a practical approximation to QP.
13
   Alternatively, QPA > QP* if the true reservation prices P1* > PLqP0 where PLqP0 = (p1⋅q0/p0⋅q0)P0 are the
inflation adjusted carry forward prices for unavailable commodities in period 1.
                                                                                                     11

Note the similarity of expressions (3) and (13) for the Laspeyres and approximate
Paasche quantity indexes. Under assumption (12), we obtain the following simple
formula for the Approximate Fisher quantity index, QFA:


(14) QFA ≡ [QLQPA]1/2
          = [QLqsq0QPqsq0]1/2                                                              using (13)
          = sq0[QLqQPq]1/2
          = sq0QFq


where QFq ≡ [QLqQPq]1/2 is the Fisher quantity index defined over only available
commodities where QLq is defined by (4) and QPq is defined by (7). Thus under
assumption (12), real consumption going from period 0 to 1 can be measured by the
Fisher quantity index QFq defined over only always available commodities times the
expenditure share on always available commodities in period 0. 14


However, as indicated above, it is very likely that the reservation prices P1* are very
much higher than their period 0 counterpart prices P0 and hence the implicit inflation for
the unavailable commodities will likely be much greater than the observed inflation in the
always available commodities. As was the case for the inequality in (13), we make the
following assumption:


(15) PLQ* > PLq.


Using assumption (15) and the inequality in (13) (QPA > QP*), we see that the true overall
Paasche quantity index, QP*, (which may be difficult to accurately calculate due to a lack
of information on the reservation prices of the unavailable products P1*) will be less than
the share adjusted Paasche quantity index calculated using only the always available
commodities, QPqsq0 (which can be calculated). Thus under the reasonable assumption
(15), we have the following relationships between the true overall Laspeyres, Paasche


14
  This result is similar to the inflation adjusted carry forward price methodology explained in Triplett
(2004), de Haan and Krsinich (2012) (2014) and Diewert, Fox and Schreyer (2017).
                                                                                             12


and Fisher measures of real consumption, QL, QP* and QF* ≡ [QLQP*]1/2, and their
counterpart subindexes that use only information on the prices and quantities of available
products, QLq, QPq and QFq:


(16) QL = QLqsq0;
(17) QP* < QPqsq0;
(18) QF* < QFqsq0.


Thus if assumption (15) holds, the true overall Paasche and Fisher quantity indexes, QP*
and QF*, will be less than their share adjusted counterpart indexes, QPqsq0 and QFqsq0,
which do not require information on reservation prices. The size of the gaps in the
inequalities (17) and (18) will grow as the size of the gap in the inequality (15) grows. 15
It is very likely that the gaps in the inequalities (15), (17) and (18) are substantial for
many countries that have implemented significant lockdowns of economic activity. 16


At the time of writing, it has become clear that the COVID-19 virus has changed the
preferences of many households. Thus households are reluctant to shop for goods and
services in person and they are reluctant to offer labour services at unsafe workplaces.
This fact affects the above analysis in at least two ways:


     •   Government mandated shutdowns of many industries is only part of the lockdown
         story; many business establishments will shut down due to safety concerns for
         both their customers and workers. Thus the lockdown effects on output and
         consumption are bigger than just government mandated shutdowns of business
         and household activities. Thus the products that correspond to the vector Q
         include not only products that have disappeared due to government orders but
         they also include products that households no longer wish to purchase due to
         safety concerns.


15
  Of course, the size of the gap in (17) will always be larger than the size of the gap in (18).
16
  See Appendix B for some rough and ready methodology which will enable the reader to form an
approximation to the gap in (18).
                                                                                                          13


     •   The reservation prices which appear in the above algebra (and in Appendix B) are
         reservation prices which are based on the preferences that prevailed before the
         lockdowns took place. For the post lockdown preferences, the reservation prices
         for the products in the Q vector are essentially infinite. Basically, changing
         preferences mean that a new CPI series along with a new real consumption series
         needs to be constructed for the lockdown period. 17


Once the economy has stabilized under lockdown conditions, it is appropriate to use
chained Fisher indexes using only commodities that are available under shutdown
conditions. 18 If the degree of shutdown increases from month to month, the analysis in
the present section can again be applied to the smaller set of available commodities as we
go from month to month. However, when the lockdown ends in period τ > 1, instead of
linking period τ to period τ − 1, linking period τ to period 0 will minimize any potential
chain drift problems. 19


3. Constructing a Cost of Living Index when Transitioning to a Lockdown Economy


The true overall Paasche price index, PP, is defined as follows: 20


(19) PP ≡ [p1⋅q1 + P1*⋅Q1]/[p0⋅q1 + P0⋅Q1]
         = p1⋅q1/p0⋅q1                                                   using assumption (1), Q1 = 0N
         ≡ PPq


17
   Suppose household preferences in the pre-lockdown period can be represented by the utility function,
F(f1(q),f2(Q)) where all three functions are increasing, linearly homogeneous and concave functions. Then
using pre-lockdown preferences, real consumption growth going from period 0 to 1 is equal to
F(f1(q1),f2(0N))/F(f1(q0),f2(Q0)). Post lockdown preferences set Q = 0N and using these preferences, real
consumption growth going from period 0 to 1 can be set equal to F(f1(q1),f2(0N))/F(f1(q0),f2(0N)) or more
simply to f1(q1)/f1(q0). Thus these two real consumption series going from period 0 to 1 are not really
comparable. If period t is a lockdown period, then real consumption growth relative to period 0 can be
represented by f1(qt)/f1(q0). If a subsequent period τ is a “back to normal” period, then we can measure
consumption growth relative to period 0 using period 0 preferences as F(f1(qτ),f2(Qτ))/F(f1(q0),f2(Q0)).
18
   We will discuss this recommendation in more detail in section 6 below.
19
   The basic idea here is that the quantity vector [qτ,Qτ] is likely to be more similar to [q0,Q0] than to the
quantity vectors that pertain to the intervening lockdown periods.
20
   Note that the true Paasche index PP does not depend on the vector of period 1 reservation prices P1*. Thus
PP is likely to be very much lower than the true Laspeyres index PL* to be defined shortly.
                                                                                                           14



where PPq is the Paasche price index that uses only the price and quantity data pertaining
to the always available products in the two periods being compared. The above equality
tells us that the restricted domain Paasche price index, PPq, is equal to the true overall
Paasche price index, PP. Thus the overall Paasche price index can be constructed without
the use of imputed price data for period 1 prices, P1*.


The overall true Laspeyres price index PL* is defined as follows: 21


(20) PL* ≡ [p1⋅q0 + P1*⋅Q0]/[p0⋅q0 + P0⋅Q0]
          = [(p1⋅q0/p0⋅q0)p0⋅q0 + (P1*⋅Q0/P0⋅Q0)P0⋅Q0]/[p0⋅q0 + P0⋅Q0]
          = PLqsq0 + PLQ*sQ0
          = PLq{sq0 + [(P1*⋅Q0/P0⋅Q0)/(p1⋅q0/p0⋅q0)]sQ0}


where the period 0 expenditure shares sq0 and sQ0 were defined by (10) and (11), the
Laspeyres price index for continuing products PLq was defined by (8) and the Laspeyres
price index for unavailable products PLQ* was defined by (9). 22 The problem with
definition (20) is that the vector of period 1 reservation prices P1* is not directly
observable and hence the overall Laspeyres index PL* and the “true” Laspeyres index for
unavailable commodities in period 1 PLQ* cannot be readily calculated.


When a commodity is temporarily out of stock in a retail outlet, many statistical agencies
simply carry forward the observed (unit value) price for the product from the previous
period and use this carry forward price in place of the Hicksian reservation prices that
were used above in our index number calculations. Thus define the overall Laspeyres
price index PLC using (inflation unadjusted) carry forward prices P0 in place of the
reservation prices P1* as follows:


(21) PLC ≡ [p1⋅q0 + P0⋅Q0]/[p0⋅q0 + P0⋅Q0]
21
   Again we add a superscript asterisk to PL to indicate that the true overall Laspeyres price index requires a
knowledge of the period 1 reservation prices for unavailable commodities, P1*.
22
   Compare (20) with the simpler expression defined by (B35) in Appendix B.
                                                                                                       15


          = [(p1⋅q0/p0⋅q0)p0⋅q0 + P0⋅Q0]/[p0⋅q0 + P0⋅Q0]
          = PLqsq0 + sQ0


where the period 0 expenditure shares sq0 and sQ0 were defined by (10) and (11) and the
Laspeyres price index for continuing products PLq was defined by (8).


Using expressions (20) and (21), it can be seen that the following inequality holds
between the simple unadjusted carry forward Laspeyres index, PLC, and the true
Laspeyres index, PL*:


(22) PL* > PLC if and only if PLQ* > 1.


As in the previous section, it is reasonable to assume that reservation prices P1* are
considerably larger than prices P0 that prevailed prior to lockdown conditions. Hence we
can safely assume that the true Laspeyres subindex for unavailable commodities, PLQ* ≡
P1*⋅Q0/P0⋅Q0, is greater than 1 and thus PLC will have a substantial downward bias
compared to the true Laspeyres price index PL* that uses reservation prices.


Following Triplett (2004) and many other authors, 23 statistical offices often multiply the
prior period prices that are not available in the present period by the price inflation of
related commodities. We will use either the Laspeyres or Paasche price index for
continuing commodities to do this indexation and compare the resulting overall
Laspeyres price indexes to PLC.


Define the inflation adjusted carry forward prices P1L using the Laspeyres price index for
continuing commodities, PLq, as the inflation adjusting index as follows:


(23) P1L ≡ PLqP0 = (p1⋅q0/p0⋅q0)P0.



23
  See for example de Haan and Krsinich (2012) (2014), Diewert, Fox and Schreyer (2017) or Diewert
(2020c). This approach is implicit in the use of equation (12) in the previous section; see equation (12).
                                                                                            16

Define the Laspeyres index using the inflation adjusted carry forward prices P1L in place
of the true prices P1* as PLCL:


(24) PLCL ≡ [p1⋅q0 + P1L⋅Q0]/[p0⋅q0 + P0⋅Q0]
          = [p1⋅q0 + (p1⋅q0/p0⋅q0)P0⋅Q0]/[p0⋅q0 + P0⋅Q0]    using (23)
          = [(p1⋅q0/p0⋅q0)][sq0 + sQ0]                      using definitions (10) and (11)
          = PLq[sq0 + sQ0]                                  using definitions (8) and (9)
          = PLq.


Thus the use of PLq as the indexing index in our inflation adjusted carry forward prices
leads to a Laspeyres type index, PLCL, that turns out to equal PLq, the Laspeyres price
index for continuing goods and services. This is a useful result since PLq is a “real” index
with no imputations whereas PLCL is constructed using a great many imputations if N is
large. Note that both PLC and PLCL can be constructed using only knowledge of p0, p1, P0,
q0, q1 and Q0.


Comparing (21) with (24) leads to the following inequality:


(25) PLCL > PLC if and only if PLq > 1.


Instead of using the Laspeyres price index for continuing commodities, we could use the
Paasche index for continuing commodities as the indexing index in the definition of the
inflation adjusted carry forward prices for the unavailable commodities. Define the
inflation adjusted carry forward prices P1P using the Paasche price index for continuing
commodities, PPq, as the inflation adjusting index as follows:


(26) P1P ≡ PPqP0 = (p1⋅q1/p0⋅q1)P0.


Define the Laspeyres index using the inflation adjusted carry forward prices P1P in place
of the true prices P1* as PLCP:
                                                                                          17


(27) PLCP ≡ [p1⋅q0 + P1P⋅Q0]/[p0⋅q0 + P0⋅Q0]
          = [p1⋅q0 + (p1⋅q1/p0⋅q1)P0⋅Q0]/[p0⋅q0 + P0⋅Q0]                 using (26)
          = [(p1⋅q0/p0⋅q0)p0⋅q0 + (p1⋅q1/p0⋅q1)P0⋅Q0]/[p0⋅q0 + P0⋅Q0]
          = (p1⋅q0/p0⋅q0)sq0 + (p1⋅q1/p0⋅q1)sQ0               using definitions (10) and (11)
          = PLqsq0 + PPqsQ0                                   using definitions (8)
          < PLCL                                              if and only if PLq > PPq.


Thus the use of PPq as the inflation index in our inflation adjusted carry forward prices
leads to a price index, PLCP, that turns out to equal a share weighted average of PLq and
PPq, the Laspeyres and Paasche price indexes for continuing goods and services. Since PPq
is likely to be less than its Laspeyres counterpart, PLq, it is likely that PLCP will be less
than PLCL. Note that the scope of PLCL and PLCP is the set of all M+N commodities and N
imputations are required to construct these indexes, whereas PLq and PPq are “real”
indexes with no imputations. A knowledge of q1 is required to construct PLCP whereas no
knowledge of q1 was required to construct PLCL.


Using (20) and (24), it is easy to show that PL* > PLCL if and only if PLQ* > PLq. Using
(20) and (27), it is easy to show that PL* > PLCP if and only if PLQ* > PPq. The bottom line
is that all three practical indexes that use some form of carry forward pricing for missing
products, PLC, PLCL and PLCP, will have substantial downward biases relative to the true
Laspeyres index, PL*.


It is too early to say whether a given country will have rising or falling prices for
continuing products as lockdowns take place. Demand for available commodities may
fall due to declining household incomes as industries shut down and this may lead to
lower prices for continuing products. On the other hand, there may be supply shortages
for some highly demanded consumer products like toilet paper, face masks and hand
sanitizers which will lead to higher prices for these products. Workers in supermarkets
that are open may demand higher wages to compensate them for increased risk of
infection which will lead to higher grocery prices in general. Truckers will also be subject
to increased risk of infection and may get higher wages a result and this will lead to
                                                                                         18

higher prices for available products. Meat processing plants may shut down due to virus
spread which again could lead to higher prices. Also, there will be rapid growth of home
deliveries for available products which will lead to higher prices for products ordered
online since transport costs must be included for the home delivered goods. A shortage of
delivery trucks and drivers may drive up transportation costs. Border shutdowns may
restrict imports of food and medical products, again leading to higher prices for
continuing products. Thus it will be important for statistical agencies to produce inflation
estimates for continuing commodities and this can be accomplished if the agency
produces the Laspeyres index for continuing products, PLq. If the agency is able to obtain
approximate expenditure data for current period values for continuing products p1⋅q1,
then it would be desirable to produce the Paasche index for continuing product, PPq, as
well so that the Fisher index for continuing products, PFq = [PLqPPq]1/2, could also be
produced.


4. Constructing a Lowe Index when Transitioning to a Lockdown Economy


The analysis in the previous section can be adapted to study the behavior of fixed basket
Lowe price indexes when a country closes down industries. This type of index is of
interest because it is used in the construction of the CPI in most countries.


Let qb ≡ [q1b,...,qMb] >> 0M and Qb ≡ [Q1b,...,QNb] >> 0N be a vector of “representative”
commodities that households are purchasing in period 0 and prior periods. The fixed
basket Lowe price index going from period 0 to 1, PB, is defined as follows:


(28) PB* ≡ [p1⋅qb + P1*⋅Qb]/[p0⋅qb + P0⋅Qb]
         = [(p1⋅qb/p0⋅qb)p0⋅qb + (P1*⋅Qb/P0⋅Qb)P0⋅Qb]/[p0⋅qb + P0⋅Qb]
         = PBqsqb + PBQ*sQb


where the fixed basket subindexes for continuing commodities and unavailable
commodities, PBq and PBQ are defined as follows:
                                                                                         19


(29) PBq ≡ p1⋅qb/p0⋅qb ;
(30) PBQ* ≡ P1*⋅Qb/P0⋅Qb.


The base period hybrid shares (prices of period 0 but quantities for a prior year b) for the
continuing and disappearing commodity groups, sqb and sQb, are defined as follows:


(31) sqb ≡ p0⋅qb/[p0⋅qb + P0⋅Qb] ;
(32) sQb ≡ P0⋅Qb/[p0⋅qb + P0⋅Qb].


In definitions (28) and (30), we have used reservation prices to value goods and services
that are no longer available. It makes sense to use reservation prices to value unavailable
products in the context of the economic approach to index number theory but it is not
clear that it is appropriate to use them to value the fixed basket Qb of unavailable
products in period 1. However, the logic of the fixed basket approach works as follows:
there is a representative basket of commodities that households are consuming in periods
prior to period 1, (qb,Qb). The fixed basket methodology simply prices out this basket of
goods and services at the prevailing market prices of periods 0 and 1 and the ratio of
these costs becomes the fixed basket price index. When goods and services are
unavailable in period 1, it is reasonable to use reservation prices for these absent market
prices since they are (imputed) market clearing prices that will ration demand down to
zero for the absent commodities in period 1.


As in the previous section, instead of using reservation prices, the prices P1* could be set
equal to the base period prices, giving rise to the following carry forward basket price
index, PBC, defined as follows:


(33) PBC ≡ [p1⋅qb + P0⋅Qb]/[p0⋅qb + P0⋅Qb]
         = [(p1⋅qb/p0⋅qb)p0⋅qb + (P0⋅Qb/P0⋅Qb)P0⋅Qb]/[p0⋅qb + P0⋅Qb]
         = PBqsqb + sQb
         < PBqsqb + PBQ*sQb                          assuming that PBQ* ≡ P1*⋅Qb/P0⋅Qb > 1
         = PB*                                        using definition (28).
                                                                                         20



Thus the carry forward fixed basket index will have a downward bias if P1*⋅Qb > P0⋅Qb,
which is a reasonable assumption.


An alternative to using carry forward prices is to use the price index for continuing
commodities, PBq defined by (29) to form the inflation adjusted fixed basket carry
forward price vector P1I ≡ PBqP0 = (p1⋅qb/p0⋅qb)P0 as an estimate for P1*. This leads to the
following inflation adjusted fixed basket price index, PBCI, defined as follows:


(34) PBCI ≡ [p1⋅qb + P1I⋅Qb]/[p0⋅qb + P0⋅Qb]
         = [p1⋅qb + PBqP0⋅Qb]/[p0⋅qb + P0⋅Qb]
         = [(p1⋅qb/p0⋅qb)p0⋅qb + PBq(P0⋅Qb/P0⋅Qb)P0⋅Qb]/[p0⋅qb + P0⋅Qb]
         = PBqsqb + PBqsQb
         = PBq                                       since sqb + sQb = 1
         < PBqsqb + PBQ*sQb                          assuming that PBQ* > PBq
         = PB*                                        using definition (28).


Again, it is reasonable to assume that PBQ* > PBq; i.e., that (imputed) inflation for
unavailable commodities is greater than observed inflation for continuing commodities.
Thus the version of the fixed basket index that makes use of inflation adjusted carry
forward prices for the unavailable commodities, PBCI, will be less than the “true” fixed
basket price index PB*.


As was the case in the previous section, we could try to determine which practical fixed
basket price index, PBC or PBCI, is greater because bias will be minimized if we choose the
maximum of these two indexes. We have:


(35) PBC/PBCI = [PBqsqb + sQb]/PBq                          using definitions (33) and (34)
               = sqb + [sQb/PBq].
                                                                                              21

If PBq > 1, so that fixed basket inflation for continuing commodities is positive, then PBCI
> PBC and it is preferable (from the viewpoint of minimizing bias) to use the inflation
adjusted carry forward fixed basket price index PBCI. On the other hand, if PBq < 1, so that
there is deflation for continuing products, then it would be preferable to use the carry
forward fixed basket price index PBC.


The above discussion of the fixed basket price indexes parallels our discussion of the
Laspeyres price index. In fact, if qb = q0 and Qb = Q0, then the fixed basket Lowe index
equals the Laspeyres index. However, in the previous section, the analysis of the
Laspeyres index was not the end of the story: in the end, the Laspeyres index was
combined with the Paasche index to form an approximation to a cost of living index. In
the present section, there is no Paasche counterpart to the fixed basket index. A fixed
basket index, like the Laspeyres index has a certain amount of substitution bias.
Normally, if consumption patterns do not change much over time, a fixed basket index
that uses a representative basket will not be subject to a great deal of substitution bias.
However, in the present context, there are massive changes in the actual consumption
vectors as we move from a pre lockdown period to a post lockdown period. And there are
massive changes in the corresponding market prices. 24 Thus the amount of substitution
bias in a Laspeyres (too high) or Paasche (too low) or fixed basket index (too high) will
also be very large indeed under these conditions. When we take an average of the
Paasche and Laspeyres indexes to form a Fisher index, we greatly reduce the amount of
substitution bias.


In addition to being subject to substitution bias under normal conditions, there is another
problem with using a fixed basket price index during a pandemic. The public will regard
a fixed basket price index as a “reasonable” index, provided that the basket vectors, qb
and Qb, are not too far removed from “normal” consumption patterns. A fixed basket
index is very easy to explain and is perfectly reasonable under normal conditions. But a
fixed basket index is not intuitively plausible when a substantial fraction of the fixed
basket commodities are simply not available. In order to maintain public confidence in

24
     We interpret Hicksian reservation prices for unavailable commodities as market prices.
                                                                                                         22

the CPI, it will be necessary for statistical agencies to move to more representative
baskets that are relevant for lockdown conditions. This means that the national statistical
agency will need to find ways to update their historical baskets more quickly—updated
baskets in real time would be ideal. 25


To explain how updated baskets could work in producing a reasonable CPI for continuing
goods and services, suppose the price and quantity data for period 0 are (p0,q0b) and (P0,
Q0b) but for period 1, the data are (p1,q1b) and (P1*,0N). It is unlikely that national
statistical agencies will be able to produce the reservation prices P1* and so we will
concentrate on how to construct a price index for continuing commodities. Note that we
are assuming that a new representative basket for continuing commodities in period 1, q1b,
is available to the agency. 26 Under these assumptions, the following pseudo Laspeyres
Paasche and Fisher price indexes, PBq0, PBq1 and PBqF, for continuing commodities could
be produced:


(36) PBq0 ≡ p1⋅q0b/p0⋅q0b = PBq ;
(37) PBq1 ≡ p1⋅q1b/p0⋅q1b ;
(38) PBqF ≡ [PBq0PBq1]1/2


where PBq was defined by (29) and we have used the fact that q0b is equal to our old qb.
The logic for preferring the pseudo Fisher index over its Laspeyres and Paasche
counterparts is the usual one: PBq0 and PBq1 are both fixed basket indexes that attempt to
measure general inflation going from period 0 to 1. Both indexes are equally plausible so
good statistical practice suggests that we take an average of the two to obtain a single
point estimate of overall inflation between the periods. If q0b is close to actual period 0
consumption of the continuing commodities, q0, then PBq0 will be a good approximation


25
   Quantity baskets of the form qb can be replaced by expenditure share information (the vector of
expenditure shares sb) for the same period provided that price information for the same period, pb, is also
available since qmb will be proportional to smb/pmb for m = 1,...,M.
26
   For some elementary index strata, the statistical agency may have scanner data available. In this case, we
set q0b = q0 and q1b = q1; i.e., there is no need to use approximations to qt in this case. The actual
consumption vector for a period is the most representative consumption vector for that period. An
elementary index is simply an index constructed at the lowest level of aggregation; see Diewert (2020b).
                                                                                                          23

to the Laspeyres index PqL. If q1b is close to actual period 1 consumption of the
continuing commodities, q1, then PBq1 will be a good approximation to the Paasche index
PqP. If both approximations are good, then PBqF will be close to our preferred index, PqF.


If the scope of the lockdown does not change materially during the lockdown, then the
statistical agency could go back to using a fixed basket (equal to q1b) for the duration of
the lockdown. However, it is unlikely that countries will keep the scope of their
lockdowns constant. Thus the number of continuing commodities that are present in two
consecutive periods is unlikely to be constant. In this case, constructing chained
maximum overlap pseudo Fisher indexes over the lockdown periods is preferable. 27


If the lockdown ends at the beginning of period τ, then it will be necessary to construct a
new basket (qτb,Qτb) that is representative for period τ. Recall that the basket for period 0
was (q0b,Q0b). In order to construct the period τ price level, instead of comparing period τ
prices to the prices of period τ − 1, it is best to compare period τ prices, (pτ,Pτ), to the
prices of period 0, (p0,P0), since the overlap of products will be much larger than the
overlap of products available in period τ to products available during the lockdown
periods. 28 Thus it is preferable that the following pseudo Laspeyres Paasche and Fisher
price indexes, PB0, PBτ and PB0τ, be produced:


(39) PB0 ≡ [pτ⋅q0b + Pτ⋅Q0b]/[p0⋅q0b + P0⋅Q0b] ;
(40) PBτ ≡ [pτ⋅qτb + Pτ⋅Qτb]/[p0⋅qτb + P0⋅Qτb] ;
(41) PB0τ ≡ [PB0PBτ]1/2.




27
   There may be a chain drift problem at the lowest level of aggregation. In this case, it may be necessary to
use a multilateral index number. See Ivancic, Diewert and Fox (2011), Diewert and Fox (2018) and
Diewert (2020b) for discussions of the chain drift problem and the use of multilateral methods. At higher
levels of aggregation, chain drift will typically not be a major problem.
28
   Other forms of linking based on the similarity of the structure of prices and quantities going from one
period to another period. For an explanation of how to implement these more sophisticated methods of
linking observations over time, see section 20 of Diewert (2020c).
                                                                                                           24


Thus the price level in period τ will be set equal to the price level in period 0 times the
pseudo Fisher index, 29 PBq0τ. This index will approximate the true Fisher index going
from period 0 to period τ. However, the sequence of price levels going from period 1 to
period τ − 1 will not approximate economic price indexes or cost of living indexes
because the big increase in the cost of living due to the lockdown in period 1 will not be
reflected by the movements in the above basket price indexes for periods 1 to τ − 1. In
order to accurately measure the cost of living for those periods, we need estimates for the
period 1 reservation prices P1*.


5. The Way Forward


Statistical agencies that use a fixed basket methodology for constructing their CPI are
faced with the fact that the fixed basket has become almost totally irrelevant. 30 A fixed
basket index is very easy to explain and is perfectly reasonable under “normal”
conditions. But a fixed basket index is not intuitively plausible when a substantial fraction
of the fixed basket commodities are simply not available. At the very least, this suggests
that NSOs move to more representative baskets that are relevant for lockdown conditions.


However, many NSOs will not have the resources to estimate representative baskets in
real time. We will list a number of possible strategies that an agency could use in order to
construct a CPI under pandemic conditions, depending on what kind of data they are able
to collect. We will start with the assumption that very little data are available and finish
with the way forward if ample data are available. For each of these cases, we will look at
possible ways of addressing the lack of matching problem at the elementary index level.


29
   Pseudo Fisher price indexes have been computed retrospectively; e.g., see Diewert, Huwiler and Kohli
(2009).
30
   One might argue that the fixed basket that is used for continuing commodities is still relevant but in fact,
there are substantial changes in consumption patterns due to the government imposed lockdowns of
economic activity. A further complicating factor is household accumulation of storable goods. Thus in
terms of our model, q1 may differ substantially from q0. Another complicating factor is the fact that online
prices can differ from in store prices for the available food and pharmacy items that are still sold during a
lockdown period. Furthermore, many households need to pay additional fees for hiring someone to do their
shopping for them and deliver it to their doorstep. Thus there is a new goods problem even in categories of
consumption that have not been shut down.
                                                                                                          25


Case 1: Very Little Data Availability


For this case, we suppose that the agency has only a fixed basket (qb,Qb) along with price
data for period 0 which is the period before the lockdown, (p0,P0). For the pandemic
periods, the agency has only price data for always available goods and services, pt for t =
1,2,...τ−1, the pandemic periods. When the pandemic is over in period τ, we assume that
the agency can collect price data for always available goods, pτ, and for commodities that
were available in period 0 and become available again in period τ, Pτ. For the lockdown
periods, the agency can calculate the fixed basket index for always available commodities,
pt⋅qb/p0⋅qb for t =1,2,...τ−1. These indexes may be suitable for (partial) compensation
purposes; i.e., if period 0 household expenditures on the basket qb were equal to p0⋅qb,
then using the index pt⋅qb/p0⋅qb to escalate the household’s period 0 “income” (equal to
p0⋅qb) would allow the household to purchase the bundle of commodities qb in period t for
t = 1,2,...,τ−1. 31 The statistical agency would need to note that the CPI for these periods is
not comparable to the CPI for either period 0 or period τ. 32 The suggested CPI for these
lockdown periods will not provide a satisfactory approximation to a cost of living index.
Because it does not involve the unavailable goods, it cannot provide a credible index that
will reflect the increase in the effective prices of unavailable goods and services.
However, to provide a useful estimate for a cost of living index relative to the standard of
living in period 0 for the lockdown periods, we require estimates for reservation prices,
Pt* for t = 1,2,...,τ−1. Very few NSOs will venture to estimate reservation prices. What
NSOs can do is to provide a credible CPI for goods and services which are actually
available during the lockdown periods. When the lockdown ends and conditions approach
“normality” in period τ, then the under-resourced statistical office can use its pre-
lockdown basket, (qb,Qb), to calculate the price level in period τ relative to period 0 as the
fixed base index [pτ⋅qb + Pτ⋅Qb]/[p0⋅qb + P0⋅Qb].



31
  This index may be subject to some substitution bias.
32
  Equations (34) show that the indexes pt⋅qb/p0⋅qb for t =1,2,...τ−1 could be generated by using the inflation
adjusted carry forward price vectors for unavailable commodities defined as PtI ≡ (pt⋅qb/p0⋅qb)P0. If this is
done, users need to be informed that the resulting indexes are not “true” fixed basket indexes in that part of
the overall fixed basket, (qb,Qb), is simply not available for purchase in period t.
                                                                                                         26


Case 2: Some Data Availability


We assume that the data availability is at least as good as in the above case. In addition,
we assume that by period σ (where 1 < σ < τ), the statistical agency is able to obtain an
estimate for a representative quantity vector qσ for the always available quantities during
the lockdown period. For the lockdown periods prior to period σ, the agency can
calculate the fixed basket index for always available commodities, πt ≡ pt⋅qb/p0⋅qb for t =
1,2,...σ−1. In period σ, the new basket qσ becomes available so we can calculate the
period t price index value for period t as πt ≡ πt−1[pt⋅qσ/pt−1⋅qσ] for t = σ,σ+1,...,τ−1.
However, the price levels π1, π2,..., πσ−1 may very unreliable due to the fact that the pre-
lockdown quantity vector qb0 will probably be rather far from the actual consumption
vectors q1, q2,...,qσ−1 over the lockdown period extending from period 1 to period σ−1.
Thus it may be preferable to define ρσ as the pseudo Fisher index comparing period 0
with period σ; i.e., define πσ ≡ [pσ⋅qb/p0⋅qb]1/2[pσ⋅qσ/p0⋅qσ]1/2. For lockdown periods
following period σ but prior to period τ, define πt ≡ πt−1[pt⋅qσ/pt−1⋅qσ] for t =
σ+1,σ+2,...,τ−1. Again, these indexes may be suitable for partial indexation purposes but
they will be subject to substantial downward biases as approximations to cost of living
indexes. When we get to period τ, the moderately-resourced statistical office can
calculate the fixed base index relative to period 0; i.e., set πτ = [pτ⋅qb + Pτ⋅Qb]/[p0⋅qb +
P0⋅Qb]. 33




33
  If the statistical office has set in motion a continuous consumer expenditure survey so that a new period τ
comprehensive basket (qτ,Qτ) can be constructed, then the office can calculate the pseudo Fisher index
defined by (42).
                                                                                                         27


Case 3: Ample Data Availability


We assume the Case 1 data availability plus the availability of representative quantity
vectors qbt for all periods t = 0,1,...,τ. We also assume that a representative quantity
vector for the unavailable commodities is available for periods 0 and τ. Denote these
vectors by Qb0 and Qbτ. The corresponding price vectors are P0 and P1. For period 0,
define the price level as π0 ≡ 1. For the lockdown periods, define the period 1 price index
π1 as the pseudo Fisher index π1 ≡ {[p1⋅qb0/p0⋅qb0][p1⋅qb1/p0⋅qb1]}1/2. For t = 2,3,...τ−1
define the period t price index as πt ≡ πt−1{[pt⋅qbt−1/pt−1⋅qbt−1][pt⋅qbt/pt−1⋅qbt]}1/2. Thus the
period to period pseudo Fisher indexes are chained together to form the period t price
level. For period τ, define the price level πτ as the comprehensive pseudo Fisher price
index connecting period 0 to period τ; i.e., define πτ as follows:


(42) πτ ≡ {[pτ⋅qb0 + Pτ⋅Qb0]/[p0⋅qb0 + P0⋅Qb0]}1/2{[pτ⋅qbτ + Pτ⋅Qbτ]/[p0⋅qbτ + P0⋅Qbτ]}1/2.


The reason for using chained pseudo Fisher price indexes for the available products
during the lockdown period instead of fixed base pseudo Fisher price indexes is the
likelihood that consumer purchases of available products over the lockdown periods may
not be well approximated by a constant vector qb. Initially, households will stock up on
storable goods and cut back on purchases of consumer durables. If the lockdown period is
long and the degree of lockdown varies, then it is quite likely that the vector of actual
purchases of available commodities in period t, qt, will be quite variable and hence a
constant qb will not provide a representative vector of household purchases over all of the
lockdown periods. 34 Of course, the gold standard for the quantity vectors qbt would be the
actual period t consumption vectors, qt, in which case, the pseudo Fisher indexes would
become actual Fisher indexes.



34
  In reality, the set of available products will also vary over the lockdown periods. At the time of writing,
food processers in many cities are not producing their full line of products; instead they are concentrating
on increasing the volume of their best selling products. Thus for some elementary index categories, it may
be necessary to use fixed base pseudo Fisher indexes in place of the chained indexes for the lockdown
periods in order to eliminate chain drift.
                                                                                                      28


6. The Lack of Matching Problem at the Elementary Index Level


A problem which has appeared as a result of country wide lockdowns is the problem of
missing products in retail outlets. As a result of household stockpiling activities, many
products are missing in grocery shops. In some cases, the missing products may reappear
in a later period; in some cases, they may be gone for the duration of the lockdown. 35 If
the products are gone for the duration of the lockdown and the remaining products are
present during the current and prior lockdown periods, then we are in position to apply
the theory above to the particular elementary aggregate under consideration; i.e., we need
to switch from pricing out the pre-lockout basket of products to the new smaller set of
products. However, real life will be more complicated than having a clear division
between products present and products that have been discontinued for all lockout
periods: products will be drifting in and out of scope in any particular retail outlet. This
may lead to a massive lack of matching problem. We will briefly suggest possible
solutions to this problem under two scenarios: (i) only web scraped data are available and
(ii) scanner data are available. The analysis in this section differs from the analysis that
was presented in the previous section where it was known that some commodities would
be unavailable for the duration of the lockdown. In the present situation, we are assuming
that products are present in some periods and not present in other periods; i.e., we are
assuming that the full array of pre-lockdown products is not available in the lockdown
periods.


Case 1: Only Price Data are Available


Method 1: Adapt the Section 4 Carry Forward Methodology


The adaptation here is to assume that q0 and q1 are equal to the vector of ones, 1M, and Q0
equals the vector of ones, 1N. Q1 = 0N as in section 4. Thus the q group of products are the
maximum overlap products that are present in both periods and the Q products are present


35
  Many food manufacturers are focusing on their most popular items and producing them at scale to satisfy
the stockpiling demands.
                                                                                                            29

in the base period 0 but not in the current period 1. The given price vectors are p0, p1 and
P1. Applying the section 4 methodology using the above assumptions on prices and
quantities leads to the following inflation adjusted carry forward price index using
equation (34) adapted to the present situation:


(43) PBCI = PBq = p1⋅1M/p0⋅1M = Σm=1M pm1/Σm=1M pm0.


The above index is the Dutot (1738) elementary index, defined over products that are
present in both periods. It has an undesirable property: it is not invariant to changes in the
units of measurement of the products. It will also give a higher weight to products that
are more expensive which may not be a desirable property. Nevertheless, it does
approximate the theoretically more desirable Jevons index under certain conditions. 36


Method 2: Use Maximum Overlap Jevons Indexes


This method simply sets the price index equal to the Jevons (1865) index for the
overlapping products in the two periods under consideration. Thus using the same
notation as was used to describe Method 1 above, the maximum overlap Jevons index,
PJMO, is equal to the geometric mean of the price ratios for the overlapping products:


(44) PJMO ≡ [Πm=1M (pm1/pm0)]1/M.


The Jevons index has the best axiomatic properties for indexes (with no missing prices)
that depend only on prices. Note in particular that the maximum overlap Jevons index is
invariant to changes in the units of measurement for the products. 37




36
     See Diewert (2020b) for a discussion of this index and its relationship to other elementary indexes.
37
     See Diewert (2020b) for the axiomatic properties of the Jevons index.
                                                                                                    30


Method 3: Use the Multilateral Time Product Dummy Method


A problem with the above two methods is that they make use of price data covering only
two periods. In the situation where closely related products are moving in and out of
scope, constructing maximum overlap bilateral index numbers does not make use of all of
the data and hence is inefficient from a statistical point of view. For example, suppose a
product is present in periods 1 and 3 and another product is present in periods 2 and 4. In
a bilateral index setup, the information pertaining to these two products would not be
used which is inefficient since price comparisons for product 1 between periods 1 and 3
and for product 2 between periods 2 and 4 are perfectly valid comparisons and should be
used somehow in constructing the sequence of price indexes. The way forward here is to
use a multilateral index which utilizes the price information for all periods.


Our preferred multilateral method is the Time Product Dummy Method with missing
observations. 38 We introduce some new notation in order to describe this method. We
now assume that there are N products and T time periods but not all products are
purchased (or sold) in all time periods. The price and quantity vectors for period t are
denoted by pt ≡ [pt1,...,ptN] and qt ≡ [qt1,...,qtN]. If product n in period t is missing, we set
the corresponding price and quantity, ptn and qtn, equal to 0. For each period t, define the
set of products n that are present in period t as S(t) ≡ {n: ptn > 0} for t = 1,2,...,T. It is
assumed that these sets are not empty; i.e., at least one product is purchased in each
period. For each product n, define the set of periods t where product n is present as S*(n)
≡ {t: ptn > 0}. Again, assume that these sets are not empty; i.e., each product is sold in at
least one time period. Define the integers N(t) and T(n) as follows:


(45) N(t) ≡ Σn∈S(t) 1;                                                                     t = 1,...,T;
(46) T(n) ≡ Σt∈S*(n) 1;                                                                    n = 1,...,N.



38
 The method was originally devised for making price comparisons across countries and is known as the
Country Product Dummy multilateral method. It is due to Summers (1973). A weighted version of this
model (with missing observations) was first applied in the time series context by Aizcorbe, Corrado and
Doms (2000). The unweighted time series version is due to Court (1939) as we shall see.
                                                                                                        31

If all N products are present in period t, then N(t) = N; if product n is present in all T
periods, then T(n) = T.


The economic model that is consistent with the Time Dummy Product multilateral
method is the following one:


(47) ptn = πtαn ;                                                                    t = 1,...,T; n∈S(t)


where πt is the period t price level and αn is a quality adjustment parameter for product n.
If all products were available in all periods, equations (47) tells us that prices for the
group of products in scope are moving in a proportional manner. This is consistent with
purchasers of the N products having the linear utility function, f(q) = α⋅q ≡ Σn=1N αnqn
where α ≡ [α1,...,αN] and q ≡ [q1,...,qN]. 39 Now take logarithms of both sides of equations
(47), add error terms etn to the resulting equations and we obtain the following system of
estimating equations:


(48) lnptn = ρt + βn + etn ;                                                          t = 1,...,T; n∈S(t)


where ρt ≡ lnπt for t = 1,...,T and βn ≡ lnαn for n = 1,...,N. Note that equations (48) form
the basis for the time dummy hedonic regression model, which is due to Court (1939). 40


Estimates for the unknown parameters ρt and βn that appear in equations (48) can be
found by solving the following least squares minimization problem:


(49) min ρ,β {Σt=1T Σn∈S(t) [lnptn − ρt − βn]2}.



39
   See Diewert (2020d) for further explanation of the underlying economic model. It can be seen that this
approach will only be adequate if the products are very close substitutes since a linear utility function
implies that the products are perfect substitutes.
40
   This was Court’s (1939; 109-111) hedonic suggestion number two. He chose to transform equations (47)
by the log transformation because the resulting regression model fit his data on automobiles better. Diewert
(2003) also recommended the log transformation on the grounds that multiplicative errors were more
plausible than additive errors.
                                                                                                         32

In order to obtain a unique solution to (49), we need to impose a normalization on the
parameters. 41 Choose the normalization ρ1 = 0 (which corresponds to π1 = 1). Denote the
resulting solution by ρ* ≡ [1,ρ2*,...,ρT*] and β* ≡ [β1*,...,βN*]. Use these estimates to form
estimates for πt* ≡ exp[ρt*] for t = 1,...,T and αn* ≡ exp[βn*] for n = 1,...,N. It turns out
that these estimates satisfy the following equations:


(50) πt* = Πn∈S(t) [ptn/αn*]1/N(t) ;                                                            t = 1,...,T;
(51) αn* = Πt∈S*(n) [ptn/πt*]1/T(n) ;                                                           n = 1,...,N.


Note that ptn/αn* is a quality adjusted price for product n in period t and ptn/πt* is the
corresponding inflation adjusted price for product n in period t. Thus the period t
estimated price level, πt*, is the geometric mean of the quality adjusted prices for
products that are available in period t and the estimated quality adjustment factor for
product n, αn*, is the geometric mean of all of the inflation adjusted prices for product n
over all periods. Note that if the set of available products in periods r and t is the same,
then πt*/πr* = [Πn∈S(t)(ptn/prn)]1/N(t) which is the Jevons index defined over the products
that are present in both periods. These price levels generated by this method have
satisfactory axiomatic properties. 42 There are some additional choices that the statistical
agency will have to make if it uses this method; i.e., it is necessary to decide on the
length of the window of observations T and it is necessary to decide on how to link the
results of the latest window of estimates with the previous window of estimates for the
price levels. The agency should be able to resolve these issues by experimenting with the
different choices for the window length and for linking the price level estimates for a new
window to the estimates of the previous window.




41
   We also need to impose a full rank condition on the X matrix generated by the linear regression model
defined by equations (48) and ρ1 = 0; see Diewert (2020c).
42
   See Diewert (2020c). It turns out that the price levels satisfy an identity test so if prices are equal in
periods r and t, then πr* = πt*.
                                                                                                   33


Case 2: Price and Quantity Data are Available


Method 4: Apply the Section 4 Carry Forward Methodology


Little additional explanation is required here; just apply the methodology explained in
section 4 to the elementary index context. Diewert, Fox and Schreyer (2017) have more
details on how to apply the carry forward methodology for Paasche, Laspeyres, Fisher
and Törnqvist indexes in the case of two observations.


Method 5: Apply the Weighted Time Product Dummy Multilateral Method


The basic economic model is still the price proportionality model defined by equations
(47) above but now we assume that we have expenditure or quantity information on
household purchases in addition to price information. With this extra information, it is
preferable to take the economic importance of each commodity into account and replace
the least squares minimization problem defined by (49) with the following weighted least
squares minimization problem: 43


(52) min ρ,β {Σt=1T Σn∈S(t) stn[lnptn − ρt − βn]2}


where the period t expenditure share on commodity n is stn ≡ ptnqtn/pt⋅qt for t = 1,...,T and
n∈S(t). 44 Again, we need to make the normalization ρ1 = 0 to obtain a unique solution ρ*
and β* to (52). It turns out the solution will satisfy the following equations, which are the
weighted counterparts to equations (50) and (51): 45


(53) πt* = exp[Σn∈S(t) stnln(ptn/αn*)] ;                                                  t = 1,...,T;
(54) αn* = exp[Σt∈S*(n) stnln(ptn/πt*)/Σt∈S*(n) stn] ;                                   n = 1,...,N.



43
   Rao (1995) (2004) (2005; 574) was the first to consider this model using expenditure share weights.
However, Balk (1980; 70) suggested this class of models much earlier using different weights.
44
   See Diewert (2020c) for a discussion on the merits of different choices for the weights.

   See Diewert (2020c).
                                                                                                          34


From (53) and (54), it can be seen that the period t estimated price level, πt*, is now a
weighted geometric mean of the quality adjusted prices for products that are available in
period t and the estimated quality adjustment factor for product n, αn*, is now a weighed
geometric mean of all of the inflation adjusted prices for product n over all periods. Note
that if the set of available products in periods r and t is the same, πt*/πr* will not collapse
to a weighted Jevons index unless the expenditure shares in the two periods under
consideration are equal.


Once the estimates for the πt* and αn* have been computed, we have the usual two
methods for constructing period by period aggregate price and quantity levels, Pt and Qt
for t = 1,...,T. The way to see this is to consider the underlying equations (47) which were
the equations ptn = πtαn for t = 1,...,T and n∈S(t). Take this equation for some n and t and
multiply both sides of it by the observed quantity, qtn, and sum the resulting equations.
We obtain the following equations using the fact that qtn = ptn ≡ 0 for n∉S(t):


(55) pt⋅qt = Σn∈S(t) ptnqtn                                 t = 1,...,T
           = πtΣn∈S(t) αnqtn
           = πtΣn=1N αnqtn                                  since qtn = 0 if n does not belong to S(t)
           = πtα⋅qt.


Because equations (47) will not hold exactly, with nonzero errors etn, equations (55) will
only hold approximately. However, the approximate versions of equations (55) allow us
to form period t price and quantity aggregate levels, say Pt and Qt, in two separate ways:
the πt* estimates that are part of the solution to (52) can be used to form Pt* and Qt* via
equations (56) and the αn* estimates that are part of the solution to (52) can be used to
form the aggregates Pt** and Qt** via equations (57): 46


(56) Pt* ≡ πt* ;       Qt* ≡ pt⋅qt/πt* ;                                                         t = 1,...,T;


46
  Note that the price level Pt** defined in (57) is a quality adjusted unit value index of the type studied by
de Haan (2004).
                                                                                                           35


(57) Qt** ≡ α*⋅qt ; Pt** ≡ pt⋅qt/α*⋅qt ;                                                          t =1,...,T.


Define the error terms etn ≡ lnptn − lnπt* − lnαn* for t = 1,...,T and n = 1,...,N. If all etn = 0,
then Pt* will equal Pt** and Qt* will equal Qt** for t = 1,...,T. However, if the error terms
are not all equal to zero, then the statistical agency will have to decide on pragmatic
grounds on which option to choose to form the aggregate price and quantity levels. 47


It should be noted that Pt** ≡ pt⋅qt/α*⋅qt is a quality adjusted unit value price level. 48 There
is also an inequality between Pt* and Pt** that is due to de Haan and Krsinich (2018; 763).
From (53) and (56), we have Pt* = exp[Σn∈S(t) stnln(ptn/αn*)], which is a share weighted
geometric mean of the period t quality adjusted prices, ptn/αn*, for products that are
actually present in period t. From (57), we have Pt** equal to the following expression:


(58) Pt** ≡ pt⋅qt/α*⋅qt                                                                            t = 1,...,T
          = Σn∈S(t) ptnqtn/Σn∈S(t) αn*qtn
          = Σn∈S(t) ptnqtn/Σn∈S(t) αn* (ptn)−1ptnqtn
          = [Σn∈S(t) stn(ptn/αn*)−1]−1
          ≤ Pt*


since a share weighted harmonic mean of the quality adjusted prices present in period t is
always equal to or less than the corresponding share weighted geometric mean using
Schlömilch’s inequality (see Hardy, Littlewood and Polyá (1934; 26)). Note that Pt** ≤
Pt* implies that Qt** ≥ Qt* for t = 1,...,T.
The axiomatic properties of the price levels πt* are studied in Diewert (2020c). They are
reasonably good.

47
   De Haan and Krsinich (2018) were the first to realize that the results of a hedonic regression would lead
to two separate ways to define the resulting aggregate price and quantity levels. See also Diewert (2020c)
(2020d). If the accurate measurement of price levels is the target, then it is probably best to use Pt*; if the
target is to measure aggregate quantity levels (and hence welfare), then it is probably best to use Pt**.
48
   The term “quality adjusted unit value price index” was introduced by Dalén (2001). Its properties were
further studied by de Haan (2004) (2010), Silver (2010) (2011), de Haan and Krsinich (2018), Von Auer
(2014) and Diewert (2020c) (2020d).
                                                                                        36



The issues of choosing a window length T for this multilateral method remain
unresolved; statistical agencies can experiment with different choices for T. There is also
the issue of linking the present window with the previous window.


From the viewpoint of the economic approach to index number theory, the use of this
method should be confined to situations where the products in scope are close substitutes
since the underlying economic assumption is that the products are perfect substitutes,
except for random errors. Quality adjusted unit value price levels are appropriate in this
situation but if the products are not close substitutes, it would be preferable to use the
inflation adjusted carry forward prices methodology suggested by Diewert, Fox and
Schreyer (2017) if the target index is a superlative index. Finally, Method 5 should not be
used at higher levels of aggregation where substitution between elementary index
categories may be low. At the second stage of aggregation it would be preferable to use
Fisher, Walsh or Törnqvist indexes if actual price and quantity data are available or use
pseudo Fisher indexes if the quantity data can only be approximated.


Method 6: The Use of Quality Adjusted Unit Value Price Levels


From the discussion of Method 5 above, it is clear that quality adjusted unit values can be
used as price levels, provided that the commodities in scope for the elementary aggregate
are close substitutes. However, it is not necessary to use the Weighted Time Product
Dummy multilateral index number method in order to obtain estimates for the quality
adjustment parameters, the components of the vector α. If the group of products under
consideration consists of highly substitutable products and all of the products were
purchased in the pre-lockdown period 0, then simply set α equal to p0, the (unit value)
price vector for the products in the pre-lockdown period. If all of the products were
purchased for a number of pre-lockdown periods, say periods 0, −1, −2 and −3, and the
price vectors for these periods were p0, p−1, p−2 and p−3, then define α as follows:


(59) α ≡ (1/4)[(p01)−1p0 + (p−1,1)−1p−1 + (p−2,1)−1p−2 + (p−3,1)−1p−3].
                                                                                                        37



Thus α is set equal to the average of past pre-lockdown price vectors for the commodities
in the group of commodities under consideration but these vectors of past prices are
deflated by the price of the first commodity in order to eliminate the effects of general
inflation between past periods for the group of commodities. The first commodity should
be chosen to be the commodity with the largest average expenditure share in the group of
commodities. If there are missing prices in the pre-lockdown periods, then instead of
using the α defined by (59), the α defined by the Time Product Dummy multilateral
method (Method 3 above) could be used to estimate the quality adjustment parameters.


From the viewpoint of the economic approach to index number theory, the use of quality
adjusted unit values as estimates for price levels should only be applied if the
commodities in the elementary group of commodities are close substitutes. 49


Method 7: Linking Based on Relative Price and Quantity Similarity


A desirable property of the Fisher price index between two periods is the fact that the
Fisher index will equal unity if prices in the two periods are equal even if the quantities
demanded in the two periods are not equal. Most multilateral methods do not satisfy this
strong identity test; they tend to satisfy a weaker identity test that says that the relative
aggregate price levels between any two periods in the window of observations will equal
unity provided that both prices and quantities are identical in the two periods being
compared.


There is a recently developed multilateral method that satisfies the above strong identity
test and can deal with missing observations. The method is based on building a set of

49
  It is possible to cluster N highly substitutable commodities in scope into quality groups based on their
price per unit of a dominant characteristic. Group the N products into low quality, medium quality and high
quality products based on their relative prices in the pre-lockdown period. Then aggregate price levels for
each of the three groups of products could be constructed by simply taking unit values (without quality
adjustment) for each group of products. We would end up with three elementary indexes in place of the
single elementary index. Then these three separate indexes could be aggregated up into a single index using
a superlative index number formula. This is feasible because we are assuming the availability of price and
quantity data for Method 6. The advantage of this method is that it avoids the need for imputation.
                                                                                                          38

Fisher index bilateral comparisons where each comparison is based on linking the periods
that have the most similar relative price structures. 50 Initially, periods 1 and 2 are linked
by the usual bilateral Fisher price index. When the data of period 3 become available, the
price and quantity data of period 3 are linked to the corresponding data of either period 1
or 2, depending on which of these two periods has the most similar structure of relative
prices. The bilateral Fisher index is used to link period 3 with period 1 if the measure of
relative price similarity between periods 1 and 3 is higher than the measure of relative
price similarity between periods 1 and 2. If the measure of relative price similarity
between periods 2 and 3 is higher than the corresponding measure for comparing periods
1 and 3, then the bilateral Fisher index is used to link period 3 with period 2. When the
data of period 4 become available, the data for period 4 are linked to the data of periods
1,2 or 3, depending on which of these 3 prior periods gives rise to the highest measure of
price similarity. And so on. In practice, measures of relative price dissimilarity are used
to link the data of two periods, using the lowest measure of dissimilarity to do the linking.
At the first stage of the network of comparisons, the two periods that have the most
similar structure of relative prices is chosen. At the next stage of the comparison, look for
a third period that had the most similar relative price structure to the first two periods and
link in this third country to the comparisons of volume between the first two countries
and so on.


A key aspect of this linking methodology is the choice of the measure of similarity (or
dissimilarity) of the relative price structures of two countries. Various measures of the
similarity or dissimilarity of relative price structures have been proposed by Allen and
Diewert (1981), Kravis, Heston and Summers (1982; 104-106), Hill (1997) (2009), Aten
and Heston (2009) and Diewert (2009). The dissimilarity measure recently proposed by
Diewert (2020c; 72) seems to be the most promising but the method needs to be more
thoroughly tested before it can be suggested to statistical agencies for general use. A
major advantage of this new method of linking periods is that the strong identity test will
always be satisfied; i.e., if prices in the current period are the same as the prices in a past

50
  Hill (2001) (2004) was an early pioneer in using this similarity of relative prices approach to multilateral
index number theory in the time series context. The real time linking method described here is due to
Diewert (2020c).
                                                                                                          39

period, the estimated price levels pertaining to these two periods will always be identical
even if quantities or expenditures are not identical. 51 There can never be a chain drift
problem using this new multilateral method.


7. Other Measurement Problems


7.1. No Agency Employee Price Collection


Most statistical agencies have stopped sending employees to retail outlets to collect prices.
Instead the agencies have switched to web scraping; i.e., they collect online prices over
the internet. The collected prices will not be perfectly comparable with the previously
collected in store prices. Cavallo (2017) did a large scale comparison of in store prices
versus online prices (excluding transport costs) across 10 countries and found little
difference between in store and online prices. 52 His results provide some justification for
comparing a web scraped price for a specific product with a collected price for the same
product in a prior period. Under lockdown conditions, home delivery of products
purchased online will increase dramatically. On the other hand, household travel
expenses will decrease due to fewer in store shopping trips. As these travel expenses are
in scope for household expenditures, it may make sense to collect online prices that
include delivery since the delivered price is the price that the consumer actually faces for
the product. The higher price for the delivered product will be offset by lower household
transportation costs. In general, we endorse the collection of web scraped data to replace
previous data that were collected by agency employees. However, some care should be
taken to not collect online prices for goods or services which were never actually
consumed by any household. Examples of such services are be listed airline fares or
listed prepaid holiday packages that are eventually cancelled. 53

51
   If the prices in the current period are proportional to the prices in a prior period, then the ratio of the
current period price level to the prior period price level will be equal to the factor of proportionality.
Another advantage of Diewert’s method is that it is not necessary to choose a window length for his
suggested multilateral method.
52
   From Cavallo (2017; 291), online prices over the comparable in-store prices were on average 4% lower.
The average markup ranged from −13% for Japan to +5% for Australia. See also Cavallo (2013) and
Cavallo and Rigobon (2016).
53
   How exactly should cancellation fees be treated in a CPI? An interesting question.
                                                                                                  40


7.2 Lack of Information on Current Household Expenditure Weights


It will be very difficult for statistical agencies to find current period expenditure share or
quantity weights for their elementary index categories. The problem is that the
“representative” basket for each month is changing rapidly as the virus spreads and
lockdown rules change to react to current conditions. Here are some possible ways for
NSOs to obtain current information on household expenditures:
     •   Some countries (such as the US and the UK) have continuous household
         expenditure surveys. Usually, the sample size for such surveys is small so, for
         example, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey does
         not have a big enough sample size to allow monthly publication of the implied
         monthly weights. It publishes semi-annual estimates. The way forward here is to
         increase the sample size. For countries that currently do not have a continuous
         consumer expenditure survey, it is absolutely necessary that they start one.
     •   Some private companies collect consumer expenditure data (along with prices and
         quantities) on a continuous basis for a sample of households using scanner data.
         NSOs can purchase these data (at a fair price) or set up their own competing
         company if they are unable to establish a satisfactory consumer expenditure
         survey.
     •   National governments can appeal to their business communities to persuade large
         firms producing consumer products to donate their electronic data to the NSO. 54
         Many large retailers around the world are already donating their data and it should
         be possible for more firms to be persuaded to do this. This information will help
         to produce a better CPI and it will also allow much better production accounts to
         be produced.
     •   Credit card companies collect information on household purchases of consumer
         goods and services. If the expenditure information could also be combined with
         product codes, this information would enable the construction of consumer price
         indexes by location and demographic group. For some countries, it may be


54
  Given that national governments are going to be forced to give handouts to a large number of firms,
getting them to cooperate with the government for a good purpose should be possible.
                                                                                                       41

        possible to access this information source. For other countries, it may not be
        possible for the statistical agency to access this information due to privacy
        concerns. 55


7.3 Should the CPI be Revised?


From the materials presented in section 7.2 above, it can be seen that national statistical
agencies will not be able to produce very accurate period t basket updates qbt that
approximate actual period t consumption qt in a timely fashion (if they can produce them
at all). However, in time, better estimates for actual consumption in past periods may
become available. 56 The question then arises: should the CPI be revised in the light of
improved information that becomes available after the release date? From a statistical
point of view, the answer to this question is yes. However, for many countries, a monthly
CPI must be provided to the public and no revisions are allowed. 57


Scanner data along with the usual information on retail sales can be massaged to produce
some rough and ready weights in real time. NSOs will simply have to announce that their
new estimates for inflation and economic growth are only very approximate estimates. A
country’s national accounts are allowed to be revised and this revision process is
generally accepted by the public, hence estimates of economic growth can be revised.
This is not the case for the CPI. A country could produce at least two CPIs: one that is
not revised and is based on available information at the month of production of the index
and another that is allowed to be revised in the light of information that becomes
available at a later date.


This strategy has been successfully used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the US
where two indexes are released at the same time; the first one (“CPI-U”) is not revisable

55
   See Carvalho et al. (2020) and Dunn, Hood, and Driessen (2020) for examples of how such information
can be used to analyze changes in expenditure patterns.
56
   Smoothing a sample of collected monthly household expenditures per household (by taking a moving
average for example) will probably lead to more accurate trend estimates for monthly household
expenditures. But the trend can only be calculated after some months have passed.
57
   This no revision policy is probably due to the fact that the country’s CPI is often used for indexation
purposes in legally binding contracts.
                                                                                          42

and the second one (“C-CPI-U”) is allowed to be revised (and approximates a superlative
index after the last revision). The second CPI can be labeled as an analytic CPI and can
be used by economic analysts who require more accurate historical information on
inflation. The first type of traditional CPI produced under lockdown conditions will
necessarily be much more inaccurate; it will be very difficult to obtain adequate
approximations to actual consumption during the start of the lockdown period due to the
absence of accurate survey information on consumer expenditures. Users need to be
alerted to this problem.


In section 7.2 we attempted to anticipate the problems that many statistical agencies will
face in trying to update their baskets to reflect the lockdown realities. We realize that new
lockdown baskets will not be available to many, if not most, NSOs. Our conclusion boils
down to this: if later information shows that the early lockdown indexes are very
inaccurate, then set the current CPI price level to the best possible estimate possible even
if it is necessary to use a different methodology than was used in the pre-lockdown
periods. For the revisable CPI, new information should be used to revise previous indexes.


7.4 The Stockpiling Problem


Lockdowns have led governments to limit trips to retail outlets for purchases of food and
other essential goods such as pharmaceutical products. These regulations plus the
reactions of households to cut down on their shopping trips to limit the risk of infection
have led households to accumulate large stockpiles of essential storable goods. Thus at
the initial stages of a lockdown, there will be a large increase in purchases of storable
goods but actual consumption of these goods will be far less. In other words, it becomes
necessary to distinguish actual household consumption of storable goods from the
acquisition of the goods. In principle, the national statistical agency will have to decide
between these two approaches to the production of a CPI.


From a welfare point of view, it is monthly consumption of goods and services which is
most relevant but it will generally be more convenient to stick to an acquisitions approach
                                                                                                         43

to the measurement of consumption. If the actual consumption approach to the scope of
the CPI is chosen, then in principle, the stocks of storable items need to be measured at
the beginning and end of each period. 58 If the acquisitions approach to storable goods is
taken, then household purchases of essential storable goods at the beginning of the
lockdown period will be very much larger than pre-lockdown purchases of the same
goods. Once the lockdown has been in place for a month or two, then purchases of
storables should fall back to pre-lockdown levels. But the problem here is that the
assumption of a constant basket equal to a pre-lockdown basket for all post lockdown
periods is going to be a rather poor assumption.


7.5 The Problem of Free Dwelling Rent


As the duration of the lockdown continues, an increasing number of tenants will not be
able to pay their rents. However, due to government regulations or due to the forbearance
of landlords, they will not be evicted. If there is a policy of rent forgiveness, then these
nonpaying tenants are getting free rent. The question for the construction of a CPI is:
what should be done under these circumstances?


Before we answer the above question, it will be useful to look at how rent indexes could
be constructed for CPI purposes if conditions were “normal” with no lockdown. Consider
the case where a rent subindex involves H rental properties; i.e., the target index is a rent
index for H households who are living in rental housing. Typically, since the units of
measurement for these units will be unique (since the location of each rental property is
unique and location is an important rent determining characteristic). Thus suppose that
the observed rents for the H properties in period t are vht > 0 for t = 0,1 and h = 1,...,H.

58
  Real actual consumption of a storable good is equal to beginning of the period inventory stock plus new
purchases of the good less end of period stock of the good. In principle, if actual consumption is the target
concept, then household stocks of storables should be capitalized and added to household wealth. In normal
times, the services provided by these storable stocks probably should not be added to the current flow of
consumption unless one argues that these stocks are desirable in their own right as a form of insurance
against future supply shocks. In times of a pandemic, such an argument seems reasonable. Note that not
recognizing a flow of services from the storables stock is a different treatment from the treatment of the
services that consumer durables provide over their useful lifetime. Stocks of consumer durables should also
be capitalized and added to household wealth but the services that durables render during a month need to
be recognized as part of actual consumption.
                                                                                                    44

We need to decompose these values into price and quantity components. This can be
done as follows: (i) define all period 0 prices for the rental properties equal to 1; (ii) set
the corresponding period 0 quantities qh0 equal to the corresponding period 0 rental
values vh0; (iii) set the corresponding period 1 quantities equal to qh1 ≡ qh0(1−δh) where δh
≥ 0 is the one period depreciation rate or quality adjustment parameter that adjusts the
period 0 quantity qh0 for depreciation of the structure; 59 (iv) the period 1 constant quality
price for the nth rental property ph1 is set equal to actual period 1 rent, vh1, divided by the
corresponding period 1 quantity qh1. Thus we have the following definitions for h =
1,...,H:


(60) ph0 ≡ 1;
(61) qh0 ≡ vh0;
(62) qh1 ≡ qh0(1−δh) = vh0(1−δh);
(63) ph1 ≡ vh1/qh1      = vh1/[vh0(1−δh)].


Using the above assumptions (60)-(63), the Laspeyres and Paasche rent subindexes, PL
and PP, can be written as follows:


(64) PL ≡ Σh=1H ph1qh0/Σh=1H ph0qh0
           = Σh=1H vh1(1−δh)−1/Σh=1H vh0
           = Σh=1H Sh0[vh1(1−δh)−1/vh0] ;


(65) PP ≡ Σh=1H ph1qh1/Σh=1H ph0qh1
           = Σh=1H vh1/Σh=1H vh0(1−δh)
           = {Σh=1H Sh1[vh1(1−δh)−1/vh0]−1}−1


where the period t expenditure share of household h in total household expenditure on
rental housing Sht are defined as follows:

59
  A more complete housing model would decompose the rental price of a dwelling unit into the sum of two
parts: a structure component and a land component. Depreciation would apply only to the structure
component.
                                                                                                              45



(66) Sht ≡ vht/Σi=1H vit ;                                                            t = 0,1 and h = 1,...,H.


PL is a base period share weighted arithmetic average of the depreciation adjusted rent
ratios, vn1(1−δn)−1/vn0, and PP is a current period share weighted harmonic average of the
depreciation adjusted rent ratios. Usually, PP will be less than PL. 60 If the statistical
agency is able to collect data on paid rents and can make estimates for monthly
depreciation rates, then both PL and PP can be constructed and hence our preferred rent
subindex, the Fisher index PF ≡ [PLPP]1/2, can also be constructed.


Suppose household h gets a rent holiday in period 1 so that ph1 = vh1 = 0 but qh1 still
equals qh0(1−δh). We can calculate a reservation price ph1* which will be consistent with
utility maximizing behavior on the part of household h during period 1; see Appendix C
for the relevant methodology. In practice it will typically be difficult to estimate these
reservation prices, but either carry forward prices or inflation adjusted carry forward
prices can be taken as approximate reservation prices. 61


In the case of rental housing, carry forward values from period 0 may provide an
adequate approximation to the period 1 imputed values for rental properties that are
available at no charge. If property h is rented at a zero price for period 1, define the prices
and quantities for periods 0 and 1 using the assumption vh1 = vh0 as follows:


(67) ph0 ≡ 1; qh0 ≡ vh0; qh1 ≡ qh0(1−δh) = vh0(1−δh); ph1 ≡ vh0/qh1 = (1−δh)−1.




60
   If rents are equal for the two periods so that vh1 = vh0 for h = 1,...,H, then the expenditure shares will also
satisfy Sh1 = Sh0 for h = 1,...,H and by Schlömilch’s inequality, PP ≤ PL; see Hardy, Littlewood and Polya
(1934; 26).
61
   Appendix C also addresses the problems that arise if a partial rent payment is made under the assumption
that the remaining rent owed is forgiven. If instead, the unpaid portion of rent is merely deferred, then the
analysis of this situation is much more complex: should the deferred rent be added to the regular rent
payment in a future period when the deferred rent is paid back to the landlord? Or will it be necessary to
create a new category in the System of National Accounts that keeps track of these deferred rent liabilities?
                                                                                                          46

If all H properties had rent forgiveness in period 1, the Laspeyres and Paasche price
indexes would take the following form using the carry forward values for the imputed
period 1 values of rental services: 62


(68) PL ≡ Σh=1H ph1qh0/Σh=1H ph0qh0
         = Σh=1H Sh0(1−δh)−1
         >1;


(69) PP ≡ Σh=1H ph1qh1/Σh=1H ph0qh1
         = {Σh=1H Sh1[vh1(1−δh)−1/vh0]−1}−1
         = {Σh=1H Sh1(1−δh)}−1                                            using vh1 = vh0 for h = 1,...,H
         > 1.


Thus using carry forward values as imputed values for free rental housing in period 1
leads to Laspeyres and Paasche indexes which are greater than 1. It is the depreciation of
the structure portion of rents that leads to this result. 63


7.6 How Should Scanner Data be Combined with Web Scraped Data?


Many statistical agencies now have access to scanner data from some retailers. How
exactly should the indexes which are generated by the use of these data be combined with
traditional price data collected by statistical agency employees or by the use of web
scraped data?


In general, it is preferable if the contribution of these two sources of price data be
combined in an index which weights the prices according to their economic importance;

62
   It is also the case that under the assumption that vh1 = vh0 for h = 1,...,H, we have PL > PP > 1. Thus the
more appropriate Fisher index will lie between PL and PP.
63
   It will not be easy to determine appropriate depreciation rates because the ratio of land to structure will
differ across various types of rental property. Hedonic regression techniques can be used to determine
appropriate depreciation rates; see Diewert, de Haan and Hendricks (2015), Diewert and Shimizu (2015)
(2017) and Diewert, Nishimura, Shimizu and Watanabe (2020). The hedonic regression techniques used in
these papers can be used to provide decompositions of rent into land and structure components and they
also provide estimates for structure depreciation rates.
                                                                                                      47

i.e., to their shares of expenditure in the elementary category under consideration. It is not
a problem to calculate expenditure shares for the scanner data but the web scraped data
will not come with the associated expenditure data and so weighting the two sources of
data by their relative quantities or expenditure shares will not be possible. In the end,
some rough explicit or implicit estimate of the relative economic importance of the two
sources of data will have to be made. Area specialists in NSOs will have to provide
approximate weights for each elementary category that uses the two sources of
information.


8. Conclusion


The current pandemic conditions have never been experienced since the establishment of
modern economic statistics, hence responses to ensure the continued production of high
quality economic statistics on key variables in these conditions have not previously been
rigorously laid out.


The current recommended approaches for dealing with products disappearing due to
lockdowns or consumers stockpiling draw on the standard response to disappearing
products in any period. That is, the advice is essentially to continue with current practice
as if nothing has happened, using imputed prices for missing goods and expenditure
weights from a pre-lockdown period. For example, Eurostat advice for construction of the
Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) includes the following: 64
     1. “The HICP weights are updated at the beginning of each year and are kept
        constant throughout the year. Thus, the weights will not change this year as a
        result of the impact of the COVID-19 on expenditures.”
     2. All sub-indices for the product classifications “will be compiled even when for
        some categories no products are available on the market.”




64
  The HICP is the European Union’s standardised measure of consumer price inflation that each member
country must construct. See Appendix C for an extended quote of the advice, along with information on the
recommendations from the IMF, UNECE and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
                                                                                                        48

We have demonstrated that following the advice on price imputations will lead to
overstated estimates of changes in real consumption and understated estimates of changes
in the cost of living. We have pointed out the problems of using expenditure weights
which are irrelevant for the periods under consideration. In addition, we have considered
a range of other difficult measurement problems that arise, such as how to deal with “rent
holidays”.


Three steps that NSOs can take to provide as much information as possible on price
indexes during a time of lockdown are:
     1. Collect whatever prices are available, including from non-traditional sources. For
        missing prices, use inflation adjusted carry forward prices. 65
     2. Urgently start a program to obtain current expenditure weights for the
        consumption basket.
     3. Produce a revisable CPI as an analytical series that can be updated as new
        methodology is developed and new data sources are exploited.


The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) approach to dealing with the coronavirus
pandemic is very much in line with the approach advocated in this paper; 66 i.e., statistical
agencies need to move away from a fixed basket Lowe index and attempt to produce
approximations to Laspeyres and Paasche indexes (and hence Fisher indexes) 67 so that
consumer price inflation is measured by an index that is relevant to current consumer
expenditure patterns. The example set by the BLS shows that it is not impossible to
produce household expenditure information in real time. Given that lockdown conditions
may apply in varying degrees for up to 18 months, it is important to have information on
current period household expenditure patterns so that meaningful estimates of consumer
price inflation can be produced during the lockdown periods.




65
   While we favour using reservation prices, we acknowledge that currently it is unlikely that NSOs will be
able to estimate these in a timely fashion.
66
   See Appendix C for more on their recommendations.
67
   The production of approximate Walsh or Törnqvist indexes as alternatives to the Fisher index is also
possible. Note that the BLS produces an approximation to the Törnqvist index in real time.
                                                                                          49

It is unlikely that expenditure patterns will revert to the pattern that prevailed in periods
just before the first lockdown period. Hence the argument that inflation adjusted carry
forward pricing will produce an accurate index when the lockdown period ends is
dubious. But what is clear is that the use of adjusted carry forward prices will not produce
an accurate CPI within the lockdown period. New basket information is required in order
to produce a meaningful CPI within the lockdown period. Thus establishing a continuous
consumer expenditure survey is key to producing a meaningful CPI during these
turbulent times.
                                                                                                   50


Appendix A: Eurostat, IMF, UNECE and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Advice


National and international statistical agencies are attempting to provide advice to national
price statisticians on how to construct a CPI under lockdown conditions. Below, we give
a sampling of this advice.


Here is the advice from Eurostat to European Union countries on how to calculate the
EU’s Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP):


“The compilation of the HICP in the context of the COVID-19 crisis is guided by the following
three principles:


    •   Stability of the HICP weights,
    •   Compilation of indices covering the full structure of the European version of the
        Classification of Individual Consumption According to Purpose (ECOICOP),
    •   Minimizing the number of imputed prices and sub-indices.


The first principle ensures that there will be no change in the sub-index weights used in the
compilation of the HICP during the year, which is the standard practice. The HICP sub-indices
are aggregated using weights reflecting the household consumption expenditure patterns of the
previous year. The HICP weights are updated at the beginning of each year and are kept constant
throughout the year. Thus, the weights will not change this year as a result of the impact of the
COVID-19 on expenditures.


The second principle means that all sub-indices for the full ECOICOP structure will be compiled
even when for some categories no products are available on the market. In such cases, prices do
not exist and they should be replaced with imputed prices. Sub-indices consisting of both
imputations and observed prices should be compiled and aggregated using the standard HICP
compilation procedures.


Finally, the third principle underlines the idea that, whenever possible, missing price observations
should be replaced by price quotes obtained from other sources. Price collection can fail because
of restrictions that do not allow price collectors to visit sampled outlets, because outlets have been
                                                                                                  51

closed down or because it is impossible to offer certain services (e.g. flights). Possible sources to
replace the missing prices in case manual price collection activities are restricted are the
following:


    •   Outlets’ websites,
    •   Telephone and email enquiries.


Some NSIs may also have access to scanner data that, although not yet integrated into the HICP
production system, could be used for the replacement of the missing prices. However, the
replacements using scanner data should be done with care as this could entail a change of outlet
to a different category or market segment.”               Eurostat (2020).


Thus the Eurostat advice boils down to carry on as if nothing has happened; i.e., keep the
existing fixed basket methodology, use web scraped or telephone interview price data to
replace previously personally collected data and if a consumption category disappears
due to shut down restrictions, use carry forward imputed prices. This goes against the
conclusions of this paper, but the Eurostat advice is understandable. In the short run, it is
impossible for Eurostat to change their methodology to a variable basket approach. Thus
the hope is probably that the lockdown period will be brief and when economies return to
“normal”, the fixed basket approach will again be satisfactory and the use of the old fixed
basket and imputation methods will enable price comparisons with the pre-lockdown
period to be reasonably accurate.


Here is the advice from the UNECE:


“Price collection may be restricted due to closed outlets or price collectors may not be allowed to
work or enter outlets. It may also be that outlets do not provide the usual set of prices through
other channels (e.g. on paper or via e-mail) and/or there may be shortage of staff in the main
office to receive and process the prices that are received. Alternative modes of price collection
include telephone, e-mail, online prices and scanner data. However, it may be difficult to ensure a
minimum coverage of all products (goods and services). In particular, this may be the case for
products for which price collectors usually collect prices. This could, for example, be the case for
                                                                                                52

clothing and fresh food in many countries. In such cases the statistical office may have to rely on
collecting a minimum of prices for the most important or the most representative products.


Compilation


For imputation of observations the general recommendation is to follow a bottom-up approach.
This means that the first choice is to impute missing prices with observed price developments of
similar products or products that are expected to have similar price developments. If such product
prices are not available, the next choice will be to impute the missing prices with the average
price development of the product group or the elementary aggregate to which the product belong.
If these are not available, the closest available higher-level price index should be used for the
imputation.


In some instances it may not be possible to collect prices for specific product groups or
elementary aggregates or even indices above the elementary aggregate level. In such cases the
price development of the product group or the elementary aggregate may be imputed by the price
development of similar product groups or elementary aggregates. If this is not possible, the price
development may be imputed by the higher-level index in which the product group or the
elementary aggregate enters. However, imputation of a missing elementary aggregate by the
overall CPI may also be justified. This corresponds to leaving the elementary aggregate out of the
calculation of the CPI. This may be the preferred option if households' expenditures on an
elementary aggregate is assessed to be zero or close to zero. In some countries this may be the
case for e.g. international travels, domestic airline travels, child care and sports and cultural
events.


These are general recommendations. National circumstances and knowledge of the developments
for particular markets and products must be considered. In all cases, it is important to apply
imputation methods that ensure the index reaches the correct level when again it becomes
possible to collect prices and include them in the index.”            UNECE (2020)


The advice from the UNECE is similar to the advice from Eurostat but the last sentence
in the above quotation provides an explicit explanation for the carry on as usual
methodology; i.e., when things return to “normal”, the post lockdown CPI indexes will be
comparable to the pre-lockdown CPI index.
                                                                                                    53



Here is the advice from the International Monetary Fund:


“When facing increased numbers of missing prices, it is important to remind that all temporarily
missing prices should be imputed using one of the methods described in Consumer Price Index
Manual: Concepts and Methods. As noted in the Manual, carrying forward, or repeating the last
available price, should be avoided as it introduces a downward bias into the index. The
imputation techniques described in the Manual do not introduce bias into the index. Imputations
are self-correcting, which means that once a price can be collected, the index returns to the
correct level. This is important so that the CPI continues to provide a reliable estimate of price
change. The CPI is a critical input to economic policy making, particularly during periods of
economic uncertainty.


If an entire index is missing, it is recommended to use the next level up in aggregation as the
basis for making the imputation. For example, if all prices for oranges are missing, the index for
citrus fruits can be used as the basis for making the imputation. If all citrus fruits are missing, the
index for fruits is used as the basis for making the imputation. If all fruits are missing, the index
for fruits and vegetables is used. If fruits and vegetables are missing, the index for food is used. If
the index for food is missing, the index for food and non-alcoholic beverages is used. Finally, if
all food and non-alcoholic beverages is missing, the All Items index is used as the basis to impute.
...
Users will continue to need data at the most detailed level. All indexes should continue to be
published, even if they are imputed. As noted previously, all imputed indexes should be flagged
and clearly noted for users. It is important for transparency that users are able to access the full
set of data that are normally disseminated.”
                                                                                         IMF (2020)


The above advice is in line with the guidance provided by Eurostat and the UNECE. It is
more explicit in one respect in that it rules out simple carry forward pricing and endorses
inflation adjusted carry forward prices. We also endorse inflation adjusted carry forward
prices over the use of carry forward prices.
                                                                                                  54

Finally, here is some information on how the US Bureau of Labor Statistics is planning to
produce its CPI under current conditions:


“How are prices collected for the CPI? Price data used to calculate the CPI are primarily
provided by two different surveys that are administered continuously each month:
    •   Commodities and Services Pricing Survey, an establishment survey of businesses selling
        goods and services to consumers, used to provide the price data for the CPI.
    •   Housing Survey, a survey of landlords and tenants used to provide rent data for CPI’s
        shelter indexes.
Survey operations for CPI pricing surveys may be affected by limitations on data-collection staff,
the availability of survey respondents, and the availability of items. Note that CPI data are
collected throughout the entire month. Specifically, any given price in the CPI sample is collected
in one of three defined pricing periods, corresponding roughly to the first 10, second 10, and final
10 days of the month. BLS uses several data-collection modes for CPI surveys that include
telephone, internet, and automated electronic data capture. However, the majority of data are
collected by personal visit. About 65 percent of CPI price data and 50 percent of CPI rent data are
typically collected by personal visit. This type of collection has been suspended since March 16,
2020. (It was suspended on March 5th in the Seattle area.)


What happens if BLS cannot collect CPI data? The percentage of prices in the CPI sample
that may be unavailable, either because the outlet is closed or the item is out of stock, is expected
to increase. When BLS cannot obtain a price either because of data-collection limitations or the
item being unavailable, it will generally be considered “temporarily unavailable.” The CPI
program has specific procedures for handling temporarily unavailable prices. Missing prices are
generally imputed by the prices that are collected in the same or similar geographic area and item
category. Essentially, the price movement of items that are not collected is estimated to be the
same as those that are collected for a given item and geographic area.


Will data collection for CPI expenditure weights be affected? The Consumer
Expenditure Survey (CE), a household survey capturing consumer spending data, is used to
calculate relative importances (weights) of goods and services in the CPI market basket. CE in-
person data collection ceased on March 19, 2020. CE data are collected by the U.S. Census
Bureau through an agreement with BLS. The Census Bureau is transitioning to collecting these
                                                                                                 55

data through telephone. Changes to CE survey operations will not have an immediate impact on
CPI data, but may have long-term impacts. These weights are used in the chained CPI index (C-
CPI-U). The March 2020 weights will be incorporated in the final March 2020 chained CPI
indexes, which are released in February 2021. BLS also incorporates the CE weights in an annual
weight update to the CPI-U and CPI-W indexes. These weight updates will be effective with the
January 2022 indexes, released in February 2022. BLS is working on mitigation strategies to
reduce measurement error of CPI weights caused by a potential loss of CE survey data.


Under what circumstances would some data not be published? A CPI index is not
published if it fails a data-quality standard known as an adequacy ratio. Specifically, if BLS fails
to collect at least one price in a geographic area that account for more than half the geographic
weight of the index, the index is not published. Even in months without disruptions, some minor
indexes with small samples occasionally fail this standard and are not published. (One example
is Repair of household items.) Data-collection disruptions would have to be extremely severe
for major CPI indexes not to be published based on this standard. Data-collection disruptions may
be more severe in some area than others, and it is possible that some data for metro areas may fail
data quality-standards and not be published. BLS will continue to monitor data-collection
disruptions.”                                 Bureau of Labor Statistics (2020)


The BLS approach to dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic is very much in line with the
approach advocated in this paper.


Appendix B: Measuring Real Consumption when there are only Two Commodities


We show that the bias in a CPI that uses inflation adjusted carry forward prices will
produce an inflation estimate for the first shut down period that is too low as compared to
a cost of living index that uses reservation prices for the commodities that are not
available. The companion estimate of real consumption (or welfare) that uses a Lowe
index to deflate nominal household expenditures into an estimate for real consumption
will be too high.
                                                                                                      56

It may be useful for many readers to have a figure which can explain the underlying
index number theory in a relatively simple way. In this Appendix we consider the case
where M = 1 and N = 1; i.e., we have only one continuing commodity q and one
unavailable commodity Q.


We assume that the household or group of households have preferences that can be
represented by the utility function, f(q,Q), which is linearly homogeneous, increasing and
concave in q,Q. The dual unit cost function for this utility function is c(p,P) where p and
P are the positive prices for a unit of q and Q respectively. 68


The observed quantity data for periods 0 and 1 are (q0,Q0) and (q1,Q1). The observed
price data for period 0 are (p0,P0) but for period 1, only the price for a unit of the
continuing commodity is observed, p1 > 0; the price for the unavailable commodity is the
Hicksian reservation price P1* > 0. We assume that Q1 is equal to 0:


(B1) Q1 = 0.


The period t utility level attained by the household is denoted by ut for t = 0,1. We have
the following definitions:


(B2) u0 ≡ f(q0,Q0) > 0; u1 ≡ f(q1,0) > 0.


Denote the observed expenditure on consumer goods and services in period t by vt. We
have the following definitions:


(B3) v0 ≡ p0q0 + P0Q0 ;
(B4) v1 ≡ p1q1 + P1*Q1
        = p1q1                                                                using assumption (B1).

68
  The function c(p,P) is defined as c(p,P) ≡ min q,Q {pq + PQ : f(q,Q) ≥ 1 ; q ≥ 0, Q ≥ 0}. The unit cost
function is also increasing, linearly homogeneous and concave in p and P. We assume that it is also
differentiable. For the early history of duality theory and its application to index number theory, see
Diewert (1974) (1976) (2020a).
                                                                                                        57



When the economic approach to index number theory is used, it is assumed that observed
expenditures on consumer goods and services is equal to the minimum cost of achieving
the utility level for the period under consideration. Using this approach we have the
following equalities:


(B5) v0 = c(p0,P0)f(q0,Q0) = c(p0,P0)u0 ;
(B6) v1 = c(p1,P1*)f(q1,Q1) = c(p1,P1*)f(q1,0) = c(p1,P1*)u1.


Let c1(p,P) denote the partial derivative of c(p,P) with respect to p; i.e., c1(p,P) ≡
∂c(p,P)/∂p and c2(p,P) ≡ ∂c(p,P)/∂P. The assumption of cost minimizing behavior on the
part of households along with Shephard’s Lemma implies that the following relationships
will hold: 69


(B7) q0 = c1(p0,P0)u0 ;
(B8) Q0 = c2(p0,P0)u0 ;
(B9) q1 = c1(p1,P1*)u1 ;
(B10) Q1 = c2(p1,P1*)u1
           =0                                                                   using assumption (B1).


Suppose the household spent all of its period t expenditure on consumer goods and
services, vt, on purchases of the continuing commodity q. Denote this period t
hypothetical expenditure on purchases of q by qte, the budgetary equivalent expenditure
on the always available commodity. We have the following definitions:


(B11) q0e ≡ v0/p0
           = [p0q0 + P0Q0]/p0                                                                using (B3)

  See Shephard (1953; 11) or Diewert (2020a; 11). Shephard’s Lemma implies that the consumer demand
functions, q(u,p,P) and Q(u,p,P), regarded as functions of the consumer’s utility level u and the prices, p
and P that the consumer faces, are equal to q(u,p,P) = c1(p,P)u and Q(u,p,P) = c2(p,P)u. Hicks (1946; 311-
331) introduced this type of demand function into the economics literature and so these functions are
known as Hicksian demand functions. They can be estimated using econometric techniques; see Diewert
and Feenstra (2019).
                                                                                          58

          = q0 + [P0/p0]Q0.


(B12) q1e ≡ v1/p1
          = p1q1/p1                                                              using (B4)
          = q1.


Since there are no purchases of the unavailable commodity in period 1, q1e turns out to
equal the observed consumption of the continuing commodity, which is q1.


The minimum cost of achieving the utility level u0 if the consumer faced the prices of
period 1, p1 and P1*, is c(p1,P1*)u0. Since f(q0,Q0) equals u0, we see that (q0,Q0) is a
feasible solution for this cost minimization problem and hence we have the following
inequality:


(B13) c(p1,P1*)u0 ≤ p1q0 + P1*Q0.


Similarly, the minimum cost of achieving the utility level u1 if the consumer faced the
prices of period 0, p0 and P0, is c(p0,P0)u1. Since f(q1,Q1) = f(q1,0) equals u1, we see that
(q1,0) is a feasible solution for this cost minimization problem and hence we have the
following inequality:


(B14) c(p0,P0)u1 ≤ p0q1 + P0Q1 = p0q1.


Now convert the hypothetical expenditures c(p1,P1*)u0 into purchases of q using the price
of the continuing commodity for period 1, p1, to obtain the hypothetical quantity q0*:


(B15) q0* ≡ c(p1,P1*)u0/p1
          ≤ [p1q0 + P1*Q0]/p1                                                   using (B13)
          = q0 + [P1*/p1]Q0
          ≡ q0e*
                                                                                                       59

where q0e* converts the period 0 purchases Q0 of the disappearing commodity into
equivalent amounts of the continuing commodity using the relative prices of period 1 and
adds this amount to the period 0 actual purchases of the continuing commodity q0. 70


Convert the hypothetical expenditures c(p0,P0)u1 into purchases of q using the price of the
continuing commodity for period 0, p0, to obtain the hypothetical quantity q1*:


(B16) q1* ≡ c(p0,P0)u1/p0
           ≤ p0q1/p0                                                                       using (B14)
           = q1 .


Suppose that the consumption vectors, (q0,Q0) and (q1,Q1) are given for periods 0 and 1
along with a household utility function, f(q,Q). Define the period 0 and 1 utility levels by
u0 ≡ f(q0,Q0) and u1 ≡ f(q1,Q1). Finally, suppose that the reference prices p > 0 and P > 0
are given. The family of Allen quantity indexes, 71 QA(p,P,u0,u1), is defined as follows:


(B17) QA(p,P,u0,u1) ≡ C(u1,p,P)/C(u0,p,P)


where C(u,p,P) is the household’s minimum cost of achieving the utility level u if it faces
the prices p,P. Since we have assumed that the utility function is linearly homogeneous, 72
the consumer’s total cost or expenditure function, C(u,p,P), factors into the product of the
unit cost function, c(p,P) times the utility level u; i.e., we have C(u,p,P) = c(p,P)u. If we
substitute this factorization of the cost function into definition (B17), we find that the
Allen quantity index collapses down to the utility ratio, u1/u0; i.e., we have the following
equality for all choices of the reference prices, p and P:


(B18) QA(p,P,u0,u1) ≡ C(u1,p,P)/C(u0,p,P)

70
   The hypothetical quantity q0e* is useful when we define the Paasche quantity index; see Figure 1 below.
71
   Each choice of p and P generates a possibly different Allen quantity index that measures aggregate
quantity change between periods 0 and 1. The definition of the Allen (1949) quantity index provides a
useful way to cardinalize a measure of consumer utility.
72
   In the economics literature, the assumption of a linearly homogeneous utility function is sometimes
called the assumption of homothetic preferences.
                                                                                         60

                          = c(p,P)u1/c(p,P)u0
                          = u1/u0.


Equations (B18) can be used to obtain alternative ways of estimating the Allen quantity
index under our assumptions. These alternative expressions for u1/u0 can be illustrated by
looking at Figure 1 below. Our first alternative way of expressing the utility ratio uses
(B18) as follows:


(B19) u1/u0 = c(p0,P0)u1/c(p0,P0)u0
              = p0q1*/[p0q0 + P0Q0]                            using (B3), (B5) and (B16)
              = q1*/[q0 + (P0/p0)Q0]
              = q1*/q0e                                        using (B11).


Our second alternative way of expressing the utility ratio uses (B18) as follows:


(B20) u1/u0 = c(p1,P1*)u1/c(p1,P1*)u0
              = p1q1/p1q0*                                     using (B3), (B5) and (B15)
              = q1/q0*.


The alternative quantities of the continuing commodity defined above, q0, q1, q0*, q1*, q0e,
q1e and q0e*, are all illustrated in Figure 1.


The ingredients that go into the construction of the Laspeyres and Paasche quantity
indexes can also be illustrated in Figure 1. The Laspeyres quantity index, QL, is defined
as follows:


(B21) QL ≡ [p0q1 + P0Q1]/[p0q0 + P0Q0]
           = p0q1/[p0q0 + P0Q0]                                        using (B1), Q1 = 0
           = sq0[q1/q0]                                                 where sq0 ≡ p0q0/v0
           = q1/[q0 + (P0/p0) Q0]
           = q1/q0e                                                    using (B15)
                                                                                                           61


             ≥ q1*/q0e                                                                using (B16)
             = u1/u0                                                                   using (B19).


Hence the Allen quantity index (equal to the utility ratio, u1/u0) is bounded from above by
the ordinary Laspeyres quantity index QL. In Figure 1, QL is equal to q1/q0e and u1/u0 is
equal to q1*/q0e. QL will typically have a large upward bias relative to the true Allen index
under our assumptions.


The Paasche quantity index, QP*, is defined as follows: 73


(B22) QP* ≡ [p1q1 + P1*Q1]/[p1q0 + P1*Q0]
             = p1q1/[p1q0 + P1*Q0]                                                     using (B1), Q1 = 0
             = q1/[q0 + (P1*/p1) Q0]
             = q1/q0e*                                                                 using (B15)
             ≤ q1/q0*                                                                  using (B15)
             = u1/u0                                                                   using (B20).


Hence the Allen quantity index is bounded from below by the ordinary Paasche quantity
index QP*. In Figure 1, QP* is equal to q1/q0e* and u1/u0 is equal to q1/q0*. It can be seen
that QP* is well below the true utility ratio, u1/u0 = q1/q0*, since q0e* is well above q0*. It
can also be seen that QL = q1/q0e is well above u1/u0 = q1/q0* since q0e is well below q0*. 74




73
   We attach an asterisk to PP because we require an estimate for the period 1 reservation price, P1*, in order
to evaluate the index using observable data.
74
   Figure 1 uses the preferences of period 0 to illustrate the decline in real consumption. If we used the
preferences of the household for period 1, then the change in real consumption can be measured by the
utility ratio f(q1,0)/f(q0,0) = q1/q0 using the linear homogeneity of f(q,Q). For the example illustrated in
Figure 1, we see that q1/q0 > 1. Thus using the post lockdown preferences, we have a utility increase
whereas using the pre-lockdown preferences, we have u1/u0 = f(q1,0)/f(q0,Q0) < 1, a utility decrease. This
illustrates the need for more than one CPI and more than one estimate for real consumption growth as we
transition from the pre-lockdown situation to the lockdown situation.
                                                                                             62


                Figure 1: Welfare Measurement in the Two Good Case




There are two sets of three parallel lines in Figure 1. The slope of the red straight line that
is tangent to the period 0 indifference curve at (q0,Q0) is equal to −P0/p0 while the slope
of the black straight line that is tangent to the period 1 indifference curve at (q1,0) is equal
to −P1*/p1. Note that P1*/p1 > P0/p0, which reflects that the (imputed) market clearing
price for the unavailable commodity in period 1, P1*, is much greater than the inflation
adjusted carry forward price for the unavailable good, (p1/p0)P0. However, if q and Q are
perfect substitutes, then the period 0 indifference curve will coincide with the straight line
(this line represents the period 0 budget constraint of the household) that is tangent to the
period 0 indifference curve. In this case, it can be seen that q0e will coincide with q0* and
                                                                                                          63

q0e* while q1 will coincide with q1*. In this case, the Allen quantity index, u1/u0 will be
equal to QL, QP* and QF*.


In the perfect substitutes case, the household utility function is equal to the linear
function, f(q,Q) ≡ αqq + αQQ where αq and αQ are positive constants that reflect the
relative utility to the household for the consumption of a unit of each commodity. The
Allen quantity index, u1/u0, is then equal to [αqq1 + αQQ1]/[αqq0 + αQQ0]. The
corresponding consumer price index is equal to [v1/v0]/[u1/u0] which in turn is equal to
[v1/v0]/[(αqq1 + αQQ1)/(αqq0 + αQQ0)] = [v1/(αqq1 + αQQ1)]/[v0/(αqq0 + αQQ0)] = vα1/vα0
where the period t quality adjusted unit value is defined as vαt ≡ vt/(αqqt + αQQt) for t =
0,1. Thus in the perfect substitutes case, the Allen quantity index is equal to a quality
adjusted unit value index, which can readily be calculated provided that estimates for αq
and αQ are available. A simple choice for the α’s is to set them equal to the
corresponding base period prices; i.e., set αq = p0 and αQ = P0. In this case, the quality
adjusted unit value index collapses down to the Paasche price PP which will be defined
below by (B36).


The point of this digression into quality adjusted unit value indexes is that this type of
index can be readily implemented by statistical agencies without having to do any
econometric estimation 75 and this type of index is perfectly acceptable even under
lockdown conditions, provide that the group of products under consideration are close
substitutes so that the household indifference surfaces for these products are close to
being parallel planes. Thus the indifference curves in Figure 1 as drawn are applicable at
higher levels of aggregation where the product groups under consideration are not close
substitutes. In this case, it will be necessary to estimate reservation prices in order to

75
  Econometric estimation may lead to improved estimates for the α’s. For example, suppose the statistical
agency has information on the unit value prices for N highly substitutable commodities prevailing in a
number of past periods. Denote the price vector for period t as pt ≡ [p1t,...,pNt] for t = 1,...,T. Then a
reasonable estimator for the vector of quality adjustment factors is α ≡ (1/T) Σt=1T (p1t)−1pt; i.e., take the
arithmetic average of past vectors of normalized product prices where the normalized vector of prices for
period t is the period t vector of prices pt divided by the price of the numeraire product 1. The numeraire
product should be chosen to be the product with the largest average share of expenditures on the N products.
As another example where econometrics can play an important role in estimating the α’s, we note that most
hedonic regression models can be interpreted as additive utility models; see Diewert (2020d).
                                                                                            64

approximate a cost of living index. If the products are close substitutes, then the
indifference curves should be drawn as curves that are almost straight lines. In this case,
quality adjusted unit values could be used instead of attempting to estimate preferences
so that reservation prices can be calculated.


From (B21), it can be seen that QL is equal to the following observable expressions:


(B23) QL = q1/[q0 + (P0/p0) Q0]
          = q1/[q0 + (P0Q0)/p0]
          = q1/[v0/p0]
          = [v1/p1]/[v0/p0]
          = [v1/v0]/[p1/p0].


Thus period 1 aggregate Laspeyres real consumption can be set equal to q1 and period 0
aggregate Laspeyres real consumption can be set equal to q0 + (P0/p0) Q0 which is equal
to q0 + v0/p0 which in turn is equal to period 0 real consumption of continuing
commodities, q0, plus the value of period 0 consumption of disappearing commodities
due to shutdowns, v0, deflated by the period 0 price level for continuing commodities, p0.
The final equality in (B23) is also useful; it shows that QL is equal to the value ratio, v1/v0,
divided by the consumer price index for the continuing commodity, p1/p0.


From (B22), it can be seen that QP* is equal to the following expression (which cannot be
evaluated unless an estimate for the reservation price P1* is available):


(B24) QP* = q1/[q0 + (P1*/p1) Q0].


Note the similarity of this expression for QP* to the decomposition of QL given by the
first equality in (B23): the price ratio for soon to be unavailable products to the price of
continuing products in period 0, P0/p0, that is used in (B22) is replaced by the reservation
price for unavailable products to the price of continuing products in period 1, P1*/p1.
                                                                                        65

The inflation adjusted carry forward price for unavailable products in period 1, P1A, is
defined as follows:


(B25) P1A ≡ (p1/p0)P0.


The approximate Paasche quantity index that results if we use P1A in place of the true
reservation price P1* is QPA defined as follows:


(B26) QPA ≡ q1/[q0 + (P1A/p1) Q0]
           = q1/[q0 + (P0/p0) Q0]                                            using (B25)
           = QL                                                              using (B23)
           ≥ u1/u0                                                           using (B21).


Thus using inflation adjusted prices in our highly simplified model leads to an
approximation to the Paasche quantity index that is exactly equal to the observable
Laspeyres quantity index defined by (B21). Typically, the strict inequality will hold in
(B26) so both QL and QPA will have upward biases as compared to the economic Allen
index, u1/u0.


Using definition (B21), we have the following alternative way of expressing QL:


(B27) QL ≡ [p0q1 + P0Q1]/[p0q0 + P0Q0]
           = p0q1/[p0q0 + P0Q0]                                       using (B1), Q1 = 0
           = p0q0[q1/q0]/v0                                           using (B3)
           = sq0[q1/q0]


where sq0 ≡ p0q0/v0 is the expenditure share of the continuing commodity in period 0.


Using definition (B22), we have the following alternative way of expressing QP*:


(B28) QP* ≡ [p1q1 + P1Q1]/[p1q0 + P1*Q0]
                                                                                                             66

             = p1q1/[p1q0 + P1*Q0]                                                      using Q1 = 0
             = p1q1/[(p1/p0)p0q0 + (P1*/P0)P0Q0]
             = [p1q1/v0]/[(p1/p0)(p0q0/v0) + (P1*/P0)(P0Q0/v0)]
             = [p1q1/p0q0][p0q0/v0]/[(p1/p0)sq0 + (P1*/P0)sQ0]
             = [p1/p0][q1/q0]sq0/[(p1/p0)sq0 + (P1*/P0)sQ0]
             = sq0[q1/q0]/{sq0 + sQ0[(P1*/P0)/(p1/p0)]}


where sQ0 ≡ P0Q0/v0 is the period 0 expenditure share of the commodity which will
disappear in period 1. If P1*/P0 > p1/p0, then QP* < sq0[q1/q0] = QL. 76


From (B21) and (B22), we see that relative to the true index, u1/u0, QL has an upward bias
and QP* has a downward bias. This suggests that taking an average of QL and QP* would
lead to an index which could provide a closer approximation to the true index. Define the
Fisher (1922) quantity index, QF*, as the geometric mean of QL and QP*:


(B29) QF* ≡ [QLQP*]1/2
             = {[[sq0(q1/q0)]2/[sq0 + sQ0[(P1*/P0)/(p1/p0)]]}1/2                   using (B27) and (B28)
             = sq0(q1/q0)/{sq0 + sQ0[(P1*/P0)/(p1/p0)]}1/2
             = QL/{sq0 + sQ0[(P1*/P0)/(p1/p0)]}1/2                                 using (B27)
             = QL/m(ρ)


where


(B30)      ρ ≡ (P1*/P0)/(p1/p0) and
(B31) m(ρ) ≡ [sq0 + sQ0ρ]1/2.




76
   The economic approach to index number theory will always imply that P1*/P0 ≥ p1/p0 or P1* ≥ (p1/p0)P0
which is the inflation adjusted carry forward price for the disappearing product. The economic approach is
consistent with P1* = (p1/p0)P0 but this equality will hold only if the consumer’s indifference curves are
parallel straight lines so that q and Q are perfect substitutes after quality adjustment. The perfect substitutes
condition is unlikely to hold under a widespread lockdown.
                                                                                                             67


Thus ρ is a relative inflation rate; it is the price index for locked out commodities, P1*/P0,
divided by the price index for always available commodities, p1/p0, and m(ρ) is the
square root of the weighted mean of 1 and ρ, where the weights are the base period
expenditure shares, sq0 for 1 and sQ0 for ρ. Thus if ρ > 1, then the weighted mean of 1 and
ρ will be greater than 1 and thus the square root of this weighted mean will also be
greater than 1 and thus QF* will be less than the Laspeyres quantity index, QL. If ρ = 1,
then m(ρ) = 1 and QF* = QL.


It is useful to provide an additive approximation to m(ρ). It can be seen that m(ρ) can be
interpreted as the geometric mean of 1 and the function sq0 + sQ0ρ. An approximation to
this geometric mean is the corresponding arithmetic mean. Thus we have the following
approximation to m(ρ): 77


(B32) m(ρ) ≈ (½)(1) + (½)(sq0 + sQ0ρ) = (½)[1 + sq0] + (½)sQ0ρ.


Using (B29) and (B32), we have the following approximation to the Fisher quantity
index:


(B33) QF* ≈ sq0(q1/q0)/(½){[1 + sq0] + [sQ0(P1*/P0)/(p1/p0)]}.


Up to this point, we have assumed that the household’s utility function, f(q,Q) was
linearly homogeneous, increasing and concave. If we are willing to assume that f(q,Q)
has a certain functional form, then it can be shown that the Fisher quantity index QF*
defined by (B29) is exactly equal to the true Allen quantity index, u1/u0, under the
assumption that the household utility function has this certain functional form 78 and the


77
   The first order Taylor series approximation to m(ρ) around the point ρ = 1 is also equal to the right hand
side of (A32). If ρ = 1, then the right hand side of (A32) is also equal to 1; if ρ > 1, then the right hand side
of (A32) is also greater than 1.
78
   This functional form is f(q,Q) ≡ [a11q2 + 2a12qQ + a22Q2]1/2. The parameters for this function are the aij.
These parameters must satisfy some restrictions in order to satisfy the concavity and monotonicity
conditions for f(q,Q). These conditions are described in Diewert (1976), Diewert and Hill (2010) and
Diewert and Feenstra (2019). This functional form is flexible; i.e., it can approximate an arbitrary linearly
                                                                                                     68


household is minimizing the cost of achieving the utility level u1 ≡ f(q1,0) in period 1 and
the utility level u0 ≡ f(q0,Q0) in period 0. Thus under the assumption that f(q,Q) has the
required functional form, we have the following exact equality:


(B34) u1/u0 = QF* = [QLQP*]1/2.


It is useful to develop formulae for the Laspeyres and Paasche price indexes that are
counterparts to the formulae for the Laspeyres and Paasche quantity indexes given by
(B27) and (B28).


Define the Laspeyres price index PL* as follows:


(B35) PL* ≡ [p1q0 + P1*Q0]/[p0q0 + P0Q0]
            = [(p1/p0)p0q0 + (P1*/P0)p0Q0]/v0                                              using (B3)
            = (p1/p0)sq0 + (P1*/P0)sQ0
            = (p1/p0){sq0 + [(P1*/P0)/(p1/p0)]sQ0}.


Define the Paasche price index PP as follows:


(B36) PP ≡ [p1q1 + P1*Q1]/[p0q1 + P0Q1]
          = p1q1/p0q1                                                             using (B1), Q1 = 0
          = p1/p0.


The Fisher (1922) price index PF* is defined as the geometric mean of PL* and PP:


(B37) PF* ≡ [PL*PP]1/2
           = (p1/p0){sq0 + [(P1*/P0)/(p1/p0)]sQ0}1/2                         using (B35) and (B36)
           = (p1/p0)m(ρ)                                                     using (B30) and (B31)
           ≈ (p1/p0){(½)[1 + sq0] + (½)sQ0[(P1*/P0)/(p1/p0)]}               using (B32).

homogeneous, twice continuously differentiable function to the second order around any point (q,Q). This
functional form has a linear utility function as a special case; see Diewert (2020a; 15).
                                                                                             69



where sQ0 ≡ P0Q0/v0 is the period 0 expenditure share of the commodity which will
disappear in period 1. If P1*/P0 > p1/p0, then PL* > PF* > PP.


Using the above definitions, it is straightforward to show that the following well known
equalities hold:


(B38) v1/v0 = PL*QP* = PPQL = PF*QF*.


In order to calculate QF* defined by (B29) or PF* defined by (B37), we need an estimate
for the reservation price P1*. It is possible to generate an estimate for P1* if an estimate for
the elasticity of demand for the products is known or could be estimated using
econometric techniques. In order to accomplish this task, we first require some
preliminary material.


Recall definitions (B7)-(B10) which defined the Hicksian demand functions 79 for the two
goods evaluated at the period 0 and 1 data for the household. For general positive prices,
p and P, and positive utility level u, the Hicksian demand functions, q(u,p,P) and Q(u,p,P),
can be defined in terms of the first order partial derivatives of the consumer’s unit cost
function, c(p,P) as follows:


(B39) q(u,p,P) ≡ c1(p,P)u ;
(B40) Q(u,p,P) ≡ c2(p,P)u


where c2(p,P) ≡ ∂c(p,P)/∂P. The Hicksian elasticity of demand for Q as a function of P
evaluated at u0,p0,P0, η0, is defined as follows:


(B41) η0 ≡ [P0/Q0]∂Q(u0,p0,P0)/∂P
             = P0c22(p0,P0)u0/Q0             differentiating both sides of (B40) with respect
                                              to P and evaluating the derivatives at (u0,p0,P0)

     See Hicks (1946; 311-331).
                                                                                                         70

           = P0c22(p0,P0)u0/c2(p0,P0)u0                                                       using (B8)
           = P0c22(p0,P0)/c2(p0,P0)
           ≤0


where the inequality follows from the concavity of the unit cost function in p and P. We
will assume that the inequality in (B41) is strict so that η0 < 0; i.e., we assume that as the
price of Q goes up, consumers buy less of it and more of q in order to keep their utility or
welfare level constant. Below, we will find it convenient to work with the negative of η0,
which we define as η0*. Thus we have the following inequality:


(B42) η0* ≡ − P0c22(p0,P0)u0/Q0 > 0.


It turns out that it will be useful to find the period 0 reservation price for the disappearing
commodity which we label as P0*. Thus P0* is the price which will make the demand for q
equal to 0 in period 0; i.e., P0* is the solution to the following equation:


(B43) 0 = Q(u0,p0,P0*)
          = c2(p0,P0*)u0                                                                      using (B40).


The reason why it is useful to find the period 0 reservation price P0* is due to the fact that
if we can determine P0*, then we can determine the period 1 reservation price P1*; in fact,
the following equation holds:


(B44) P1*/p1 = P0*/p0.


Using (B43), we see that the following equation holds: 80


(B45) 0 = c2(p0,P0*)


80
  Since c(p,P) is linearly homogeneous in (p,P), Euler’s Theorem on homogeneous functions implies that
the first order derivatives of this function are homogeneous of degree 0 in (p,P). Thus we have c2(λp,λP) =
c2(p,P) for all λ > 0. Choose λ = 1/p and we obtain the equation c2(p,P) = c2(1,P/p).
                                                                                                    71

           = c2(1,P0*/p0)                                 using the linear homogeneity of c(p,P)
           = c2(1,P1*/p1)                                 if (B44) holds
           = c2(p1,P1*)                                   using the linear homogeneity of c(p,P)
           = c2(p1,P1*)u1
           = Q(u1,p1,P1*)
           ≡ Q1.


Thus if we set P1* equal to the inflation adjusted carry forward reservation price (p1/p0)P0*,
this will be the correct reservation price for period 1.


We can find an approximation to P0* by equating the first order Taylor series
approximation to Q(u0,p0,P) around the point P0 to zero. Call this approximation to P0*,
P0**. Thus we need to solve the following equation for P0**: 81


(B46) 0 = Q(u0,p0,P0) + [∂Q(u0,p0,P0)/∂P][P0** − P0]
           = Q0 + c22(p0,P0)u0[P0** − P0]


where the second equality follows by differentiating Q(u0,p0,P0) defined by (B8). Solving
the equation (B46) for P0** leads to the following estimate for P0*:


(B47) P0** − P0 ≡ − Q0/c22(p0,P0)u0
                   = P0/η0*                                                  using definition (B42).


Divide both sides of (B47) through by P0 and we obtain the following expression for
P0**/P0:


(B48) P0**/P0 = 1 +1/η0* > 1.




81
  The approximation methodology used here is similar to the methodology used by Hausman (1981)
(2003), Diewert (1998), Diewert and Feenstra (2019), Diewert, Fox and Schreyer (2019) and Brynjolfsson,
Collis, Diewert, Eggers and Fox (2020).
                                                                                             72


The inequality in (B48) follows because we assumed η0* > 0. From (B44), we see that P1*
= (p1/p0)P0*. Approximate P0* by P0** and define the approximate reservation price for
period 1 as:


(B49) P1** ≡ (p1/p0)P0**
           = (p1/p0)P0(1 + 1/η0*)                                                 using (B48).


The last equation in (B49) can be rearranged to give us the following approximation to
the term (P1*/P0)/(p1/p0) which appears in the formulae for QP*, QF*, PL* and PF*: 82


(B50) ρ* ≡ (P1**/P0)/(p1/p0) = 1 + 1/η0*.


The above analysis shows that if an estimate for the elasticity of demand η0* can be
obtained, then estimates for the bias in the Laspeyres quantity index QL defined by (B27)
relative to the Paasche and Fisher quantity indexes defined by (B28) and (B29) can be
calculated. Similarly, if an estimate for the elasticity of demand η0* exists, then estimates
for the bias in the Paasche price index PP defined by (B36) relative to the Laspeyres and
Fisher quantity indexes defined by (B35) and (B37) can be calculated.


To illustrate the possible magnitudes of the differences between the Laspeyres quantity
index for consumption defined by (B27) relative to the Fisher quantity index defined by
(B37), let sq0 = ½, sQ0 = ½ (so that ½ of all consumption producing industries are shut
down), p1/p0 = 1 (so that there is no inflation in the prices of continuing commodities)
and η0* = ½. In this case, ρ* = (P1**/P0)/(p1/p0) = 1 + 1/η0* = 1 + 2 = 3 and m(ρ*) = [sq0 +
sQ0ρ*]1/2 = [½ + (½)3]1/2 = 21/2 = 1.414. 83 Then QL/QF* = m(ρ*) ≈1.414. Hence the
Laspeyres quantity index will overstate real consumption (from a welfare perspective) by
about 40%.



82
  See (A28), (A29), (A35) and (A37).
83
  If we use the approximation to m(ρ) defined by the right hand side of (A32), we find that this
approximate estimate is equal to 1.5 as compared to the true estimate equal to 21/2 ≈1.414.
                                                                                            73

The bias in the Paasche price index (which is equal to the Laspeyres and Paasche price
indexes for just the continuing commodities in our simple model) relative to the Fisher
index will go in the other direction and understate cost of living inflation. Thus PP/PF* =
1/m(ρ*) = 1/1.414 = 0.707. Thus the Paasche price index (which is also the carry forward
price index in our simple model) will understate cost of living inflation by about 30%.
Carry forward basket type indexes which have a basket which is approximately
proportional to the period 0 quantity vector will have biases (relative to a welfare or cost
of living perspective) similar to the biases in the Laspeyres quantity index and in the
Paasche price index. Our simple model analysis indicates that the bias in fixed basket
type price indexes will be very large if the pre-shutdown share of expenditure for
commodities that are ultimately unavailable during lockdown periods is large.


Appendix C: Defining Reservation Prices Under Lockdown Conditions


We use the same notation as was used in section 2 of the main text with one exception:
we now assume that some components of the Q1 vector could be positive. We also
assume that the analysis here is applied to a single household. An example where the
quantity consumed of a lockdown affected commodity is positive in a lockdown period is
rental housing where the tenant is given a rent holiday. Thus in this case, if the first
commodity in Group 2 is rental housing, then Q11 > 0 but the observed price is P11 = 0.
However, the utility value of its free rent to the household is not 0; it is a positive
reservation price, P11* > 0. Our problem here is to find a way to estimate this reservation
price. Once we have found this price, it is appropriate to add P11*Q11 to the observed
expenditures, p1⋅q1, in order to better approximate the value of actual consumer
expenditure in period 1. Hence this Appendix has some relevance to the construction of
the national accounts during lockdown periods as well as being relevant for the
construction of a cost of living index.


Restating the notation used in section 2, denote the period t price and quantity vectors for
always available products by pt ≡ [p1t,...,pMt] >> 0M and qt ≡ [q1t,...,qMt] >> 0M for t = 0,1.
The lockdown affected price and quantity vectors for period 0 are P0 ≡ [P10,...,PN0] >> 0N
                                                                                                         74


and Q0 ≡ [Q10,...,QN0] >> 0N. The observed price for the locked down commodities in
period 1 is P1 = 0N, and the corresponding observed quantity vector is Q1 ≡ [Q11,...,QN1] >
0N. Most of the components of Q1 will be zero but some components could be positive;
i.e., the government may be providing some goods and services free of charge or it may
legislate rent holidays for tenants which will lead to 0 prices. We provide a methodology
for finding estimates for the vector of reservation prices P1*.


We first consider the consumer’s period 0 cost minimization problem. Suppose the
household utility function is u = f(q,Q) where f(q,Q) is nonnegative, increasing and
concave in the components of the vectors q and Q. Define the period 0 utility level as u0
≡ f(q0,Q0) > 0. We assume that (q0,Q0) solves the following period 0 cost minimization
problem:


(C1) C(u0,p0,P0) ≡ min q,Q {p0⋅q + P0⋅Q : f(q,Q) ≥ u0; q ≥ 0M; Q ≥ 0N}
                    = p0⋅q0 + P0⋅Q0


where C(u,p,P) is the consumer’s cost function. 84


Define the consumer’s conditional cost function, C*(u,p,Q), for u ≥ 0, p >> 0M and Q ≥
0N as follows:


(C2) C*(u,p,Q) ≡ min q {p⋅q : f(q,Q) ≥ u; q ≥ 0M}.


When solving the cost minimization problem defined by (C2), the consumer minimizes
the cost associated with the purchase of always available goods and services, p⋅q, subject
to achieving at least the utility level u, conditional on having on hand, the vector of
sometimes available goods and services Q. 85 We note that if the consumer’s utility


84
   The cost function is used to define true cost of living indexes such as C(u0,p1,P1*)/C(u0,p0,P0) and
C(u1,p1,P1*)/C(u1,p0,P0).
85
   Under our regularity conditions on f(q,Q), it can be shown that C*(u,p,Q) has the following properties: it
is increasing in u for fixed p and Q, it is nondecreasing, concave and linearly homogeneous in p for fixed u
                                                                                                             75

function f(q,Q) is estimated using available econometric techniques for data in the pre-
lockdown period, then an empirical estimate for the conditional cost function C*(u,p,Q)
defined by (C2) can be obtained.


We assume that the observed period 1 consumption vector q1 solves the conditional cost
minimization problem (C2) when (u,p,Q) equals (u1,p1,Q1). Using this assumption, we
have the following equality:


(C3) p1⋅q1 = C*(u1,p1,Q1).


Assuming that C*(u1,p1,Q) is differentiable with respect to the components of Q at the
point Q = Q1, define the vector of period 1 reservation prices for the goods and services
subject to lockdown restrictions, P1*, as the negative of the vector of first order partial
derivatives of C*(u1,p1,Q1) with respect to the components of Q; i.e., define P1* as
follows:


(C4) P1* ≡ − ∇QC*(u1,p1,Q1)
           ≥ 0N


where the inequality in (C4) follows from the fact that C*(u,p,Q) is nonincreasing in the
components of Q.


We use the reservation prices defined by (C4) as the prices for the lockdown affected
goods and services for period 1. Consider the following period 1 (regular) cost
minimization problem where u1 ≡ f(q1,Q1):


(C5) C(u1,p1,P1*) ≡ min q,Q {p1⋅q + P1*⋅Q : f(q,Q) ≥ u1; q ≥ 0M; Q ≥ 0N}
                     = min Q {P1*⋅Q + min q {p1⋅q : f(q,Q) ≥ u1; q ≥ 0M} : Q ≥ 0N}
                     = min Q {P1*⋅Q + C*(u1,p1,Q) : Q ≥ 0N}                           using definition (C2).

and Q, it is convex in (u,Q) for fixed p and it is nonincreasing in Q for fixed p and u. If in addition f(q,Q) is
linearly homogeneous in q,Q, then C*(u,p,Q) is linearly homogeneous in (u, Q).
                                                                                                            76



The first order necessary conditions for Q1 to solve the final cost minimization problem 86
in (C5) are the following conditions:


(C6) P1* + ∇QC*(u1,p1,Q1) = 0N.


But conditions (C6) are equivalent to equations (C4), which were used to define the
reservation prices P1*. Hence we have the following:


(C7) C(u1,p1,P1*) = min Q {P1*⋅Q + C*(u1,p1,Q) : Q ≥ 0N}                                        using (C5)
                     = P1*⋅Q1 + C*(u1,p1,Q)                                                     using (C6)
                     = P1*⋅Q1 + p1⋅q1                                                           using (C3).


The above algebra shows that if the consumer had the “income” p1⋅q1 + P1*⋅Q1 to spend
on the commodities in scope for the lockdown period 1 and faced the prices p1 and P1*,
then the consumer would minimize the cost of achieving the actual utility level u1 ≡
f(q1,Q1) by choosing the observed consumption vector, (q1,Q1). Thus the observed
lockdown restricted consumption vector would be freely chosen by the consumer facing
the price vectors (p1,P1*) in order to minimize the cost of achieving the actual period 1
utility level, u1.


Our conclusion at this point is that if the target CPI is a cost of living index, then the
reservation price vector P1* should be used to value period 1 locked down products in
place of the observed vector of zero prices, P1 = 0N. Laspeyres, Paasche and Fisher
indexes can be formed using the reservation prices P1*.


If we make the further assumption that the utility function f(q,Q) is the square root of a
quadratic form in the components of q and Q, then since this functional form is exact for



86
  These conditions are also sufficient for Q1 to solve the last minimization problem since C*(u,p,Q) is a
convex function of Q under our regularity conditions.
                                                                                            77

the Fisher index using the reservation prices, the utility ratio, u1/u0, would be equal to this
Fisher index.


There is only one aspect of the reservation price methodology presented here which is not
standard: the methodology above shows how theoretical reservation prices can be
obtained for products that are supplied at zero prices during the lockdown period but the
corresponding quantities held by consumers may be positive instead of being set equal to
zero. If there are such products so that Q1 > 0N, then P1*⋅Q1 > 0 and this imputed
expenditure on lockdown affected products should be added to the expenditures on
always available goods and services during period 1, p1⋅q1, to form overall consumer
expenditures or “income”.


This has implications for the System of National Accounts: actual consumer expenditures
on goods and services during lockdown periods, which are equal to p1⋅q1, need to be
augmented by imputed expenditures on lockdown affected goods and services that are
provided at zero prices but have marginal utilities that are above zero, P1*⋅Q1. For
lockdown period products n that are simply not available, the corresponding quantity Qn1
will equal 0 so Pn1*Qn1 will also equal 0 and there is no need to add Pn1*Qn1 to actual
expenditures. But for some government services provided at zero cost and for rental
housing that is temporarily supplied at a zero price, we need to add these imputed
expenditures to actual expenditures to get an accurate picture of actual real consumption
and welfare.


There is an example in Diewert and Feenstra (2019) that shows how the Fisher functional
form can be estimated econometrically and it also calculates the resulting reservation
prices for missing products in a grocery store example. So it is possible to estimate
reservation prices, but the estimation of reservation prices at scale is not possible at the
present time. The actual reservation prices will have to be approximated by inflation
adjusted carry forward prices or by simple unadjusted carry forward prices. The analysis
in Appendix A above shows that inflation adjusted carry forward prices can have a
substantial downward bias relative to their true reservation prices.
                                                                                                      78



Finally, the above methodology can be modified to deal with a related problem associated
with the measurement of housing rents. Many urban areas have some form of rent control
imposed on price increases for rental housing. If these rent controls have been in place for
long periods of time, the actual price paid for a rented dwelling unit in period t, say Pnt,
could be well below a current market price Pnt*, which would likely approximate the
appropriate period t reservation price. Thus in order to calculate a cost of living index, the
actual price paid Pnt should be replaced by its higher opportunity cost price Pnt* and the
resulting Laspeyres, Paasche and Fisher indexes should be calculated using these higher
prices. 87 In the national accounts, the actual rental income and expenditure, PntQnt, will be
recorded in both the production and household accounts but the imputed housing
expenditures above the recorded expenditures, Pnt*Qnt − PntQnt > 0, needs to be added to
household expenditures on consumer goods and services.
