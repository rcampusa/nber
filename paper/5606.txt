          Are the large measured wage differentials   associated with on-the-job   computer   use

productivity gains or the result of unobserved heterogeneity?   We examine this issue with three

large cross-sectional   surveys from Germany.      First, we confirm   that the estimated wage

differentials associated with computer use in Germany are very similar to the U.S. differential.

Second,    using the same techniques we also measure large differentials for on-the-job    use of

calculators, telephones, pens or pencils, or for those who work while sitting down.   Along with

our reanalysis of the U.S. data these findings cast some doubt on the interpretation of the

computer-use wage differential as reflecting productivity effects arising from the introduction of

computers in the workplace.

I.     Introduction
       It seems undeniable that the increase in the skill premium in the
       advanced world is primarily the result of skill–biased technological
       change.


                  Paul Krugman,      a Stanford University economist            (1994)

       I don’t think a guy will be able to go into his country club if he
       doesn’t   have a CAD/CAM         [computer         aided manufacturing      and
       design system] system in his factory.             He’s got to be able to talk
       about his CAD/CAM         system as he tees off on the third tee – or
       he will be embarrassed.


       Joseph Engelberger,     founder of Unimation,           the first major U.S.
       robot manufacturer     (Schlesinger       1983)

     There has been a large widening          of wage differentials         in the U.S. and
other industrialized     countries   during the past 15 years.          Many researchers
have attributed    this change to skill-biased       technological    change (see Bound
and Johnson (1992)).      The evidence supporting            a major role for skill–biased
technical change, however, is primarily inferential,             Wages for highly skilled
workers in the U.S. have risen while the number of skilled workers has risen
as well. In the view of many, therefore, this requires an explanation              based on
an increased demand for more skilled labor. Since the 1980’s witnessed great
technological    advances, including cheaper and more powerful computing                 tech-
nology, technical change has been considered               a plausible explanation. 1 Sup-
port for a major role for skill–biased           technological    change,    moreover,    has
been strengthened      by the perceived inability of other candidate explanations
to explain the dramatic changes in the observed pattern of wages over time
in the U. S..
    Until recently, changes in the wage structure have rarely been directly
linked to observable technical developments that are presumably transform-
ing workplaces     and the distribution      of wages,       A notable exception      is Alan


   lIndeed in 1983, Time Magazine,    a weekly U.S. news publication,          gave its much
vaunted “Man of the Year” award to the Computer.



                                             1
Krueger’s     (1993)   careful and influential study that finds that the use of a
computer      at work is associated    with a 10-15 percent wage differential.            In
this paper, we attempt        to shed some new light on the question of whether
the measured      returns to computer      use reflect productivity      differences    due
to the introduction        of computers   in the workplace        – and hence provide
a potential    explanation     for wage structure    changes – or whether these re-
turns merely reflect unobserved        heterogeneity y. If this latter view is correct,
the direct evidence for skill–biased technical change in explaining           changes is
severely undermined.
      In this paper, we first present evidence from German data that shows that
the basic pattern of computer       use and the wage premium for computer              users
is very similar to the findings for the U. S., which suggests that an analysis
of the German data is informative.        Second, since the German data contains
detailed information       on the tools used by workers and the knowledge              they
have about     these tools,    we can apply conventional      techniques     to evaluate
the returns to these other tools, as well as computers.            When we do so, we
find for example,      that the measured return to the use of pencils at work is
almost as large and robust as the measured return for computer use. Since we
do not believe that pencils changed the wage structure, this would appear to
undermine the view that the coefficient on computers provides direct evidence
on the role of skill–biased technological change. Instead, the results seem to
suggest that computer         users possess unobserved    skills that are rewarded in
the labor market, or that computers         were first introduced       in higher paying
occupations     or jobs.    We argue that all the results in Krueger         (1993)     can
be interpreted    in this light. We review some related literature on this issue
and present additional evidence of our own. The remainder of the paper is
organized as follows, The next section describes the German data sets we
use. Section 3 discuses the measured returns to the use of tools in the U.S.
and Germany.       Section 4 discusses various interpretations          of the empirical
evidence and the final sect ion concludes.



II.       The Data
Our German data come from three cross-sections            of the West German “ Qual-
ification and Career Survey,” conducted          in 1979, in 1985/86,    and in 1991/92
by the Federal Institute for Vocational         Training (BIBB)   and the Institute for


                                            2
Labor Market Research        (IAB).   The surveys contain standard           demographic
and labor market variables but are also particularly rich in details about
workers’ jobs, job attributes, the tools used in these jobs, the skills necessary
to perform a job, and how these skills were obtained. The sampling frame
for the survey is the German employed population age 16 to 65. Each survey
has slightly less than 30,000 respondents.         We use the largest sample possibly,
only deleting a observations which do not have information on the variables
we analyze. The questions in the three surveys are similar but not exactly
comparable.    We report details on the variables we use below.
   The questions on computer use differ slightly between the 1979 survey and
the later waves. For the 1979 survey we combine affirmative answers to two
questions as computer users. The first asked about the use of “computers,
terminals, or monitors,” the second inquired about word processors. In the
later surveys there are six categories which we combine:           computers     on shop
floors, office computers,   PCs, terminals, word processors,       and CAD systems.
Other questions    inquired about the use of computer           controlled    machinery,
but this seems to be different from the concept captured in the questions in
the U.S. Current Population      Survey used by Krueger (1993).
   Table 1 summarizes the probability        of using a computer at work for differ-
ent categories of workers and reproduces a similar tabulation from Krueger
(1993). Computer use in the mid 1980s is lower in Germany than in the U.S.
but by 1991 the fraction of workers using computers            on the job in Germany
approaches    the U.S. utilization    rate. In addition the patterns of use among
various labor market groups are very similar.            In both countries computers
are used predominantly      by the more highly educated,      by the age group 25-39,
by white collar workers, and by full time employees.



III.      The       Returns            to Computer                 Use         in the
          U.S. and Germany
To assess the wage differential       associated     with using computers       we run a
number of standard wage regressions.        Our dependent variable is the log of
gross average hourly earnings.        This variable is constructed from monthly
earnings and usual weekly hours. 2
    The raw log wage differential for computer            use in Germany      is 0.139 in
1979, 0.240 in 1985/86,      and 0.288 in 1991/92.      This is somewhat      lower than
the 0.276 differential for the U.S. in 1984 and 0.325 in 1989.              Results from
the wage regressions including a computer dummy and other covariates are
reported in Table 2. The wage differential for computer use in Germany falls
to 0.112 in 1979, 0.157 in 1985/86, and 0.171 in 1991/92 when controls such
as education, experience, gender, and others are added to the regression.
These differentials resemble relatively closely those found by Krueger which
are displayed in the first two columns.         As in the U. S., the wage differential
associated with computer       use in Germany has increased over time.
    The basic patterns      of computer      use in the U.S. and in Germany            and
the wage differentials     associated   with computers      are very similar.      This is
true despite the fact that the German labor market is more regulated,                  pay
setting more centralized,      and the wage structure more compressed             than in
the U.S. (see e.g. Krueger and Pischke (1995)).          The narrower wage structure
in Germany is reflected in the fact that most coefficients           in Table 2 tend to
be somewhat      smaller in Germany than they are for U.S. data,             Overall, we
thus conclude    that the wage differential for computer          use is very similar in
the two countries, which suggests that the interpretation           of the results is also
likely to be the same.


A      The Returns to Pencils, Telephones and Sitting on
      the Job in Germany
In this subsection    we compare the patterns of use and the wage differentials
associated with computers       to those for a set of more commonly–found            tools
and job attributes which are likely to invite a very different interpretation.


     ‘The earnings variable in the survey is obtained not as a continuous number but in
bracketed form. There are 13 brackets for the 1979 survey, 21 in 1985/86, and 15 in
199 1/92, We assigned bracket midpoints       to each group,   The resulting approximation
should be rather good because of the large number of brackets. Adopting a similar speci-
fication we find that this earnings variable yields the same return to schooling in 1985/86
as reported by Krueger and Pischke (1995) with a continuous earnings variable for 1988.
Years of education are imputed from information on schools attended and degrees obtained
following Krueger and Pischke (1995).



                                            4
    Table 3 tabulates    the fraction    of users which mention         that they utilize
various tools on their job in the three German data sets. Computer usage has
increased markedly from 1979 to 1991. Desk or hand calculators                  (the 1979
data also include cash registers in this category)         are used more heavily and
their usage has also increased substantially          during this period.     Telephones
are used by about half the work force; with little change during this period.
Approximately 60% of workers use a pen, pencil or other writing material on
their job. Furthermore, we use a variable whether employees predominantly
work while sitting.    The 1985/86      survey had a direct question on how often
respondents   sit at their job, allowing five possible answers: basically never,
rarely, occasionally, often, almost always. We classified those responding
“often” or “almost always” as sitting. In 1979 the only similar question
asked how often respondents       stand, allowing the same five responses.               We
classified those standing    “never”    or “rarely”     as sitting.     There is no such
variable in the 1991/92     survey. The fractions sitting differ between the two
years; this is likely to be due to the differences in our variable definitions,
To compare      persons associated     with office work or more supervisory            roles
to blue collar workers, we also consider the usage of manual hand tools, like
hammers, screw drivers, paint brushes, hand operated drills, etc. About 30%
of workers use such tools,
    Table 4 investigates    the wage differentials associated         with these various
tools.   In first panel of the table we report results from regressions similar
to those reported     in Table 2 except that we separately            include each of our
tools used on the job,     Workers who use a calculator         on their job earn 9 to
13 percent more than those who did not.           Telephones     are associated       with a
12 to 14 percent differential,   the use of writing materials is associated            with
an 11 to 13 percent differential, while sitting yields 10 percent higher wages.
    While it is plausible that the use of calculators        or telephones     raises pro-
ductivity, it is unlikely that the productivity     differential of using a computer,
a telephone,    a pencil or a chair are all basically       the same.      Instead,    what
we are obviously    capturing is the fact that all these variables are associated
wit h “office” jobs, which are typically higher paying than jobs not involving
desk work.     Any of these variables, therefore,      might indicate that the users
of office equipment    are more skilled than the non-users, or perform different
tasks, or that such workers are more likely to have access to office tools.
This interpretation is corroborated by the wage differential observed for us-
ing tools associated with relatively unskilled blue collar work: the users of


                                           5
simple hand tools earn about 10 percent less than nonusers.
    To control for the part of the wage differential attributable                simply to oc-
cupational wage differentials, the last three columns of table 4 present results
from the same regressions but which include a very detailed set of occupa-
tion dummies.       The wage differential associated       with computer          use, as well
as those for the other tools, drop to about 30 to 50 percent of their original
value. Thus, a large fraction of the original differentials are indeed associated
with occupations.      Nevertheless,    differences in wages in the order of 4 to 7
percent remain for the users of the various office tools even within narrowly
defined occupations.  This again mirrors the within occupation estimates
reported by Krueger (1993) for the U.S.
    Finally, to control for the possibility     that the use of pencils, calculators,
etc. might simply be proxying          for the use of a computer       we include all five
office tool dummy variables together          and report the results in the bottom
panel of Table 4 (the 1991/92          results do not include        sitting).     While    the
differential associated    with each falls, they all stay individually             significant.
The computer       differential with 7 to 13 percent is among the largest, but the
differentials for telephones    and jobs which involve sitting also remain in the
order of 5 to 7 percent.    This result is less surprising if each of these variables
proxies for worker ability or a particular type of job; none of the proxies are
perfect and some are more important          than others.     Clearly, however, the use
of telephones or pens did not purely proxy for computer use! The results are
again qualitatively    similar when we include occupations.
    In addition,    we also reanalyzed      the High School         and Beyond        data for
Sophomores and Seniors in 1980 (HSB) used by Krueger (1993). Briefly, HSB
is a longitudinal data set that contains inter alia information on computer
use, acheivement test scores and school performance           for individuals who were
sophomores    or seniors in 1980.       As Kruger notes, information             on computer
use was collected only in the 1984 wave of the survey and students were only
asked whether they had ever used a computer             on a job.     We follow Krueger
and use the information      as if it referred to the current job, although this may
not be the case for some proportion         of the individuals.
    In table 5 we exactly replicate the results in Krueger’s table VI, columns
(2), (3), and (4)3. The various regressions include a different set of covariates,

however, we only display the coefficient on the computer               variable.   Krueger’s
results are shown in the first line. Eliminating missing values on the calcula-
tor and VCR variables yields a slightly smaller sample.                The coefficients   on
the computer      dummy       in this sample are shown in Panel A. The deletions
do not make any difference          to the estimated       coefficients.   Panel B shows
the returns to using a calculator        on the job.      The coefficients    are positive,
marginally    significant, but are only one fifth the size of the computer              coef-
ficient and only one fourth to one sixth the size of the calculator coefficient
for Germany.    Part of the differences may reflect real differences between
Germany and the U.S. Part of the difference may be the consequence of the
fact that our German sample, being representative of the adult population, is
much older than the HSB sample which contains only high school graduates
two to four years out of school,
    Thus, the patterns of returns are somewhat different in the U.S. from our
findings for Germany where we found a positive wage differential associated
with the calculators     on the job.


B     Computer Use Versus Computer Knowledge
What gets rewarded in a competitive               labor market are only skills that are
scarce. In competitive        labor markets, individuals will not be able to capture
returns arising from a new technology,             say the assembly line, if everybody
else can also use the new technology.             Private returns only accrue to those
workers who possess a skill like the ability to program a computer or work
with business software. If these workers are scarce, their wages should be
bid up in the market.         In addition,    the return should accrue to everybody
possessing the skill regardless of whether the worker actually uses a computer
on the job or not.       This effect results from the labor supply side:             worker
mobility should result in a uniform differential for all workers with computer
skills. This suggests that the correct variable to use in these regressions is
computer     knowledge   rather than computer          use. In addition,   once computer
knowledge     is controlled    for computer       use should not matter independently
anymore.
   The German 1979 survey allows us to further examine this hypothesis.
The key feature of the 1979 data that we use is from a series of questions
on job skills possessed        by respondents. One of the skills inquired about
was computer     skills. Table 6 presents a cross tabulation of survey responses


                                              7
concerning    computer   skills and computer      use.   A key fact from this table
is that about two thirds of those who possess computer skills do not use a
computer on their job. Curiously, a small fraction of workers actually use
computers     without any qualification.
    In the upper panel of Table 7, we include the computer knowledge dummy
in a wage regression.    Column      1 and column 5 include the measure of com-
puter knowledge in lieu of a measure of computer            use, Indeed, it is apparent
that the estimated     “returns”    are similar for either knowledge     or use. When
we include dummies for both computer knowledge and computer use, we find
that most of the wage differential accrues to the knowledge           dummy and not
to the use variable, just as the compensating        differentials argument outlined
above suggests.
   There is also the labor demand side to be considered,              however.    It only
makes sense to employ a worker with computer knowledge in a non-computer
job if this worker is at least as productive      in the alternative job.   This argu-
ment suggests that the wage differential associated with computer knowledge
could equally well be a return to some other skill or worker attribute that is
often found in the same workers who possess computer              skills. Workers who
knew how to use computers          in the late 1970s, for example, might have been
more enterprising     during their education      to actually    acquire this skill.    It
could be this entrepreneurial       talent and motivation     that is rewarded.     If one
wishes to maintain the argument of skill–biased technical change, it is clear
however, that some such unobserved          talent has to be present among workers
with computer knowledge: this is because 9.8 percent of the employed work
force earn a 14 percent wage differential without using computers.   Thus,
even under the skill–biased technological       change explanation     unobserved    het-
erogeneity   is important.   Once this is recognized,       it is now a small step to
conclude that it might be this unobserved talent, for example entrepreneurial
mot ivation, that is also rewarded among computer            users.
   The pattern of coefficients in Table 7 is again robust to controlling for the
same set of occupations as above. When both the computer use and knowl-
edge variables are entered together with occupation          controls (column 7), only
the computer knowledge variable remains positive while the coefficient on the
computer     use dummy falls to zero.
   More importantly, while computer knowledge rather than computer use
seems to explain the wage differential we found for Germany this still does
not explain our findings regarding         the other tools used on the job.       When


                                            8
we replace computer       use with one of the other tools, such as pens or pen-
cils (lower panel in Table 7), we find positive wage differentials              associated
with pencils even after controlling       for computer     knowledge      and detailed oc-
cupations.    It seems to us that these results are equally consistent            with an
explanation    based on differences in pay across workers who have advanced
skills and use white collar tools rather than the productivity         effects associated
with computer     knowledge.
    The High School and Beyond           Survey contains a variety of variables in-
dicating whether the individual        has ever used various software packages or
has written programs in a computer           language.    This could have occurred       in
school or at work, Using these as indicators for computer knowledge,               we run
similar regressions as in Table 7 with a subset of the Krueger sample from
the HSB4 The results are presented in Table 8. Unlike in the German data
we find no evidence that it is computer          knowledge rather than computer         use
which is rewarded in the labor market.            However we should stress that the
HSB sample is rather peculiar since it only consists of high school graduates
two to four year out of school.      These workers may not have had time yet to
find the kind of jobs that reward their skills most adequately.             Hamilton and
Yuen (1995) use the same computer           knowledge     variables from the HSB and
find wage differentials in the order of 8 percent using the 1986 rather than
the 1984 wage and including respondents           who attended      college.


C     Are Other Ability Controls Adequate?
One way to address the possibility of unobserved heterogeneity in these re-
gressions is to include other controls for ability. Krueger used data from the
High School and Beyond Survey which allowed him to include both a com-
puter dummy and controls for parental background,              achievement     scores, and
school grades.     We have measures of secondary           school grades in math and
German in the 1979 survey as well as information on the father’s occupation.
Table 7 presents results with these additional regressors (columns 4 and 8).
Including grades and parental background            does little to change the returns
to computer    knowledge     and the use of computers       or pencils.    This indicates


    40ur samplehas only 4,579 observations since we deleted missing values in the variables
indicating software or computer language proficiency. This sample differs slightly from the
one we use in Table 5.



                                             9
that ability controls, such as grades, may only be poor proxies for the types
of skills that are ultimately    relevant in the workplace.    Indeed, even a crude
variable, such as the use of pens or pencils, is still able to account for some
other worker attribute with a quite substantial reward.
       Similarly, Krueger finds no change in the computer        coefficient   control-
ling for parental background,      test scores, and grades in the HSB data.        The
problem with these results is that the partial correlation       of test scores with
wages in the Krueger sample is negative and grades are uncorrelated with
wages. This may be due to the fact that the sample is selected to exclude
individuals    who went on to a college education.        Furthermore,    the workers
in the sample are very young, test results may not be revealed to employers
and there might have been insufficient           time for the labor market to learn
about the skills of these workers (see Gibbons          and Farber (1994)).      Thus,
these ability controls in the HSB may not be reliable controls to assess the
possibility    that unobserved   heterogeneity    explains the returns to computer
use.



IV.           Reconsidering              the Evidence
The preceding analysis sheds some doubts on the interpretation that the
computer wage differential arises from the possibility that the introduction
of computers      into the workplace      has changed the productivity      and wages
of workers who use computers.            Instead, the wage differential    for the use
of a variety of tools at work seems to pick up unobserved                heterogeneity
among workers. Especially during the diffusion of personal computers at
the workplace in the 1980s it is likely that more highly paid workers were
the ones who started to use these first on their jobs.           In this section we
argue that the results in Krueger (1993) as well as the results found in more
recent research are also consistent with this interpretation.       In particular we
re-examine     the following evidence:

   1. The computer wage differential is three times as high in the nonunion
      sector than in the union sector.

   2. The computer      differential has increased over time in the U, S.

   3. The pattern of returns to specific computer          tasks is consistent    with
      skill–biased technical change.

4. Computer     use at home is not rewarded as highly as computer        use at
   work.

5. Grouped data ``fixed effect'' models of thereturns   tocomputer      use find
   large wage effects of computers.

6. The returns to use of a computer are higher for those with higher levels
   of schooling.

1. The computer wage differential is three times as high in the nonunion
   sector than in the union sector.

  This is unsurprising since unions are known to compress the wage struc-
  ture. Thus, all wage differentials tend to be lower within the union
  sector. Of course, this ought to be true regardless of whether comput-
  ers truly capture computer    skills or are instead simply measuring       the
  impact of any other work related skills and abilities,

2. The computer    differential has increased over time in the U.S.

  The simplest model for the introduction    of computers in the workplace
  would suggest that the productivity     of the marginal computer       worker
  declines as more computers    are introduced   in the workplace.     However,
  the observed pattern of increasing wage differentials can easily be rec-
  onciled with the skill biased technical change story if the quality and
  therefore the associated productivity   effects of computers increased fast
  enough.     There is little doubt that the quality of computers       changed
  tremendously    over the 1980s. On the other hand, the observed pattern
  is also easy to reconcile with a pure heterogeneity   explanation.    Returns
  to skill have increased during the 1980s. Thus, if computer use proxies
  for work related skills, then the return to computer use should increase
  alongside with other ability related wage differentials such as the return
  to schooling.

  Krueger argues against this view because of the fast expansion of com-
  puter use. If computers    are used by the most able workers first or the
  otherwise most highly paid workers first and then slowly spread to less
  productive,   lower wage groups we should see the computer      wage differ-
  ential fall. However, it is unlikely that the proliferation    of computers



                                   11
   followed such a monotonic         pattern.     Mainframe    computers     were typi-
   cally used directly only by a few specialists or staff positions but not by
   line managers. These positions are on average better paid, therefore we
   find a significant computer differential already in 1979. When personal
   computers became available, computer use became more decentralized.
   If PCs slowly spread to more highly paid positions,             then the computer
   differential may well have risen during the 1980s. According                to Table
   1, computer use in Germany grew much faster among the more highly
   educated than among the less educated. This may explain a rising com-
   puter wage differential in Germany between 1979 and 1991/92                   despite
   the fact that the returns to skill did not change during this period,

3. The pattern of returns to specific computer tasks is consistent            with skill-
   biased technical change.

   The results, however, are also easy to reconcile with unobserved              hetero-
   geneity.   Krueger finds that the highest wages are paid to those using
   computers     for electronic   mail, followed by spreadsheets          and then pro-
   gramming.     Both electronic mail and spreadsheet use seems to indicate
   that the user probably         occupies     a managerial   position.    Other tasks
   are associated with lower wages, such as inventory cent rol or computer
   aided design, although these uses are likely to enhance productivity                as
  much as or more than the more highly rewarded tasks.

4. Computer      use at home is not rewarded as highly as computer                use at
   work.

  To probe the unobserved         heterogeneity     explanation,   Krueger includes a
  separate dummy variable for computer use at home and an interaction
  with computer      use at work. The wage differential for using computers
  at home is about one third of the wage effect of using computers at
  work. This seems to suggest that the computer dummies reflect more
  than just productivity y effects.          In fact, unobserved   heterogeneity y can
  explain this pattern if computers proxy for ability and using computers
  at work is a better proxy than using computers              at home.

  In addition,     using a computer      at home may simply proxy for higher
  earnings and therefore the ability to afford a home computer.                   In or-
  der to probe this idea, we ran regressions in the HSB data including                  a


                                         12
  variable for the use of a VCR at home and at work.                 VCRs      are much
  less likely to be a technology      that requires major skills and raises pro-
  ductivity    substantially.    On the other hand, in the mid 1980s VCRs
  were relatively expensive,       so that earnings are likely to be positively
  correlated   with ownership of a VCR.

  Panel C of Table 5 presents our estimates of the returns to using a
  VCR at home. The wage differential associated with this is 4 percent.
  Panel D of Table 5 displays results from a regression for both using a
  VCR at home and using a VCR at work (only few workers use VCRs on
  their jobs). The returns are very similar but the coefficients on VCRs
  at work is not very well determined because of the small sample size,
  The coefficient on an interaction          term between VCR use at home and
  at work was small and insignificantly           different from zero and had no
  effect on these results. We think the results on VCRs are most easily
  explained    by the fact that the income elasticity for VCRs is positive,
  while ownership of a consumer durable may not be a good control for
  ability.

5. Grouped data ‘~xed eflect” models of the return to computer                  use find
   large wage efiecis of computers.

  In section III C, we noted that computer            use or knowledge         may be a
  better proxy for work related skills than grades, test scores, or family
  background     variables.     Therefore,   we do not view the result that the
  computer differential remains after controlling for such ability measures
  as evidence against the unobserved           heterogeneity    explanation.

  An alternative to controlling       directly for ability is to difference out the
  ability component      in a panel regression.      There are three studies that
  we are aware of that have attempted             to do this.    Entorf,   Gollac and
  Kramarz (1995) analyze French panel data and find that workers who
  start using computers         on their jobs do not get wage increases.            Bell
  (1996) uses the British National           Child Development      Study and finds
  that the coefficient on computer use remains at about two thirds of the
  cross sectional level after differencing, Both these studies use micro
  data on workers.

  One weakness of both studies is that that they lack a first period vari-
  able on computer use and have to infer this value. Bell, for example,


                                        13
       assumes that none of the workers in his sample use computers               in 1981,
       the date of his first wave. An additional         problem with the Bell study
       is that all individuals      in the sample are born in the same week, so
       that it is impossible to control for labor market experience.          Since more
       skilled workers tend to have steeper wage profiles, computer usage may
       simply be picking up the effects of differences in experience           profiles so
       that his first difference results are still consistent with an unobserved
      heterogeneity y explanation        for the computer   effect.

      Entorf et al. (1995) on the other hand, have information on when indi-
      viduals began using computers. They use this information to construct
      measures of computer         use in earlier years. The cross–sect ional results
      with the French data are roughly consistent with U.S. and German data
      using similar human capital covariates,         Their estimate of the coefficient
      on computer       use is 7% in the cross-section.      On the other hand, when
      they re–estimate       these models with fixed effects they find an estimate
      of less than one percent.5

       Another    study that presents first difference         results for the effect of
      advanced      technologies   on wages is Chennells and Van Reenen (1995).
      This study also uses U.K. data, but their data are average wages at the
      firm level.    The data come from the Work Place Industrial Relations
      Survey. They find that the effect of the firm using advanced technolo-
      gies on the average wages of skilled workers increases from 0.053 in
      the cross section to 0.135 in first differences. However, it is unclear
      whether this is compelling evidence either. Investment of firms tends
      to be correlated with cash flow and profitability         (Fazzari, Hubbard and
       Petersen     1988) and more profitable       firms tend to pay higher wages
       (Blanchflower,     Oswald and Sanfey (1992), Estevao and Tevlin (1995)),

      Krueger tries to address this issue by running wage regressions using
       “first-differences”    of dat a grouped by three digit occupations.        As long
      as the composition       of occupation      groups does not change over time,
      this procedure      effectively    eliminates any bias in the estimates due to
      unobserved      heterogeneity,     While we agree that it is plausible that the
      composition       of occupations     changes rather slowly, interpreting        fixed


    5These finding are consistent with results found in Card, Kramarz   and Lemieux   (1995)
for France using cell means for various demographic    groups.


                                             14
       effects coefficients for a period when returns are changing is more diffi-
       cult. We know that wages increased the fastest in more highly skilled
       occupations during the 1980s, A positive coefficient in the grouped
       regression is consistent with the unobserved                heterogeneity     explanation,
       if these are also the occupations           in which computer         use grew the most
       in the 1980s.      If this latter explanation          is correct,    then the effect of
       the change in computer usage should disappear once we control for a
       variable which captures the initial skill level in the occupation.

       In order to investigate        this, we replicated       Krueger’s      occupation      level
       regressions from the CPS. These are displayed in Table 9, Our results
       differ slightly from those reported            in Krueger        (1993 ).6     Column     (1)
       displays the results from Krueger’s             paper and column             (2) shows our
       results when only the change in the fraction of workers using computers
       is included    in the regression.          In column    (3) we include the level of
       1984 wage.      Since wage growth was higher for workers earning higher
       wages initially (Card and Lemieux              1996) this might control better for
       unobserved     heterogeneity     than the change in computer                 use. However,
       we find that this is not the case; the computer variable actually becomes
       even more important         while the base wage is insignificant,                The base
       wage is problematic       because temporary          components        in the wage and
       sampling error will lead to a spurious negative correlation                    between the
       change and the lagged level of the variable.                Aut or, Katz and Krueger
       (1995),   who are exploring        these issues concurrently            with our paper,
       suggest using the average education level in the occupation                     in the base
       period.   This is a powerful predictor of wage growth in the occupation
       (note well the increase in the R2).              Computer        use becomes      negative
       and insignificant     once schooling        is controlled     for,   This indicates that
       these regressions are not very robust to changes in specification.                   Wage
       growth in an occupation        in the 1980s seems more closely related to the
       skill level in the occupation      than to the growth in computer utilization.

   6. The returns to use of a computer             are higher for those with higher levels
       of schooling


    6See Appendix for details on our sample.        We are grateful to David Autor,       who has
also attempted  to replicate Krueger’s results,    for many useful discussions,




                                              15
    The interaction        between    computer           use and education        in the U.S. is
    positive,   significant,    and increasing over time. This is consistent with
    the skill–biased technical change explanation.                    Computers       make work-
    ers more productive.         The productivity            effect is larger for more skilled
    workers, for example for those with higher education.                        Since the more
    educated workers are the ones using more computers in the 1980s, part
    of the returns to computer use are being captured by education                        if com-
    puter use is not controlled           for.    Krueger calculates        that 40 percent of
    the increase in returns to education                   between      1984 and 1989 can be
    explained    by computer       use.

    The observed       pattern for the U.S. is also consistent                  with unobserved
    heterogeneity.     According      to this explanation,           computer     use proxies for
    productivity     which is rewarded in the labor market.                     Since the distri-
    bution of log wages is skewed to the right, the returns to unobserved
    skills might easily be higher for more highly educated                      workers, 7 Alter-
    natively, computer         use may proxy for more valuable skills among the
    more highly educated.         Furthermore, the spreading of the wage distribu-
    tion in the 1980s will exacerbate                 this effect. Therefore,    the interaction
    term between computer            use and education           might increase over time.

    Autor (1994) finds that the interaction between computer use and
    schooling is not very robust. The returns to school tend to be slightly
    lower at very low education             levels,       Workers who haven’t          completed
    elementary     school very rarely use computers                  and it may be this non-
    linearity that the computer/schooling                  interaction    picks up.
    When     we interact       computer     use and education            in our German        data
    sets we find the opposite         results from those found for the U.S. These
    results are reported        in Table 10. The interaction               terms are negative
    and significant.       We find the divergence               in results hard to reconcile
    with a skill biased technical change explanation. Both skills taught in
    school and technology are not fundamentally different in the U, S, and
    in Germany.       Thus, if computers               raised the productivity      of the more
    highly educated        to a greater extent than other workers we should see
    similar interaction      terms in both countries.             One potential explanation
    could be that returns for Germany                     do not reflect marginal products


71ndeed, this is exactly   the argument    made in Juhn,       Murphy    and Pierce (1993),


                                                 16
       very well because the German wage structure is too highly regulated,
       However,      if this is the case then we should               also find a much lower
       effect for computer     use in Germany           but that is not the case. Overall,
       the empirical evidence for a complementary                  between computer use and
       schooling,    which is at the core of the skill–biased technological                 change
       story, seems rather weak to US.



V.       Conclusion
Suppose a researcher sets out on a research project to determine the wage
differential associated with the use of computers on-the-job. Unfortunately,
his research assistant mistakenly pulled a variable “using pen or pencil”                        in-
stead of the desired variable on computer                use. Could the analyst have told
the difference      merely from the results of wage regressions?g                   According     to
our results in this paper we believe that this is unlikely since the wage dif-
ferentials associated     with the use of writing materials and computers                       look
extremely    similar. In addition, the wage differentials of tools like pencils re-
main significant even after controlling for grades, parent al background, and
a detailed set of occupations.   We are reasonably convinced that the use
of pens or pencils on the job most likely reflects unobserved                       heterogeneity
among workers and jobs not captured by these alternative controls.                         This ar-
gument is not evidence that the wage differential associated                       with computer
use may not represents returns for some workers generated by the computer
revolution. However, there are good reasons to be skeptical about this ex-
planation and instead to entertain the possibility that this coefficient mostly
reflects unobserved     heterogeneity.
     While a number of studies have appeared that have tried to address the
unobserved    heterogeneity        explanation     by including fixed effects in panel re-
gressions,   these results so far show little regularity.                Also,     panel data of-
ten lack sufficient detail on the introduction              of computers      at the workplace
to make these studies fully convincing.        Chennells and Van Reenen (1995)
present instrumental      variables results using R&D expenditures and patents
at the firm level as an instrument               for advanced      technologies.       While these

users, which would have indicated      the mistake.

results show little role for a causality running from technology                to wages we
do not find the exclusion        restrictions      in these regressions very compelling
either.
    Our skepticism about the effects of computers on wages is mirrored by the
recent literature that has tried to assess the effects of increased computer use
on productivity.      If the returns to computer         use reflect entirely productivity
effects, then the estimates in Krueger (1993) suggest that output in the U.S.
should have risen by 0.38 percent each year in the mid–1980s                   according     to
Sichel and Oliner (1994). They find that computers only raised growth by
about 0.16 percent age points using standard growth accounting techniques.
    Brynjolfsson      and Hitt (1993), on the other hand, find much higher implied
productivity    effects based on production          function    estimates using firm level
data.     According    to their estimates,      output    due to computers      should have
risen by about 1 additional       percentage       point per year. As they acknowledge
themselves,    their estimates    are subject       to the same problem       as Krueger’s:
firms with computers        may be more productive              but this may simply be a
reflection of unobserved      heterogeneity y among firms.          In addition,   their esti-
mates are for the late 1980s and early 1990s.               The productivity       effects, in
particular of PCs, may well have been much larger during this period than
during the earlier years when the new technology                 was first introduced.     The
introduction of PCs was probably             associated    with a substantial      period    of
learning about its most productive           uses.
    If it is true that it took until the late 1980s for large productivity          effects of
computers to emerge, labor economists are again in a dilemma, In this case
computers are unlikely to be the technology which led to skill–biased techno-
logical change. The returns to higher skill have changed relatively rapidly in
the earlier part of the 1980s but the spreading of the wage distribution                    has
slowed somewhat since the late 1980s (Bound and Johnson 1995). Thus, the
timing of the productivity       effects of the personal computer revolution             would
be entirely wrong to explain the empirical findings about wages,

Appendix:               Construction               of the CPS Sample
The sample we use for for the regressions reported in Table 9 differs slightly
from the one used by Krueger           (1993);    to maintain comparability        with his
results, however,     we followed    his procedures       rather closely.    The computer
variable is from all rotation groups of the 1984 and 1989 October                 CPS sup-
plements.      The sample includes all observations         with employment       status re-
code 1 or 2, ages 18-64 (this is the age range we believe Krueger (1993) uses
although his paper states that the range is 15-65), for which the answer to
the computer       question is not missing.
    The wage and education          variables are from the outgoing         rotation groups
for all twleve months of 1984 and 1989.             The samples include individuals
with employment        status recode    1 or 2, ages 18-64.        The wage variable is
constructed     as edited or computed earnings per week (the variable earnwke on
the National Bureau of Economic            Research (NBER)        Annual Earnings Files
(AEF))      divided by edited usual hours per week (uhourse in the NBER AEF).
For hourly workers this corresponds          to their answer to the CPS question 25c,
For salaried workers this corresponds         to usual earnings per week (item 25d)
divided by usual hours. 1989 wages are deflated to 1984 values by the GDP
deflator for consumer expenditures. Observations with hourly wages below
$1.50 or above $250 are deleted. The log wage for observations which are
topcoded in 1984 ( earnwke equal to 999) is set to 3.1 (the mean log wage for
all observations     with earnwke     >999    in 1989; this value differs slightly from
Krueger’s).
    Education      is years of schooling     completed.      Observations     with missing
values for wages or education        were deleted before forming cell means by oc-
cupation.     There are 480 occupations       with at least one observation       from the
wage and the computer        sample.    The square root of the number of observa-
tions in the 1989 wage sample for each occupation               is used as weight in the
regressions.
