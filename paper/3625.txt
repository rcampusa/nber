                PRODUCT DEMAND, COST OF PRODUCTION,
         SPILLOVERS, AND THE SOCIAL RATE OF RETURN TO R&D

                            ABSTRACT

     The purpose of this paper is to develop and estimate a model
of production with endogenous technological change.
Technological change arises from R&D capital accumulation

decisions. These decisions respond to market and government
incentives and generate R&D capital spillovers.
     A spillover network of senders and receivers is estimated.

The network shows that each receiving industry is affected by a
distinct set of R&D sources and each sending industry affects a

unique set of receivers. For the receivers, spillovers generally

expand product markets, lower product prices, increase production
costs and input demands. For the sources, significant R&D
spillovers cause the social rates of return to R&D capital to be
substantially above the private returns.

1. INTRODUCTION*

        Investing in research and development (R&D) leads to the development

   of new products and the introduction of new or modified production

   processes. However, knowledge transmission occurs at relatively low cost,

   so that R&D investors may not be able to completely appropriate the

   returns from their investment. This public good characteristic of

   knowledge implies that externalities or spillovers are associated with R&D

   capital accumulation.

        Theoretical work on industrial innovation has recognized the

   existence and importance of R&D capital spillovers. Spence (1984) showed

   that industry R&D investment increases with spillovers. However, because

   of appropriability difficulties individual firms reduce their R&D

   activities. Katz (1986) showed that the magnitude of spillovers and the

   nature of R&D sharing are important in the determination of industry

   output production and R&D activities. Moreover, he established that

   spillovers and cooperative research agreements generate distinct effects

   on social welfare.

        Recently, within the context of growth theory, Romer (1990) developed

   a model with product market power and R&D spillovers. R&D capital

   accumulation (which is the endogenous source of technological change) in

   conjunction with spillovers cause product market size to expand and

   thereby increase the output growth rate. In addition, R&D spillovers

   generate a divergence between social and private returns to R&D capital.

  Aghion and Uowitt (1990) show that R&D capital and spillovers affect

   output growth through the enhancement of market power for some producers,

  while other producers suffer an erosion of their monopoly profit.
                                  -2-



      The theories of industrial innovation and secular growth both

 emphasize the role of R&D capital as a source of endogenous technological

change and the spillovers that emanate from R&D investment. R&D

spillovers are a form of externality that arise from the nonrivairous, but

at least partially excludable character of R&D capital formation (see

Griliches [1979] and Romer [1990] for discussions on this point). Also,

in a number of studies done over the past decade, the demand for R&D

capital has been modeled as an endogenous input, which is determined

simultaneously with other production decisions (see Nadiri and Schankerman

[1981], Mohrten, Nadiri and Prucha [1986], Bernstein [19881 and Bernstein

and Nadiri [1988, 1989]). The empirical results confirm that the demand

for R&D capital responds to changes in output and input prices, including

the service price or rental rate of R&D capital itself. In addition, the

empirical findings establish that R&D capital is a nonrivalrous input.

Once R&D capital stock exists, it can be used freely by many producers

throughout the economy.

     There are a number of distinctive features of R&D spillovers.     First,

spillovers emanate from investment in R&D. The causality runs from R&D

capital to R&D spillovers which, in turn, influence output supply and

input demand decisions. Second, R&D spillovers generally affect both

product demand and production characteristics. Thus there are pecuniary

and technological externalities associated with spillovers. Firms can

find that both their product price and production cost are affected by the

R&D capital accumulation of other firms in the economy. Third, spillovers

are intertempora]. externalities because the transmission of R&D spillovers
                                -3-



arises from R&D capital stocks. R&D capital stocks exist because current

expenditures on R&D give rise to a stream of future benefits. These

future benefits do not solely accrue to those agents who incurred the past

expenditures but also to other agents in the economy. Thus the existence

of R&D spillovers implies that past R&D decisions of one firm can affect

the current product price and production cost of other firms.'

     The purpose of this paper is to develop and estimate a model of

production in which R&D spillovers influence both product demand and

production characteristics. Producers maximize the expected present value

of the flow of funds by selecting output supply and input demands,

including R&D capital. The demand for R&D capital, which is the source of

endogenous technological change, is determined in accordance with the

rules of intertemporal profit maximization and is therefore influenced by

market incentives and government policy. Producers exhibit product market

power and so are able to influence product prices through output and R&D

capital decisions. R&D capital accumulation improves product quality;

therefore producers can charge higher prices for their products.

     In the model, R&D spillovers arise from the R&D capital stocks.

These spillovers affect product prices and Costs of production or, in

other words, the profitability of recipient producers. Spillovers also

influence input demands and output supplies. In this paper the effects of

R&D spillovers on product price, cost and the structure of production are

estimated. An important Implication from spillovers influencing product

price and production cost is that borrowed R&D capital can generate both

positive and negative effects on profitability. At current prices
                                 -4-



producers can find that product demand has fallen as a result of R&D

investment (in other words, the development of new products or product

characteristics) undertaken by other firms in the economy. R&D spillovers

can erode the size of product markets and market power.2

     In the empirical literature various ways have been adopted to measure

R&D spillovers. The pool of R&D spillovers or of borrowed R&D has been

defined as the sum of R&D expenditures (see Criliches [1964], Evenson and

Kislev [1973], and Levin and Reiss [1984, 1988)), the sum of R&D capital

stocks (see Bernstein [1988], and Bernstein and Nadiri [1989)), and the

patent weighted sum of R&D expenditures (see Scherer [1982, 1984],

Griliches and Lichtenberg [1984), and Jaffe [1986]). In all these studies

the pool of borrowed R&D was defined as a single variable. Thus each

spillover source was aggregated into a single pooi of borrowed R&D

capital. Due to the scalar definition of borrowed R&D, the emphasis of

the literature has centered on the effects of R&D spillovers on the

profitability and production structure of recipient producers.

     As an alternative to the scalar notion of spillover, Bernstein and

Nadiri (1988) introduced the vectorization of borrowed R&D capital. In

this paper each producer is treated as a distinct spillover source so that

from the estimation results a spillover network (or matrix) of senders and

receivers is derived. R&D spillovers also create a divergence between the

social and private rates of return to R&D capital. The social rate of

return equals the private rate plus the change in profit due to R&D

spillovers. In this paper, the social and private rates of return to R&D

capital are estimated. Moreover, because a spillover network is derived,
                                      -5-



   the wedge between the social and private returns is decomposed among the

   spillover-receiving producers.

         The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In section two

   the model of production and spillovers is developed. Section three

   contains a discussion of the data and estimation results. In the fourth

   section the spillover network is derived along with the effects of

   spillovers on product prices, production costs, output supplies and factor

   demands. Section five pertains to the calculation and decomposition of

   the social and private rates of return to R&D capital. In the last

   section the results are summarized and conclusions are drawn.




2. THE MODEL OF INTERINDUSTRY SPILLOVERS

         Cost of production is affected by the R&D capital of producers

   throughout the economy. Thus traditional cost functions must be amended

   to incorporate the externality associated with R&D capital accumulation.

   The representative variable cost function can be written as



   (1)    c" — Cv(wt, Yt' K.,    S)


   where cV is the normalized (by the uth variable factor price) variable

   cost, C" is the twice continuously differentiable variable cost function,

     is the n-l dimensional vector of relative variable factor prices, y is

   the output quantity, K is the m dimensional vector of capital inputs,

   which includes own R&D capital (Kr) tK is the m dimensional vector of net
                                              -6-



investment (K1.              IKi -   K1.jJ,   i— l,...,in), S is the i dimensional vector

of R&D capital associated with all producers other than the representative

one

            R&D capital affects variable cost in three ways.4 First, a larger

own R&D capital input means lower variable cost if R&D is process-oriented

since a larger knowledge base is used to combine the variable factors of

production (acv/aKr < 0). However, if R&D is product-oriented then

quality improvements are costly to undertake (8CV/ôKr > 0). Second,

investment in R&D implies that producers incur adjustment costs as they

divert variable inputs from output production to R&D investment

(ÔC"/MKr > 0, see Mohnen, Nadiri and Prucha [19861). Third, there are

spillovers associated with increases in R&D capital of other producers in

the economy, which leads to cost reductions for the representative

producer (3cV/3S <0, j— l,...,1).

            The specific form of the (net of adjustment cost) variable cost and

adjustment cost functions are given by



(2.1) lnc         —        + 'j filnw + ylny +             k<kt
                      +      lnwlny +                   1nlnK.

                              1Pkqktqt

where c" is now normalized (net of adjustment cost) variable cost, ce is

normalized adjustment cost, and                  —
                                                     ,qk (equations (2.1) and (2.2) can be
                                  -7-



combined with just a renormalization of the 'q parameters). The

functional form for variable cost is restricted translogarithmic in terms

of the non-spillover variables (see Schankerman and Nadiri [1986]). The

functional form for adjustment cost implies that marginal adjustment costs

are zero when net investment is zero (see Morrison and Berndt [1981] and

Mohnen, Nadiri and Frucha [1986]). With respect to the spillover

variables, the functional form is nonlinear in the spillover parameters

and linear in the logarithms of the spillover variables. The parameter

nonlinearity arises from the interaction between the spillovers, factor

prices, capital inputs and output quantity. Moreover, the interaction

enables the spillovers to exert differential effects on output and each of

the inputs. This result emerges from the fr,       and     parameters in

equation set (2). The vectorization of borrowed R&D implies that each

spillover source can generate a distinct effect on variable cost, output

supply and factor demands. These differential source effects are

manifested by the /3 parameters in equation set (2). The terms borrowed

and spilled are used interchangeably. The borrowing or spillover

processes are not modeled explicitly in this paper.

     The pool of borrowed R&D capital that affects variable cost is given

by the term I_1lnSI. The sources comprising the spillover pool

affecting variable cost are determined within the estimation of the model

and simultaneously with the effects on spillover recipients. These

sources are characterized by the estimation of the j9 parameters. If        —

o then   the jth producer is not a source of spillover through production

cost to the representative industry.

      The accumulation of the capital stocks occurs by the following

processes,



(3)          K. —   I   + (Im ti' K0 >


where I, is vector of gross investment, 'm is the m dimensional identity

matrix and S is the m dimensional diagonal identity matrix of depreciation

rates such that 0       S   1 i—l,...,m.6

      Product demand is influenced by R&D spillovers. The representative

inverse product demand function is



(4)          Pt —   D(y, Krt z, S)


where p is the relative product price, D is the twice continuously

differentiable inverse product demand function, and z is a vector of

exogenous variables which affect product demand.7 Product demand is

affected by the vector of R&D spillovers and own R&D capital. R&D capital

quantities represent product quality indicators. Moreover, product

quality changes arise from current and past R&D investment decisions and

not solely from contemporaneous expenditures for product improvements.

Product quality improvements arising from own R&D capital   imply that

product price increases (ap/aK>O). However, spillovers that affect

product demand can either generate positive or negative price effects.

R&D capital is not arbitrarily separated into process R&D that only

affects production cost and product R&D that only affects product demand.
                                       .9-



R&D capital affects both cost and demand. It is the parameterization of

the variable cost and inverse product demand functions that permits the

determination of the product and process influences of R&D capital.

      The specific form of the inverse product demand function is



(5)    lnp —       + a7lny + arlnK      +     _1alnz+ ayrlnytlnKrt
               +                   +   _iarjlnKrtlnZjt
               + (a5lny + arslnKrt)_iajlnsjt.


The inverse    product demand function is nonlinear in the spillover

parameters and linear in the logarithms of the spillover variables.8

      R&D spillovers affect output and R&D capital through the                      and

parameters. Each spillover source generates a distinct effect on product

price through the a parameters. Indeed the pooi of borrowed R&D capital

affecting product demand is given by I_1a1nS .                   As is the case for

spillovers affecting production cost, the pool of borrowed R&D affecting

product demand is determined within the estimation of the model and

simultaneously with the effects on spillover recipients.

      Production decisions are governed by the maximization of the expected

present value of the flow of funds. Thus                                        -

existing information and are formed over future relative variable factor

prices and capital purchase prices.

        The specific equilibrium conditions defined by (6) can be found by

using equations (2), (3), and (5), applying Shephard's Lemma (see Diewert

[1974]) and carrying out the maximization. The equilibrium conditions

are,

a(s,s+l) — (l+p1Y',    the superscript e denotes the conditional expectation

of a variable.

     Equation set (7.1) denotes the equilibrium conditions for the

variable factors of production. In equilibrium the ith variable factor

cost share is directly affected by the pool of borrowed R&D that

influences production cost through the fl       parameters.9
     The equilibrium condition for output is given by equation (7.2). In

equilibrium the revenue to cost ratio is influenced by spillovers that

affect both product price and production cost. Spillovers altering

product price affect the revenue to cost ratio through the inverse price

elasticity of product demand, as          delimits how the spillover pool

changes the inverse price elasticity. In addition, spillovers affecting

production cost influence the revenue to cost ratio through the variable

cost flexibility.'0 This effect is manifested through fifl.

     Equation set (7.3) characterizes the equilibrium conditions for the

non-R&D capital inputs. In equilibrium the marginal cost of a non-R&D

capital input, which consists of the user cost and the marginal adjustment

cost, is offset by the expected marginal benefit, which consists of the

variable cost reduction in period s and the future adjustment cost

reduction from having a larger capital input. Clearly, adjustment costs

create the intertemporal links. These costs generate the trade-off

between marginal cost increases in period s and marginal cost decreases in

period s+l. In addition, R&D spillovers affecting production cost

influence the equilibrium conditions for non-R&D capital inputs directly

through the ,    kr,   k—l,.. .,m parameters.

        Equation   (7.4) shows the equilibrium condition for the R&D capital

   input. This condition is different from the other capital input

   equations. R&D capital not only affects variable cost but also product

   price. Thus the marginal benefit associated with R&D capital consists of

   increases in marginal revenue, net of changes in variable cost as well as

   variable adjustment cost reductions. The revenue component arises from

   the ar, a.,r, ars parameters. In addition, the R&D capital equilibrium

   condition is affected by both sets of spillovers through the      and

   parameters

        The equilibrium conditions along with the variable cost and inverse

   product demand functions point out how spillovers influence the array of

   production decisions, including the intertemporal trade-offs associated

   with R&D and non-R&D capital inputs.




3. THE DATA AND ESTD(&TION RESULTS

        Data was obtained for six industries for the period 1957-1986. The

   six industries are chemical and allied products (SIC 28), fabricated metal

   prducts (SIC 34), nonelectrical machinery (SIC 35), electrical products

   (SIC 36), transportation equipment (SIC 37), and scientific instruments

   (SIC 38). These industries account for 92% of manufacturing R&D

   expenditures on average over the sample period.

        The data on the quantities of output, labor, physical capital and

   intermediate inputs as well as the data on price indices were obtained

   from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (see Gullickson and Harper [1986) for

   a detailed description of the data).
                                         - 13   -




      For each industry the output quantity is measured as the value of
gross output divided by the output price index. There are two variable

factors, labor and intermediate inputs. The wage rate is defined as the

labor price index normalized to one at 1982.             The labor input quantity is

measured as the labor cost divided by the labor price index. The price of

intermediate inputs is derived from a Tornqvist index (normalized at 1982)

of the prices of materials, energy, and purchased services. The quantity

of intermediate inputs is measured as the total cost of materials, energy.

and purchased services divided by the price index of intermediate inputs.

      There are two quasi-fixed factors, physical capital and R&D capital.

Physical capital is defined as the sum of structures and equipment capital

stocks. The deflator of physical capital is derived as a Tornqvist index

of the acquisition price indices of structures and equipment,

respectively. The rental rate of physical capital is defined as

  —
      pi,(   + Li,)   (1 -    -u     z) where pi, is the physical capital deflator,

p is the discount rate, which is taken to be the rate on Treasury bonds of

ten-year maturity, Li,       is   the physical capital depreciation rate, i,   is   the

investment tax credit, u is the corporate income tax rate, and z is the

present value of capital consumption allowances.

      R&D capital is defined as the accumulation of deflated R&D

expenditures." The R&D expenditures were obtained from the National

Science Foundation (1987 and earlier issues). The deflator of R&D capital

is constructed by linking Mansfield's (1985) constructed deflator series

forward with the CNP deflator and backward with Schankerman's (1979)

constructed R&D deflator series. Initial deflated R&D expenditures are
                                - 14     -




grossed up by the average annual growth rate of physical capital for the
period 1948-1956 in order to obtain initial R&D capital stock. Given the

initial stock, R&D capital is developed according to the perpetual

inventory formula using declining balance depreciation. The depreciation

rate is taken to be 10 percent. This rate is similar to the ones used in

other studies (Mohnen, Nadiri, Prucha [1986] used 10 percent and Jaffe

[1986) used 15 percent). Little is known about R&D capital depreciation,

but Hulten and Wykoff (1981) found that for assets which are used in R&D

activities depreciation ranged from 10% to 20%.12 The rental rate on R&D

capital is defined as Wr — Pr(P +   6)       (l -   - u)   where Pr is the R&D

price deflator, 6r is the R&D capital depreciation rate equal to 0.1 and

r is the incremental R&D tax credit.

     The exogenous variable affecting product demand for any one industry

is defined as real gross domestic product (GDP) net of the industry output

divided by population. This variable captures the effect of real income

for those agents who demand the product.

     The estimation model consists of the variable cost function (equation

(2.1)), the inverse product demand function (equation (5)) and the output

and input equilibrium conditions (equations (7.1) -        (7.4)).   There are six

equations to be estimated for each of the six industries. The endogenous

variables are product price, variable cost, labor cost share, output

quantity, physical capital, and R&D capital inputs. Optimfring errors are

added to equations (2.1), (5), (7.1) and (7.2). The errors associated

with equations (7.3) and (7.4) upon removal of the conditional

expectations operator represent unanticipated information which become
                                  - 15   -




available   after the time that the capital decisions are made. Thus the

conditional expected value of the error is zero at the time of the capital

decisions. It is also assumed that the errors have zero mean and positive

definite symmetric covariance matrix.

     The estimation model consists of equations which contain expected

future values of variables (see equations (7.3) and (7.4)). In order to

estimate these Euler equations, Hansen and Singleton (1982) developed a

generalized method of moments estimator, which has been shown by Pindyck

and Rotemberg (1982) when the errors are homoskedastic, to be equivalent

to the nonlinear three stage least squares estimator (see Jorgenson and

Laffont [1974]). This estimator involves the selection of instruments.

Lagged values of relative factor prices, relative product price, variable

cost, output, physical and R&D   capital,    and real net CD? per capita are

the instruments selected. The estimator is consistent and efficient (for

the set of instruments that are used).

        The estimation results are shown in appendix Table Al. In order to

identify the parameters, without loss of generality the restriction Pr. —

ar. —   1 is imposed. The set of spillover sources for each receiving

industry is determined in the following manner. First, all spillover

sources are entered into the model which is then estimated. The spillover

sources that generate a negative impact effect on variable cost are

retained.14 The model is again estimated with the remaining spillovers.

The process is repeated until all spillover sources generate variable cost

reductions. To guarantee that the acceptance of a spillover source is not

biased by the order in which sources are rejected, the model is estimated
                                 - 16   -




a number of times with the different spillover sources considered in

various combinations. For each industry the accepted spillover sources

always converged to the ones outlined by the parameters in Table Al. In

addition, the parameters associated with any set of spillovers must be

consistent with the restrictions on the variable cost function or more

generally the second order conditions of the maximization problem defined

by (6).

     The acceptance condition for spillover sources is quite general.

First, it is consistent with the assumption of free disposability in

production. If spillovers are cost increasing then producers have the

option of eliminating them from their production process. Producers can

costlessly dispose of spillovers. Second, the criterion is based upon

variable cost and not total cost. Spillovers that increase total cost are

not rejected. Fixed costs associated with R&D capital can increase with

spillovers. In order to absorb the spillovers, additional R&D investment

may have to be undertaken, thereby increasing total cost. Third, the

acceptance condition does not restrict spillovers that affect product

price. R&D spillovers can either increase or decrease product price and

thereby generate positive or negative revenue effects, given the size of

product markets.

     The estimation results from Table Al imply that the estimated

magnitudes of the eridogenous variables are positive and the variable cost

function is concave with respect to variable factor prices, and convex in

physical capital and adjustment cost is convex in physical and R&D

investment. In addition, variable profit (revenue minus variable cost) is
                                   - 17   -




concave in output and R&D capital. These conditions are satisfied at each

point in the sample and for each industry.

     The results show that the standard errors of the estimates are

generally small relative to the estimates. The standard errors of each of

the equations is also small. The square of the correlation coefficients

between the actual and predicted values of the endogenous variables are

generally high and residual plots did not point out any significant serial

correlation. The estimated model seems to fit the data quite well and

satisfies the integrability conditions.

     The dynamic features of the model are associated with the capital

adjustment parameters, ,&,        and         The wedge between the expected

marginal benefit due to capital expansion and the respective rental rate

arises from the significance of the adjustment cost parameters. In

general, from Table Al, the adjustment parameters are statistically

significant for each industry. Besides the own adjustment cost parameters

(pa, i —   p,r),   which are all positive as required, there is also the

cross adjustment parameter ipr• In five of six industries (electrical

products is the exception) the cross parameter is significant and

positive. Thus an increase in net investment for physical (R&D) capital

stock increases adjustment cost for the R&D (physical) capital stock.

     Contemporaneous marginal adjustment cost is equal to the difference

between the expected marginal benefit and rental rate for each capital

input. If marginal adjustment cost is zero, then the expected marginal

benefit per dollar of the ith capital service equals the respective rental

rate. Table 1 shows the marginal adjustment cost per dollar of capital

   service   for each type of capital. For a dollar spent on additional

   physical capital, industries incur adjustment costs ranging from $0.25 to

   $0.87. Transportation equipment is at the low end of the range while

   fabricated metal is at the high end. The range among the industries of

   marginal adjustment cost per dollar of R&D capital service is greater than

   for physical capital. The range for R&D capital is from $0.07 to $0.46,

   with transportation equipment at the low end and scientific instruments is

   at the high end. Table 1 shows that each industry must incur significant

   adjustment costs when either R&D or physical capital stocks are increased.

   These adjustment costs imply that there is an intertemporal trade-off in

   the decision to accumulate both physical and R&D capital inputs (see

   equations (7.3) and (7.4)). Thus both types of capital inputs are,

   indeed, quasi-fixed factors.




4. R&D SPILLOVERS, PRICE, COST, AND PRODUCTION

        There is a different set of spillover sources for each recipient

    industry. Table 2 shows the spillover network. This table is derived by

   considering the j9, a j — 28, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38 parameter estimates from

   Table Al. As can be seen from Table 2, each industry is a receiver of R&D

    spillovers and five of six industries are spillover sources (fabricated

   metal is not a spillover source). In addition, four of the industries are

    affected by a single source, one industry is affected by two sources and

    one industry is affected by three sources. However, even in the case of

    multiple sources, for each receiving industry the spillover parameters are

equal across source industries. For each receiving industry, the
interindustry spillover sources tend to be concentrated in a few

industries. Thus using aggregate R&D expenditures, or aggregate R&D

capital, or producer weighted sums of these variables appears to be too

broad a measure of R&D spillovers. When allowance is made to account for

individual spillover sources, there is a narrow range of source industries

for each receiving industry. In addition, each source only affects a few

industries. There are not more than three industries affected by any one

source. Thus for each spillover sender or receiver the network is

relatively narrow. However, since the collection of senders and receivers

is not symmetric, the network involves all of the industries.

      Spillovers influence production decisions by first altering product

price and production cost for any receiving industry. To see these

initial effects hold output and the capital inputs fixed and differentiate

equations (2) and (5) with respect to the spillover variables,

Equation (8.1) shows the product    price effect associated with R&D

spillovers and equation (8.2)     shows the cost-reducing effect associated

with spillovers. An increase in product price, given output, physical and

R&D   capital inputs, as a   result of R&D   spillovers    means that revenue

increases for the recipient industry. The converse is true for decreases

in product price.
                                - 22   -




     The product price and cost reduction effects are presented in Table

3. Four of the six industries, namely fabricated metal, nonelectrical

machinery, electrical products, and transportation equipment are

recipients of negative price effects. Thus at existing output and R&D

capital levels, R&D spillovers cause product prices to fall. These

negative elasticities vary significantly across industries; the range is

from -0.05% to -0.16%. Chemical products and scientific instruments are

the two industries where R&D spillovers increase their product price. The

magnitude is from 0.03% for scientific instruments to 0.05% for chemical

products. For all the industries, the effects of spillovers that

influence product price are very stable over the sample period.

     The cost reductions, for each industry, are also stable over the

sample. A 1% increase in R&D spillovers causes a range of variable cost

reductions from 0.05% to 0.24%. The major beneficiary of spillover-

generated cost reductions is fabricated metal, while chemical products

receive the smallest reduction in their cost. From Table 3 by

substracting cost reductions from the price effects (since cost reductions

increase profit), the effect of R&D spillovers on the profitability of

each recipient industry can be determined (given output, physical and R&D

capital inputs). Spillovers increase variable profit for each industry

except chemical products, where the cost-reduction and price increase

offset each other.'5 The increases in 1985 are 0.086% for fabricated

metal, 0.061% for nonelectrical machinery, 0.054% for electrical products,

0.062% transportation equipment, and 0.050% for scientific instruments.

When R&D spillovers cause variable profit to grow, not only is the effect

stable over time, but also quite similar across industries.

     The significance of adjustment costs associated with both physical

and R&D capital implies that industries are in short-run equilibrium. In

the short run producers treat capital inputs as fixed factors and the

equilibrium relates to product price, variable cost, variable input and

output quantities.

     The effects of R&D spillovers on equilibrium are given by



                                                                   -

spillover elasticity on conditional (output fixed) labor demand and s1 is

the labor cost share.16 There are three terms in the numerator of

equation (9.1). The first term shows the direct effect of spillovers on

output supply through changes in product price and variable cost, the

second term shows the indirect effect through variable cost and the last

term shows the indirect spillover effect through product price. Equations

 (9.2), (9.3), and (9.4) point out that spillovers affect product price,

variable cost, and variable factor demands directly and also indirectly

 through changes in output supply.

       Table 4 shows the spillover elasticities of output supply, product
  price, variable cost, labor and intermediate input demands. An increase

   in R&D spillovers in each industry causes output to expand and thereby

  product price to fall. Indeed, even for the two industries where R&D

   spillovers increase product price, given output and the capital inputs

   (namely chemical products and scientific instruments), the output

   expansion effect arising from the spillovers is sufficiently strong to

   cause product prices to fall. In addition, the sum of the output and

   price elasticities shows the effect on revenue as R&D spillovers increase.

   For each industry, R&D spillovers generate revenue growth. Thus, R&D

   spillovers cause the size of the product markets to expand.

        Once output expands from the spillovers, then variable production

   cost increases. Thus, the effect of the growth in output outweighs the

   initial cost-reduction due to the spillovers. Moreover, in each industry

   the demands for labor and intermediate inputs increase as a result of R&D

   spillovers. Technological change, represented by R&D spillovers, causes

   product markets to grow and this expansion leads to increases in labor and

   intermediate inputs.




5. RATES   OF   RETURN TO CAPITAL

        Rates of return to physical and R&D capital differ because of

   adjustment costs and spillovers. Private rates of return can differ among

   the two types of capital because expected marginal benefits are equated to

   rental rates and marginal adjustment costs. Differences in marginal

adjustment   costs between physical and R&D capital create differences in

their private returns. R&D spillovers define externalities which affect

product price and production cost, as a consequence, social rates of

return to R&D can differ from their private returns. There are no

externalities associated with physical capital and hence its social rate

of return is equated to its private rate.

The before tax net of depreciation private rates of return to the capital

stocks are derived from equations (7.3) and (7.4) by re-arranging terms in

each equation and using the definition of rental rates



(10) p — Pt +        iLq                     k —   p,r

where p represents the remaining terms in equations (7.3) or (7.4). In

equilibrium, the private rate of return on the kth capital equals the

discount rate plus the capitalized value of marginal adjustment cost per

dollar of the kth capital. The private rate of return to R&D capital, as

defined in this paper, is the rate of return accruing to an industry.'7

     In order to calculate the social rates of return to R&D capital a

welfare function must be specified because R&D spillovers affect product

demand, as well as cost of production. However, the present task is more

limited in scope. The purpose here is to calculate the difference between

social and private rates of return when both rates are evaluated at the

equilibrium levels of output supply and input demands. To undertake the

calculation, consider a situation where the R&D spillovers are

internalized by the industries. In this case the joint industry expected

discounted flow of funds is given by

where ''   is       defined at the equilibrium levels of output supply and input

demands. Now since the R&D spillovers have been internalized, there are

additional profits to be earned from each of the different R&D capital

stocks. The additional profit implies additional return and the extra

return is the increase in Z from R&D spillovers. Thus, using equations

(2) and (5),

                                +



The additional return on each R&D capital stock equals the net product

price and cost-reduction effects arising from the R&D spillovers. This

means that the social rates of return on the R&D capital stocks, evaluated

in equilibrium, are defined as



(13)        —          +   (l+p8)   (a/aK.)/q

These   social rates of return, denoted as                  are essentially sectoral

rates of return to the R&D capital stocks, while                  are industrial rates

of return. From equation (13) spillover-generated increases in product
                                  - 29   -




price   and cost reductions cause the gap to widen between the rates of

return to R&D capital.

     Table S shows the contributions to the social rates of return arising

from the spillovers associated with the R&D capital of each industry. For

each source industry, the effects are decomposed by spillover recipient.

Chemical products affects the variable profit, through product price and

variable cost, of nonelectrical machinery, and scientific instruments.

Table 5 shows that the spillovers from chemical products generate price

reductions in nonelectrical machinery and price increases in scientific

instruments. However, the cost reduction caused by chemical products on

nonelectrical machinery is greater (in absolute value) than the decrease

in price. Thus the net return to R&D capital, from the spillovers on

nonelectrical machinery, is positive and in 1985 is 0.156. The return to

R&D capital in 1985 from scientific instruments is 0.090.

     The fabricated metal industry does not generate spillovers.

Nonelectrical machinery induces spillovers on transporation equipment. In

1985 the net return on R&D capital, from the product price and cost

reductions, is 0.155. Electrical products also affects only one industry,

scientific instruments. In 1985 the return to R&D capital of electrical

products from scientific instruments is 0.045.

     The spillovers from transportation equipment affect fabricated metal,

nonelectrical machinery and scientific instruments. As a result of the

spillovers, product prices decrease for fabricated metal and nonelectrical

machinery, but the net returns to the R&D capital of transportation

equipment from the two industries are positive and in 1985 are 0.039 and

0.049 respectively. The return from scientific instruments in 1985 is
0.029.

     The spillovers from scientific instruments affect chemical products

and electrical products. These spillovers decrease the product price for

electrical products but the cost reduction effect is such that the net

return is positive arid in 1985 is 0.137 from electrical products. The

return from chemical products in 1985 is 0.447.

     The general conclusions that emerge are that three of the five

sending industries affect multiple industries. Three of the sources

industries cause product price reductions for spillover recipients.

However, the R&D capital for each source industry generates a positive net

contribution to the social rate of return from each of its spillover

recipients. Lastly, chemical products, nonelectrical machinery and

scientific instruments are the main spillover source industries.

     From Table 5, for each spillover source, adding the product price and

variable cost generated returns from the spillovers over all recipients to

the private rate of return to R&D capital equals the social rate of

return. Table 6 shows the before tax net of depreciation rates of return

to physical and R&D capital. Marginal adjustment cost per dollar of

physical capital stock is not significantly different from the magnitude

for R&D capital so that the before-tax private rates of return are quite

similar. This result appears at each point in the sample and for each

industry. However, there are significant returns to R&D spillovers. In

five of the six industries the social rate of return to R&D capital

exceeds the private rate. In 1985 the smallest percentage difference
                                   - 32   -




   between the social and private returns is about 20% and is exhibited by

   electrical products. The percentage difference is slightly less than 50%

   for transportation equipment in 1985. The greatest deviation between

   returns is observed from scientific instruments. In this case the

   difference is 200% in 1985. For the chemical products and nonelectrical

   machinery industries the social rate of return is about twice the private

   rate in 1985. Thus, in general, the social rates exceed the private rate,

   and there is also a great deal of variation across spillover source

   industries as to the extent of the wedge between returns. In addition, it

   is possible to generate significant social rates of return to R&D capital

   by only affecting a few receiving industries. The spillover reach does

   not have to be extensive for social rates to exceed private rates of

   return.




6. CONCLUSION

        In this paper a dynamic model of production and endogenous

   technological change was developed and estimated. Technological change

   arose from the R&D capital accumulation decisions by producers. These

   decisions were governed by the conditions of intertemporal profit

   maximization and were formed simultaneously with output, input and

   physical capital accumulation decisions.

        The accumulation of R&D capital generated spillovers because of the

   nonrivairous but excludable character of R&D capital. The spillover

   network that was estimated showed that each receiving industry was

affected   by a distinct set of R&D sources and each sending industry

affected a unique set of receivers. Among the spillover recipients both

product demand and production characteristics were affected by R&D

spillovers. Spillovers caused output (or product market size) to

increase, which in turn, caused product price to fall, production cost and

input demands to increase. Among the spillover sources, although private

rates of return (net of depreciation and before tax) to physical and R&D

capital were not dissimilar, R&D spillovers caused the social returns to

be significantly greater than the private returns to R&D capital.

     There are a number of further areas of research with respect to R&D

spillovers. First, R&D spillovers could be an important source of the

international transmission of knowledge. International spillovers could

increase the rate of knowledge diffusion among trading partners, such as

the U.S. and Japan. Second, R&D spillovers can be an important source of

knowledge transmission between nonmarket organizations, such as

universities and industrial organizations. R&D spillover links between

the two types of organizations could be important contributors to the

social rates of return to R&D capital in the economy.

1. There are other public goods which give rise to similar externalities as

    R&D   capital.   For example, roads, bridges and airports have some of the

    same type of characteristics as R&D       capital.
2. Spillovers that affect product demand are like quality changes. Quality

    improvements associated with some products can decrease demand for other

    products. These quality changes are based on the accumulation of R&D

    investment.
3. Variable factors only generate hiring costs, while the capital inputs (or

    quasi-fixed factors) generate user and adjustment costs. The adjustment

    costs are reflected by the net investment vector in the domain of the

    variable cost function. Given output, capital inputs and spillovers, an

    increase in net investment causes variable cost to rise (see Morrison and

    Berndt [1981] and Mohnen, Nadiri and Prucha [1986]). Although a single

    output is assumed, the model can be generalized to multiple outputs. The

    subscript t represents the time period.

4. In general the normalized variable cost function is nondecreasing,
                                       - 36   -




   homogeneous of degree zero and concave in the variable factor prices, (the
   non-normalized variable cost function is homogeneous of degree one in

   variable factor prices) nondecreasing in output, nonincreasing and convex

   in non-R&D capital inputs and nondecreasing and convex in non-R&D net

    investments. There are few restrictions associated with output and own

   R&D   capital   because these variables also affect product price and hence

   revenue. The production process summarized by equation (1) is not

    restricted to exhibit constant returns to scale.

5. The reduction of variable cost due to spillovers is a manifestation of

    free disposability in production. If spillovers increase cost then

    producers have the option of not using them in their production process as

    spillovers can be costlessly disposed.

6. It is assumed that capital services are proportional to the capital

    stocks.

7. The inverse product demand function is nonincreasing in output and

    nondecreasing in own R&D capital. Product demand is specified in terms of

    a function directly rather than derived from a utility function because

    not all customers facing the producers are consumers.

8. More general functional forms for the inverse product demand function were

    used in the estimation of the model but they failed to improve the

    results.

9. There are n-l variable factor demandequations because the nth variable

    factor equation is linearly dependent on the first n-l equations

    w18v13/c'— 1).
10. Variable cost flexibility is the output elasticity of variable cost (see
                                      - 37




   Jorgenson [1986]).

11. The R&D components of labor and intermediate inputs were substracted from

   their respective categories, in order that there would not be any double

   counting among the factors of production which include R&D   expenditures.
12. Previous work showed that estimation results are not affected by

   depreciation rates between 8% and 12%.

13. The subscript k referring to the parameters pertaining to the capital

    inputs are now subscripted with p for physical capital and r for R&D

   capital.

14. The negative impact effect means that spillovers reduce variable cost,

    given output, physical and R&D   capital   inputs.

15. For the chemical products industry the only spillover parameters were

    and a38 (see Table Al). Moreover, the null hypothesis that 38 + a38     — 0

    is not rejected. Thus by equations (8.1) and (8.2) variable cost

    reduction offsets product price increase.

16. The intermediate input demand effect can be derived from the spillover

    elasticity of labor demand since the former is the residual variable

    factor.

17. Equation (10) is just another way of writing the equilibrium conditions

    for the capital inputs. Indeed, p is defined as the before tax expected

    marginal benefit of the kth capital, net of depreciation per dollar of the

    kth capital stock.
