                                           ABSTRACT

       This paper examines the importance of financial constraints for firm investment expenditures
by looking at the relationship between investment expenditures and proceeds from voluntary asset
sales in financially healthy US manufacturing companies. Specifically, we examine whether asset
sales have a greater influence on investment expenditures for firms that are likely to be financially
constrained. Asset sales may provide a cleaner indicator of liquidity than cash flow since it appears
not to be positively correlated with future investment opportunities. The cross-sectional differences
in firm investment expenditures are examined using an endogenous switching regression model with
unknown sample separation, which does not require an a priori classification of firms or knowledge
of their financial constraints. We find that after controlling for investment opportunities and cash
generated from operations, cash obtained from asset sales is a significant determinant of corporate
investment. Moreover, the sensitivity of investment to proceeds from asset sales is significantly
stronger for firms that are likely to be associated with characteristics associated with financial
constraints.

1. Introduction

        There is a growing literature that suggests that because of information asymmetries and

capital market imperfections, corporate investment expenditures are strongly influenced by a

firm’s ability to internally generate cash flow. Consistent with the view that the correlation

between investment expenditures and cash flows is due to financing constraints, researchers have

found that the sensitivity of investment expenditures to cash flows are much stronger for firms

that are likely to be financially constrained [Fazzari, Hubbard, and Petersen (1988), Hoshi,

Kashyap, and Scharfstein (1988), Whited (1992), Gilchrist and Himmelberg (1995), Hubbard

(1998), and other].

        Recent papers by Kaplan and Zingales (1997) and Cleary (1999) question the

interpretation advanced by the previous studies and suggest that the sensitivity of firm investment

to internal capital might be caused by other factors that have been overlooked. Specifically, they

report that the sensitivity of investment to cash flows is the lowest for firms that they classify as

being the most likely to be financially constrained. Fazzari, Hubbard, and Petersen (2000), in a

reply to Kaplan and Zingales (1997), take issue with their interpretation on a number of

dimensions. In particular, they question the use of qualitative managerial statements about the

firm’s financial status and suggest that the Kaplan and Zingales (1997) as well as the Cleary

(1999) methodology tend to classify financially distressed firms as being financially constrained.

        To a large extent this controversy arises because of difficulties associated with measuring

investment opportunities. If investment opportunities are not measured appropriately, then cash

flows, in addition to conveying information about internal liquidity, may also reflect information

about future investment opportunities that are not captured by proxies for q.             Since the

measurement of q incorporates firm market value, this effect is likely to be more severe for firms

suffering from problems of information asymmetry, which are also the firms that are most likely




                                                 1
to be financially constrained. As a result, we might expect higher estimated coefficients of cash

flow in investment regressions for firms a priori classified as financially constrained.

         There have been a number of approaches to resolve this problem. One of them is to

identify shifts in firms’ internal funds that are uncorrelated with shifts in investment opportunities

[e.g., Lamont (1997), Hubbard, Kashyap, and Whited (1995), and Fazzari and Petersen (1993)].

In general, the results suggest that investment is positively related with firms’ internal sources of

capital that are uncorrelated with their future profitability.

         This study provides further evidence along these lines by exploring the relationship

between funds obtained from voluntary divestitures and firm investment expenditures. Cash

obtained from asset sales seems to be an appropriate variable for this purpose for a number of

reasons. First, in contrast to the cash flow variables used in prior studies, cash obtained from

voluntary divestitures is not likely to be positively related to the firm’s investment opportunities.

For example, the sale of assets not related to a firm’s core operations is unlikely to convey

information about the growth opportunities of the firm’s remaining lines of business. Moreover,

the sale of assets from a firm’s core business may indicate that the selling firm’s growth

opportunities are unfavorable, which would bias the results against finding a liquidity effect.1

Second, asset sales may increase the amount of funds under the managers’ discretion without the

monitoring that arises with a public securities offering.

         The prior literature provides two motivations for why financially healthy firms undertake

voluntary asset sell-offs.      The first is that voluntary asset sales allow firms to restructure

operations to achieve higher operating efficiencies by selling assets to more productive users or

by selling assets that have negative synergies with the sellers’ core businesses [Hite, Owers, and

Rogers (1987) and John and Ofek (1995)].              With this motivation, asset sales are likely to


1
  Cash obtained from asset sales is also free of another possible caveat of cash flow. Kaplan and Zingales
(1997) raise a concern that in firms where cash flow and investment grow at a rate similar to that of sales,
investment-cash flow sensitivities are biased towards one. They further argue that this effect is stronger for
firms with higher annual growth rates that tend to be classified as financially constrained.


                                                      2
influence investment expenditures only for firms that are in some way financially constrained.

Financial constraints may also be the motivation for asset sales.         Asset sales are privately

negotiated transactions and may represent a less costly means of raising capital than public issues

of debt and equity for those firms facing information problems.               Therefore, financially

constrainted firms may sell assets to raise cash for alternative investments [Lang, Poulsen, and

Stulz (1995)]. In either case, we expect to see a much stronger relation between asset sales and

investment for financially constrained firms.

        To test this hypothesis we estimate a switching regression model with unknown sample

separation to examine cross-sectional differences in investment-asset sales sensitivity.       This

method avoids the necessity of a priori knowledge of whether or not a firm is financially

constrained. Rather, the likelihood of a firm demonstrating investment behavior, consistent with

financial constraints, is endogenously determined by multiple firm characteristics.

        We find that after controlling for investment opportunities and cash flows, cash from

asset sales is a significant determinant of corporate investment expenditures.        Moreover, the

estimates of the switching regression model indicate that the sensitivity of investment to both

asset sales and cash flows is related to variables that are likely to be related to financial

constraints. In particular, firms that are larger, older, have lower market-to-book ratios, lower

levels of financial slack, have bond ratings and are more likely to pay out dividends demonstrate

significantly lower sensitivity of investment to asset sales and internal funds.

        The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 defines the variables and describes the sample

and data. Section 3 explains the econometric methods and presents the empirical results for

investment regressions on the full sample. Section 4 presents the evidence on cross-sectional

differences in investment behavior based on the estimation of a switching regression model.

Section 5 provides our conclusions.

2. Data and Variables

2.1 Sample and Data

        Our sample includes manufacturing firms (SIC codes between 2000 and 3999) listed on

the NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ firms from the COMPUSTAT research file. This data file

includes firms that no longer exist, so that there is no survival bias. However, we do restrict our

sample in two ways. First, since we examine the relation between asset sales and investment, we

consider only firms that have sold fixed assets during the sample period. Second, since we are

primarily interested in the effect of financial constraints rather than financial distress, we exclude

all financially distressed firm-years from the sample.

        Prior studies have shown that distressed and healthy firms sell assets for very different

reasons [Ofek (1993), Asquith, Gertner, Scharfstein (1994), Brown, James, and Mooradian

(1994)]. In particular, a marginal dollar of cash flow from asset sales is less likely to be invested

if a firm is in financial distress. Inclusion of distressed firms in the sample would thus bias the

results against finding a relationship between firm investment and internal capital. In addition,

classifying distressed firms as constrained may falsely indicate that the sensitivity of investment

to internal capital is weaker in firms that are more likely to be constrained [Fazzari, Hubbard,

Petersen (2000)]. Our definition of financial distress is based on interest coverage ratios as in

Asquith, Gertner, and Scharfstein (1994). A firm is classified as financially distressed in a given

year if the firm’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) is less

than 80 percent of its interest expense in one year or if EBITDA is less than the interest expense

for two consecutive years.

        The sample includes all the firm-years with complete data on the required variables

during the period from 1977 to 2000. Because of the need to create both lagged and lead

variables, the actual tests are estimated for the period from 1980 to 1999. The final sample used

in estimating the regressions consists of an unbalanced panel dataset of 9,751 firm-years and

1,474 firms. The number of observations for each company varies between 1 and 20. The


                                                  4
sample does not have a survival requirement and includes a substantial number of firms that no

longer exist.

        The sample includes firms from a wide range of size distribution measured by the book

value of their total assets and capital. Unlike other studies, we are not imposing a size restriction

on asset sale transactions in a given year. All qualifying firm-years are included in the sample

irrespective of the size of divestitures in a given year. As a result, the average asset sales

transaction is a much smaller percentage of fixed assets compared to those reported in previous

studies. For example, Brown, James, and Mooradian (1993) and John and Ofek (1994) report

average transaction prices of 14% and 40% of book value of assets, respectively. In our sample,

assets are sold in 7,733 out of 9,751 firm-years, and the average transaction size for those

observations is 3.2% of capital.       Another reason for such a difference between sizes of

divestitures is that we measure asset sales only by the amount of cash obtained in exchange for

the assets while other studies use the total proceeds that may combine cash and exchanged

securities. Since some of our tests are conducted for the 80’s and the 90’s separately, we also

report statistics for the two subperiods separately.



2.2 The Model and the Variables

        Our empirical specification can be summarized as follows:

  Investmentit = f(growth oppt, liquidity, assets sales, control variables)+ εit               (1)

where i refers to the company, t refers to the time period and investment is measured as the

capital expenditures made by a firm during the year. Growth opportunities are proxied by

market-to-book ratio, which is calculated as the ratio of the market value of equity plus the book

value of total debt to the book value of total assets at the beginning of each period. To measure

internally generated liquidity, we include both flow and stock measures. Specifically, we include

cash flow, measured as the sum of the income before extraordinary items and depreciation and

amortization during the year, and financial slack, measured as the sum of cash and marketable


                                                  5
securities held by a firm at the beginning of each year.

         The amount of cash from asset sales is included as an additional source of liquidity. The

asset sales information, taken from the companies’ flow of funds statements (Compustat

item107), includes the amount of cash obtained from sale of property, plant, and equipment. It

understates the total value of sold assets since it measures only cash proceeds from asset sales and

does not include the value of divested assets in exchange for equity or debt. Investment is

measured by capital expenditures (Compustat item 128), which also includes only the amount of

cash spent on investment and not the value of total investment. These measures are more

appropriate for the purpose of this study, since we are concerned about constraints associated

with raising external cash. All the flow variables and financial slack are scaled by the book value

of the beginning-of-period net fixed assets. Finally, in order to control for both effects of

leverage in firm investment, we use the coverage ratio, which is calculated as the interest expense

divided by EBITDA, in the investment regression and short-term and long-term leverage ratios in

cross-sectional regressions.2 In order to reduce the impact of outliers, the regression variables

with extreme observations are winsorized. Descriptive statistics of the variables included in our

regressions are presented in Table 1.

         Table 2 presents the correlations between the variables. The Table reveals a very strong

positive correlation between cash flow and growth opportunities measured by the market-to-book

ratios, suggesting that the sensitivity of investment to cash flow may be attributed to information

about future profitability that is not captured by the market-to-book ratios. In contrast, the

correlation coefficient between asset sale proceeds and the market-to-book ratios is negative and

significant, which suggests that firms with greater levels of asset sales may have poorer


2
  Lang, Ofek, and Stulz (1996) argue that investment should be negatively related to leverage because high
leverage reduces the current funds available for investment and affects the firm’s ability to raise additional
funds due to reasons discussed by Myers (1977) and Jensen and Meckling (1976). They provide evidence
that for firms with unattractive growth opportunities investment is significantly negatively related to
leverage.

investment opportunities.



3. Sensitivity of Investment to Funds from Asset Sales

        The first set of tests is based on estimating the model on the full sample. We estimate a

least squares regression using first differences for all variables and year dummies in order to

control for fixed firm and year effects. We estimate the model on the 20-year sample and for the

two ten-year periods of the 80’s and the 90’s. Both current and lagged values of all independent

variables and the lagged value of the dependent variable are included in the model.

        The regression results are presented in Table 3. As in previous studies, investment is

positively related to both flow and stock measures of internal cash.             In all regressions,

contemporaneous and lagged cash flow and the beginning-of-period financial slack are significant

determinants of investment. Beginning-of-year investment opportunities play a very important

role, too, but with a small coefficient as in most previous studies. Consistent with the findings of

Lang, Ofek, and Stulz (1996), firms with higher levels of interest expense relative to their income

invest significantly less.

        The results also show that there is a strong positive relation between the amount of cash

from divestitures and corporate investment.          A divestiture and use of its proceeds for

reinvestment may not happen in the same year. A firm may sell assets and reinvest the proceeds

in the following year or it may make an investment planning a divestiture in the following year.

In order to consider all these possibilities, we include both positively and negatively lagged asset

sales along with current assets sales in the model. The results show that asset sales in the current,

previous and the following year have a significant positive effect on investment.

        The main result of the first set of regressions is that after controlling for growth

opportunities, corporate investment is significantly correlated with both cash flows and funds

obtained from divestitures. Our hypothesis is that since asset sales is less likely to be positively

related to growth opportunities, the sensitivity of investment to asset sales is likely to be driven


                                                 7
by financing constraints. To explore this hypothesis further we conduct cross-sectional tests.



4. Cross-Sectional Differences in Investment

4.1 Endogenous Switching Regression Model with Unknown Sample Separation

        If asset sales are associated with investment expenditures because of financing

constraints, then the observed sensitivity of investment to funds raised from asset sales should

vary cross-sectionally.   In particular, it should be higher when firms are more financially

constrained. Most of the prior studies have used the following method for estimating the cross-

sectional differences in firms’ investment behavior.      Firms or firm-years are classified into

subgroups based on certain firm characteristics or qualitative information assumed to reflect the

degree of financial constraints, and separate investment regressions are estimated for each

subgroup.

        This method assumes that the points of sample separation are known.               In reality,

however, the extent of financial constraints faced by a firm is not directly observable. We expect

that some firms face greater financial constraints than others, but we cannot perfectly identify

these firms ex ante. An exception would be, for example, the case of Japanese firms studied in

Hoshi, Kashyap, Scharfstein (1991), where the affiliation of a firm with a keiretsu is directly

observed. In most other cases, the threshold values of firm characteristics used for sample

separation are based on judgment calls. This implies that the results of estimation of investment

regressions on different samples may be sensitive to the choice of the criterion and the

breakpoints used for sample splits. This may be one of the reasons for the conflicting findings in

the existing literature, especially if the relationship between financial constraints and investment-

cash flow sensitivity is non-monotonic, as argued by Kaplan and Zingales (1997).

        We use an endogenous switching regression model with unknown sample separation [see

Maddala and Nelson (1994) and Maddala (1986)], which was previously used to estimate cash

flow sensitivities in Hu and Schiantarelli (1997). This approach provides estimates of separate


                                                 8
investment regressions without a priori classifying firms as constrained or unconstrained. It is

based on the assumption that the number of different regimes in which firms operate is known,

but the points of structural change are not observable. The advantage of this approach is that the

extent that investment behavior differs across groups of firms and the characteristics that make

firms more likely to demonstrate higher or lower sensitivity are determined simultaneously.

        We assume that there are two different investment regimes. In one regime, investment

may be more sensitive to the availability of internal funds than in the other regime.          We

hypothesize that these differences reflect the extent of financial constraints faced by firms.

Depending on the extent of liquidity constraints a firm may operate in one of the two

unobservable investment regimes.

        The model is composed of the following system of three equations that are estimated

simultaneously:

                                           I1it = Xitβ1 + u1it                                  (2)

                                           I2it = Xitβ2 + u2it                                  (3)

                                            yit* = Zitγ + εit.                                  (4)



        Equations (2) and (3) are the structural equations that describe the investment behavior of

firms in the alternative regimes. Equation (4) is the selection equation that determines a firm’s

“propensity” of being in one or the other investment regime. The observed investment, Iit,

undertaken by firm i at time t, , is defined as



                                          Iit = I1it iff yit* < 0

                                         Iit = I2it iff yit* ≥ 0.                               (5)




                                                    9
        In (2) and (3), Xit are the determinants of corporate investment and Zit are the

determinants of a firms’ likelihood of being in the first or the second investment regime at time t.

β1, β2, and γ are vectors of parameters, yi* is a latent variable measuring the tendency or the

likelihood of being in the first or the second regime, u1, u2, and ε are residuals. Firms are not

fixed in one regime. As described by (5), a transfer between the regimes occurs if yi* reaches a

certain unobservable “threshold” value. This is important since a firm’s financial status may

change over time, leading to a significant change in its investment behavior.

        We assume that u1, u2, and ε are jointly normally distributed with mean vector 0 and

                       σ 11 σ 12 σ 1ε 
                                       
covariance matrix Σ =  σ 12 σ 22 σ 2 ε  .      This assumption permits a nonzero correlation
                                       
                       σ 1ε σ 2 ε 1 

between the shocks to investment and the shocks to firms’ characteristics and endogenous

switching between the two investment behaviors. Note, that var(ε) is normalized to 1 because, in

(4), we can estimate only γ/σε , but not γ and σε, individually. Since σ12 does not appear in (7), it

is not estimable.

        The switching regression approach allows us to control for multiple indicators that jointly

determine the group in which a firm is likely to belong without the need for splitting the sample

into many smaller parts or including many interaction terms. The number of indicators used to

split the samples or create interaction terms is usually limited to one or two. However, single

factor classifications may not successfully separate firms with different sensitivity of investment

to internal financing. The severity of financial constraints often varies among firms of the same

subgroup because of other factors that are not controlled for. Multiple factor classifications, on

the other hand, increase the number of subsamples reducing the size of each group used for

estimation or increase the number of interactive terms in single regressions and produce

imprecise estimates.    The estimation of the selection equation also allows us to assess the

statistical significance of the factors assumed to proxy for the degree of liquidity constraints faced


                                                 10
by a firm. Besides, the selection regression, which directly includes the firm characteristics,

incorporates more information into the estimation of the separate investment regimes than the

creation of dummy variables or sample splits.

         The model is estimated by the method of Maximum Likelihood. Although we do not

observe the tendency of a firm being in one or the other investment regime, we know that if

εit < - Zitγ, the firm’s investment is determined by (2), and if yit* > 0 or, equivalently,

εit > - Zitγ, the firm’s investment is determined by (3). The likelihood function for each

observation is given by



                      lit = Pr ( εit < − Zγ u1it = I 1it − Xitβ 1) Pr (u1it = I 1it − Xitβ 1) +

                        + Pr ( εit > − Zγ u2it = I 2it − Xitβ 2) Pr (u 2it = I 2it − Xitβ 2) .                       (6)

and the log-likelihood function subject to maximization is given by

         The Maximum Likelihood estimates of β1, β2, γ, σ’s can be obtained using numerical

maximization techniques. It is possible to test for the existence of two different investment

regimes by performing a likelihood ratio test with the log-likelihood values for OLS and the

switching model. If β1 is equal to β2, and σ1ε is equal to σ2ε then u1 is equal to u2 and the

likelihood function reduces to a standard normal density. We conduct this test later.



4.2 Criteria of Sample Separation




                                                          11
4.2.1 Size

        One of the most widely used proxy variables for the level of financial constraints is firm

size [Devereux and Schiantarelli (1990), Oliner and Rudebusch (1992)]. Smaller firms are likely

to be financially constrained for a number of reasons. First, empirical evidence shows that

transaction costs of new issues decrease with the issue size. This makes external funds relatively

more expensive for small firms. Second, small firms get less analyst coverage and may thus have

less access to external sources of capital because of adverse selection problems [Myers and

Majluf (1984)]. Third, large firms can raise debt more easily because they are more diversified

and less prone to bankruptcy. Thus, higher sensitivity of investment to internal capital in small

firms will support the hypothesis that financial constraints lead to underinvestment.

        Previous empirical tests of a financial constraint size effect report mixed results

[Schiantarelli (1996)]. When size is applied to large datasets with a wide range of firm sizes, the

results seem to support the hypothesis that small firms face much higher costs of raising external

funds than do large firms. However, results for smaller samples of relatively large firms show

either higher sensitivity of investment to changes in cash flow for larger firms or no significant

differences between size groups. One possible explanation for such evidence is that different

sampling criteria may create a bias towards selecting only those small firms that have been

successful and less liquidity constrained.

        Our sample may suffer from a similar selection bias. First, we are using only quoted

firms. Second, we are eliminating distressed firm-years. The number of distressed firm-years

and observations with missing values is likely to be higher among smaller firms. Thus our

sampling criteria may exclude more small firms than large firms. However, we do include firms

that are no longer in existence. We also impose a less strict restriction on the minimum required

number of years of record. This is likely to mitigate to some extent the selection bias against

small firms.




                                                12
        We measure size as the natural logarithm of the book value of assets at the beginning of

each period adjusted for inflation.

4.2.2 Age

        Similar to size, firm age may proxy for the wedge between the costs of external and

internal capital [Devereux and Schiantarelli (1990), Oliner and Rudebusch (1992)]. Younger and

growing firms are more likely to be financially constrained. Age is proxied by the natural

logarithm of the number of years a firm has been listed on NYSE, AMEX or OTC.

4.2.3 Leverage

        As argued by Lang, Ofek, and Stulz (1996), leverage may negatively affect firm

investment in a number of ways.         First, it may reduce the amount of cash available for

investment. Second, due to reasons discussed by Myers (1977) or Jensen and Meckling (1976),

highly levered firms may face higher hurdles in accessing external sources of capital. To control

for both effects separately we include two measures of leverage in the selection equation--the

ratio of short-term debt over the book value of assets and the ratio of long-term debt over the

book value of assets.

4.2.4 Financial Slack

        Financial slack may be associated with financial constraints for two reasons. Some have

argued that firms with ample cash reserves are not liquidity constrained since their investment is

not limited by a lack of finance [Kaplan and Zingales (1997), Kashyap, Lamont, and Stein

(1994)]. Others, however, suggest that high levels of financial slack indicate that these firms are

more financially constrained [Calomiris, Himmelberg, and Wachtel (1996), Fazzari, Hubbard,

and Petersen (1996), Kim, Mauer, and Sherman (1998)], since constrained firms have more

incentive to hold large cash balances. For example, Calomiris, Himmelberg, and Wachtel (1996)

find that firms with low or no credit quality ratings tend to hold larger stocks of liquid assets and

demonstrate higher sensitivity of investment to cash flow.

4.2.5 Market-to-Book Ratio


                                                 13
         Firms with high growth opportunities have greater need for external financing, and,

therefore, may be more liquidity constrained. At the same time, a high market-to-book ratio may

indicate that the firm’s growth opportunities are recognized by the market, which implies that,

other things equal, firms with higher market-to-book ratios will have easier access to external

funds.

4.2.6 Dummy Variables for Dividend Payout and Bond Rating

         We also include a dummy variable, which is equal to one if a firm paid out dividends in

the year prior to the investment and zero, otherwise, and a dummy variable which is equal to one

if a firm has bond rating by the Standard & Poors. Firms that pay out dividends are expected to

be less liquidity constrained and firms that have bond rating are expected to have easier access to

external capital markets.



4.3 Results of Estimation of the Switching Model

         The switching regression model with unknown separation is estimated by the method of

Maximum Likelihood using numerical maximization techniques. In order to account for firm-

specific fixed effects, the investment regressions are estimated in first differences, and year

dummies are included in the investment regression to control for fixed year effects. We estimate

the model for the entire 20-year period and its two 10-year subperiods of 1980-89 and 1990-99.

         Table 4 reports the results of the estimation of the switching regression model for the 20-

year sample. The estimates of the two investment regressions, presented in Panel A, demonstrate

that the firms’ investment behavior is significantly different in the two regimes. This difference

is especially apparent for asset sales. In both regimes, investment is positively and significantly

related to cash flow and the stock of cash. Although there are statistically significant differences

in these coefficient estimates, they are roughly of the same magnitude. In contrast, the coefficient

of the contemporaneous asset sales variable is about eight times larger in the constrained regime,

and the leads and lags of this variable is significant only in the constrained regime. In addition,


                                                14
the coverage ratio has a significantly stronger negative effect on investment for firms operating in

the second investment regime, where investment is more sensitive to internal liquidity and asset

sales. The coefficients of growth opportunities are not significantly different between the two

regimes.

        The estimates of the selection equation, presented in Panel B, reveal that six of the

selection characteristics play an important role in determining the likelihood of a firm being in a

particular investment regime. The estimates indicate that firms that are larger, older, have lower

levels of financial slack, lower market-to-book ratio, are more likely to pay dividends and have

bond rating are likely to operate in investment regime 1. The estimates in the investment

equation are consistent with regime 1 being the unconstrained regime, which is consistent with

our intuition about the characteristics of firms that are likely to be constrained.

        The estimates of the same model for the 1980-89 and 1990-99 decades are reported in

Tables 5 and 6, respectively. Overall, the findings are consistent with those reported in Table 4.

As shown in Panel A of Tables 5 and 6, firms operating in the first investment regime

demonstrate lower sensitivity to all the three measures of liquidity. However, the differences in

sensitivities are much more dramatic for asset sales.          Unlike the previous results, growth

opportunities are more important for firms that operate in the first investment regime in the

decade of 1980-89 and become less important for the same kind of firms in the decade of 1990-

99. Panels B present the results of the selection equation. As before, firms that are larger, older,

have lower market-to-book ratio, lower financial slack, and are more likely to pay dividends are

more likely to operate in the first investment regime where investment is less sensitive to internal

funds and asset sales. Long-term leverage is significantly negative in the results for the 80’s

indicating that firms with lower leverage are less dependent on internally generated cash. It

becomes positive and marginally significant in the 90’s.

        The existence of two distinct investment regimes can be tested with a likelihood ratio

test. The problem with a switching model is that under the restriction that the coefficients of the


                                                  15
two investment regimes are equal, the parameters of the selection equation are not identified

which complicates the calculation of degrees of freedom. It is also possible that the asymptotic

likelihood ratio statistic does not have a χ2 distribution. We rely on the results of the Monte Carlo

tests conducted by Goldfeld and Quandt (1976), suggesting that the χ2 distribution can be used to

conduct a likelihood ratio test by defining the degrees of freedom as the sum of the number of

constraints and the number of unidentified parameters. The calculations for our model yield 57

degrees of freedom. Given the critical value for the χ2 distribution at the 1 percent level with 57

degrees of freedom, we can easily reject the possibility of similar investment behavior by all

firms at any conventional level of significance for both estimated specifications. Two distinct

investment regimes describe the data significantly better than one regime.



6. Conclusion

        This paper examines the relation between proceeds from voluntary asset sales and firm

investment using an extension of the q model of investment. The evidence suggests that funds

from voluntary divestitures provide an important financing source for financially constrained

firms. Specifically, firms invest more when they generate cash from asset sales and the extent to

which they do this tends to be related to firm characteristics that are likely to be associated with

financial constraints.

        The findings in this paper provide strong evidence that cross-sectional differences in

financing constraints have significant effects on corporate investment expenditures.            This

evidence is consistent with a substantial literature on financial constraints that focuses on the

sensitivities of investment expenditures to cash flows. The existing literature, however, has been

criticized because cash flows are likely to measure investment opportunities as well as corporate

liquidity. Our tests, therefore, provide an important contribution to this debate because it is

unlikely that asset sales would be strongly related to investment opportunities.




                                                 16
        Although our analysis suggests that financing constraints at least partially explain why

firms invest more when they sell assets, we do not explain the causal relation between these two

variables. One possibility is that financially constrained firms take on existing positive NPV

projects that they would have otherwise passed up when they receive the proceeds from an

unrelated asset sale. Another possibility is that financially constrained firms choose to finance

new investment opportunities by selling assets. Both explanations require financial constraints,

however, the direction of causation between asset sales and investment is very different.

Although it is likely that in reality both explanations are important, this should probably be

considered in future research.

        Future research should probably also consider other explanations for the relation between

investment expenditures and asset sales. Perhaps, this relationship arises because firms are

constrained in ways that have nothing to do with capital.       For example, firms may have only

limited amounts of managerial time and are thus forced to eliminate a line of business before they

can add a more promising line of business. While this explanation is plausible, one would have to

argue that the firm characteristics that appear to be associated with financing constraints are really

measuring managerial constraints. This is unlikely, but probably should be considered in future

work.

Descriptive statistics for 1,474 financially healthy US manufacturing firms that sold fixed assets
for cash proceeds at least once over the period 1980-99. Investment is measured as capital
expenditures. Cash flow is the sum of income before extraordinary items and depreciation and
amortization. Asset sales is equal to the cash proceeds received from sale of fixed capital.
Growth opportunities (M/B) is equal to the sum of the book value of total debt and market value
of equity divided by the book value of total assets. Financial slack is the sum of cash and short-
term investments. Investment, cash flow, asset sales, and financial slack are deflated by the book
value of the beginning-of-period net fixed assets (K). Total assets and net capital are measured in
million dollars. Total assets, net capital, and leverage ratios are measured at the beginning of
each year. The number of observations for all variables is 9,751 for 1980-99, 4,919 for 1980-89,
and 4,832 for 1990-99.

Investment regressions for 1,478 financially healthy US manufacturing firms that sold fixed
assets for cash proceeds at least once over the period 1980-99. The dependent variable is
investment measured as capital expenditures. Cash flow is the sum of income before
extraordinary items and depreciation and amortization. Asset sales is equal to the cash proceeds
received from sale of fixed capital. Growth opportunities is equal to the sum of the book value of
total debt and market value of equity divided by the book value of total assets. Financial slack is
the sum of cash and short-term investments. Investment, cash flow, asset sales, and financial
slack are deflated by the book value of the beginning-of-period net fixed assets. The regressions
are estimated using first differences for all the variables and year dummies in order to control for
fixed firm- and year effects.

Panel B: The selection equation

The dependent variable is coded 1 for the first investment regime and 0 for the second investment
regime. A positive coefficient means that firms with a high value of the selection variable are
more likely to be in the first regime. The book value of assets is estimated in 1980 US dollars.
Age is the number of years a firm has been listed on NYSE, AMEX or OTC. Financial slack
includes cash and short-term investments and is deflated by the beginning-of-period net fixed
assets. Growth opportunities is equal to the sum of the book value of total debt and market value
of equity divided by the book value of total assets.

Panel B: The selection equation

The dependent variable is coded 1 for the first investment regime and 0 for the second investment
regime. A positive coefficient means that firms with a high value of the selection variable are
more likely to be in the first regime. The book value of assets is estimated in 1980 US dollars.
Age is the number of years of a firm has been listed on NYSE, AMEX or OTC. Financial slack
includes cash and short-term investments and is deflated by the beginning-of-period net fixed
assets. Growth opportunities is equal to the sum of the book value of total debt and market value
of equity divided by the book value of total assets.
