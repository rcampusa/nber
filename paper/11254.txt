                                           ABSTRACT

Equity ownership gives labor both a fractional stake in the firm's residual cash flows and a voice in
corporate governance. Relative to other firms, labor-controlled publicly-traded firms deviate more
from value maximization, invest less in long-term assets, take fewer risks, grow more slowly, create
fewer new jobs, and exhibit lower labor and total factor productivity. We therefore propose that labor
uses its corporate governance voice to maximize the combined value of its contractual and residual
claims, and that this often pushes corporate policies away from, rather than towards, shareholder
value maximization.

When Labor Has a Voice in Corporate Governance

I.      Introduction

        On July 12, 1994, as shareholders approved the recapitalization that rendered United the

largest majority employee-owned company in the world, UAL stock closed at $99.25. On

December 9, 2002, UAL became a penny stock as, unable to sustain the industry’s highest labor

costs, it filed for bankruptcy protection. Other airlines vehemently opposed aid to UAL, arguing

that it had brought on a crisis in the industry by relentlessly driving labor costs up. Robert Roach,

Jr., the General Vice President for Transportation at the International Association of Machinists

and Aerospace Workers, United'
                             s largest union, responded, "Everybody is shocked and

concerned that the federal government would not be there for American workers as they are for

rebuilding Afghanistan.”1 Sam Buttrick, an airline analyst at PaineWebber summarized that “At

the root of the problem is the simple fact that labor has excessive structural leverage”.2

        Employee-owned equity blocks are surprisingly commonplace in the United States.

According to the National Center for Employee Ownership, as of 2002, employees owned

several hundred billion dollars worth of their employers’ stock. This includes 11,000 Employee

Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs), stock bonus plans, and profit sharing plans through which 8.8

million workers have over $400 billion primarily invested in their employers’ stocks – an

average investment of about $45,000 per employee. In addition, some 11 million employees hold

over $160 billion of their employers’ stocks through some 2,200 401(k) plans – about $14,000

per employee. In the past decade, the biggest growth in employee stock ownership has been

York Times, December 5, 2002.
through broad based stock option plans and employee stock purchase plans. Some ten to 25

million employees own several hundred million dollars worth of their employers’ stock through

some 8,000 of these plans.

         These figures translate into a significant tier of employee-owned stock in many large,

publicly traded companies. Although employee ownership of public companies through ESOPs

and 401(k) plans seldom exceeds ten percent, and that through broad based option and purchase

plans seldom exceeds 30%, these stakes are nonetheless substantial enough blocks to matter at

shareholder meetings. Since most ESOPs pass voting rights through to employees, and 401(k)

plans, broad based stock option plans, and stock purchase plans usually give employees full

voting rights, these stakes give employees a substantial voice in the corporate governance of

many large publicly traded US firms.

         Proponents of employee equity ownership hold that these developments are desirable.

Vanek (1965), Drucker (1978), and Aoki (1984) argue that employee equity ownership leads to a

convergence of employees’ interests with those of shareholders, empowers employees, and

lengthens workers’ time horizons. They propose that these effects lead to better overall corporate

performance. Another argument in favor of employee stock ownership is that labor markets, like

capital markets, are imperfect; and that these imperfections might induce managers to make

suboptimal decisions. Giving labor a role in corporate governance might mitigate labor market

imperfections and improve overall economic welfare. Garvey and Swan (1994), echoing a

similar argument, contend that labor ownership may motivate enhanced efficiency given costly

and imperfect contracting. Their main premise is that employees, as well as shareholders, are

residual claimants under incomplete contracting, so vesting some control with labor is ex-ante

efficient.

        In contrast, Jensen and Meckling (1979) argue that employee equity blockholdings have a

dark side – they create an entrenched workforce with corporate governance power. Entrenched

labor, like entrenched management, can destroy value as it strives to maximize its utility.

Moreover, like entrenched management, entrenched labor cannot be got rid of easily.

        Our objective is to test empirically these competing hypotheses regarding the effects of

labor ownership and control. We compare several dimensions of corporate decision-making by

firms with labor equity ownership and other firms, controlling for exogenous firm characteristics.

We find that publicly-traded firms whose employees have a greater voice in corporate

governance deviate more from value maximization, spend less on new capital, take fewer risks,

grow more slowly, create fewer new jobs, and exhibit lower labor and total factor productivity.

These results are highly robust.

        We interpret our findings as evidence that extending residual claims to the generality of

employees is often not an efficient way to align shareholder and labor interests. Employees, like

creditors, primarily hold a fixed claim on the firm’s cash flow, in the form of wages and salaries.

If labor as a fixed claimant acquires equity ownership, it obtains a residual claim and a voice in

corporate governance in addition to its fixed claims. Our evidence is consistent with labor using

its corporate governance voice to maximize the total value of its two claims – the fixed,

primarily salary-based, claim and the residual equity-based claim.

        The corporate strategies that lead to shareholder value maximization and those that

maximize the combined value of employees’ residual claim and expected future wages and

benefits can differ markedly. This is especially so since workers’ equity claims are usually small
compared to the largely fixed claims associated with their wages and benefits. Yet, in a widely

held firm, labor’s stake may give it a major voice in corporate governance. We propose that this

imbalance often allows labor to use its governance voice to push corporate policies away from,

rather than towards, shareholder value maximization.

       The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we discuss the

behavior of labor as a corporate stakeholder and present an overview of the relevant literature.

We describe our sample selection procedure in Section III, and report our empirical results in

Section IV. Section V contains a brief summary and concluding remarks.



II.    Labor as a Corporate Stakeholder

       Labor’s contractual stream of wages is similar to risky debt, in that it consists of a fixed

claim on the firm (current and retired labor’s stream of promised wages and benefits) less a put

option (whose exercise price is the expected value of labor’s claim in bankruptcy). That is, as

long as the firm’s value exceeds the value of labor’s claim in bankruptcy, the value of labor’s

wages is invariant to firm value. For firm value less than labor’s claim under bankruptcy, labor’s

wage claim is reduced a dollar for every dollar reduction in firm value below this threshold.

Figure 1 illustrates.   Here we generalize the term “bankruptcy” to include any corporate

reorganization that reduces or eliminates wages – even if not implemented under formal

bankruptcy procedures. Fama and Jensen (1983) argue that governance power should be vested

in those who receive a firm’s residual claim, and point out that American law reflects this

premise. If the put option of bankruptcy is unlikely, employees are usually contractual claimants,

receiving a fixed wage, and need no voice in corporate governance. Consequently, American

courts hold that corporations be run in their shareholders’ interests, with management choosing
policy variables to maximize shareholder value. Employees’ and other creditors’ governance

rights only come into play in the event of bankruptcy, when their contractual claims expire and

they become residual claimants.

         A hypothetical alternative legal regime would give complete corporate governance power

to current labor.3 Labor would choose policy variables to maximize the value of its fixed

contractual claims less that of the put option. Given that employees’ careers with their firms are

finite, we suppose labor has a horizon limitation, beyond which it employs an infinite discount

rate. Under these assumptions, labor’s objective is equivalent to minimizing the value of the put

option. Applying standard results in option pricing theory to a comparison of the two regimes

lets us predict how corporate governance in our hypothetical labor-controlled firm might differ

from corporate governance in shareholder-controlled firms.

         First, all else equal, the option value (which labor seeks to minimize) is lower if cash

flows within labor’s time horizon are larger. However, what happens to cash flows in periods

subsequent to labor’s horizon does not affect the option’s value. In contrast, the value of a

shareholder-controlled firm is larger whenever sacrificing near-term cash flows raises future cash

flows sufficiently over any time horizon. Consequently, our hypothetical labor-governed firm

would avoid some long-term investments that a shareholder-controlled firm would undertake.

Arguably, debt contracts extending beyond current labor’s tenure might alleviate this under-

investment.      However, this cannot be a complete solution, for external creditors’ claims are

subordinate to current labor’s claim if debt payments are scheduled beyond current labor’s

employment tenure.




3
 German corporate governance law goes far in this direction, for its codetermination rules grant half the seats on
corporate supervisory boards to employee representatives.
       Second, all else being equal, the option value is lower if the variation in operating cash

flow is smaller during current labor’s horizon. Thus, labor generally finds projects with volatile

cash flows undesirable, regardless of their net present values. This implies that our hypothetical

labor-controlled firm should avoid risks that a shareholder-controlled firm would accept.

       Third, these differences should slow the growth rates of our hypothetical labor-controlled

firms relative to those of shareholder-controlled firms. Possibly, as an unintended benefit, labor

ownership might eliminate the over-investment free cash flow problem identified by Jensen

(1986). However, labor-managed firms need not follow the NPV rule at all, since labor would

rank projects with sufficient cash flows and low risk ahead of potentially higher NPV projects.

This suggests that labor-controlled firms might have lower shareholder values, as measured by

average Tobin’s q ratios, than otherwise similar shareholder-controlled firms.

       Finally, it makes sense to envision worker effort as a corporate governance variable in a

worker-controlled firm. Shareholder-controlled firms use a variety of incentive systems to

encourage workers to work harder. These tools are also at the disposal of our hypothetical

worker-managed firm. All else equal, however, labor is only concerned with generating enough

cash flow to cover its wages. Any further increase in operating cash flow is unimportant to labor.

These considerations suggest that labor-controlled firms might invest less than would

shareholder-controlled firms in marginally increased productivity if current cash flows exceed a

certain level. In addition, labor may use its governance voice to alter its labor-leisure tradeoff to

permit greater leisure. Thus, we would expect lower productivity levels in such firms.
II.A   Labor Control Associated with Equity Ownership by Labor

       In the United States, labor does not gain corporate control rights without acquiring an

equity stake. However, if other shareholders’ stakes are small, as is often the case in large US

firms, equity ownership might give labor a corporate governance voice out of proportion to its

equity block holding. Morck et al. (1988) argue that holding a five percent block of stock lets top

managers dominate corporate governance. Other authors argue for a higher threshold of control,

though there is broad agreement that a stake well below 50% can confer de facto complete

control on the blockholder.

       These considerations suggest that labor equity ownership might lead to labor gaining a

controlling voice in corporate governance for a small share of the firm’s residual cash flows. In

such cases, labor’s desire to protect its human capital and its fixed wage and benefit contract

within a finite horizon has a real effect on corporate policy. Specifically, labor control, obtained

with only a small labor ownership stake, might lead to reduced long-term investment, risk

avoidance, slower growth, less concern with share value maximization, and/or reduced

productivity.



II.B   Previous Work

       Previous work searches for productivity and incentive effects of labor equity ownership.

One approach consists of examining abnormal returns around labor’s acquisition of equity blocks

through ESOPs. An ESOP is a tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan established

under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974 that invests most of its

assets in the employer’s stock. Thus, the creation of an ESOP can result in employees acquiring a

significant block of shares. Consequently, an examination of ESOP announcement returns could
provide an insight into the effect of labor ownership. However, results of ESOP announcement

studies have been inconclusive. For instance, while Chang (1990) finds positive abnormal

returns, Gordon and Pound (1990) report an insignificant average announcement period return.

       ESOPs enjoyed special tax privileges and are subject to provisions not applicable to other

ownership plans. This can create problems in interpreting empirical findings and may be partially

responsible for the inconclusive results. For example, does a positive abnormal return upon an

ESOP announcement reflect expectations of changed labor productivity or expectations of tax

breaks? Scholes and Wolfson (1990), Chaplinsky and Niehaus (1990), and others argue that the

tax effects of ESOPs are limited and not necessarily bigger than those provided by other

employee compensation plans. However, Beatty (1995) reports that ESOP announcement

abnormal return is significantly positively related to estimated tax benefits.

       Further interpretation problems arise because ESOPs often arise in connection with

corporate takeover defenses. Gordon and Pound (1990) argue that the management of a potential

takeover target can create an ESOP to modify the firm’s ownership structure in its favor by

placing a block of shares in friendly hands. Thus, ESOPs could be used as a managerial

entrenchment tool. However, as Stulz (1988) argues with respect to anti-takeover activities in

general, management might also use the ESOP as leverage to gain better terms for shareholders

in a takeover contest. For these reasons, it is difficult to understand the complete effects of

employee ownership by analyzing ESOP announcement abnormal returns.

       Another approach is to estimate the effect of employee ownership on labor productivity

and accounting measures of corporate performance. Again, results have not been conclusive.

Bloom (1986) utilizes a series of augmented Cobb-Douglas production functions to evaluate the

effects of employee ownership on productivity at the firm level. He estimates the functions
cross-sectionally and longitudinally for a large sample of manufacturing and non-manufacturing

firms. He concludes that employee ownership has little or no impact on corporate performance.

In contrast, Beatty (1995) performs a similar analysis and reports that ESOPs increase sales per

employee in the first two post ESOP-adoption years if the ESOP replaces no other retirement

benefit plan. Park and Song (1995) report significant improvements in performance (as measured

by return on assets, Tobin’s q, and market-to-book ratio) in the three years following plan

establishment. However, such improvements are contingent on the presence of an external

blockholder. Lougee (1999) investigates the long-term effects of ESOP adoption. She concludes

that her tests provide no evidence that ESOPs improve firm performance.

        A potential problem with studies that focus on the immediate post-ESOP years is that

they may capture the residual effects of financial circumstances associated with takeover threats

or defenses. This matters since ESOPs are sometimes created as takeover defenses or liquidity

enhancements programs in the presence of financial difficulties. In addition, given the stock

allocation rules followed by most ownership plans, it apparently takes time for corporate policies

and results to reflect the effects of employee influence on management.

       We address these difficulties in two ways. First, we consider all labor-owned equity

blocks, not just those associated with ESOPs. Since much labor ownership in US publicly traded

firms does not arise out of ESOPs, this provides us with a substantially larger sample and affords

us the opportunity to examine possible differences arising from the mode of labor ownership.

Second, to avoid temporary or unusual financial circumstances associated with the events

leading up to an ESOP, we require that blocks of labor ownership be in place for several years

before we admit a firm to our sample of labor-controlled firms. By not including the immediately
ensuing years, we examine firms more likely to be subject to labor’s governance influences. We

thus focus on long-term steady state implications of labor equity ownership.

       Another concern with focusing on labor ownership is that control does not automatically

follow ownership. Chang and Mayers (1992) discuss how de jure labor equity blocks can

become de facto management ownership. Indeed, corporate management, not labor or its

representatives, explicitly votes many labor equity blocks. Including such blocks is appropriate

in other contexts, but not in this study. This is because control over voting shares translates into

corporate governance influence, and hence into the strength with which labor’s objectives

become manifested in corporate policy.

       Labor-voted equity stakes clearly give labor a voice in corporate governance decisions.

McElrath and Rowan (1992) find that unions view employee ownership as a way of influencing

strategic decision making and restricting management’s largely “unchecked independence”.

Anecdotal evidence concurs. For example, Northwestern Steel & Wire Co. places at least one

ESOP representative on its board if its ESOP owns a minimum 5% of the outstanding shares.

Similarly, labor nominates four of Weirton Steel’s fourteen directors; and three of UAL’s twelve

directors represent employees. McKersie (1999) reports that most corporate boards make major

decisions by consensus, and that this often gives labor-nominated directors significant leverage.

He quotes one labor-nominated director: “If you work within the system, you can either get a lot

accomplished or get some projects struck down, even though your opinion may at first be in the

minority.” McKersie quotes another labor-nominated director’s experience with consensus: “On

what I thought was a fairly minor issue, but one that I felt strongly about, I cast the only

opposing vote on the board. It caused a great deal of problems; the other directors could not

understand how I could be opposed after hearing their point of view. Because there is a tendency
to move only on unanimity, it gives (labor-nominated) directors much more influence than I ever

expected we had.”

       In other cases, employees influence corporate policies directly, i.e., without necessarily

having board representation. For example, the labor union at Marriott International, working

with other investors, won a 1998 proxy contest to prevent Marriott’s proposed dual-class

recapitalization. The company had intended the dual-class structure as an integral part of its plan

to split its food service and hotel businesses. Similarly, UAL aborted its acquisition of USAir in

1995 because of employee opposition. Voting power clearly enhances employees’ ability to

influence corporate decisions. We are therefore interested in firms where labor votes its stock,

but not in firms where managers vote labor’s shares.



III.   Empirical Framework

III.A Sample Construction

       We begin with the 3,823 definitive proxy statements filed with the Securities and

Exchange Commission in 1995. We then exclude filings by mutual funds, real estate investment

trusts, limited partnerships, subsidiaries, and firms with incomplete data in COMPUSTAT. This

yields an initial universe of 2,165 proxy statements. We read each of these filings to determine

the proportion of voting shares owned by employees of each firm.

       We identify 277 firms where employees own at least five percent of outstanding shares as

reported in the beneficial ownership section of the proxy statement. In 22 of these firms,

management exercises the right to vote employee-owned shares. For example, corporate

executive officers, serving as ESOP trustees, vote a twenty percent ESOP block in Security

National Financial. Similarly, five company officers exercise voting control over the 17.95%
block of Central Steel & Wire’s profit sharing plan. Since we are interested in labor’s corporate

control voice, not simply de jure labor ownership, we drop these 22 firms, reducing the sample

to 2,143. Of these, employees control at least five percent of voting shares in 255 firms. We

classify these as subject to some degree of labor voice in corporate governance.4

         We then checked earlier proxy statements for each of the 255 labor voice firms to

determine the year labor ownership passed the 5% threshold. We denote this as the event year for

the firm. We exclude 29 firms with event years later than 1990. This is because we wish to

examine the steady state effects of employee voice in corporate control, and employee stock

ownership can sometimes result from corporate restructuring under financial distress. By

requiring at least five years of labor influence prior to the empirical window we examine, we

hope to mitigate the effects of any temporary financial problems that might have been associated

with labor accumulating stock.5

         Thus, our final labor voice sample consists of 226 firms. Of these, 110 are firms in which

labor acquired its stake through an ESOP. In 75 firms, labor acquired its stake through non-

ESOP means: profit sharing, stock bonuses, stock savings, stock purchases, or combinations of

these and other retirement benefit plans. Labor acquired its equity stake through a combination

of ESOPs and other channels in the remaining 41 firms. Table 1 summarizes the distribution of

labor ownership among the labor voice firms. Mean and median labor ownership are 13.16% and

10.60%, respectively. The minimum stake controlled by labor is five percent, while the

maximum is 68.20%. By way of comparison, mean and median non-affiliated block equity



4
  For e.g., Morck, Shleifer and Vishny (1988) find that entrenchment effects begin to dominate at 5% management
ownership. Also note that the SEC uses a five percent threshold for Schedule 13D filings under the Williams Act
incorporated in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
5
  Admittedly, this approach may introduce some survivorship bias into our analysis, since labor voice firms must
survive at least five years after the event year to be part of our sample. However, this should bias results in favor of
the labor voice firms.
holdings among the labor voice firms are 8.79% and 6.00%, respectively, while mean and

median managerial ownership for these firms are 13.60% and 6.83%, respectively. Thus, labor is

the largest blockholder in the typical labor voice firm.

       Our control sample consists of the 1,888 firms reporting no labor equity ownership or

ownerships lower than five percent in their proxy statements. We regard these firms as largely

free from labor influences in corporate governance.


III.B Variable Definitions

       Our basic strategy is to run regressions explaining corporate performance and strategy

variables with measures of labor voice and a set of control variables. This section first describes

our labor voice measures, and then describes the variables employed in our financial

performance regressions. Finally, we describe variables in the other regressions we also run.

Labor Voice Measures

       We measure labor voice in several ways. One set of approach uses indicator variables set

to one if labor votes more than a certain fraction of the shares at the company’s annual general

meeting. We use five, ten, fifteen, and twenty percent thresholds. A second approach uses the

fraction of labor-voted shares as a continuous variable. We also experiment with more

complicated specifications, including quadratic and piecewise linear terms. These add no

significant explanatory power. The relationship between labor voice and our various dependent

variables is always monotonic.

Financial Performance Regressions

       Our primary goal is to understand how a labor voice affects corporate governance. A

major aspect of corporate governance is the creation of wealth for shareholders, which we

measure by Tobin’s average q approximated as the market value of common equity plus book
values of preferred equity and long-term debt divided by the book value of assets less short-term

debt. Although it is possible to construct more sophisticated versions of Tobin’s q, Chung and

Pruitt (1994) show that this relatively simple version performs quite as well as more complicated

ones. Besides, more sophisticated measures require additional data, which reduces sample size

and creates another set of econometric problems. Recent studies that employ the simple measure

of Tobin’s q include Callahan et al (2003) and Hartzell and Starks (2003).

        We do not include regressions explaining profitability measures such as return on asset

(ROA) or profit margins (ROS) as alternate specifications. This is because these variables

measure short-term performance. Although short-term performance might be depressed by some

governance problems, it might also be elevated by other effects. For example, profits might be

elevated if risk averse labor voice firms sacrificed long-term performance to build up a cash

cushion. In a sufficiently efficient stock market, market-to-book ratios incorporate such trade-

offs and accurately reflect net gains in present value terms. Of course, market irrationality,

among other things, can distort market-to-book ratios. When we rerun the regressions in our

tables with ROA or ROS as the dependent variable, our labor voice measures are insignificant.

        We recognize that labor voice is only one of many variables that may affect a firm’s

ability to create wealth. To estimate the marginal effect of labor influence, we must control for

other governance and non-governance factors related to Tobin’s q. These include board size

(Yermack, 1996), board composition (Rosenstein and Wyatt, 1990), leadership structure

(Rechner and Dalton, 1991), managerial equity ownership (Morck et al, 1988),6 block ownership

(Bethel et al., 1998), the availability of investment opportunities (Yermack, 1996), and current


6
 Following Morck et al. (1988), the empirical corporate finance literature typically uses breakpoints to control for
managerial ownership. We employ the same breakpoints as in Morck et al. (1988), i.e., ownership levels of less than
5%, between 5% and 25%, and greater than 25%. Our results are invariant to other breakpoints, as well as to a single
continuous measure of managerial ownership.
profitability (Yermack, 1996). We hand-collect governance data (board size, board composition,

leadership structure, managerial equity ownership, and block ownership) from 1995 proxy

statements and use the ratio of capital expenditures to total assets as a proxy for the availability

of investment opportunities. Our measure of current profitability is return on assets, defined as

the ratio of operating income to total assets at the beginning of the year. We obtain data on

capital expenditures, operating income, and total assets from COMPUSTAT.

        In addition, we control for debt because leverage may alter a firm’s contracting

environment and significantly enhance or hinder its ability to create shareholder wealth. We

measure leverage as the ratio of long-term debt to total assets using data from COMPUSTAT.

We also control for whether managers’ compensation is tilted toward equity or debt-like, fixed

payoffs because equity compensation may affect managerial incentives. Our measure of the

structure of managerial compensation is the ratio of the CEO’s option compensation to total

compensation, which we compute using data from Execucomp. Finally, we employ two-digit

SIC code dummies to control for industry effects, and use the logarithm of total assets (in 1994

dollars) to control for firm size.

        As indicated earlier, we wish to focus on long-run steady state effects. We thus compare

our labor voice firms to control firms over the seven-year period 1995 to 2001. However, it is

possible that labor ownership resulted from past financial problems. For example, labor

ownership can result from a bailout of the company using pension fund money to set up an

ESOP, as at Morrison Knudsen Corp in September 1988. Labor ownership may also arise as a

concession to unions in return for taking pay cuts, as at United Airlines. Establishing a labor-

owned equity block can also serve as a defensive move against an actual or feared hostile

takeover, as in the well-known Polaroid case. Since Morck et al (1989) and others show that
hostile takeovers in this period were often preceded by poor financial performance, a spurious

correlation problem is again possible, i.e., past performance can result in labor control, as well as

affect the dependent variable. In Section III.A, we required labor voted equity blocks to have

been in place for at least five years before admitting firms to our labor voice sample to

circumvent this problem. Nevertheless, we consider a number of variables to control for possible

remaining aftereffects of past financial circumstances.

       The first of these is average ROA calculated for each firm over 1985 to 1989. Including

this variable should thus capture echoes of any financial problems that triggered the formation of

the labor equity block. As a robustness check, we also use average historical Tobin’s q ratio,

calculated also over 1985 to 1989. Our results are not sensitive to the measure of past financial

performance. As a further robustness check, we rerun all our regressions including first ROA

estimated from 1990 through 1994 and then Tobin’s q averaged over the same period.              The

results again remain virtually unchanged.

Other Regressions

       In addition to the shareholder value tests, we also compare several other dimensions of

corporate decision making for the labor voice and control firms. These dimensions are long-term

investment, operating risk, growth, and labor and total factor productivity. We discuss our

measures for these variables below.

       We consider two sorts of long-term investment as alternate dependent variables. The first,

an investment rate, is denoted dK/K, and is capital expenditure on new property, plant and

equipment, normalized by total net property, plant, and equipment. The second is research and

development spending, also normalized by net property, plant, and equipment and denoted
R&D/K. Where all other main financial variables (sales, assets, and net income) are reported, but

R&D is not, we presume it to be negligible and set it to zero.

       Our measure of operating risk is the standard deviation of return on assets. For each year

t, we calculate the standard deviation of return on assets over the current year and the three

preceding years, i.e., years t, t-1, t-2, and t-3. We define return on assets as the ratio of operating

income before depreciation, interest, and taxes to total assets at the beginning of the year.

       We define two measures of corporate growth, namely, sales growth and labor force

growth. Sales growth is the three-year average growth rate of real sales calculated as


                      α t Salest − α t −3 Salest −3
        ∆Salest =                                                                      [1]
                           3 *α t −3 Salest −3


for each year t, where α is the GDP deflator. Labor force growth rate is constructed analogously,

but without the GDP deflator.

       To estimate total factor productivity (TFP), we assume that each firm’s sales are

generated by a Cobb-Douglas production function of the form

        Yit = ALβit K itα                                                              [2]

where Yit is net sales for firm i in period t, Lit is the number of employees, Kit is net property,

plant, and equipment, and A,α, and β are parameters. Unlike Bloom (1986) and Beatty (1995),

we do not assume a labor ownership augmentation parameter. Rather, we employ residuals from

our estimation of the logarithmic transformation of [2] as a measure of firm-level TFP, and look

for any effect associated with labor voice in these residuals. We control for industry factors by

estimating a separate equation for each two-digit SIC industry group.

       We compare labor productivity as well as total factor productivity. We measure labor

productivity by the simple ratio of real sales to the number of employees.
III.C Statistical Tests and Robustness Checks

       We begin our analysis by contrasting the means and medians of the dependent variables

defined in the previous section for labor voice and control firms. We recognize that these variables

are often not entirely within management’s control, and so univariate results may sometimes be

misleading as indicators of managers’ intentions, or corporate policies. We therefore follow

simple comparisons of these variables across the two samples with multiple regression analysis.

This allows us to control for exogenous factors that may affect each aspect of corporate decision-

making.



IV.    Empirical Results

IV.A Shareholder Value

       Panel A of Table 2 shows that average and median Tobin’s q for labor voice firms during

1995-2001 are 1.019 and 0.875, respectively. These are significantly lower, at the 1% level or

better, than the corresponding figures for other firms, 1.433 and 1.026. Similarly, although not

reported in Table 2, average and median Tobin’s q are significantly lower for labor voice firms

in each of the seven years, with p-values of 0.05 or less. These results provide preliminary

evidence of significantly less effective shareholder wealth maximization in firms whose

corporate governance is influenced by a labor voice.

       Table 3 presents regressions of Tobin’s q on labor voice and the governance and other

controls described in Section III.B. The first column controls for prior financial circumstances

using historical Tobin’s q, and uses a continuous measure of labor voice, the percentage of

shares voted by employees. Its coefficient is -0.0158, which is significant at the 1% level. This
implies that the difference between no labor voice to a 10% labor voted block, the median in the

labor voice subsample, is a Tobin’s q depressed by 16% in the latter. A similar result obtains if

we measure labor control using an indicator variable equal to one if labor votes at least five

percent (column II). The coefficient of -0.2296 implies that labor voice is associated with a 23%

reduction in Tobin’s q. Columns III and IV control for prior financial circumstances using

historical return on assets. Labor voice variable remains negative and significant at the 1% level.

       We also estimate cross-sectional regressions similar to those in Table 3 for each of the

seven years in our data. Labor voice is negative and statistically significant at the 5% level or

less in each year. Furthermore, we estimate regressions (not reported) for which the dependent

variable is the change in average Tobin’s q from 1985-1989 to 1995-2001. We obtain similar

results: Labor voice is significantly negatively related to the change in average Tobin’s q, with p-

values lower than 0.05.

       A reasonable concern with the above results is whether a five percent equity ownership

translates into a meaningful governance voice for labor. If not, the regression results may simply

be picking up other unknown factors associated with labor ownership that depress shareholder

value. We address this concern by digging deeper into the ownership structure of each of our

sample firms to identify those cases where labor ownership is most likely to translate into a

significant corporate governance voice.

       A natural starting point is to raise the minimum employee ownership level required for a

firm to be considered as subject to labor influence in corporate governance. We therefore repeat

our regressions using the subset of firms with minimum labor-controlled equity stakes of 10%,

15%, and 20%, respectively, in place of the full sample of labor voice firms. Results of these

regressions appear in Table 4. As the table shows, the labor voice dummy is negative and
significant at less than the 5% level in each case. In addition, the coefficient becomes more

negative as we increase the minimum stake, from -0.388 for 10% stakes to -0.530 for 20%

stakes. Note also that there are only 23 firms with labor-voted equity stakes of at least 20%

(column III). The significant negative coefficient for labor control in this regression suggests a

particularly strong underperformance by the labor voice firms.

        Labor’s ability to influence corporate governance may depend not only on the absolute

voting stake controlled by employees, but also on the makeup of the firm’s other shareholders.

For example, a labor stake of even 20% may mean nothing if managers own 50% of the

outstanding shares. Similarly, a strong influence may not necessarily accompany labor’s equity

ownership if there are other significant outside blockholders. For these reasons, Table 5 repeats

our analysis using only the subsets of labor voice firms where labor owns 10%, 15%, and 20% of

the shares and this stake is the single largest block in the company’s ownership structure. We

believe labor’s ability to influence corporate policies is probably greatest in these cases. Again,

the labor voice variable is negative and statistically significant in each regression. Overall, our

results are inconsistent with labor voting power entailing a convergence of interest between

outside shareholders and employees. Rather, there is strong indication of a considerable

reduction in corporate value creation as measured by Tobin’s q ratio.




IV.B Long-term Investment

       Panel A of Table 2 presents univariate statistics for capital investment rates and research

and development spending for our labor voice and control firms. As the table reveals, both

measures of long-term investment are significantly lower in labor voice firms. The average

capital investment rate of labor voice firms is 8.4% compared to 13.3% for other firms.
Similarly, R&D expenditure for labor voice firms average 1.3% of total assets, compared to

3.1% for control firms. In each instance, the difference is significant at the 1% level. Similar

results hold with respect to medians.7

           These univariate results suggest that labor’s voice might deter long-term investment.

Again, prior poor performance in labor voice firms might affect these results. We therefore

control for historical financial performance. We also include controls for firm size and several

dimensions of corporate governance as well as the firm’s investment opportunity set. In addition,

each regression includes two-digit SIC code dummies to control for unobservable industry

factors.

           Column I of Table 6 presents summary results from regressions for capital investment

rate. The first row measures labor influence using the percentage of votes controlled by labor,

while rows two through four use five percent, ten percent, and fifteen percent threshold

dummies, respectively, to distinguish labor voice firms. Consistent with the univariate results,

Table 6 reveals a negative significant relationship between labor voice and capital spending. The

estimated coefficients imply that, after controlling for past financial circumstances and other

factors, a ten percentage point increase in labor-controlled equity reduces capital spending by

about two percent, while a labor voice in corporate governance (as measured by the five percent

ownership dummy) is associated with a 2.59% reduction in long-term investment. Since the

mean and median of capital spending are about twelve and seven percent, respectively, of net

property, plant and equipment, these are economically significant effects.8




7
  We also compute industry-adjusted R&D expenditures based on 2-digit SICs, and find similar results, i.e., labor
voice firms invest significantly less in R&D than do control firms.
8
  Only 25 firms with labor stakes higher than 20% have sufficient data for similar regressions. For this group, the
labor voice dummy is not significant, although it is negative.
       The second and third columns of Table 6 present results of regressions for research and

development expenditure. Since we do not have real economic depreciation data for R&D

investments, our dependent variable is left censored. We thus employ Tobit, rather than OLS,

regressions. As column II shows, the labor voice variable is not significant in each regression

estimated over the full sample. However, when we restrict the sample to firms that actually

invest in R&D during the period, the labor voice variable (as measured by the percentage of

labor-controlled equity, as well as the five- and ten-percent ownership dummies) is negative and

statistically significant at the 5% level, as reported in the third column of Table 6. Recall that

more than half of our sample firms report no R&D expenditure during the entire seven-year

empirical window of our study. These results suggest that labor voice firms that invest in R&D

invest less than otherwise similar control firms.

       As robustness checks, we rerun all of the above procedures using alternative long-term

investment measures normalized by total assets and total sales. Using these variants does not

change our qualitatively conclusions. Further, if we partition the sample into ESOP firms and

firms with other types of labor ownership, we find no significant differences in the effect of labor

voice, i.e., labor voice firms tend to reduce long-term investment, irrespective of the means

through which labor acquired ownership.

       These results are hard to reconcile with the hypothesis that labor equity ownership causes

workers to advocate shareholders’ interests. McConell and Muscarella (1985) show that stock

prices rise when firms announce increases to their capital budgets. Chan et al. (1990) show that

similar positive abnormal returns accompany announcements that firms are increasing their R&D

budgets. Likewise, Eberhart et al. (2004) report significantly positive long-term abnormal

operating performance following R&D increases. These studies and others suggest shareholders
believe most firms underinvest in long-term projects. The depressed shareholder value associated

with labor voice in section IV.A undermines any argument that labor voice firms might be

curtailing value-destroying excess capital spending and R&D.




IV.C Operating Risk

       Panel A of Table 2 presents univariate comparisons of operating risk for labor voice and

other firms. Mean and median operating risk for labor voice firms are 3.5% and 2.9%,

respectively. These are significantly lower at 1% level or better than the comparable figures for

other firms, 5.5% and 3.9%, respectively. Results are similar when we measure operating risk

using the standard deviation of operating income scaled by sales.

       Column IV of Table 6 presents summary results from regressions for operating risk

analogous to those in the preceding columns for long-term investment and R&D expenditure. In

the first row, labor voice is labor’s percentage voting power. Its coefficient is negative and

significant at the 1% level. In the second through the fourth rows, labor voice is a dummy

variable for 5%, 10%, and 15% labor equity ownership, respectively. In each case, the

coefficient is negative and significant at the 10% level or better.

       As a robustness check, we substitute the standard deviation of return on sales, estimated

over the same period, as the measure of operating risk. Qualitatively similar results ensue. Next,

we partition the sample into ESOP firms and firms with other types of labor ownership. We find

some differences in the effect of labor voice based on the sample partition. The labor voice

variable is negative and significant for ESOP firms. On the other hand, it is never significant in

the regressions for firms with other types of labor ownership, although it is also always negative.
Thus, it appears that the operating risk results are driven by ESOP firms, which represent 49% of

our sample of labor voice firms.

       Table 6 indicates that a labor voice in corporate governance is associated with a

significant reduction in corporate risk taking. This is consistent with risk-averse employees

biasing their firms’ investment and other decisions to reduce risk. It also provides further

evidence that labor influence in corporate governance need not promote a convergence of

interest between employees and public shareholders. Overall, the evidence on operating risk is

consistent with labor voice firms curtailing risky investments.




IV.D Corporate Growth

       Panel A in Table 2 displays univariate statistics for real sales and labor force growth

rates. Over the seven-year comparison period, labor voice firms achieved average and median

sales growth rates of 8.6% and 5.7%, respectively; significantly below comparable figures for

other firms of 13.8% and 8.7% at 1% level or better. Perhaps more importantly, labor voice firms

create only about half as many net new jobs as other firms. Note that to maintain or increase

individual labor’s wages while simultaneously increasing total labor force would require

profitability and/or efficiency improvements. We have argued and presented evidence against

both elsewhere in the paper. Put differently, our evidence suggests that labor dislikes a dilution

of its claims to corporate revenues (including quasi-rents in the form of excess wages or

benefits), just as equity holders dislike a dilution of their claims with new issues.

       Columns V and VI of Table 6 regress real sales and labor force growth rates on labor

voice and our standard controls, including historical profitability to control for past financial

circumstances and 2-digit SIC code dummies for industry factors. The first row uses a continuous
labor voice stake, while the second through the fourth rows use labor control thresholds of 5%,

10%, and 15%, respectively.

       The coefficients of the labor voice dummy in columns V and VI of Table 6 are negative

and significant for all regressions. The parameter estimates suggest that, after controlling for

other aspects of a firm’s corporate governance and financial circumstances, real sales growth is

lower for labor voice firms by 3% to 5%, while employment growth is lower by 3% to 4.5%.

When labor voice is measured with a continuous variable, the coefficients are -0.22% for sales

growth and -0.19% for staff growth, indicating that a ten-percentage point increase in labor-

controlled votes reduces real sales growth by 2.2% and employment growth by 1.9%. These

results do not depend on the mode of labor ownership. Separating ESOP firms from other firms

with labor voice yields virtually identical results in each subsample.




IV.E Productivity

       Univariate results for total factor productivity residuals are shown in Panel A of Table 2.

The average total factor productivity residual for labor voice firms is -0.011, significantly below

the 0.070 average for other firms at the 1% level. Similarly, median productivity residual for

labor voice firms is -0.032, compared to 0.050 for other firms. Again, the difference is significant

at the 1% level. Thus, while the actual output of a typical non-labor-controlled firm represents

105% of what we would expect based on factor inputs, labor voice firms manage to produce only

about 97% of expected output on average. This clearly suggests that labor influence in corporate

governance is associated with noticeably depressed firm-level productivity.

       Column VII of Table 6 examines the robustness of this association to controls for other

aspects of firm governance and financial circumstances by regressing total factor productivity
residuals on measures of labor voice and the control variables from Section III.B. The first

regression measures labor influence using the proportion of shares voted by employees, while the

second, third, and fourth regressions use indicators variables corresponding to 5%, 10%, and

15% labor ownership, respectively.

        As Table 6 reveals, labor voice is negative and significant in each regression. These

results confirm the univariate findings of a substantial depression in factor productivity at labor-

controlled firms. In particular, the coefficient of the labor voice dummy becomes more negative

at higher employee voting thresholds without losing its statistical significance, despite sharply

reduced numbers of firms satisfying the labor voice definition.

        A similar conclusion follows for labor productivity. Although Table 2 shows mean and

median sales per employee to be statistically indistinguishable, column VIII of Table 6 reveals

significantly depressed labor productivity in labor voice firms. Again, the effect is more negative

at higher thresholds of employee ownership. The coefficient estimates imply that, compared to

other firms, real sales per employee is lower by about 17.84% in firms where employees control

15% or more of outstanding voting shares, while labor-voting power ten-percent higher is

associated with a real sales per employee 5.4% lower. These productivity results suggest that the

depressed employee and total factor productivities in labor voice firms are economically, as well

as statistically, significant.

        We note that our results are not inconsistent with Beatty (1995), who finds depressed and

enhanced productivity associated with ESOPs depending on whether they replace existing

pension plans or not. First, ESOPs usually replace existing pension plans. Second, Beatty (1995)

studies sales per employee during the first two post-ESOP adoption years. Since troubled firms

often establish ESOPs as they restructure, a productivity rebound effect is possible – especially
in firms that are not in such serious difficulty that they must sacrifice their existing pension

plans. We exclude the first five years of employee ownership precisely to allow effects of such

contingent events to fade, and to allow time for employees to use their governance voice to affect

corporate decision-making.




V.     Conclusions

       Our empirical findings reveal that a longstanding labor voice in corporate governance is

associated with significantly depressed shareholder value, sales growth, and job creation. This, in

part at least, appears to reflect a systematic avoidance of certain types of investment – capital

expenditure, R&D spending, and high-risk investments in general. It also probably reflects

depressed labor and total factor productivity in firms whose employees influence corporate

governance.

       We argue that current labor rationally uses its voice to maximize the value of its equity

stake plus the present value of its expected future wages and benefits. Since the present value of

future wages and benefits is much larger relative to the present value of labor’s equity stake in

most cases, Jensen and Meckling (1979) argue that labor is primarily concerned with maintaining

current and future cash flows sufficient to prevent wage or benefits cuts. This, combined with

current labor not greatly valuing cash flows that accrue in the distant future, beyond their wage

and benefits horizons, explains a low-risk, low-investment, and low-growth strategy. Depressed

productivity may simply reflect labor using its voice to enhance its labor-leisure tradeoff to attain

greater leisure. However, it might also reflect depressed investment in innovation, which might

erode the value of current labor’s firm-specific human capital. Further work is needed to clarify

these issues.
       Our findings cast a serious doubt on the simple premise that labor equity participation

causes a convergence of interests between workers and shareholders. It appears that the increased

governance role acquired by labor following an ownership stake allows employees to influence

corporate policies in ways beneficial to their narrow interests. Labor appears to use its voice in

corporate governance to inject employee horizon and firm-specific human capital concerns into

the firm’s objective function as it maximizes the combined value of its contractual and residual

claims. This often pushes corporate policies away from, rather than towards, shareholder value

maximization.

ω (the region to the righ of ω), then labor receives its fixed payment (ω) while
shareholders receive the excess of cash flow over ω in the form of dividends. The figure
assumes that shareholders are the sole residual claimants in the firm.

This table presents information on the distribution of employee equity ownership among our
final sample of 226 labor voice firms. Initially, we identify 277 firms where employees own at
least five percent of outstanding shares, as reported in the beneficial ownership section of the
1995 proxy statement. We drop 22 firms because the labor stake is voted by management. We
drop an additional 29 firms because the labor stake was acquired after 1990. Thus, the final labor
voice sample consists of 226 firms. In the table below, Ownership Range is the percent of
outstanding shares controlled by employees as reported in the firm’s 1995 proxy statement.

Table 2: Univariate comparisons of labor control and other firms

Employees at Labor Voice Firms control at least five percent of the firm’s voting shares, while
employees at Non-labor Voice Firms control less than five percent of the voting shares. Tobin’s
q is calculated as the ratio of the sum of market value of common equity, book value of preferred
equity, and book value of long-term debt to the book value of assets. For each year t, Net Capital
Investment is average net investment in property, plant, and equipment over years t, t-1, and t-2
normalized by net property, plant, and equipment. R&D Investment is the ratio of R&D
expenditure to total assets. Operating Risk is calculated as the standard deviation of annual return
on assets over years t, t-1, t-2, and t-3. Sales Growth is calculated as the three-year average
growth rate of real sales over years t, t-1, and t-2. Staff Growth is calculated in a similar manner.
Total Factor Productivity is the residual of annual industry-specific Cobb-Douglas production
functions estimated for each 2-digit SIC industry group. Sales per Employee is the natural
logarithm of the ratio of annual sales to the number of employees. Insider Ownership is the
proportion of outstanding voting shares owned by all officers and directors. Block Ownership is the
percentage of voting shares controlled by unaffiliated holders of five percent or more. Board Size is
the number of directors. Board Composition is the proportion of directors who are non-employee
directors with no business or personal relationship with the firm or any of its employee-directors.
Leadership Structure is a binary variable, which equals one when the CEO also serves as board
chairman, zero otherwise. Managerial Equity Compensation is the ratio of the value of annual
options granted the CEO to the CEO’s total annual compensation. Investment Opportunities is the
ratio of capital expenditures to total assets. Leverage is the ratio of long-term debt to total assets. Firm
Size is the natural logarithm of total assets in 1994 constant dollars. Current Profitability is return on
assets, calculated as the ratio of operating income to total assets at the beginning of the year.
Historical Profitability is average return on assets over 1985-1989. Historical Tobin’s q is
average Tobin’s q ratio over 1985-1989. All non-corporate governance variables (except
Historical Tobin’s q and Historical Profitability) are averages over 1995-2001. Corporate
governance variables are from 1995 proxy statements and/or annual reports. For each variable,
***, **, and * indicate that the value for Labor Voice Firms is significantly different from the
value for Non-labor Voice Firms at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

Table 5: Market valuation and labor control robustness check
(labor owns the largest single block)

The dependent variable in these regressions is Tobin’s q, calculated as the ratio of the sum of
market value of common equity, book value of preferred equity, and book value of long-term
debt to the book value of assets. 10% Labor Dummy, 15% Labor Dummy, and 20% Labor
Dummy are indicator variables which equal one if labor ownership is at least 10%, 15%, and
20%, respectively, zero otherwise. In each labor firm, employees own the largest single equity
block. Managerial Equity Compensation is the ratio of the value of annual options granted the
CEO to the CEO’s total annual compensation; Insider Ownership I measures managerial equity
ownership up to 5%; Insider Ownership II measures managerial equity ownership between 5%
and 25%; Insider Ownership III measures managerial equity ownership greater than 25%; Block
Ownership is the proportion of outstanding voting shares controlled by unaffiliated holders of five
percent or more; Board Size is the number of directors; Board Composition is the proportion of
directors who are non-employee directors with no business or personal relationship with the firm or any
of its employee-directors; Leadership Structure is a binary variable, which equals one when the
CEO also serves as board chairman, zero otherwise; Investment Opportunities is the ratio of capital
expenditures to total assets; Leverage is the ratio of long-term debt to total assets; Firm Size is the
natural logarithm of total assets in 1994 constant dollars; Current Profitability is the ratio of operating
income to total assets at the beginning of the year; Historical Profitability is the average of return
on assets over 1985-1989. All non-corporate governance variables (except Historical
Profitability) are averages over 1995-2001. Corporate governance variables are from 1995 proxy
statements and/or annual reports. Each regression includes 2-digit SIC industry dummies to
control for unobservable industry factors. Statistically significant variables are shown in bold
typeface. The number in parentheses under sample size is the number of firms satisfying the
definition of labor firms in each regression.

Table 6: Corporate operations and labor control

This table summarizes results from 32 regressions relating several aspects of corporate
operations to measures of labor control. DK/K is net investment in property, plant, and
equipment normalized by net property, plant, and equipment. R&D is the ratio of research and
development expenditure to total assets. For each year t, VROA is calculated as the standard
deviation of annual return on assets over years t, t-1, t-2, and t-3. DSLE is three-year average
growth rate of real sales. DSTF is three-year average growth rate of employees. TFP is the
residual of annual industry-specific Cobb-Douglas production functions estimated for each 2-
digit SIC industry group. SPE is the natural logarithm of the ratio of annual sales to the number
of employees. Labor Ownership is the proportion of outstanding shares voted by employees. The
variables 5% Labor Dummy, 10% Labor Dummy, and 15% Labor Dummy are indicator variables
which equal one if labor ownership is at least 5%, 10%, and 15%%, respectively, zero otherwise.
Each regression includes controls for managerial equity compensation as measured by the ratio
of the value of annual options granted the CEO to the CEO’s total annual compensation, insider
ownership, block ownership, board size, board composition, leadership structure, investment
opportunities as measured by the ratio of capital expenditures to total assets, leverage as measured
by the ratio of long-term debt to total assets, firm size as measured by the natural logarithm of total
assets in 1994 constant dollars, and historical profitability as measured by average annual return on
assets over 1985-1989, as well as 2-digit SIC industry dummies to control for unobservable
industry factors. All non-corporate governance variables (except historical profitability) are
averages over 1995-2001. Corporate governance variables are from 1995 proxy statements
and/or annual reports. The first entry in each cell is the coefficient of the labor voice variable
from each regression. P-values are shown in parentheses under each regression coefficient. The
first number in the square brackets in each cell is the sample size; it is followed by the number of
firms satisfying the definition of labor-influenced firms in each regression. Regressions in the
column labeled R&D I are Tobit regressions estimated over all sample firms, while those in the
column labeled R&D II are regressions estimated over firms with non-zero R&D expenditures.
