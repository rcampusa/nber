      THE IMPACT OF THE POTENTIAL DURATION OF UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS

for UI recipients around the time when benefita are likely to lapse.      The

I.   Introduction



      European countries with relatively generous unemployment
insurance (UI)      systems (such as Belgium, France, Germany, the

Netherlands, and the United Kingdom) have suffered much larger and

more persistent      increases in unemployment in the 1980's than the

United States.       These differences in European and U.S. unemployment

experience are largely explained by the substantially        longer duration

of unemployment spells in Europe.       Furthermore, much microeconomic

evidence indicates that there is a positive relation between the

level of UI benefits received and the duration of the unemployment

spells of UI recipients.1       These observations have generated much

interest among hoth academics (e.g. Minford, 1985) and the press

(e.g. The Economist,      14-20 May 1988,   p.69) in the hypnthesis that
work disincentives arising from generous unemployment insurance (UI)

systems play an important role in high and persistent European

unemployment in the 1980's.
      Burda (1988) provides some suggestive evidence that differences

in the generosity      of UT systems may help explain cross-country

differences in unemployment performance.         Burda finds a strong

positive correlation      (of 0.63) between a measure of the generosity of

UI benefits available to a fully insured worker and the ratio of

long-term unemployment to the labor force for fourteen OECO countries

of the impact of benefit levels on spell duration in the United
Stares, and Atkinson et al. (1984) and Narendranathan at ml. (1985)
for estimates for the United
Kingdom.

in 1985.2     On the other hand, Burtless (1987) argues persuasively

that European UI systems were generous well before the rise in

European unemployment.        Many European etonomies with very generous
benefits had much lower unemployment than the less generous U.S. in

ihe 1960's.     Still, typical unemployment spell durations have tended
to he quite long in economies with liberal UI systems even in petiods

of relatively low unemployment.       A key issue prior to the debate over

the impacts of UI system generosity on aggregate unemployment       is

whether there is microeconomic evidence consistent with the key link

in the macroeconomic    argument that observed differences in UI systems
csn help explain substantial cross-country differences in the

duration of unemployment.

     In comparing the UI system in the U.S. with those in Europe, the

major differences appear to be in the potential duration of benefits
and eligibility requirements for benefits rather than in the weekly

benefits level for qualified workers.        In particular, insurance and

other assistsnce lasts for more than twice as long in most European

countries than in the United States.        The potential duration of

benefits varies dramatically across countries.        The typical qualified

worker is eligible for    6    months of benefits in the U.S. versus over a


     28urda classifies as long-term unemployed those unemployed
workers with current spells of 12 months or longer. The UI measure
constructed by Burda combines information on the level of benefits,
average manufacturing earnings, and the maximum duration of benefits.
Burds's measure is the present discounted value (using a 10 percent
discount rate) of the maximum number of weeks of benefits available
to an insured worker relative to the average weekly earnings for a
manufacturing worker. This measure ignores taxes and substantial
differences across countries in eligibility requirements for UI.
These differences in eligibility rules generate substantial variation
in the fraction of the unemployed covered by UI across countries.

year of benefita in the France, Germany, and Sweden (Burtleas, 1987).
In fact, benefita can laat indefinitely (at a reduced rate after the

firat year) for aome individuala in Belgium and the United Kingdom

(Eaeraon, 1988).    UI benefita that laat for a long duration combined

with limited monitoring of aearch effort may make an economy more

ausceptible to increaaea in long-term unemployment in the face of
adverae ahocks.

      While much microeconomic reaearch haa ahown that higher levela of

benefita are aasociated with longer durationa of unemployment, there

ia much leaa empirical reaearch on the impacta of the potential

duration of benefita on the duration of unemployment.3    Since

differencea in the length of available benefita are the key

difference among UI syatema, an underatanding of how potential

benefit duration affecta the diarribution of unemployment   apella ia
crucial for determining whether UI differencea help explain cross-

country differencea in unemployment.
      In thia paper, we preaent new empirical evidence on the impact of

the   level and potential duration of benefita on the duration of

unemployment in United Statea.    Since the proapect of rehire by one'a

previoua employer ia important for a substantial fraction of UI

recipienta in the U.S.,4    we examine the impact of UI benefita on

(1987) are among the few sophiaricated econometric studiea of the
impact of potential benefit duration on the duration of unemployment.

     4For example, Katz and Meyer (1988) found that 75 percent of a
large aample of UI recipienta from Miaaouri and Pennaylvania in 1979-
8G indicated when they filed for UI benefita that they expected to be

behavior.              -




   We look at two types of empirical evidence. The first part of our

empirical work involves an analysis of the unemployment spells of a

sample of household heads from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics.
These data allow us to compare spell distributions for UI recipients

and nonrecipients and to look at differences in the time pattern of

recalls and the acceptances of new jobs.     We find big differences in

the distribution    of spell durations for UI recipients and

nontecipients.     Sharp increases in both the recall and new job

finding rates ate apparent at durations when benefits are likely to

lapse for UI recipients.     The absence of such increases in the escape

rate from unemployment     for nonrecipients provides strong evidence of

an impact of the potential duration of UI benefits on firm recall

policies and workers' willingness to start new jobs.
    The second part of out empirical work examines the impact of the

level and length of UI benefits on the escape tate from unemployment

for a large sample of UI recipients.     This Continuous Wage and

Benefit History (CWBH) data set, extracted by Hoffitt (1985a), has

the advantage of providing detailed administrative records on the UI

system parameters facing individuals.     Since the data set covets

spells in 12 states during the 1978-83 period, a fair amount of both
cross-section and time series variation in UI parameters       is

available.   This variation allows us to directly estimate impacts on

the escape rate from unemployment of differences     in the level and

length of benefits and test the predictions of alternative models.

We utilize these estimates to simulate the impact of changes in the

level and maximum duration of benefits on the mean duration of

unemployment, the fraction of workers exhausting benefits, and

expected expenditure on UI benefits per compensated unemployment

spell.
    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.     Section II

reviews several alternative theoretical models of the effects of UI

system parameters on the probability of leaving unemployment.
Section III presents our comparison of the unemployment spella of UI

recipients and nonrecipients.     Section IV applies econometric

duration models to administrative data on the spells of UI

recipients, and section V presents simulations using these estimates.
Section VI provides some concluding remarks.



II. Theoretical    Background



    In this section, we analyze the likely impacts of the level and

potential duration of unemployment benefits on duration of

unemployment and the time pattern of the escape rate from

unemployment.     We discuss the predictions of three types of models

(1) a standard job search model;    (2) job search models that

incorporate the layoff-rehire process; and (3) a static labor-leisure
choice model.



Standard Job Search Model with no Recalls

   Mortensen (1977) utilizes a dynamic search model with no recall
                                      6


                                                                offer
possibility, variable search intensity, a stationary known wage
distribution, and a constant arrival rate of job offers (for a given

search intensity) to analyze the effects of UT on the escape rate

from unemployment.     Mortensen incorporares two key features of the UI

system in the United States into the model: benefits are assursed to
be paid only for a specified duration rather than in every period of

an unemployment spell, and new entrants or workers who quit joba are

not qualified for benefits.5

    As the remaining number of weeks of benefits available to a

qualified unemployed worker decreases, the value of remaining

unemployed also decreases.     This drop causes the reservation wage to

fall and search intensity to increase as an individual geta closer to

when benefits lapse.     These changes in behavior imply that the escape

rate from unemployment rises until the date of benefit exhaustion.

After exhaustion, the hazard rate is constant given the assumption

that the environment is stationary.       The time pattern of the hazard

rate for an unemployed worker initially qualified for UI benefits

with potential duration of P0 periods is illustrated by the solid

line in Figure lA.6 If individuals can locate jobs and arrange not

to begin work until their benefits run out, one might observe a

discrete increase in the escape tate near the point of benefits

exhaustion followed by a discrete drop after exhaustion.

    Mortensen's model suggests that changes in the level and length


     5See Burdett (1979) for an analysis of a similar model.

     6The figure is drawn assuming the marginal utility of leisure is
independent of income.
of benefits have two opposing influences on the escape rate from

unemployment.         Increases in either of the benefit parameters have

the stsndard disincentive effect of raising the value of being

unemployed, but these increases also raise the value of being

employed by increasing the utility associated with being laid off in
the future.      The second effect, known as the "entitlement" effect,

raises the escape rate from unemployment for workers who currently do

not qualify for benefits and for qualified workers close to

exhaustion.

      The effect of an increase in the potential duration of benefits

from P0 to P1 is illustrated in Figure 1A. The standard disincentive

effect reduces the escape rate from unemployment for a newly laid-off

worker, but the entitlement effect leads to a higher escape rate as

one approaches       and passes the exhaustion point.        The impact of an

increase in the benefit level from b0 to b1 is illustrated in Figure

lB.

      The model suggests the following stylized, reduced-form

apecification for the escape rate from unemployment, A:


                 +     -    +     -

        A =   A( P, P-t, b, b*(P-t), K)     for P-c     0,



where t is the duration of the apell,        P   is potential duration of

benefits, P-t is time until exhaustion, b is the level of benefits,
and X is a vector of individual and labor market variables affecting

the arrival rate of job offers, search intensity, and choice of

reservation wage.          The escape rate from unemployment increases as

time    until exhaustion declines.        Higher benefits reduce the escape

rate when time until exhaustion is high and increase the escape rate

at around exhaustion.     Since the entitlement effect is likely to he

small relative to the standard search subsidy effect, the average

duration unemployment is likely to rise with increases in both the

level and potential duration of benefits.



Recall Prosoects, UI Benefits, and Unemoloyment Soell Duration

       The standard job search model is not entirely appropriate for

analyzing the unemployment durations of workers on layoff with some

possibility of recall.     Ihe interpretation of empirical evidence on

the duration of insured unemployment spells in the U.S.8 requires a

consideration of the role played by recalls since the majority of

insured unemployment spells appear to end in recall (Katz, 1986a;

Katz and Meyer, 1988). The prospect of recall affects the

probability of leaving unemployment directly through the rate of
actusl recalls and indirectly by affecting worker search behavior.

Katz (1986a) extends a standard model of jab search to include an

exogenous probability of recall.9          He shows that under reasonable


     7There are many reasons unrelated to UI that might generate a
direct effect of spell duration on the hazard rate. Empirically, one
csnnot separate out the independent effects of duration, time until
exhaustion, and potential benefit duration for s sample containing
only insured unemployment spells if P is fixed during all spells
since t, P-r, and P are perfectly collinesr.

        majority of insured unemployment spells in Canada also end in
recall by the previous employer. See-Robertson (1988).

     9Burdett and Mortensen (1978) and Pissarides (1982) also analyze
job search models that incorporate the possibility of recalls.
conditions better recall prospects reduce the new job finding rate by

raiaing the reservation wage and reducing the likelihood of search.
    The statistical model of unemployment spell durations generated

by the job search models extended to allow for recalls is a competing
risks model in which unemployment spells can end either through

recall or the finding of an acceptable new job.    The predictions of

standard job search models for how variables affect the escape rate

from unemployment really refer to the new job finding rate and these

predictions need not hold for the overall escape rate from

unemployment   (the sum of the recall and new job finding races).

Tnformation on whether spells end through recall or the finding of a

new job allows an econometrician to estimate a competing risks aodel.

Katz and Meyer (1988) have analyzed the unemployment spell durations
of a sample of UI recipients in Missouri using a competing risks

approach.   They find that UT recipients who expect to be recalled
have much lower new job finding rates than those who do not expect to

be recalled, and that the new job and recall races have quite

different time patterns and are often correlated in opposice

directions with characteristics of individuals.

   Mortensen (1987) analyzes the effects of limited duration UT

benefits in a joint wealth maximizing model of job separations that

incorporates the possibility of temporary layoffs.   Layoffs occur in

response to reductions in match-specific productivity.   The

reservation wage decreases over the course of an unemployment   spell
as a worker approaches benefit exhaustion.   This induces an

increasing new job finding rate as in Mortenaen (1977) and an
                                      10

increasing recall rate as well.     Mortenaen shows that for realistic

parameter values most of the decline in rhe reservation wage should
occur in the last week or two before exhaustion.       The discrete change

in the flow value of being unemployed when benefits are exhausted

yields the prediction rhat many firms may recall laid-off workers
around the benefir exhaustion point and that the new job finding rate

should increase around exhaustion.        The duration and incidence of

unemployment spells are shown to rise with increases in the level and

length of benefits.



Unemoloymenr Soell Duration in a Sraric Labor-Leisure Choice Model

      An alternative approach is taken by Moffitt and Nicholson (1982)

who use a aratic model where unemployed workers have preferences over

income and unemployment.    Unemployment is valued because of its
leisure component and because one can search while unemployed.        At

the   time of job loss, individuals choose income and weeks of

unemployment subject to a budget consrrainr.       The budget constraint

has a convex kink at the week of UI exhaustion because       unemployment
ceases to be subsidized at this point.        This kink combined with a

continuous distribution of tastes implies that many people will

maximize their utility by rerurning to work the week benefits lapse.

Randomness in the job finding procass suggests a cluster of spells

ending around rhe exhaustion   patn.r..

      Moffitt and Nicholson show that increases in rhe level and length

of benefits generate income and subsritution effects which serve to

increase the mean duration of unemployment spells.       The static nature
                                        11

of the model makes it difficult to translate its predictions into a

hazard model framework.        The key prediction is that the escape rate

from unemployment should he relatively high near the exhaustion

point.        The impacts of increases in the level or length of benefits

on the choice of spell duration roughly translate into negative

effects on the hazard rate.



Summary

       All three models considered suggest that the distribution of

unemployment spell durations should differ for UI recipients and

nonrecipients.       UI recipients should display stronger positive

duration dependence in the new job finding rate than nonrecipients at

least up through the point of exhaustion.        One may also expect to

find spikes in the escape rate (both through recalls and the finding

of new jobs) near exhaustion for UI recipients.        Increases in the

level and potential duration of benefits should increase the duration

of unemployment spells of UI recipients.




III.    UI,    Recalls, and Unemployment Spells: Evidence from the PSID



Data Description

       In this section, we compare the distributions of unemployment

spell durations of UI recipients and nonrecipients in the United

Stares.        We analyze employer-initiated unemployment spells in the

198D-81 period for a national sample of household heads.        The data
                                                       12

are derived from Waves 14 and 15 of the Panel Study of Income

Dynamics (P510)         .    The interviews        from     these   two waves       of     the    P510

provide     detailed        information     on each household           head's      last

unemployment        spell     at   least   partially        contained    in   the    calendar        year

preceding     the      interview date.10               For the last unemployment                 spell in
the calendar year prior to the interview, respondents provide

retrospective information on the spell duration and the start month
of the    spell.            We can also determine whether UI benefits were

received during the spell, and whether completed spells ended through

recall or the taking of a new job.

     The basic sample contains 1115 layoff and plant-closing

unemployment spells for household heads at least 20 and not greater
than 65 years old.12               This data set has two major advantages.                          First,


     lDThe questions concerning individual unemployment spells were
only asked of household heads who were labor force participants at
the time of the interview.  Individual unemployment spell infotmation
is not available for other household members.

     1The P510 allows one to distinguish among job separations
arising from quits, plant closings, and other employer-initiated
separations (layoffs and firings). The P510 does not distinguish
between separations initiated through layoffs and through firings
(discharges for cause)
         household head's last spell from the calendar year prior to
the interview date made it into the sample if (1) the spell ended in
recall to the pre-separation employer; (2) the spell ended in the
taking of a new job and the head was separated from his or her last
job by a plant closing, layoff, or firing; (3) the spell is censored
at the interview date and the head is categorized as on temporary
layoff; or (4) the spell is censored at the interview date and the
head is categorized as unemployed having been separated from last job
by plant closing, layoff or firing. Observations satisfying the
above criteria were deleted from the sample if they had missing
information on pre-separation industry, occupation, spell duration,
spell start date, or UI receipt. An observation was also deleted if
the head at the time of the interview was not the head in the
previous year.

it contains a large sample of spells for both UI recipients and

nonrecipienta, and contains information on complete unemployment

spells rather thsn just compensated unemployment.        UI benefits were

received during some part of the spell for 63 percent of the

observations   (703 spells)   .   Most studies of the impact of

unemployment   insurance utilize data sets containing only UI

recipients and only information on weeks of compensated

unemploymentJ3    Second, our data set allows us to separate the

escape rate from unemployment into its component parts: the new job

finding rste and the recall rate.        The ability to separate new job

acceptances from recalls is important since the impacts of UI on job
search behsvior predicted by standard search models refet to the new

job finding rste and do not necessarily translate into predictions
for the total escape rate in samples where recalls are important.

    The PSID data set also has several disadvantages.        First,

information is only available on whether UI is received at sometime

during a spell.   One cannot identify the level or potential duration

of the benefits available.        Second, response biases for retrospective

information on individual unemployment spells can be severe.

Mathiowetz and Duncan (1968) find in a study of response bias in

retrospective answers to unemployment questions similar to those
found in the PSID that short spells tend to be underreported and that

the reported start and end dates of spells are often quite

inaccurate.    It is unclear whether this type of response bias

distorts comparisons of the distribution of spell durations for UI

      There are sharp differences in the characteristics of UI

recipients and nonrecipients.     UI recipients have much higher wages

than nonrecipients.     Substantially larger fractions of the UI

recipients are white, married, male, and manufacturing workers.        The

recall rate is also substantially higher for UI recipients.        These

differences in the characteristics of rhe two groups help explain the

longer mean spell duration for nonrecipients.17



Samole Hazard Functions for UI Recioients and hionrecipients

      The   pattern of unemployment spell durations for UI recipients and

nonrecipients from the PSID sample is illustrated in Figures 2A and
28.    The figures plot the Kaplan-Meier empirical hazards for the two

samples with the weekly duration data grouped into two week intervals
for ease of presentation.     The overall empirical hazard for a given

two week period is the fraction of spells ongoing at the start oi the

period which end during the two week interval.     The recall and new

job empirical hazards, plotted for the rwo samples in Figures 3A and

38,   are analogously defined as the fraction of spells ongoing at the

start of a period which end during the period through recall and




     17Formal duration model estimates reported in Katz (l965) that
include demographic variables, industry, occupation, the county
unemployment rate, and a plant closing dummy indicate that the
differences in the spell durations for the two groups are largely
explained by differences in these observed variables.

    The figures reveal substantial differences in the pattern of the

escape rate froa unemployment for UI recipients and nonrecipients.

The total hszard rates are initially downward sloping for both

groups.   The total hazard increases substantially in the 25 to 40

week interval for UI recipients.       There are large spikes in the

escape rate from unemployment at 26 weeks and at 39 weeks for UI

recipients.     Spikes of similar magnitude at 26 and 39 weeks ste not

apparent for UI nonrecipients.       While the exact placing of the spikes

may be an artifact of the tendency for individuals to report long

unemployment rates as lasting exactly half a year, three quartets, or
one year (Sider, 1985), the much greater importance of these spikes

for UI recipients strongly suggests that they may be related to the

limited duration of UI benefits. Most UI recipients during this

period were eligible for either 26 or 39 weeks of benefits in a

benefit year.       The escape tate from unemployment   appears to increase

substantially around when many UI recipients would be exhausting
benefits and a much smaller increase in the escape rate is apparent

for nonrecipients.

    The total hazard rates presented in Figures 2A and 28 mask sharp

differences in the new job finding and recall rates illustrated in

Figures 3A and 38.       The recall hazard drops sharply with spell

duration for both UI recipients and nonrecipients.         Most recalls

occur within    8   weeks of the start date of a spell.    The new job

finding rate diffeta aubatantially for UI recipients

nonrecipients.  The new job finding rate starts out quite a bit lower

and is much more upward sloping for UI recipients.    The lower initial

new job finding rate for UI recipients may be an artifact of the one

week waiting period before UI eligibility in most states.

Individuals expecting quite short spells may also not bother to apply

for benefits.   On the other hand, these factors could not plausibly

account for the differences in the new job finding rate patterns for

UI recipients and nonrecipients   after the first few weeks.   The low

initial new job finding rate and apparent positive duration

dependence in the new job finding rate for UI recipients provides

support for the prediction that UI depresses new job finding when
time until exhaustion is large and that the escape rate rises with

time until exhaustion.   The jumps in the recall and new job finding

rates for UI recipients at likely exhaustion points (26 and 39 weeks)

are strong evidence for the prediction that firms teke into account

the duration of UI benefits in designing recall policies (as

suggested by the Mortensen'a   (1987) modeI of the impact of limited

duration UI on recall policies) and that workers become much more

likely to take new jobs as their benefits run out.    The absence of

such patterns for nonrecipients in the PSID sample strongly suggests

that these patterns represent behavioral responses by firms and

workers to the incentives created by a UI system with limited benefit

duration.

    The sample hazard functions plotted in the figures do nor take

into account heterogeneity among individuals in the sample.     Although
                                   18

uncontrolled heterogeneity biases estimates of duration dependence in

the total hazard towards spurious findings of negative   duration

dependence, a bias in the opposite direction is possible for an
individual escape route hazard in a competing risks model.    If

uncontrolled factors that raise the recall rate also reduce the new

job finding rate, then one can (at least in theory) generate spurious

positive duration dependence in the new job hazard.19    In fact,   Katz

(1986a) finds that positive duration dependence in the new job

finding rare for UI recipients is more prevalent when controls for
observables are included in formal duration model estiaaces using

this PSID data set.   The differences between the escape rates for UI

recipients and nonrecipients and the spikes near exhaustion points

for UI recipients also remain when we estimate competing risks models

with nonparametric baseline hazards and controls for observables are

estimated,29   Furthermore, Katz and Meyer (1988) find substantial

increases in both the recall and the new job finding rates near the

week of benefits exhaustion and find strong positive duration

dependence in the new job finding rate for a sample of UI recipients




     19Katz (l986b) shows that the cooditions required for unobserved
heterogeneity to lead to a bias in the direction of positive duration
dependence in the new job hazard are quite extreme.
     20Man and Hausman (1986) have developed an estimator to handle
unobserved heterogeneity that is correlated among the risks in a
competing risks model. They have implemented their estimator on a
sub-sample of our PSID data set that excludes spells initiated by
plant closings. Their results indicate that there is essentially
zero correlation among the unobservables in the new job and recall
hazards and that allowing for correlated, unobserved heterogeneity
does not qualitatively affect one's inferences for this data set.

IV. Hazsrd Model Estimates using the Moffitt Data Set



       This section reports hazard model estimates of the effect of the

level and length of UI benefits on unemployment durations.     We use

Continuous Wage and Benefit History (CWBH) UI administrative records

on the compensated unemployment spells of a sample of 3365 males from

twelve states during the period l97B-l983.  The sample is drawn from
                                                  22
a data set previously analyzed by Moffitt (l985a)     CWBH data

provide accurare information for each individual on the level of UI
benefits and their potential duration.     The number of weeks of

benefit receipt is also known exactly.23     This avoids many of the

measurement error problems common in other data sources.
      The data set provides enough variation in UI system parameters

within and across stares and over rime to get accurate estimates of

the    impact of the level and length of UI benefits and the time until


        21The Missouri data set combines UI administrative records with
a follow-up survey of UI recipients.  The administrative records
allow one to accurately date whether a spell ends in the week that
benefits lapse.

     22The original Moffitt (1985a) data set contains 4&28
observations. 1,227 observations are excluded because of missing
data on age, schooling, dependents or marital status. 36
observations are excluded because the recorded spell is longer than
the reported potential duration of benefits.

     23The spells in the Moffitt data are periods of benefit receipt.
Spells that are interrupted by short periods when benefits are not
received are concatenated. This modified spell of benefit receipt
may do a better job of grouping together periods of similar behavior.
See Moffirt (l985b) for more discussion.

benefit exhaustion.      On the other hand, the data set only covers

compensated unemployment so that one cannot use it to make inferences
about what happens to individuals after benefits are exhausted.               The

data set also does not permit one to identify whether spells end

through recall or the finding of a new job.             Thus one can only

analyze the overall unemployment escape rate.
       The duration of unemployment spells is analyzed using formal

hazard model techniques.         We use a proportional hazards model

estimator that allows for time-varying explanatory variables and

which nonparametrically         estimates the change in the hazard over time.

This semiparametric approach is analyzed in detail in Meyer              (1986).

The estimates are the parameters of a continuous time hazard model

and thus retain a clear interpretation.             Nonparametrically   estimating
the change   in the hazard over time eliminates the need to impose a

potentially restrictive functional form that has little theoretical

justification.       If an incorrect functional form were assumed, all of

the parameter esrimares from the model would be inconsistent.               This

danger is avoided by nonparametrically estimating the baseline
hazard.

      Formally, we parameterize the overall hazard rare of exit from

unemployment for individual i at time t, ).(t)             using the

proportional hazards form.           Let T. be the length of individual i's

unemployment spell.          Then the hazard at spell length r is

        9 is a vector of parameters which is unknown.

UI 1 is the additional effect on the hazard when one moves from

1 week from exhaustion.  Thus, the effect of moving from 6 weeks away

 to 1 week is 4 times the UI 2-5 coefficient plus the UI 1

 coefficient.        The other UI spline coefficients have analogous

 interpretations.

        Formally, let      r    be the number of weeks until benefits lapse.

             0 otherwise,


and similarly for the remaining spline variables.

       In some of the later specifications the potential duration of

benefits is directly included as an explanatory variable along with

the rime until exhaustion spline.24                        In addition, interaction terms

suggested by the thaoretical models reviewed in section It and

previous empirical work are included.                       These variables interact the

level of benefits with age,                  the unemployment rate, and the            time until

exhaustion.     Since benefits are extended in the course of many

spells, a variable is included which equals                       1   in week   t   if anytime

during a spell it was expected that benefits would lapse in week                                t.


This variable may also pick up the possibility that some individuals

do not apply for extended benefits even when eligible.                              The state

unemployment rate variable used in the specifications changes during
each spell.     State dummy variables (fixed-effects) are included in

the    specifications to account for unobserved differences across
states that may be correlated with both the generoaity of the state

UI system and the character of unemployment in the state.                              The other

included variables are age, race,                     education, marital status and the

number of dependents.



Discussion of the Estimates

          The coefficient estimates from the specifications are reported

in Table 2.      Meyer (1988) provides a detailed discussion of the
estimates from similar specifications using this data set.       A

discussion of the non-UI variable coefficients can also be found

there.      In all of the specifications tried the UI benefit level has a

large negative effect on the hazard rate.        Specification 1 indicates

that a ten percent increase in the benefit level       is associated with

a 5.4 percent decrease in the hazard.       A strong effect of weeks until

benefits lapse is seen from the exhaustion spline coefficient

estimates in Specification     I.   The hazard increasea 94 percent when

one moves from 5 weeks to 2 weeks before benefits expire.       In the

last week the hazard increases an additional 78 percent.

Cumulatively, the hazard more than triples as one moves from         g   weeks

to   1   week before exhaustion.

     Since the data set we utilize contains information on sleeks of

benefit receipt rather than on actual weeks of unemployment,         an

institutional feature of state UI systems could be responsible for

some of the rise in the hazard found in the last week before benefits

lapse.      In most states there is a cap on the total dollar amount of

benefits paid to an individual during a benefit year.       The cap

typically depends on an individual's base period earnings.       If this

cap on total benefit payments is binding, an individual may receive

smaller benefit payment in his or her last week of eligibility.            Sors€

individuals may not bother to pick up this smaller final check.

Individuals who remained unemployed but did not collect their final

UI benefit would be treated in our hazard model estimates as escaping

from unemployment in the week before benefits are exhausted.

    The possibility that these smaller final payments could

spuriously generate the rise in the hazard just before exhaustion was
examined using an additional dats set.     The data set contains CWBH

informstion on 38,472 unemployment spells from 8 states during 1979-

1984.    The eight states include seven of the twelve in our subset of

the CWBH data set previously snalyzed by Moffitt.    We compared the

hazard rate of exit from compensated unerployment in the week before

regular benefits lapse when the benefit payment was its full amount
and when it was reduced because of the cap on total dollar benefits.
Those who received Extended Benefits or Federal Supplemental

Compensation benefits were excluded.     For the eight states the hazard

wss 21 percent higher (25.7 percent as compared to 21.2 percent) when

the last payment was less than the full weekly amount.     While these

comparisons are somewhat crude since we did not control for other
individual attributes, they support the hypothesis that a lower

benefit amount may cause people not to claim their last week of

benefits.    However, because only s slim majority of the final

payments are less than the full amount, this effect could only cause
s 12 percent   increase in the overall hazard the week before benefits

lapse.    Thus, only a small part of the rise in the hazard just before

exhaustion could be explained by this phenomenon.

   The estimates reported in Table 2 also indicate that the
                                       25

probability of a spell ending is very high in a week in which

benefits were scheduled to lapse at soae point earlier in a spell.

One interpretation of this result is that some firas' plan the tiaing

of recalls and some workers' arrange the starting of a new job to

coincide with the end of eligibility for benefits, but do not alter

these plans in the face of an extension of benefits.            Alternatively,

this result could reflect that some people eligible for extended

benefits do not claim them.

    The estimated effect of the benefit level on the length oi

unemployment spells is at the high end of the distribution of recent
estimates.    A consensus of the previous estimates of the effect of a

ten percentage point increase in the replacement ratio might be a

one-half to one week increase in the length of spells.25                Here the

estimate is around one and one-half weeks.        Larger estimated effects

are a plausible result of better data on spell length and the level

and length of benefits.     Many other studies have hsd to impute the
level of benefits for individuals and often it is not known who is

even eligible for benefits.

      The sources of variation in benefit levels in our data are

nonlinesrities in the benefit schedules (different minima and maxima

across states), legislative changes during the sample period, and the

erosion of real benefit levels due to inflation between legislative

changes.     Benefit maxims differ substantially across states.                For

example, the maximum benefit in Missouri is below the mean benefit in

Pennsylvania in our data set.     It is hard to make a plausible caae

for endogeneity of these soutces of vatiation given that we are

controlling fot the previous wage, as well as state characteristics

through the fixed effects. As a check on the specification however,
future work is planned which will concentrate on variation in

benefits due only to legislative changes.

     Specification   (2) in Table   2   includes several additional

variables.   The potential duration of benefita is included as in the

original Noffitt (1983a) paper.         This variable is time-varying and

often increases from 26 to 39 in the course of a spell as benefits

are extended.   The entitlement effect captured by Mortensen's        (1977)

job search model leads to the prediction that the coefficient on
                                                        until
potential benefit duration should be positive when time
exhaustion is also included as a covariate. In fact, the coefficient
estimate is negative and substantial in magnitude, although it is not
                                                                  is
quite significant at conventional levels. A negative coefficient

consistent with the income effects from more generous benefits

postulated by Moffitt and Nicholson (19g2).         The coefficient estimate
                                                                a 27
implies that a 13 week extension of benefits is associated with

percent decline in the hazard.
    Two benefit level interaction variables are also included in

Specification (2).    Benefits are interacted with the dummy variable

Age 17-24.   This variable has a large and significant negative
                                                            to the
coefficient, indicating that the response of younger people

                                       27

(1985)   In a specification not reported, we also interacted the

benefit level with Age 25-35.     This variable had a negative

coefficient, but was small and insignificant.
    An interaction between the level of benefits and time until

exhaustion less than or equal to   3   weeks was also added.   Thia

coefficient tends to support the hypothesis of Mortenaen (1977) that
                                                 exhaustion (and may
higher benefits will have less of an effect near
even raise the hazard), but the positive coefficient ia not quite

significant.
    Several other specifications were tried, but are not reported.

If Specification    (2) is estimated without atate fixed effects,     the

benefit level coefficient almost doubles in absolute value to .0073

(standard error .0011), while the estimated time until exhaustion and

potential benefit duration effects are not greatly altered. The
exclusion of fixed effects also causes the state unemployment rate to

that higher unemployment states also tend to have longer spells, but

when the unemployment rate rises within a given state the mean speli

length drops.     This finding may be the result of a composition effect

arising from the greater frequency of short temporary layoffs
downturns. Other interactions between the benefit level and tiae

until exhaustion were tried, but they were small and inaignificant.

    Further apecificationa were estimated which explicitly accounted

 for the potential impact of omitted variables on the hazard model

 estimates.    These left out variables are typically called unobserved

 heterogeneity.    Specifications which allowed unobserved heterogeneity
                                     28

with a gamma distribution were tried.     The signs and statistical

significance of the main coefficients did not change appreciably, but
the benefit coefficients    (benefit level, benefit and age interaction,

potential duration of benefits) rose by about 25 percent.


V. Simulating   the Impact of Changes in the Length and Level of UI

Sene fits



    In this section, we simulate the effect of changes in the level

and length of UI benefits on the duration of unemployment spells, the

exhaustion rate, and the amount of benefits paid.     Simulations are

useful to better describe the effects of changes in covariates

because the transformation from a change in the hazard to changes in

spell length is complex.     The complexity arises from the nonlinearity

of the model and the estimation of a separate baseline hazard

parameter for each spell length interval.     Simulations also provide   a


degree of robustness to unobserved heterogeneity.     One interpretation

of results presented in Lancaster (1985) is that unobserved

heterogeneity biases coefficient estimates toward zero but will have
little effect on elasticities of mean duration with respect to

covariates.26   Our simulations essentially calculate these mean

duration elasticities.     The simulations also allow one to use the

entire distribution of explanatory variables rather than evaluating

the model at the mean of the covariates.     Finally, changes in the

for 39 weeks of benefits (the standard potential duration in a period

in which extended benefits are triggered).   The moat speculative part

of the procedure is making an assumption concerning behavior after

benefits are exhausted.   Since the data set covers only compensated

unemployment, one cannot use it for inferences concerning post-
exhaustion escape rates. We assume that after exhaustion the

baseline hazard is equal to the average baseline hazard is our sampie

and that the benefit level is zero.  The exhaustion spline is treated

 as if one is 15 weeks before exhaustion in the simulations presented

where N is the sample size.        Given the aggregate survivot function,

the predicted mean weeks of unemployment is calculated using the

rolling sum which is the predicted weeks of unemployment                           accumulated

by week t.

In all of the simulations N(l04), the number of weeks accumulated by

the end of two yeats, was calculated.                Since the sum converged

rapidly the simulation results would not he very different if we had
truncated the sum at 1 or     3   years instead.                  Thus, the predicted mean

weeks of unemployment is defined by N(104).

      Predicted mean weeks compensated is defined by                    14(d),   where d is

the potential duration of benefits.                Predicted benefits paid per

where b. is the UI benefit for individual                    i.     Finally, the predicted

percentage exhausting UI benefits equals S(d).

Simulation Results

       Simulations which use Specification               1   are reported in Table            3,

and simulations using Specification            2    are reported         in Table 4.         The

base case scenario predicted values differ appreciably                           for   the   two
                                   32

simulations, but the effectsof policy changes are very similar.               The

base case difference occurs because the simulations assuae that

potential duration does not change during the unemployment spells,
while in the actual Moffitt data the potential duration benefits

rises in the course of many spells as benefits are extended.           This

effect is captured through the baseline hazard estimates in

Specification I rather than directly in the potential duration of
benefita coefficient as in Specification 2.      Tn both sets of

simulations the potential duration of benefits is assuaed to be

constant over time, but in Specification 1 the baseline hazard

estimates implicitly incorpotate increases in the potential duration

of benefits from extended benefits triggers turning on during the

course of a spell.   Thus the simulations from Specification       2


presented in Table 4 probably provide a better guide to the mean

weeks of unemployment and benefit payments to be expected in each of

the scenarios.

    We simulated the impact of changes in UI parameters on the

predicted mean completed spell of unemployment and on the mean weeks

of compensated unemployment.   Tables   3   and 4 report the following

policy experiments: 10, 20 and 30 percent reductions in the level of

benefits, and changes in the potential duration of benefits from 39
to either 35 or 26 weeks.   A change in maximum potential benefit

duration from 26 to 39 weeks is exactly the natural policy experiment

that occurs when extended benefits are triggered in the United

States.

length of benefits have substantial effects on the aean duration of

unemployment of UI recipients.     The two sets of simulations provide

quite similar estimates of the impact of policy changea.     An incteaae

in the potential duration of benefits from 26 to 39 weeks is

predicted to raise the mean unemployment spell duration by 2.1 weeks

in both simulations.     This is a surprisingly large effect given that

most spells are completed well before the 26 weeks of regular

benefits run out.     An increase in potential benefit duration will

mechanically increase the mean compensated spell duration even if
benefits have no incentive effect since previously uncompensated

unemployment will be classified as compensated unemployment.       The

predicted effect of an extension of benefits from 26 weeks to 39
weeks if there are no incentive effects from extending benefits

(using Specification 2) is a 0.9 week increase in mean compenaated
spell duration.     Thus most of the impact of extended benefits on

compensated unemployment arises through the negative effects of UI on
the escape rate from unemployment.

    We conclude from an examination of a variety of simulated changea

in potential benefit durations that a one week extension of banefira

increases the mesn duration of an unemployment spell by approximately

0.16 to 0.20 weeks.     One caveat in interpreting these estimates is

thst much of the variation in the potential length of benefits atiaes

from the extension of benefits in times    of poot macroeconomic

conditions.   Tf the time-varying state unemployment tate variable

included in our specifications does not fully capture labor market

conditions, then part of the our estimate of the increase in the
                                    34

duration of unemployment from an increase in potential benefit

duration may aimply reflect that potential benefit duration is high

when job availability is low.   However, the estimated effects of UI

are corroborated by Specification 1 which does not use this source of

variation in the UI parameters and still gives similar results.

    Our estimates of the impact of potential benefit duration on the

average unemployment   spell duration of UI recipients are s bit larger
than most of those in the literature.    Our estimates are slightly

larger than Moffitt's (1985a) estimate of 0.15 weeks from a model
that does not include state dummy variables.    Hoffitt and Nicholson

(1982) find using a static labor supply estimation framework that s
one week extension raises the average unemployment duration by 0.10

week.   Noffitt and Nicholson's sample includes only UI recipients who

had exhausted their regular benefits, and their measure of

unemployment includes both compensated and uncompensared

unemployment.   It seems plausible that a group of largely   "long-

term" unemployed workers, such as the sample analyzed by Hoffitt and

Nicholson, may be less sensitive to benefits than a more

representative group of UI recipients such as in the data set we

examine.   In a study of Canadian UI recipients, Ham and Res (1987)

find that s one week increase in the duration of benefits increases

the mean duration to the start of a new job by 0.26-0.33 weeks in a

competing risks framework.28
    The hypothetical UI parameter changes examined in the simulations


     28Since some of the spells in their sample end in recall, it is
difficult to translate this finding into an estimate of the effect on
the mean duration of unemployment.
                                     35

have substantial effects on the amount of benefits paid per spell.     A

reduction in the level of benefits by 10 percent has an impact on the

UI budget similar to a reduction in the potential duration of

benefits from 39 to 26 weeks.    The simulations indicate that

increases in potential benefit duration have much larger adverse

incentive effects on unemployment than do chmnges in the level of

benefits that have the same effect on the UI budget.    The simulations

in Table 4 show that the budget cut from the base case accomplished

through s 10 percent reduction in benefits reduces mean unemployment

by 1.2 weeks, while a similar budget cut done through eliminating
extended benefirs generstes almost twice as large a reduction in

unemployment.
    These findings suggest that a government with a fixed UI budget

faces s sharp trade-off between incentives and insurance in the

design of the level and time sequence of UI payments.    A balanced

budget reduction in the level and increase in the maximum duration of
benefits has strong adverse incentive effecra although it does

provide grester protection for those who are unlucky in their

attempts to gain reemployment.    The theoretical results of Shavell

and Weiss (1979) concerning the optimal design of a UI system subject

to e fixed UI budget combined with our findings of strong behavioral

effects of UI on the rate of reemployment suggest that a system of

high benefits with limited duration may be preferable to one with
lower benefits of longer duration.

The Impacts of Extended Benefits on the Income of the Unemployed

       Broadly, our results suggest thst the behavioral effects of Ut
sre extremely important.      In fact,   the estimated incentive effects of

extended benefits are large enough to allow the possibility          that

benefit extensions     could actually reduce the total money income of

UI recipients.     If the benefit extension did not affect       the duration

of unemployment or reemployment earnings, then increasing the weeks

of unemployment    in which benefits are received would unambiguously

raise the income of the unemployed.           On the other hand, if a higher

duration of benefits increases unemployment duration and does nor

affect reemployment wages, the extension of benefits may reduce the

income (although probably not the welfare) of UI recipients if

reemployment wages are higher than UI benefits.
       The following simple calculations are instructive concerning the
incentive effects of increases in benefit duration.           The simulations

presented in Table 4 imply that an increase in benefit duration from

26 to 39 weeks    raises the unemployment income of typical UI

                                                 in 1977 dollars).   If one
recipients by $223 (from $1222 to $1455
assumes that there are no behavioral effects of extending benefits,

i.e.    the distribution   of spells is unchanged, then the analogous

figure is $98.29     The overall impact of this increase in potential

benefit duration on the income of the typical UI recipient may be

assessed under alternative assumptions about reemployment wages.              We

make the strong assumption that reemployment weekly wages are


     29This calculations assumes rhar the escape rare from
unemployment after 26 weeks is the same as it would be if benefits
had not been extended.
                                                    37

unaffected by the availability of extended benefits.                       Under this

assumption, the change in a UI recipient's money income arising from

the extension of benefits is given by the formula:



 A Income =       C       A(Weeks of compensated unemployment) * (WeeklyUI benefit)
              -       C   A(Total Weeks of unemployment) * (Reemployment weekly wage))



In Table 5, we present the predicted impact on the income of a UI

recipient (with pre-Ul weekly earnings equal to our sample average of

$170) of an increase in potential benefit duration from 26 to 39
weeks.   We use the simulations discussed above based on

specifications (1) and (2) from Table                     2.   We consider three oases for

each specification.                 The first case assumes there are no behavioral

effects of extended benefits.                   The second case assumes that extended
benefits increase unemployment by the amounts shown in out simulation

results (in Tables 3 and 4) and that reemployment wages are 90

percent of pte-UI weekly wages.                   The final case assumes these same

behavioral effects on the duration of unemployment, but assumes that

reemployment wages are only 60 percent of pre-Ul weekly wages.                           Katz

and Meyer (1988) find that the typical UI recipient who gains

teemployment within a year of layoff has (initial) reemployment

weekly earnings that ste approximately 10 percent less than pta-UI

weekly earnings.                On the other hand,       those who were not recalled and

exhausted benefits averaged 50 percent losses in weekly earnings.

    The calculations presented in Table 5 suggest that extending

benefits may reduce the total money income of UI recipients.                          If one

These calculations assume a pre-Ul weekly wage of $170. All figures are in

earnings, then both specifications yield the ptediction
income of the typical UI recipient actually falls in response to an

increase in potential benefit duration from 26 to 39 weeka.       If

workers whose behavior is most strongly affected by extended henefita

have low reemployment wages, then it is likely that extended benefits

raise the money income of UI recipients.       Of course, these

calculations ignore the increases in leisure accruing ro Ut

recipients from greater unemployment and do not take into account the

possibility that extended benefits may allow workers to make better

job matches raising future earnings from employment.       If a longer

durstion of benefits allows workers to find higher paying jobs and

these jobs last for even several months, then extended benefits are

likely to raise the income of the unemployed.


VI.   Conclusions


      The evidence presented in this paper indicates that the potential

duration of UI benefits has a strong impact on the duration of the
                                                                  Our
unemployment spells of UI recipients in the United States.
examination of data from the PSID indicates that the distributions of

unemployment spell durstions of UI recipients and nonrecipients are

quite different.    Substantial increases in both the recall rare and

new job finding rate are apparent for UI recipients around the time

when benefits are likely to lapse.        Large increases in the eacape
rate from unemployment in the several weeks before exhaustion are
                                     39

also apparent for a large sample of UI tecipients for which

administrative data allows us to accurately date the end of the spell

and the point at which benefits are exhausted.     Katz and Meyer (1988)

report similar increases in the hazard rate near exhaustion for
another sample of UI recipients.     It seems safe to conclude that

potential benefit duration has significant behavioral effects on firm
recall policies and worker new job finding strategies.      Furthermore,

our estimates indicate that policies that extend benefits have much

greater adverse incentive effects on the duration of unemployment
than policies with the same predicted impact on the government budget

which raise the level of benefits.

    Our results indicate that a one week increase in potential

benefit duration increases the average duration of the unerployment

spells of UI recipients by about 0.16 to 0.20 weeks.      These estimates

can be used guardedly to make a rough guess as to what the impact of

longer potential benefit durations in Europe than in the United

States is on the mean duration of unemployment.     An increase in

potential benefit duration from six months to one year is predicted
to increase mean duration of unemployment by 4 to    5   weeks, and an

increase from six months to two years is predicted to generate a 13

to 16 week increase in unemployment duration,     The average

uncompleted duration of ongoing spells was 68.2 weeks in the United

Kingdom in 1984 versus 18 weeks in the United States (Lsyard and

Mickell, 1986).   The fraction of the unemployed covered by benefits
                                     40

is also much lower in the United States than in the United Kingdom.30

Thus, longer duration of benefits may be able to explain about 10 to
30 percent of the difference in mean unemployment   spell durations

between the United States and the United Kingdom.

    Two caveats about our results should be kept in mind.     First,

while lower unemployment benefits might decrease the length of UI

recipients' spells, the spells of non-UI recipients might rise due to

congestion/displacement   effects.   If aggregate employment is

determined by the level of demand, and the marching of particular

workers to jobs is not important, shorter unemployment spells for ono

group would imply longer spells on average for others.     This effect

would imply that our estimates of the microeconomic effects of UI on

unemployment are sn overestimate of the macroeconomic effects.

Second, we have concentrated on transitions in one direction between

only Iwo of the possible labor market states.     Clark and Summers

(1982)   and Topel (1985) have emphasized the effects of UI on other

transitions.    A more encompassing analysis of the effects of UI on

the labor market might yield different conclusions about the

aggregste effects of changes in the level and length of UI benefits.

decline in the fraction of the unemployed receiving UI in rho U.S.
