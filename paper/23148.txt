The Effect of Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs on Opioid Utilization in Medicare

                                          ABSTRACT

The misuse of prescription opioids has become a serious epidemic in the US. In response, states
have implemented Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs), which record a patient's
opioid prescribing history. While few providers participated in early systems, states have recently
begun to require providers to access the PDMP under certain circumstances. We find that "must
access" PDMPs significantly reduce measures of misuse in Medicare Part D. In contrast, we find
that PDMPs without such provisions have no effect. We find stronger effects when providers are
required to access the PDMP under broad circumstances, not only when they are suspicious.

1     Introduction
In recent years, the use of prescription opioids has grown dramatically in the United States; between 1999

and 2010, opioid prescriptions increased by 300% (Kunins et al., 2013). Opioids are an effective analgesic,

but bring a high risk of addiction and overdose, and over the same period deaths from opioid poisoning

more than quadrupled (Chen et al., 2014). Increases in opioid overdose deaths contributed to a historical

reversal in the decline of mid-life all-cause mortality over the period 1999 to 2013 (Case and Deaton, 2015).

In addition, it became clear that opioids prescribed legitimately by well-meaning medical professionals were

being diverted to street sale for non-medical use (Dart et al., 2015). In October 2015, President Obama and

health care provider groups announced a set of joint public-private initiatives aiming to improve prescribing

practices and expand addiction treatment; the bipartisan 21st Century Cures Act awards more than $1

billion in new funding for grants to states for related efforts.

    The most significant policy responses to the opioid problem have taken place at the state level. Most

importantly, nearly every state has implemented a Prescription Drug Monitoring Program, or PDMP, that

collects data on prescriptions for controlled substances to facilitate detection of suspicious prescribing and

utilization. A PDMP allows authorized individuals to view a patient’s prescribing history in order to identify

those who are misusing or diverting opioids. State programs have evolved over time and continue to vary

along several dimensions, including the extent to which medical providers are encouraged to access the data.

Early programs were developed by law enforcement agencies and had provisions that made it difficult for

providers to access the data. Other programs did not block provider access, but did not actively encourage

them to utilize the data. PDMP administrative data show that, when provider access is possible but not

mandatory, only a small share of providers create PDMP logins and actually request patient histories (PDMP

Center of Excellence, 2014). A goal of the October 2015 initiative was to “double the number of health care

providers registered with their state PDMPs in the next two years”, showing the recent acknowledgment of

this problem (White House, 2015). Low provider utilization of these programs may explain why a number of

studies find that PDMPs have little or no effect on opioid use and related adverse health outcomes (Meara

et al., 2016; Paulozzi et al., 2011; Reifler et al., 2012; Jena et al., 2014; Li et al., 2014; Brady et al., 2014;

Haegerich et al., 2014).

    Between 2007 and 2013, seventeen states implemented PDMPs for the first time but did not require

providers to access them. Ten states enacted stronger laws requiring providers to access the PDMP under

certain circumstances prior to prescribing. In nine of these ten states the “must access” requirement was

enacted to improve the efficacy of a PDMP that was already in place. Prior studies fail to account for

differences between programs that do and do not require providers to access the database. This requirement

                                                        2
is the main focus of this paper. Applying difference-in-differences models to aggregated claims data from

Medicare’s prescription drug program (Medicare Part D), we evaluate the effect of PDMPs on the prescription

drug utilization of Medicare beneficiaries. Our large-N microdata allows us to go beyond measures of average

utilization, which have been the main focus of previous studies, to measure rare outcomes in the upper tail of

the distribution – the exact outcomes that PDMPs are meant to impede. For example, a key outcome that

we analyze is the percentage of opioid users who obtain prescriptions from five or more prescribers, which

is a commonly used marker for “doctor shopping”. The Part D claims also allow us to construct multiple

measures capturing the intensity of opioid utilization. Additional data on hospital, outpatient, and physician

claims provide information on opioid poisoning incidents. Effects among the Medicare population are likely

to correlate with effects among the general population, and due to the program’s size effects in Medicare are

noteworthy in their own right. Meara et al. (2016) note that nearly one in four prescription overdose deaths

in 2008 was a disabled Medicare beneficiary.

   We first establish that a PDMP without a “must access” provision is not associated with opioid misuse

in Medicare. In contrast, we find that implementing a “must access” PDMP reduces many of measures

of excessive quantity – the share of beneficiaries obtaining more than seven months supply in each half-

year, and the share that fill claims before the previous claim’s days supply has been used. In addition,

we find that “must access” PDMPs reduce “shopping” behavior. In treatment states relative to controls,

the percentage of Medicare Part D enrollees who obtain prescriptions from five or more prescribers falls by

8% and the percentage of enrollees who obtain prescriptions from five or more pharmacies by more than

15%. These results suggest that measures that require prescribers to access the PDMP can be an effective

way to reduce questionable opioid use patterns. And even though our quantity and shopping measures are

strongly correlated with opioid poisoning incidents as observed in medical claims data, we find a negative

but statistically insignificant relationship between “must access” PDMP laws and opioid poisoning incidents.

   Because there is little or no integration of state databases, drug-seeking individuals trying to avoid

scrutiny may cross state borders to escape detection by the PDMP in their home state. We test for such

avoidance behavior using a novel measure of whether a Part D enrollee disproportionately obtains opioids

from out-of-state prescribers or pharmacies (relative to her out-of-state rate for non-opioid prescriptions).

Our results indicate that a “must access” PDMP in a given state raises the rate at which that state’s residents

obtain opioids from out-of-state prescribers by roughly a third of a standard deviation.

   We also exploit the Medicare medical claims for a new measure of shopping behavior, also novel to our

knowledge. An individual shopping for a provider willing to prescribe opioids will incur an unusual number

of claims in which the provider bills Medicare for a “new patient” procedure code. A “must access” PDMP

reduces the share of individuals with four or more new patient visits in a half-year by 15%. Given Medicare
                                                      3
outlays for these visits, a “must access” PDMP in every state would avert $174 million in expenditures each

half-year.

   As is the case in many areas where public policies are enacted at the state level, there is some heterogeneity

among “must access” PDMP laws. Although our main analysis estimates the average effect of these laws,

we also estimate models that exploit this heterogeneity to compare what can plausibly be characterized as

stronger or weaker forms of “must access”. Specifically, we allow for differences among laws that pertain

to certain care settings (2 states), laws that require providers to access the PDMP only when they are

suspicious of an individual (3 states), and laws that effectively pertain to all providers and all patients (5

states). We find that the broadest laws, which apply to all ingredients and settings and do not rely on

provider discretion, have the strongest impacts on our measures of excessive quantity. However, even the

weaker laws have effects on measures of shopping behavior.

   Additional results support a causal interpretation of our findings for “must access” laws. We estimate

event-study regression models to test for differences in trends prior to the implementation of “must access”

laws and generally find no statistically significant difference between “treatment” and “control” states in the

pre period. We also investigate whether the estimated effects of “must access” PDMPs might be driven by

other state policies, including either other aspects of PDMP design or non-PDMP opioid control policies.

Based on an extensive review of state policies, we identified three policies that co-occur with our policy of

interest, but these policies have little or no independent impact on opioid misuse and the estimated effects

for “must access” laws are unchanged when we control for these alternative policies. We also show that our

results are very robust to dropping any one of our treatment states, suggesting our findings are not driven by

unusual circumstances in one of our implementing states. Finally, as a sort of placebo test, we examine the

utilization of statins and antidepressants. It is very uncommon to obtain these drug classes from multiple

prescribers or pharmacies, suggesting that our opioid “misuse” measures do not simply reflect poor care

coordination among Medicare beneficiaries. We find no effects of a “must access” PDMP on the utilization

of either of these two types of drugs.

   Individuals who qualify for Medicare on the basis of a disability are known to have high rates of opioid

misuse and abuse (GAO, 2011). We find that the majority of the policy impacts we find in the overall

Medicare population are driven by the disabled subpopulation, particularly the low-income disabled. We

also consider as a population of special interest all those who historically met our criteria for doctor-shopping

at least once. Effects are quite large in percentage terms among this population, consistent with this policy

curbing misuse among the targeted population.

   With sizable financial support from the Federal government, every state but Missouri has implemented a

PDMP in response to the prescription opioid epidemic. Our results help explain why the existing literature
                                                       4
provides little consistent evidence of their effectiveness. Given that PDMPs are designed to combat the

misuse and diversion of opioids by alerting providers of questionable utilization patterns, they will only be

successful if providers make use of the data collected by the program. Based on this logic, in recent years

states have begun strengthening their PDMPs by requiring providers to access the data. In this paper, we

provide the first empirical evaluation of such “must access” laws.


2     Background

2.1    Opioids and Medicare Part D

In recent decades, many physicians have argued that pain, “the fifth vital sign”, was historically undertreated

(Pasero and McCaffery, 1997). In response, the medical community began to treat pain more aggressively,

often using prescription opioids. The top panel of Figure 2 shows the spread in opioid prescriptions between

2007 and 2013, the time period covered by this analysis. Much of the increase came in prescriptions for

chronic pain, despite the fact that research suggests that opioids are less effective for chronic pain than for

acute pain, such as after surgery (Manchikanti et al., 2010). Along with the increase in utilization came

significant increases in rates of misuse and overdose; the dashed line in Figure 2 shows a steep increase

in emergency department visits for opioid poisoning. According to the National Survey on Drug Use and

Health (NSDUH), by 2013 more than 35 million Americans had used pain relievers non-medically at least

once in their life (NSDUH, 2014).

    Given the significant disease burden of the elderly and disabled, it is not surprising that opioid use is quite

common in Medicare Part D. The bottom half of Figure 2 depicts opioid utilization and poisonings among

Part D enrollees, demonstrating the national trends are reproduced in the sample we consider. In 2010,

approximately one-quarter of Part D enrollees took opioids (Jena et al., 2014). Use is especially prevalent

among disabled Medicare beneficiaries: in 2011 nearly half filled an opioid prescription (Morden et al., 2014).

Over the time period of this analysis, the median days supply among disabled opioid takers rose from 60

days in the first half of 2007 to 105 days in the second half of 2013. A 2011 report by the Government

Accountability Office (GAO) found that in 2008 2% of Medicare beneficiaries obtained frequently-abused

drugs (opioids as well as some stimulants and benzodiazepines) from five or more prescribers per year,

which they deemed indicative of “doctor shopping” (GAO, 2011). Patterns of questionable access are more

prevalent among the disabled, who comprise about a third of opioid takers in Medicare Part D. However,

opioid misuse among the elderly has been rising in the very recent past. In 2012, the opioid mortality rate

among those over sixty years of age surpassed that of those between twenty and fifty-nine (West et al., 2015).

    For most years since the Medicare prescription drug program was established in 2006, program adminis-

                                                         5
trators and plan sponsors have had a limited ability to identify or curtail opioid misuse (GAO, 2011). Efforts

to address the problem have largely been limited to encouraging plans to “provide practitioner and benefi-

ciary education as appropriate” when suspicious patterns were identified. While state Medicaid programs

can require suspected opioid abusers to receive their drugs from only one prescriber or one pharmacy, the

legislation authorizing Medicare Part D did not permit either Part D plans or the Center for Medicare and

Medicaid Services (CMS) to restrict access in this way (GAO, 2011). In addition, while beneficiaries can

change Part D plans at least yearly, an insurer that has identified suspected drug abuse was not permitted

to transmit that information to future insurers (Blum, 2013). In July 2013, the last half-year of our sample,

Medicare began notifying plans of individuals with potentially inappropriate opioid utilization as defined by

its own PDMP-style Overutilization Monitoring System, although no action was required. In 2017 or 2018,

CMS recommends that plans begin denying inappropriate claims at “point-of-sale”, and plans will gain the

authority to limit high-risk beneficiaries to certain prescribers or pharmacies (Agrawal, 2016). To note, opi-

oids are relatively inexpensive, incurring a negotiated price of $1.61 per day in our sample. Opioids account

for only about 3% of Part D insurers’ total drug costs in 2011, whereas antidepressants, for example, are

taken by about as many individuals but account for nearly 10%. If only a small portion of opioid utilization

is inappropriate, insurers may not choose to undertake self-financed efforts to interdict it.

2.2    State Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs

The most important policies aimed at curbing opioid abuse are prescription drug monitoring programs, or

PDMPs, which are established and operated by states to collect and facilitate the sharing of data on opioid

prescriptions. The earliest programs were primarily designed to assist law enforcement in investigations,

and were based around carbon copies. In the past decade, PDMPs have automated reporting, migrated

online, and increased reporting frequency, meaning they now contain an up-to-date and complete patient

prescription history. Policymakers have hypothesized that informing medical providers of potential misuse

could help impede diversion and recreational use of opioids. A physician or pharmacist may agree to proceed

if a prescribing history, such as in Figure 1, shows only a single prescriber, but might refuse if the history

reflects multiple providers or an unusually large quantity of opioids.

   However, even as information technology made it easier to obtain the data in a timely fashion, state

programs established different rules regarding provider access. In some states, PDMPs began to allow

providers to query the PDMP, while in others it was explicitly prohibited or allowed only for current (but

not prospective) patients (Davis et al., 2014). Similarly, in some states, the PDMP actively generated reports

to prescribers and pharmacies when a patient appeared to be misusing opioids; in other states, it was illegal

for the PDMP to do so (Davis et al., 2014).

                                                       6
   Despite a growing recognition of the dangers of opioids, physician groups have not generally endorsed

PDMP access as a solution. Physicians complained about interference with clinical practice, new paperwork

burdens, and the difficulty of contextualizing and interpreting a prescribing history (Islam and McRae,

2014; Gourlay, 2013). When prescribers were allowed access, they were sometimes granted immunity from

prosecution for not checking the PDMP (Davis et al., 2014). In this context, it is not surprising that when

not mandated, only the most conscientious providers actively used the PDMP to inform prescribing decisions

(Haffajee et al., 2015). For example, in the first year after a voluntary PDMP was established in Florida, a

state with a well-publicized opioid misuse problem, fewer than 1 in 10 physicians had even created a login for

the system (Poston, 2012). Similarly, two years after Rhode Island allowed prescribers to query its PDMP,

officials estimated it was used in only 10% of prescriptions (Arditi, 2014). Levy et al. (2015) show that nearly

half of prescriptions for opioids from the United States are written by primary care specialists, suggesting

that even if the heaviest prescribers are enrolling, low rates of uptake will limit the effectiveness of PDMPs.

   In recent years, a number of states have strengthened their PDMPs by requiring providers to access the

data under certain circumstances. These “must access” provisions appear to have substantially increased

provider take-up. When New York implemented a “must access” provision in 2013, the number of registrants

increased fourteenfold, and the number of daily queries rose from fewer than 400 to more than 40,000.

Similarly, in Kentucky, Tennessee and Ohio, implementing a “must access” provision increased by several

orders of magnitude the number of providers registered and the number of queries received per day (PDMP

Center of Excellence, 2014).

   Table 1 summarizes state laws studied in this paper by providing, in the first two columns, the half-year

that the state’s original PDMP law went into effect and when a “must access” provision went into effect. Our

main source of information on state laws is the detailed database of PDMPs collected by the Prescription

Drug Abuse Policy System (pdaps.org). This database was created by multiple legally-trained researchers

independently reviewing state laws relevant to PDMP operations for content and dates of enactment (Davis

et al., 2014). Note that we do not report laws for states whose first PDMP law passed before 2007, since

they do not contribute to identification in later analyses. By the end of 2013, all states except Missouri

and DC have passed some form of PDMP. In this paper we focus on the ten states that began to require

providers (under certain circumstances) to access the PDMP prior to prescribing opioids. In all cases but

one (Delaware) the “must access” provision strengthened an existing PDMP.

   In our main analyses we treat all ten states that have a policy that requires providers to access the

PDMP under certain circumstances as “must access” states, but in fact the laws do differ. In general, more

recent “must access” policies are stronger than earlier laws. Louisiana’s law applies only to pain clinics and

Oklahoma’s to methadone. In Nevada, Delaware, and Ohio providers must access the PDMP if they have
                                                       7
“a reasonable belief that the patient may be seeking the controlled substance...for any reason other than

the treatment of an existing medical condition.” In 2012 or 2013, Kentucky, West Virginia, New Mexico,

Tennessee and New York required access for all care settings and ingredients, and providers must check even

if they are not suspicious. In Section 4.3 we explore how the impact of a “must access” provision varies by

strength of the law.

    Early studies on PDMPs generally did not attempt to distinguish among different types of programs.

For example, Paulozzi et al. (2011) examine the relationship between whether a state has any kind of

PDMP between 1999 and 2005 and opioid poisoning incidents and mortality. They find no effect. Similarly,

using cross-sectional data from 2010, Jena et al. (2014) find no relationship between the presence of a state

PDMP and the number of Medicare beneficiaries obtaining prescriptions from multiple providers. Reifler et

al. (2012), considering 1999-2003, find that the growth in opioid use slows when states pass PDMP laws.

Brady et al. (2014) and Li et al. (2014) find no effect on opioids dispensed or drug overdose mortality from

PDMPs between 1999 and 2008. Meara et al. (2016) test the impact of PDMPs and a variety of other opioid

interdiction policies in a difference-in-difference framework using disabled Medicare beneficiaries; they find

no significant effects. In a review, Haegerich et al. (2014) conclude that 14 studies of PDMPs “have not

clearly established significant effects on total opioid prescribing or health outcomes with PDMPs.”

    Two recent papers that are more optimistic about the effectiveness of PDMPs look more carefully, as

we do, at PDMP characteristics. Patrick et al. (2016) find a greater impact on opioid overdose deaths in

the general population in states whose PDMP monitors more drugs and updates data at least weekly. A

study by Dowell et al. (2016) shares our focus on “must access” PDMP provisions; their results suggest that

“must access” PDMPs are associated with a reduction in opioid overdose deaths and the morphine milligram

equivalents of prescribed opioids per state resident. Neither of these recent papers examines the relationship

between PDMPs and the type of extreme utilization that the programs are designed to reduce.


3      Data and Methods

3.1        Measures of Opioid Use, Misuse, and Poisoning

Our primary dataset is the prescription drug and medical claims of a random 5% subsample of Medicare

beneficiaries enrolled in Part D and fee-for-service Medicare (not Medicare Advantage) in any year between

2007 and 2013. The prescription drug claims denote the exact drug purchased, days supply, purchase date,

prescriber identifier and pharmacy identifier. Opioids are identified using the United States Pharmacopeia

2011 Medicare Model Guideline Formulary Reference File.1 Because several of the legislative changes during
    1 Wedo not distinguish between Schedule II (most opioids) and Schedule III (hydrocodone combinations and buprenorphine)
claims. Over our time period, all PDMPs covered Schedule II and nearly all covered Schedule III drugs (Davis et al., 2014).

                                                            8
this period occurred in the middle of the calendar year, to better match the claims data to the appropriate

policy regime, we divide the data into six-month periods, assigning laws to a period if they were in effect for

more than half of the time.

   Table 2 provides basic summary statistics for the full panel of FFS/Part D enrollees (first column) and

the subsample with at least one opioid claim during each half-year (second column). For each of fourteen

half-years, the sample size is approximately 950,000; individuals appear about eleven times. A quarter of the

sample is entitled to Medicare due to disability and two in five are dually-eligible for Medicaid due to low

wealth and income. In any half-year, 28% of FFS/Part D enrollees fill at least one prescription for opioids.

Opioid takers are more likely than the average Part D enrollee to be eligible for Medicaid or disabled. Not

surprisingly, opioid users also have higher rates of cancer and are more likely to be near the end of life.2 We

consider the full population of opioid takers, even though more than a third of these individuals fill only a

single prescription (often as part of post-operative care).

   Even with this rich detail, it is difficult to distinguish appropriate and inappropriate use of prescription

opioids. We draw on prior research to construct several proxy measures of misuse. Table 3 describes the

measures of opioid use and misuse that we construct using the claims data. We have three groups of outcomes:

quantity-based outcomes, “shopping” outcomes, and medical service outcomes.

   Our simplest quantity-based outcome is a measure of the share of Part D enrollees who take any opioids

at all. However, our other quantity-based outcomes are intended to reflect the upper tail of the utilization

distribution; the goal is to capture utilization patterns that previous research suggests are either indicative

of misuse or dangerous per se. First, we create an indicator variable that equals one for all individuals who

obtained 211 or more days supply (more than seven thirty-day prescriptions) of opioids in a half-year. The

distribution of days supply is given in Figure 3, with the right panel zooming in on the distribution above the

cutoff. The right panels show the frequency of observations, revealing thousands of observations of even rare

phenomena. Nearly 9% of opioid takers fill more than 210 days supply of opioid prescriptions in a half-year;

high days supply could indicate abuse or opioid diversion, but could also result from patients experimenting

with different ingredients or strengths, or combinations of long-acting and short-acting opioids.

   The potential for mistaking these benign reasons for having high days supply can be reduced by converting

each prescription to morphine-equivalent dosage (MED). The morphine-equivalent dosage allows opioids of

different ingredients, strengths, and form (routes of administration) to be converted into equivalent milligrams

of morphine.3 We divide the total MED obtained in a six-month period by 180 days to create a “daily MED.”

the inpatient, outpatient, and carrier (physician) medical claims. Cause of death is not noted in Medicare claims data.
   3 We collected the conversion of each opioid ingredient × strength × form from the following three sources: Palliative.org

(2016); CMS (2015); Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation (2016). The exact conversion is available upon request.


                                                             9
For example, hydrocodone has a morphine-equivalence factor of one; if an individual obtains an 18 day supply

of 10mg of hydrocodone, he or she has obtained a “daily MED” of 1 over the half-year. Figure 4 depicts the

distribution of this variable. The height of the first bar shows that more than three-quarters of opioid takers

have less than ten MED over the six month period, most likely consistent with acute use over a limited

period. 1.7% of opioid takers obtain enough opioids to have a continuous daily dosage of more than 120

MED. Guidelines for providers, e.g. Washington State Agency Medical Directors’ Group (2010), suggest

that chronic usage above this threshold is associated with an escalation in risk.

    A final quantity-based measure is the prevalence of overlapping claims – i.e., having multiple prescriptions

for the same drug at a point in time. We create a binary flag for whether an individual fills a second claim

for the same ingredient more than a week before the first prescription should have been finished, based on

its days supply.4 If the two claims are for different ingredients, we attribute their overlap to the patient

experimenting with other opioids and do not code the individual as having overlapping claims. This measure

is similar to the concurrently supplied measure in previous research (Jena et al., 2014). More than 91%

of observations have no overlapping claims. Most of those with overlapping claims have only one, but

individuals in the top percentile have six claims overlapping by more than a week in a six month period.

    One of the main ways that a PDMP can reduce opioid abuse is by curtailing “shopping” behavior, whereby

an individual visits multiple prescribers or pharmacies to obtain opioids. This outcome is of particular interest

since the information provided by PDMPs is specifically designed to inform a provider of doctor shopping

behavior. In the Part D claims, we can count the number of distinct providers from whom an enrollee

received a prescription for opioids during the half-year and the number of different pharmacies at which

opioid prescriptions were filled.5 For both variables, the modal value is one, though there is a long right tail,

especially for the number of physicians. We construct a measure of doctor-shopping by identifying all Part

D enrollees who received opioid prescriptions from five or more prescribers in a single period. In our data,

2.3% of opioid takers meet this criterion. It is possible that there are other explanations for a large number

of prescribers, such as uncoordinated care. However, obtaining opioids from five or more prescribers is nine

times as likely for opioids as it is for antidepressants, and more than 200 times as likely as it is for statins.

We construct an analogous measure for individuals who fill opioid prescriptions at five or more pharmacies

in a half-year. Seven of our ten implementing states require dispensers to check on the same grounds as

prescribers (the exceptions are DE, LA, and NY). Such “pharmacy shopping” is less common: approximately

half of a percent of opioid users visit five or more pharmacies in a half-year. Figures 5 and 6 present the
   4 Because we follow a person longitudinally across years, we can properly account for prescriptions filled in, say, late December

and early January.
   5 Pharmacy and prescriber identifiers are not included on our 2007 Part D claims file; therefore, variables using those data

are reported for the 2008-2013 period.


                                                                10
distribution of these variables, again showing the distribution above the threshold in the right panel.

   The data collected by a state PDMP is generally limited to prescriptions that have been written and

filled in that state. Similarly, access to the data is generally limited to physicians, pharmacists and law

enforcement officials in that state. Therefore, to the extent that a PDMP does curtail doctor-shopping it

may push some drug abusers to obtain or fill prescriptions in other states. An out-of-state prescriber or

pharmacist would be unaware of a suspicious record in another state’s PDMP; in addition, the individual’s

home state PDMP will remain unaware of prescriptions filled in another state. Indeed state and Federal

policymakers have complained for more than a decade that uncoordinated state efforts are vulnerable to this

behavior (GAO, 2002). Since the Medicare claims data provides information on geographic location, we can

test for this type of avoidance behavior. One challenge, however, is that it is not uncommon for Medicare

beneficiaries to fill prescriptions out-of-state, either because they live near a state border, are traveling, or

live part of the year in another state (e.g., “snow-birds”). To distinguish border-crossing for the purpose

of obtaining opioids from other reasons that a patient would fill prescriptions in more than one state, we

calculate an individual-level measure of “excess” opioid claims from out-of-state prescribers as


              Excess Opioid Claims from OOS Prescriber =
                 P                                                    P
                     Opioid Prescriptions from OOS Prescribers            Non-opioid
                                                                                  P Prescriptions from OOS Prescribers
                             P
                               Opioid Prescriptions              −                   Non-opioid Prescriptions

   We construct an analogous measure of excess claims from out-of-state pharmacies; on average, individuals

are less likely to fill opioids at an out-of-state pharmacy than to fill non-opioids at such pharmacies, making

the mean of this measure in Table 3 negative. As with our other proxies, this type of behavior is rare; only a

few percent of opioid takers are more likely to obtain opioids from out-of-state than from in-state providers.

Lacking guidance from the literature to suggest a cutoff for these variables, we analyze them as continuous

outcomes. In analysis, we standardize this variable to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one,

meaning its coefficient is directly interpretable as the impact of the policy being tested in terms of standard

deviations.

   Our last two measures leverage each opioid taker’s medical history, as reported in the medical claims

files.6 We use the medical claims to construct an alternative measure of doctor shopping. In the outpatient

and physician (carrier) medical claims, we identify all claims where the provider billed for a “new patient”

code.7 About a third of opioid takers have at least one new patient visit in a six month period, and the 99th

percentile has four or more such visits. Of course, the majority of new patient visits for opioid takers will

be innocuous. Again, lacking guidance from the literature, we choose a cutoff of four or more new patient
  6 We  do not have medical claims for 2013; therefore, these measures are reported for the 2007-2012 period.
  7A   “new patient” visit has a HCPCS code of 99201, 99202, 99203, 99204, or 99205.


                                                                 11
visits, a rate of new patient visits that is limited to the top 1.3% of opioid takers.8 This variable differs from

the doctor shopping variable constructed using Part D claims in that this measure includes “unsuccessful”

shopping–i.e., visits where a drug-seeking patient was not able to obtain a prescription. We note that policies

designed to make opioids harder to obtain could move this measure in either direction – if shopping efforts

become less likely to yield opioids, shopping intensity could either increase or decrease.

    Finally, the incidence of opioid poisonings is a key outcome of interest. An opioid poisoning incident is

indicated by an ICD code for an “opioid related overdose”; we apply the exact codes reported by Meara

et al. (2016).9 We should note that while many researchers report on opioid overdose deaths, our measure

includes both fatal and non-fatal poisonings. Since the same opioid poisoning incident might generate claims

in several settings of care, we simply note whether an individual has any opioid poisoning incidents; the rate

in each half-year is 0.2% of opioid takers.

    In addition to allowing us to analyze extreme types of utilization, an important advantage of our micro-

data compared to the aggregate data used in most other studies is that we can observe the joint distribution

of opioid utilization and health outcomes at the individual level. Figure 7 illustrates the special role of doctor

shopping in opioid abuse and misuse in our dataset. Figure 7 separates our sample population by whether

they ever had an opioid poisoning incident. The number within the bar represents the highest number of

prescribers ever seen in a half-year, and the height of the bar segment is the percent of beneficiaries who

see that number at least once. Overall, the figure shows that most of those who ever experience an opioid

poisoning incident are using multiple prescribers. Half of those who experience an opioid poisoning incident

met our criterion for doctor shopping at least once, whereas only 18% of those who are never poisoned do

so. Among those who experience an opioid poisoning incident, less than 5% of individuals never see more

than a single prescriber; the comparable figure for those who never experience an opioid poisoning incident

is 44%.

    Patients that we identify as doctor shoppers are also more likely to obtain extremely large amounts of

prescription opioids. This can be seen in Table 4, which reports the correlation of our misuse measures

with each other and opioid poisonings. At the same time, the data suggest that doctor shopping is not the

only pathway to potential misuse: 33% of patients who obtain more than seven months’ supply see only one
   8 In Section 4, we test robustness to the thresholds used to define misuse for days, prescribers, and pharmacies.
   9 Specifically,an opioid poisoning incident involves ICD code 9650∗ , E8501, E8502, E9500, or E9800, in any position in the
ICD codes of the inpatient, outpatient, and carrier claims. We include poisonings with suicidal intent. We exclude heroin
poisoning 96501 from this definition, although several authors have noted the substitutability of heroin and opioids (Alpert et
al., 2016; Dart et al., 2015; Unick et al., 2013). We do not find enough heroin poisoning incidents in the data to evaluate it as
a separate outcome.
Under a policy in effect between 2014 and early 2017, Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services redacted claims for substance
use disorders. This policy does not target opioid poisoning incidents per se, but if a single claim reports ICD codes for an opioid
poisoning incident and a substance use disorder, the entire claim might be redacted. Our 2012 medical claims are partially
affected by redaction; however, we find a similar rate of opioid poisonings in 2012 relative to earlier years, and similar to rates
published by Meara et al. (2016), whose claims are not redacted.


                                                                12
prescriber. This suggests the utility of analyzing a number of proxy measures which capture various aspects

of opioid misuse. The bottom row of Table 4 indicate that our prescription-based measures of misuse are

positively correlated with opioid poisoning, as measured in the medical claims. The relationship can also

be seen by running probit regressions of our poisoning outcome on the misuse proxies. Estimated marginal

effects from such regressions are reported in Appendix Table A.2. Consistent with the work of Jena et al.

(2014), nearly all of our misuse measures bilaterally predict opioid poisoning, with some measures raising

the rate of opioid poisoning incidents tenfold.

3.2     Estimation Strategy

Our principal analysis tests the impact of a state policy on state-halfyear aggregates of opioid use, misuse,

and poisoning incidents. Our regression model is



                                             Yst = δs + δt + β1(policyst ) + εst ,                                              (1)


where Yst is an opioid outcome averaged over a state×halfyear and 1(policyst ) is 1 if the state has a particular

type of PDMP in the half-year. One outcome, the percentage of Part D enrollees using any opioids, is

calculated using data from all enrollees in a given state and half-year. For all outcomes related to misuse

or abuse, we use the number of enrollees with at least one opioid prescription as the denominator. Each

observation is weighted by the number of enrollees represented in the denominator.10 Each regression contains

fixed effects for states (δs ) and years (δt ) and clusters the standard errors at the state; for our main estimates

we also report wild cluster-bootstrap percentile-t confidence intervals (Bertrand et al., 2004; Cameron et al.,

2008). Brewer et al. (2013) show that this bootstrap provides correct inference – hypothesis testing of correct

size – in the presence of autocorrelated errors when the number of treated groups is as low as five.

    We use this basic setup to evaluate the impact of two types of PDMPs: those that do and do not require

providers to access the data collected by the program. Seventeen states implemented a PDMP without a

“must access” provision between 2007 and 2013; ten others implemented a “must access” PDMP.11 Our

main hypothesis is that PDMPs will have a stronger impact when providers are required to access the data.

To test this, we first estimate the effect of PDMPs that do not have a “must access” provision, dropping

the ten “must access” states. Then using the full sample of states we estimate two models to evaluate the

effect of the “must access” laws. The first model includes the indicator for non-“must access” laws as an
  10 In results available upon request, we find broadly similar estimates when equally weighting states. However, the unweighted

standard errors are much larger, suggesting weighting correctly adjusts for heteroskedasticity driven by differences in state sample
size (Solon et al., 2015).
  11 As described in Section 3.1, we lack shopping outcomes for 2007 and medical services outcomes for 2013. Because of this

data limitation, only eight of the ten treatment states identify the policy impact for some outcomes. Details are provided in
Appendix Table A.1.


                                                                13
independent variable. In the second specification, we combine the states with the PDMPs without a “must

access” provision with states having no PDMP at all.

   Within the limits imposted by our short-T panel, we can also evaluate “must access” PDMPs within

an event study framework. The event study reorients each state’s first post-treatment period to zero, and

measures the difference between a treatment and control state in the periods prior to and following this period.

This analysis serves two purposes. Firstly, systematic differences between treatment and control states in

the pre-treatment period could suggest nonparallel trends or policy endogeneity. Secondly, evaluating the

impact of the treatment several periods post implementation can suggest whether the policy’s impact fades

out or grows over time. The event study estimates the following equation:

                                                                 X
                                         Yst = δs + δt +                      βh Tsh + εst                                 (2)
                                                           h=−4,−3,...0...2


where Tsh = 1 if state s implemented a must access PDMP h half-years ago (or if h is negative, will implement

a PDMP −h half-years in the future.) The first post period is denoted by h = 0, and we combine all post

periods after the third (h = 2) into the third.

3.3    Methodological Limitations

The use of Medicare claims data for this analysis brings several advantages: individual-level data allows us

to measure extremes of the distribution, the large sample size provides many observations of rare outcomes,

and the medical claims allow us to directly observe the linkage between opioid utilization and poisonings.

However, the Part D program only began in 2006, several years into the escalation of opioid utilization. We

therefore have only a short time period on which to assess state-specific trends in opioid misuse prior to

PDMP implementation.

   Other limitations of our dataset are inherent to administrative claims. Part D claims could undercount

an individual’s utilization if they purchase opioids on the street. In addition, a Medicare beneficiary can

fill opioid prescriptions using cash instead of Part D benefits, although over our sample period there was

little reason to do so. The possibility of beneficiaries obtaining opioids outside of Medicare Part D is not

a concern for our analysis of opioid poisonings, although there we rely on the accuracy of medical coding

for fee-for-service beneficiaries. Finally, our perspective could be affected by beneficiaries in jail or prison.

Medicare does not pay claims during periods of incarceration, but the standard claims files do not reflect

incarceration status.12 In principle, a “must access” PDMP could reduce misuse rates via the channel of

incarceration.
 12 Individuals   remain enrolled in Part A and can remain in Parts B or D if they or a public entity continue to pay premiums.



                                                               14
    Finally, our 5% random sample is well-designed for characterizing the experience of Medicare enrollees.

However, it is not possible to use these data for prescriber-level analyses. A slight majority of opioid

prescribers write only a single prescription to one of our sampled individuals, and even at the 99th percentile

the prescriber writes prescriptions to only six individuals. We leave a fuller investigation of how prescribers

respond to opioid control policies to future work.


4     Results

4.1    Effect of a PDMP Without a “Must Access” Provision on Opioid Misuse
       and Poisonings

In Table 5, we report the results of our difference-in-difference strategy for the PDMPs that do not require

providers to access the database, dropping the ten states that implement a “must access”’ PDMP from the

analysis. Most of our point estimates cannot be distinguished from zero. The exceptions are an increase

in the rate of filling opioids at five or more pharmacies, and an increase in the share of opioid takers with

at least four new patient visits. The first result is clearly contrary to the sign we expect from a successful

opioid control policy. The hypothesized effect for the number of new patient visits is theoretically ambiguous,

though it seems more plausible that a successful PDMP would reduce such visits. Indeed, that is what we

find for “must access” PDMPs. This logic, combined with the fact that none of the estimates for the quantity

measures are statistically significant, suggests that positive and significant coefficient on the 4+ new patients

variable should be discounted.

    In order for a PDMP to provide useful information to a prescriber or pharmacist who checks it, the

PDMP needs to first populate its database of utilization.13 The implementation of a PDMP at time t is

actually the implementation of data reporting requirements, and so it may take time for a provider to see a

representative record for any patient. Therefore, in the third panel of this table, we again test for the impact

of a non-must access PDMP lagging the implementation date by six months. That is to say, we assume a

newly-implemented PDMP is only effective six months after its actual implementation date. We again find

that a PDMP without a “must access” provision is largely ineffective. Overall, the results in Table 5 are

consistent with our hypothesis that PDMP that rely entirely on the voluntary participation of providers are

unlikely to be successful.
 13 Among our ten states implementing a “must access” PDMP, only Delaware did not first have a non-“must access” PDMP

which had already begun collecting data.




                                                         15
4.2     The Effect of “Must Access” PDMPs on Opioid Misuse and Poisonings

In Table 6, we report the results of estimating Equation 1 for a “must access” PDMP. The models reported

in the upper panel also include indicators for the presence of a non-“must access” PDMP. Because we find

few significant differences between the seventeen states with non-“must access” laws and other states that

did not implement a new PDMP during this period, our preferred model combines these two categories of

states into a single control group. Results from this more parsimonious specification are reported in the

lower panel of Table 6. The two models produce similar point estimates for the effect of a “must access”

PDMP. For every estimate, we report below it the 95 percent wild cluster-bootstrap percentile-t confidence

interval, with CIs that exclude zero in bold. Our inference is unaffected by this procedure.14

    Our first set of outcomes reflect the quantity of opioids obtained. A “must access” PDMP is associated

with a statistically significant 2.4% decline in the share of Part D enrollees taking opioids. Similarly, we find

a 6% decline in the share of opioid takers with overlapping claims, and a 5% decline (significant at the ten

percent level) in the share with more than seven months supply. In contrast to these statistically significant

effects, we estimate a fairly precise zero on the share of those obtaining more than 120 MED/day.

    We find larger declines in our shopping outcomes – a statistically significant 8% fall in the share of

individuals obtaining opioids from five or more prescribers and a 16% decline for five or more pharmacies.

The passage of a “must access” PDMP may prompt individuals to cross state lines in search of less-regulated

prescribers and pharmacies. We find evidence consistent with that hypothesis for the case of out-of-state

prescribers: a “must access” PDMP raises the rate at which individuals obtain prescriptions from out-of-

state prescribers by about a third of a standard deviation, although this result is only significant at the ten

percent level. The next column tests whether a “must access” PDMP affects opioid takers’ number of new

patient visits (measured from the medical claims). We find a 14% decline in this rate (significant at the five

percent level).

    Each new patient visit is reimbursed by Medicare under standard rules, even if the visit is motivated

purely by opioid-seeking behavior and no other care takes place.15 If the decline in new patient visits is not

offset by other episodes of care, then the reduction in new patient visits is net Federal savings. To calculate

these savings, we estimate the impact of a “must access” PDMP on the average number of new patient

visits, which yields a coefficient of -0.024 (SE 0.010). When multiplied by the cost of a “new patient” visit,

on average $119 in our 2012 medical claims, and the represented population, we find that a “must access”
  14 We also computed the pairs cluster-bootstrap percentile-t CIs. The pairs cluster assigns a given state’s outcomes to an

alternative state’s policy history, obtaining the distribution of estimates under a null hypothesis of no effect. We find similar
CIs using this procedure; results available upon request.
  15 We do not explicitly test how a “must access” PDMP affects the volume of medical services. However, in results available

upon request, we find that a “must access” PDMP reduces the share of individuals seeing a high number of providers, although
for some thresholds the effect is insignificant.

                                                               16
PDMP in every state would reduces outlays on new patient visits by $174 million each half-year.

   The final column tests whether a “must access” PDMP affects an important health outcome: opioid

poisonings. Despite the fact that we find negative effects on several measures of misuse which are positively

correlated with opioid poisonings, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that these programs reduce poisonings.

The estimated coefficients in the last column of the table are negative, but they are small relative to their

standard errors.

   An extension of this analysis shows that our results are not sensitive to the thresholds used to define

misuse. In Figure 8, we test the impact of a “must access” PDMP using Equation 1 on various thresholds

for days supply, number of prescribers, number of pharmacies, and number of new patient visits. The y-

axis reports the percentage change associated with a “must access” PDMP, and the mean of the variable is

reported along the x-axis. Point estimates for each threshold are always negative; however, it is clear that

standard errors grow as the threshold cuts off a smaller share of opioid takers.

4.3    Model Assumptions: Pretrends, Co-Occurring Policy Changes, and Policy
       Heterogeneity

An assumption underlying our difference-in-difference strategy is that states that implement a “must access”

PDMP were similar prior to implementation to those that do not. The event history model presented in

Equation 2 represents a standard way to evaluate this assumption; an additional benefit of this specification

is that it can inform us how a policy’s impact increases or decreases with time since implementation. The

results of estimating Equation 2 are reported in Figure 9. We depict each βh for four half-years prior to

implementation and three half-years post implementation. βh signifies the difference between implementing

and nonimplementing states on this measure h periods before or after implementation, net of state and

calendar half-year dummies. We drop states that implement in either the first or last year of our panel, which

leaves us six states that contribute to identification of every βh , eliminating impacts on βh that result from

composition alone. In general, the coefficients are not significantly different from zero, suggesting that prior

to implementation the states that implemented “must access” PDMPs did not differ from controls. However,

some of the results are suggestive of anticipatory effects, particularly for the pharmacy shopping outcome.

We note that, in the lead-up to the implementation of a “must access” PDMP, all states except Delaware had

existing PDMPs which allowed, but did not require, provider access. Since the policy process for a change

like a “must access” PDMP would have involved consultation with health care providers, it is possible that

they were made aware in the late pre-period of the scope of the problem and the potential applicability of

the PDMP to which they already had access. Presumably, in advance of the official start date, the agency

managing the PDMP would have begun encouraging providers to create PDMP accounts and begin accessing

                                                      17
the data. Similarly, providers may have made changes in workflow earlier than required in order to ensure

they were in compliance with the law on its first applicable date. If so, then the implementation timing of

a “must access” PDMP is actually fuzzy, with the true post-period beginning earlier than what we record.

With respect to the impact of the policy over time in the post policy, there is no systematic pattern of either

growth or reduction in impacts over time.

   Another important assumption that underlies our interpretation of the results is that they are not picking

up the effect of other opioid-related policies that states were implementing around the same time. In some

cases, the legislation that established “must access” rules contained other measures aimed at strengthening

the PDMP. The Prescription Drug Abuse Policy System describes a broad set of PDMP characteristics.16

For each of ten states implementing a “must access” PDMP, we looked for any policies implemented at the

same time in more than one “must access” state. Three states – Kentucky, West Virginia, and New York –

began to allow providers’ “delegates” to access the PDMP at the same time as the “must access” provision

began. Allowing delegates lowers the labor costs of accessing the PDMP by enabling, for example, a medical

assistant to query the PDMP instead of the prescribing physician. Three states – Ohio, Kentucky, and New

York – increased the frequency with which PDMP data must be updated. Increasing frequency of reporting,

e.g. from weekly to daily, improves the quality of data available to a provider accessing the PDMP. States

enacted policies besides PDMPs as well. The dataset collected and analyzed by Meara et al. (2016) identifies

laws that set limits on days supply, establish new requirement for the physician-patient relationship and

verifying patient identification at pharmacies, increase the use of tamper-resistant prescription pads, and

establish new regulations pertaining to pain clinics. There were two instances where states enacted one of

these policies close to the time they implemented a “must access” rule: pain clinic laws in Kentucky and

Ohio.

   Intuitively, the two PDMP-related provisions can be seen as complements laws requiring PDMP access.

Providers who access a PDMP will obtain more useful information when the database is updated more

frequently and the cost of complying with a “must access” requirement will be lower when providers can

delegate the task of checking the database. Therefore, we first test whether these policies have an independent

effect when passed in the absence of a “must access” law. If they have little or no impact on misuse outcomes

when passed alone, they cannot be responsible for the policy impacts reported in Table 6. We view pain clinic

laws as targeting a slightly different channel of misuse than PDMP-related policies. “Must access” policies

bring information to the mass of providers, including many who prescribe opioids only rarely, while pain
  16 This dataset is a comprehensive resource on all aspects of PDMPs: which agency operates the PDMP; who – prescribers,

pharmacists, patients, law enforcement, out-of-state entities – may access the PDMP and under what circumstances; whether
the PDMP is permitted or required (or neither) to identify suspicious activity and whether it is permitted or required (or
neither) to inform licensing boards, law enforcement, providers, or patients of such activity; and which substances must be
reported to the PDMP and at what frequency.

                                                            18
clinic laws directly regulate the behavior of a small share of providers who account for a disproportionate

share of all opioid prescribing. The two approaches may both be effective against different patterns of opioid

abuse.

   We test for an independent effect of each of the three co-occurring policies using data on the 41 states

without “must access” laws. Ten states among the 41 began to allow delegates to access their PDMPs,

20 increased the frequency of PDMP reporting, and 3 implemented pain clinic regulations (Table 1). The

results from this analysis are presented in Table 7. To facilitate comparisons, the first row reports the results

from Table 6. Neither allowing delegates nor increasing reporting frequency have estimated effects that are

significant at the .05 level, so we conclude that these policies do not affect opioid misuse when providers are

also not required to access the PDMP. We find that pain clinic regulations are associated with an increase

in the rate of four or more new patient visits and the use of out-of-state pharmacies. These coefficients have

the opposite sign as our “must access” estimates, which suggests that failing to account for pain clinic laws

may cause the magnitude of the latter to be understated. The other significant coefficient, on use of five or

more pharmacies, has the same sign and similar magnitude as our main estimate. Taken as a whole, these

results do not suggest that our “must access” results are being driven by other co-occurring policies.

   An alternative way to test the sensitivity of our results is to simply add controls for those laws to our

main regressions. The policy variation to precisely parse the effects of these different provisions is somewhat

limited, since as stated some are passed by the same states at the same time. In Appendix Table A.3 we

present estimates from such regressions. In general, controlling for these other policies moves the effects of

a “must access” PDMP slightly towards zero, although the point estimates never differ significantly from

our preferred, more parsimonious specification. We see that when controlling for pain clinic laws “must

access” PDMPs are still associated with a reduction in the use of five or more pharmacies, which supports

our hypothesis that these laws affect different channels of misuse.

   The results presented so far do not account for differences among “must access” laws related to the types

of providers targeted and the discretion providers are granted (see Section 2). To consider the importance

of these differences, we categorize our ten states’ laws into three subtypes: limited laws that apply only to

certain ingredients (Methadone in OK) or settings of care (pain clinics in LA), discretionary laws that require

the provider to access the PDMP if they are suspicious (NV, DE, and OH), and broad laws that apply to

all ingredients and settings and do not rely on provider suspicion (KY, WV, NM, TN, and NY). Figure 10

shows the point estimates we obtain if we include each subtype of policy as independent variables in a single

regression. The gray bar shows our overall estimate, for reference. Among our quantity outcomes (top four

figures), the pattern of estimates suggests that broad policies have stronger effects than discretionary laws,

which in turn appear to be stronger than limited policies (although the differences between the subtypes
                                                       19
are not always significant). The other outcomes do not display such a clear pattern. However, even limited

laws significantly affect shopping outcomes, and in most cases the estimate for each subtype cannot be

distinguished from the overall estimate.

    As an addendum to this analysis, we test the robustness of our estimates to dropping one of our imple-

menting states. These results are presented in Appendix Figure A.1. A gray bar again represents the overall

estimate, and each estimate drops the state noted on the x-axis (which orders states by implementation

date). Finding that removing a single state significantly changes our estimated policy impact would suggest

that special circumstances in that state are actually driving our results. Instead we find that point estimates

are very similar when estimated on a subset of nine or seven implementing states.

4.4     Results by Subsample

In addition to our main analysis, which is based on state-year averages for all opioid users, we also analyze

the same outcomes calculated for key subsamples of Medicare enrollees. As noted, it is generally believed

that the problem of opioid abuse is most serious among lower-income Medicare beneficiaries and those who

qualify due to disability. Therefore we conduct separate analyses by Medicare eligibility category. Table 8

tests the impact of a “must access” PDMP on aggregate outcomes within four Medicare subsamples. We

find that the probability of taking opioids is reduced among all groups (insignificantly for disabled and non-

dually eligible.) However, the effects of “must access” PDMPs on measures of high quantity or shopping are

primarily found among the low-income disabled. In fact, given the number of dual disabled and the point

estimates of their behavioral response, the impact on the low-income disabled is responsible for more than

two-thirds of the overall Medicare impact on 211+ days supply, overlapping claims, five or more prescribers

or pharmacies, and excess out-of-state pharmacies.17 Consistent with the literature reviewed in Section 2,

the disabled are more likely to have utilization patterns that suggest “misuse” and have a much higher rate

of opioid poisoning incidents. It’s possible that a “must access” PDMP has larger effects in the low-income

disabled because the policy is well-targeted towards the type of “misuse” that is more common among

this subpopulation. Alternatively, a “must access” PDMP may simply have a larger impact among the

low-income disabled population. If physicians are more likely to suspect “misuse” among the low-income

disabled, then a “must access” provision in states with a discretionary policy may result in more PDMP

checks for this group than for elderly opioid users.

    Table 9 considers the subsample of 41,709 individuals who met our doctor shopping criteria – obtained

opioids from five or more prescribers in a six month period – at least once in their state’s pre period (any
  17 To make these calculations, we multiple the subsample’s effect by its size, and then divide by product of the overall sample

and its size. For the case of 211+ days supply, the calculation is (-0.0128*940,362 dual disabled)/(-.00429*3,703,389 opioid
takers).


                                                               20
time for control states). On average, a state-halfyear still contains more than 600 individuals. If a “must

access” PDMP is successful, it should result in behavior change among these individuals. Consistent with

this, effects among this sample of previous doctor shoppers are larger in magnitude than among Medicare

beneficiaries as a whole; for example, the share of beneficiaries with overlapping claims and the use of five

or more pharmacies falls by a quarter, and four or more new patient visits falls by 37%. However, we still

do not find any reduction in opioid poisoning incidents among this group; the insignificant point estimate

amounts to only a 10% reduction.

    Appendix Table A.4 describes the impact of a “must access” PDMP on subsamples defined by health

status. An unintended consequence of a “must access” PDMP might be a “chilling effect” on appropriate

opioid utilization. The top two panels of the table report the effect of a “must access” PDMP on state-

halfyear aggregates of cancer patients and those without cancer. We limit this analysis to 2007-2012 because

we do not have the medical claims to identify cancer for 2013. A first note is that while taking opioids is more

common among cancer patients, our measures of opioid “misuse” are not markedly higher, suggesting we are

not mislabeling high but appropriate utilization too often. Among the quantity outcomes, a “must access”

PDMP actually raises the rate at which cancer patients obtain high quantities of opioids, perhaps because

providers are more comfortable allowing high quantities when they are certain of the absence of misuse. Our

results show that a “must access” PDMP affects shopping outcomes among both cancer patients and those

without cancer. Finally, we find that a “must access” PDMP reduces poisonings among cancer patients.

In results available upon request, we find that this effect is unchanged when we exclude the small number

of poisonings explicitly characterized as “with suicidal intent”. The table shows that a “must access”

PDMP reduces measures of misuse among those without cancer, without impeding the utilization of cancer

patients. Inasmuch as some cancer patients show behavior consistent with shopping, such behavior becomes

less common after a “must access” PDMP is implemented. The second two panels consider two different

subsamples: those who die in the half-year versus those who do not. Again, while those who die are more

likely to take opioids, they are if anything less likely to meet our “misuse” criteria.18 In this comparison,

it’s clear that the effects of a “must access” PDMP are driven by those who do not die in the half-year. The

utilization of those who die is less affected, although there is a reduction in overlapping claims and the use

of five or more pharmacies.

4.5     Placebo Test: “Must Access” PDMPs’ Effect on Non-opioids

Finally, we also estimate a set of “placebo” regressions that test for an effect of PDMP laws on the use or

“abuse” of statins and antidepressants. If a “must access” PDMP is correlated for some reason with general
  18 We make no adjustment for the amount of time in the half-year the patient was alive. If utilization were identical, means

of measures would still be lower among those who die in the half-year due to censoring.

                                                             21
trends in prescription drug utilization or prescribing patterns, we will incorrectly attribute the change in

opioid misuse measures to the “must access” PDMP. As a placebo test, Table 10 looks at the impact of a

“must access” PDMP on outcomes for statins and antidepressants, which are taken by a similar share of

the Medicare population. The excess out-of-state prescriber and pharmacy measures are not standardized

in this table to show their levels across these three types of drugs. As mentioned above, it is vanishingly

rare to obtain statins or antidepressants from five or more prescribers or pharmacies. However, these other

types of drugs are more often provided in large quantities or in ways that create overlap in fill dates. One

interpretation is that individuals commonly experiment with drugs in these categories, and that prescribers

are comfortable allowing overlapping claims and large quantities among drugs with low potential for overdose

and abuse. We find no significant effects of a “must access” PDMP on outcomes for drug types besides opioids.


5     Conclusion
Several key conclusions emerge from our analysis. First, our results suggest that PDMPs that do not require

provider participation are not effective in reducing questionable or inappropriate use of prescription opioids.

In contrast, we do find evidence that “must access” PDMPs have the desired effect of curbing certain types

of extreme utilization. Specifically, such policies reduce several measures of excessive quantity and shopping

behavior. The strongest laws, which cover all ingredients and settings of care and do not require providers to

be suspicious, have larger effects on utilization than weaker laws, but even “limited” and “discretionary” laws

lower rates of shopping behavior. Several additional analyses suggest that these estimates represent causal

effects. We show that states that pass a “must access” PDMP are not dissimilar to states that do not on our

key measures during the pre period. Since our sample period was a time of active policy experimentation

among states, we search for policies that co-occur with “must access” laws, but no potential confounding

policies have strong independent effects when passed in the absence of a “must access” PDMP. Finally, our

results are very robust to dropping any of our implementing states. Subsample analyses show that, as we

expect, the policy’s impacts are concentrated among previous misusers and low-income disabled enrollees,

who have the highest rates of misuse measures.

    Although these results point to the effectiveness of “must access” PDMPs, other results suggest the

limits of this policy. We find no statistically significant effect on a key medical outcome: opioid poisoning

incidents. This is despite the fact that several outcomes for which we find significant effects are themselves

positively correlated with poisoning. The explanation for this result may have to do with the fact that

in the Medicare Part D data that we analyze, we observe prescription fills rather than actual utilization.

Perhaps poisonings do not fall because Medicare beneficiaries who are misusing opioids are able to find other

ways to maintain consumption. The fact that we find some evidence that stronger PDMP laws induce some
                                                      22
beneficiaries to turn to out-of-state sources is suggestive of this type of compensatory effect. There are other

possible spillover effects, such as substitution to street sources of prescription opioids or heroin that we are

not able to measure. Alternatively, the PDMP effects that we observe may be driven by a reduction in

opioid diversion. That is, rather than reducing the amount of opioids that beneficiaries take, these laws may

reduce the amount that they sell to others.

   Another possibility is that a “must access” PDMP reduces the rate at which individuals become opioid

misusers, delaying the effects on poisonings beyond our sample period. Borgschulte et al. (2016) suggest that

the impact of opioid control policies interacts with a state’s capacity to provide substance abuse treatment

to those who are now incentivized to reduce utilization.

   To our knowledge, no evaluation yet exists of recent changes CMS has made to opioid access policies in

Part D A collaboration between CMS and state PDMPs could allow states access to CMS’s data resources,

allowing improved identification of suspicious patterns of prescribing and utilization and smoother sharing

of information across state lines.

       Figure 2: Opioid Utilization and Poisoning, Overall (top) and in Medicare Part D (bottom)

Overall opioid prescriptions collected from Volkow (2014). Overall poisoning incidents, which reflect
emergency department visits alone, are collected from the Drug Abuse Warning Network Emergency
Department Data for 2007 to 2011 (the dataset was discontinued in 2011). Medicare opioid prescriptions
(available 2007-2013) and poisoning incidents (available 2007-2012) are from a 5% random sample of
enrollees in free-standing Part D and fee-for-service Medicare.

 This table reports the impact of a PDMP without a “must access” provision. The top panel estimates Equation 1 using a binary measure of whether a
PDMP without a “must access” provision is in place, excluding from the analysis the ten states with a “must access” PDMP. The bottom panel repeats
the top with the implementation of a non-must access PDMP lagged by six months, e.g. a PDMP implemented in January 2008 is said to come into
effect in July 2008. Each observation is weighted by the number of individuals represented. Fixed effects for states and halfyears are always included, and
standard errors are clustered at the state. +, *, **, and *** represent significance at the 10, 5, 1, and 0.1 percent levels, respectively. The impact on
quantity outcomes is estimated for 2007h1 to 2013h2; the impact on shopping outcomes is estimated for 2008h1 to 2013h2; the impact on medical services
outcomes is estimated for 2007h1 to 2012h2.

 This table estimates the impact of a “must access” PDMP on opioid misuse and poisonings in Medicare Part D. In the top panel, we estimate Equation 1
with two independent variables: whether a PDMP with a “must access” provision is in effect and whether a PDMP without a “must access” provision is
in effect. The bottom panel, our baseline specification, uses “must access” alone. Each column is the result of OLS regression on state-halfyear aggregates.
Each observation is weighted by the number of individuals represented. Fixed effects for states and halfyears are always included, and standard errors (in
parentheses) are clustered at the state. In the bottom panel, we report the 95 percent wild cluster-bootstrap percentile-t CI, with CIs that exclude zero in
bold. +, *, **, and *** represent significance at the 10, 5, 1, and 0.1 percent levels, respectively. The impact on quantity outcomes is estimated for 2007h1 to
2013h2; the impact on shopping outcomes is estimated for 2008h1 to 2013h2; the impact on medical services outcomes is estimated for 2007h1 to 2012h2.

                                    Figure 8: Extremes: Prescribers, Pharmacies, Days Supply, New Patients

These figures extend the analysis reported in Table 6 by sequentially raising the threshold for extreme
outcomes for days supply, number of prescribers, number of pharmacies, and new patient visits. The y-axis
shows the percentage change that the policy impact of a “must access” PDMP represents as a share of the
variable’s mean, which is reported along the x-axis. The 95 and 90 percent confidence intervals are
depicted by thick and thin bars, respectively.

                    Figure 9: Event Studies; first implementation period is denoted zero

These figures report the estimation of Equation 2, showing the difference between implementation
states in the four half-years prior to a “must access” policy and the three half-years following. For
each period, we show the point estimate (dot) and its 95 percent confidence interval.

 This table estimates the independent impact of three different policies that sometimes co-occur with “must access’ provisions. The top row repeats the
analysis of Table 6 for reference. The next three panels test the impact of allowing delegates, increasing reporting frequency, and regulating pain clinics in
independent estimations of Equation 1. The lower three panels drop the ten states that ever implement a “must access” PDMP. Each column is the result
of OLS regression on state-halfyear aggregates. Each observation is weighted by the number of individuals represented. Fixed effects for states and halfyears
are always included, and standard errors (in parentheses) are clustered at the state. The impact on quantity outcomes is estimated for 2007h1 to 2013h2;
the impact on shopping outcomes is estimated for 2008h1 to 2013h2; the impact on medical services outcomes is estimated for 2007h1 to 2012h2.

                    Figure 10: Limited, Discretionary, and Broad Must Access PDMPs.

These figures show how the impact of a “must access” PDMP varies across three subtypes of laws:
limited laws that apply to certain ingredients or settings of care, discretionary laws where
providers must access the PDMP if suspicious, and broad laws with neither restriction. The
figures report the point estimate and 95% CI from Equation 1, where we include each of the three
subtypes as independent variables. Gray bar represents overall estimate from Table 6.

 This table repeats our baseline analysis on subsamples defined by Medicare eligibility category. The panels show the results for OLS regressions on
state-halfyear aggregates of opioid takers in each of the specified eligibility subsamples. Each observation is weighted by the number of individuals
represented. Fixed effects for states and halfyears are always included, and standard errors are clustered at the state. +, *, **, and *** represent significance
at the 5, 1, and 0.1 percent levels, respectively. The impact on quantity outcomes is estimated for 2007h1 to 2013h2; the impact on shopping outcomes is
estimated for 2008h1 to 2013h2; the impact on medical services outcomes is estimated for 2007h1 to 2012h2.

      This table reports our baseline results on the impact of a “must access’ PDMP on utilization of the indicated drug type in Medicare Part
     D between 2007 and 2013. Each column is the result of OLS regression on state-halfyear aggregates of takers of the indicated drug; each
     observation is weighted by the number of takers represented. Fixed effects for states and halfyears are always included, and standard errors
     are clustered at the state. *, **, and *** represent significance at the 5, 1, and 0.1 percent levels, respectively. The impact on the first
     three outcomes is estimated for 2007h1 to 2013h2; the impact on prescriber and pharmacy outcomes is estimated for 2008h1 to 2013h2. The
     excess out-of-state prescriber and pharmacy measures are not standardized in this table to emphasize how they differ across the three types of drugs.

    Due to data availability constraints, not all variables studied in this paper are measured over the entire
seven year (fourteen half-year) time period covered in this paper. Table A.1 describes the exact availability
of our outcome variables. Quantity variables related to taking opioids or days supply are observed in all time
periods. Our 2007 Part D Event dataset was from a preliminary release which did not record prescriber or
pharmacy; therefore, outcomes related to prescribers or pharmacies are missing for 2007. We do not have
inpatient, outpatient, or carrier medical claims for 2013, so variables calculated from those datasets, such as
opioid poisoning incidents or new patient visits, are missing for 2013.

      This table reports the marginal effects of probits predicting an opioid poisoning incident in a half-year using contemporaneous measures of misuse
     among opioid takers enrolled in Part D and fee-for-service Medicare (not Medicare Advantage) in the period 2007–2012. The number of observations
     varies because in 2007 we do not observe prescribers and pharmacies, and in any year a few prescribers and pharmacies cannot be reliably assigned to
     states.

 This table estimates the impact of a “must access” PDMP, controlling for three different policies that sometimes co-occur with “must access’ provisions.
The top row repeats the analysis of Table 6 for reference. The lower panel adds as extra independent variables dummies for allowing delegates, increasing
reporting frequency, and regulating pain clinics. Each column is the result of OLS regression on state-halfyear aggregates. Each observation is weighted
by the number of individuals represented. Fixed effects for states and halfyears are always included, and standard errors (in parentheses) are clustered at
the state. The impact on quantity outcomes is estimated for 2007h1 to 2013h2; the impact on shopping outcomes is estimated for 2008h1 to 2013h2; the
impact on medical services outcomes is estimated for 2007h1 to 2012h2.

 This table repeats our baseline analysis on health subsamples. The panels show the results for OLS regressions on state-halfyear aggregates of opioid takers
in each of the specified eligibility subsamples. Each observation is weighted by the number of individuals represented. Fixed effects for states and halfyears
are always included, and standard errors are clustered at the state. +, *, **, and *** represent significance at the 5, 1, and 0.1 percent levels, respectively.
The impact on quantity outcomes is estimated for 2007h1 to 2013h2; the impact on shopping outcomes is estimated for 2008h1 to 2013h2; the impact on
medical services outcomes is estimated for 2007h1 to 2012h2.
