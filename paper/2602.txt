 I. Introduction

     Rapid increases in law school tuition costs and the increasingly

large debt burdens incurred by law school students have led to numerous

economic issues being raised relative to the "market" for law school

students. Will future law school tuition increases be inhibited by

potential students' ability and willingness to pay? Will increasing debt

burdens skew law students' career choices towards higher paying

specialties? Will enrollment in law schools and/or the quality of law

school applicants decline and will any such declines be widespread or

concentrated in a few lower quality law schools? Given all of the above

questions, what criteria should law schools use to allocate the limited

financial aid resources they have available? These are but a few of the

economic issues relating to the law student market that law schools must

confront.

     Prior research by academic economists and lawyers provide some useful

insights into the workings of the market for law students. First, studies

by economists of the labor market for lawyers suggest that it is dangerous

to project trends. Whether one uses a simple "cobweb model" or a more

sophisticated "rational expectations model", one observes that the number

of law school applicants is sensitive to earnings levels in the

profession.' Moreover, studies that utilize both U.S. and Canadian data

suggest that, other things equal (including demand), an increased supply

of graduates from law schools inevitably leads to lower real earnings of

new entrants in the profession.2

     Second, increasing law school costs and/or decreasing real earnings

of lawyers may well lead to a decline in the number and quality of

applicants to law schools.3 Recent empirical evidence suggests this has
                                      2

happened; since the early 1980s the quality of law school applicants (as

measured by LSAT scores, grade point averages, or the fraction of

applicants coming from the most prestigious undergraduate institutions)

has dropped and the number of applicants fell between 1982 and l985.

     Third, even after one controls for individual lawyers' personal

characteristics such as age, experience, race, region of residence and

sex, lawyers' earnings systematically vary with the type of law they are

practicing (e.g., private practice, corporate, judicial clerkship,

government, public interest).5 Moreover, it appears that individual

lawyers' occupational decisions, in particular the decision whether to

enter private or public interest law practices, depend on differences in

their expected earnings in the two types of practices, as well as their

underlying political and social attitudes.6

     Fourth, there is some evidence that a law student's class rank and

the quality of the law school he or she attended influence the probability

that he or she will initially be employed by a large law firm.7 As is

well known, larger law firms tend to offer higher starting salaries.8

     Finally, recent work by economists on college student debt in general

and law student debt in particular suggests that the debt is manageable,

in the sense that viewed as a long-term investment that yields higher

future earnings it makes sense for students to undertake the

indebtedness.9 The real policy issues are whether annual and/or lifetime

borrowing limits under federal programs will be increased often enough to

permit continual increases in law schools' tuition levels and whether

repayment periods will-be sufficiently lengthened to reduce the impact of
                                          3

high annual   repayment   levels on the decision to enter law school and law

students' choice of careers)°

     Much of the prior research, especially that done by lawyers, quite

reasonably treats law schools as part of a single group and seeks

cooperative solutions to the problems that the group faces. Yet it is

quite clear that law schools by necessity compete with each other on a

number of dimensions including the recruitment of students, the

recruitment of faculty, the placement of graduates, and the attraction of

gifts and endowments. As such, it makes sense when addressing some

problems to view law schools as competitors and this is the approach that

I take in much of what follows.

     I begin in the next section by presenting an empirical analysis of

how the market for law school students functions at a point in time. In

particular I conduct an econometric analysis of the interrelationships

between law school tuition levels, law school quality, law faculty

salaries, and the starting salaries of law school graduates. The

estimates I obtain suggest that the market for law school students

"behaves" in a manner that economists would consider quite rational, from

the perspective of the participants.

     I turn in section III to an examination of recent data on law school

graduates' salaries, earnings in alternative occupations and law school

tuitions. These data suggest that while tuition increases have outpaced

starting salaries for lawyers, law school attendance, on average, still

appears to be a worthwhile investment.

     Of course to say, on average, law school is a worthwhile investment

does not imply it will be equally profitable for all individuals nor that
                                      4

the costs will not influence career choices. High tuition and subsequent

high debt levels may discourage students from low-income families from

entering law school. High debt levels may also discourage law students

from entering low paying fields of practice (e.g., public interest law)

and many people may judge it to be socially desirable to expand employment

in these areas. This leads naturally to a discussion of how law schools

should allocate the limited financial aid resources they have and whether

these funds should be allocated in the form of loans or scholarships.

Section IV discusses these questions, borrowing heavily from earlier work

of mine.11 A brief final section then provides some concluding remarks.



II. The Market for Law School Students

     Given the general market conditions that influence lawyers' salaries,

what factors might be expected to influence the starting salaries that

graduates of a law school receive? Other things equal, one would suspect

that the "better" the students and the "better" the law school the higher

starting salaries will be. The racial and gender mix of a school's

graduates may also influence starting salaries if discrimination or

affirmative action pressures are present in the legal labor market, or if

he "types" of law that graduates practice are influenced by their gender

and race. Finally, other things equal, starting salaries may differ for

graduates from public and private law schools because of differences in

the "types" of law that students from each tend to enter and/or due to

differences in placement efforts and recruitment networks that exist

between the two categories of schools.12
                                      5

    Table 1 presents the results of my efforts to test some of these

hypotheses using data from Barron's Guide to Law Schools. Every few years

Barron's surveys the Deans of Admissions at American law schools to obtain

information for Barron's Guide to Law Schools. Among the questions asked

is the average starting salary of graduates of the prior years academic

class. Understandably, not all law schools wish to reveal this

information; however information for 99 of the 174 ABA accredited law

schools was reported in Barron's seventh edition, which was published in

1986. These data, which pertain to average starting salaries for

graduates of the law school class of 1985, are the salary data used in my

analyses.

     Since these data come from admissions offices, not necessarily from

detailed records of placement offices, it is not obvious how accurate they

are. The National Association for Law Placement (NALP) annually collects

data on salaries of graduates of each law school, however the NALP data

for each individual law school j strictly confidential and could not be

used in this study.

     To get a feel for the accuracy of the Barron's data, I provided a

representative of NALP with the Barron's salary data for three public and

three private law schools and asked her to compare them to the similar

data obtained by NALP in their survey of the class of 1985.13 She

reported that while Barron's average reported starting salary for the six

schools was $31,517, the comparable average in the NALP data was $32,997,

almost 4.7 percent, or $1,500, larger. In one case the NALP figure was

over $3,000 higher, while in another case it was almost $2,500 lower.

Reassuringly, though, the simple correlation of the Barron's and NALP
figures across the six schools was .951. Taken together, these results

suggest that the Barron's data are sufficiently accurate for my purposes

and they are used in Table 1.14

     In this table, average starting salaries are specified to be a

function of the median LSAT score of enrolled students in the school (a

measure of student ability), the "Courman Score" of the law school in the

latest ranking (a measure of one observer's perceptions of the school's

"quality"), whether the school is a public institution, and the percentage

of the school's students that are females and minorities (column l).15

Equations are estimated using both the level and logarithm of average

salaries as dependent variables. Finally, some specifications (column 2)

include the percentage of the school's graduates placed in public sector

(government, military, or judicial clerkships), public service, and public

interest positions as an additional explanatory variable. While this

variable helps control for the "occupational distribution" of the school's

graduates, one must caution that it may well be determined by other

included variables in the model.

     Focusing initially on the specification that ignores this last

variable (col. 1), as expected better students, as measured by LSAT

scores, received higher salaries. A one point increase in the average

LSAT score of students in a school was associated with about a $750 higher

average starting salary in 1985 in the level specification and a 2.5

percent higher stArting salary in the logarithmic specification.

Similarly, students from higher ranked (by Courman) schools received

higher salaries. So, for example, an increase in the Gournian ranking from

300 to 400 (the cutoff points for his "acceptable plus" and "strong"
                                       7

categories) was associated with a $1,500 higher 1985 average starting

salary in the level specification and about a 6 percent higher starting

salary in the logarithmic specification. Finally, other things equal,

graduates of public law schools' starting salaries were some $2,400, or

close to 9 percent lower in 1985 than graduates of private law schools and

the race and gender composition of a school's student body was unrelated

to its graduates' starting salaries.

     Once one controls for the percentage of the law school's graduates

placed in public sector, public service or public interest positions (col.

2). the magnitude of these differentials changes somewhat. The salary

increase associated with a 100 point increase in the Gourman Score falls

to about $1,100 or 4 percent, while the public/private salary differential

falls to about $1,200, or 4.3 percent. Both of these reductions occur

because, other things equal, students from higher ranked law schools are

less likely, and students from public law schools are more likely to be

employed in public sector, public service, or public interest positions

(Table 2, panel A, col. l)).6

     While the above results suggest that there are obvious economic

benefits (at least in terms of starting salaries) associated with

attending better rated law schools and private law schools, other things

equal, there are also obvious costs. These are documented in Table 3

where results are reported of estimating equations in which a law school's

1985-86 tuition and fees level for full-time students was specified to be

a function only of its Gourman Score and whether it is a public

institution.
                                      8

     Focusing on the results for all schools (the top panel) a 100 point

increase in an institution's Gourman Score is associated with roughly a

$1,140 to $1,367 increase, or about a 20 percent higher tuition. Holding

school rating constant, tuition and fees average roughly $2,900 (for out-

of-state students) to $5,600 (for in-state students) lower at public that

private law schools, or 30.5 to 75.1 percent lower)-7 In fact, the same

percentage relationship between tuition and school rating is estimated

when analyses are done separately for private and public law schools (the

bottom two panels). Given this tuition/school rating relationships, it is

not surprising that there is also some evidence (Table 2, panel B) that

higher tuition levels reduce the proportion of students entering public

sector, public service and public interest law careers.

     Why do the better rated law schools charge more? While one could

answer this question from the perspective of both the demand and cost

sides of the market. I focus initially on the cost side here. Analyses

are reported in Table 4 in which a law school's tuition and fees is

specified to be a function of the median base salary and fringe benefits

of its full-time faculty, the total number of volumes in its library per

first year student, the student-faculty ratio, and whether the school is

public. Presumably, one would expect that higher faculty salaries, a

higher library volume-student ratio, and a lower student-faculty ratio

should all be associated, other things equal, with higher tuition and fee

levels. In fact, of these three variables, only the faculty compensation

level seems to matter. In the logarithmic specification that uses out-of-

state tuition levels for public law schools, this variable's estimated

elasticity is not significantly different from unity. That is, across law
                                      9

schools at a point in time, as faculty compensation increases by a given

percentage, tuition and fees increase by roughly the same percentage.

    Of course, from the perspective of the demand side of the market,

there may be a limit to what any law school can charge at a point in time;

raising tuition too far above one's competitors may lead to a decline in

applicants and/or acceptances from admitted applicants. Some evidence to

support this hypothesis, at least for private law schools is found in

Table 5 which presents the results of estimating equations in which a

school's acceDted apolicant yield (enrolled first-year students-accepted

applicants) and its aoolicant yield (enrolled first-year students-total

applicants) are specified to be functions of the Gourman Score of the

school and the logarithm of its tuition and fees for full-time students.

The coefficients of the latter variable can be interpreted as measuring

the effect of a one percent increase in a school's tuition and fees on the

two yield rates, school quality held equal.

     Quite strikingly, higher tuition rates are associated with both lower

accepted applicant and lover applicant yield rates. When the analyses are

redone (middle panel) using only the sample of private schools, a ten

percent increase is a school's tuition is seen to reduce the school's

accepted applicant yield by about 2.3 percentage points and its applicant

yield by 1.4 percentage points. Not surprisingly, higher rated private

schools have higher accepted applicant yields (fewer accepted applicants

turn them down), but lower applicant yields (they have the luxury of

rejecting more applicants.)18

     What emerges from these tables is a rather consistent pattern of

results. There are financial benefits, in the form of higher starting
                                      10

salaries to attending higher rated law schools and, other things equal,

private law schools (Table 1). Because of this, higher rated law schools

and private law schools are able to charge higher tuitions (Table 3).

These higher tuitions allow them to pay higher faculty salaries (Table 4),

which presumably are used to attract and retain higher-quality faculty.

Given the rating of a law school, however, there is a limit to how high it

can raise its tuition, as higher tuition levels are associated with lower

accepted applicant yield rates (Table 5). Since the rating of a law

school surely depends heavily on the quality of its faculty, what emerges

from all this is a set of starting salary, law school rating.

public/private dichotomy-tuition-faculty salary relationships across law

schools that intuitively seems to make sense)-9

     What has not yet been shown is, given the magnitudes of these

relationships, if law students appear on average to have made wise choices

in the law schools they attended. If on average, for a given Gourman

rating for a law school, graduates earned starting salaries that were

roughly $1,200 to $2,400 higher in 1985 if the law school was private

(Table 1), did it make sense for them to pay tuition and fees in the

private sector that were some $2,900 to $5,600 (Table 3) higher than

tuitions in public sector schools in 1985-86? If, other things equal, a

100 point increase in a law school's Gourman Score was associated with

increased starting salaries of 1,100 to $1,500, but increased tuition of

$1,140 to $1,370, did it make sense for them to try to attend the higher-

rated schools. The discussion that follows helps provide the answers.

     Let T represent the tuition cost of attending a law school, C

represent other law school costs (including books and additional living
                                                     11

costs), A represent the opportunity cost of attending law school (the

earnings foregone), and S represent the earnings expected upon graduation

from law school. All these figures are expressed in annual terms and, for

expositional convenience I will ignore inflation, discounting, and growth

in any of these variables over time or over the life cycle here (these

restrictions are relaxed in section III).20 If the time it takes to

complete law school is L years and a law school graduate expects to

practice law for N years then it is straightforward to show that under

these assumptions the expected present value (PV) of the financial gain
                                                                      -

from attending law school is


     (1)   PV — N(S   -
                          A)   -
                                   L(T +   C   +   A)


     Now suppose that we consider two law schools, i and j, and that the

only elements in the above expression that differ between them are their

tuition levels and the expected earnings levels of their graduates. Then

the difference between the expected present values of financial gains from

attending the two     schools      is



     (2) PVi - PVj — N(Sj           -
                                        Sj)
                                               -
                                                   L(Tj   -
                                                              Tj)

     Suppose law school i's tuition is higher, as is the expected

earnings levels of its graduates. If individuals choose law schools based

on the expected financial gains they offer, school i will be preferred to

school J as long as PVj            PVj, which occurs if and only if


           (Si -

                                          12

     Typically, completion of law school for full-time students requires

three years (L — 3) and it is not unreasonable to assume that a person who

graduates from law school plans to spend at least 15 years in the

profession (N -     15).   Thus, it makes sense for the typical student to try

to attend the high tuition level law school as long as the annual earnings

advantage of its graduates over the graduates of the low tuition level

school (Si -         is at least 20 percent (3/15) of its annual tuicion cost
               59
disadvantage (T -      Tj).
     Given this relationship, it is clear the potential law school

students had an incentive (at least in 1985) to get to the highest rated

school they could. The marginal annual tuition cost of attending a higher

rated school was roughly of the same order of magnitude as the marginal

gain in annual earnings the higher rated school provided. Similarly,

potential law school students on average had an incentive to attend

private sector law schools rather than public law schools of equal rating;

the lower estimate of the estimated annual salary gain from doing so

($1,200) exceeds 20 percent of our estimate of the average tuition

differential for in-state students of doing so ($5,600).

     Of course to say that it made sense on average for students to try to

attend highly rated private law schools in 1985-86 doesn't imply that it

made sense for all individuals to try to do so. Individuals who expected

to practice law only for a relatively short period of time obviously would

find the net financial advantage from public law schools higher.

Individuals who expected little financial gain from attending higher rated

private law schools (such as those interested in public interest law)

would obviously not have sought to do so. It is thus not surprising that
                                       13

I found graduates from higher rated law schools and private law schools

were less likely to be employed in public sector, public service, or

public interest positions (Table 2).

     Given the financial incentives prospective students faced in 1985-86.

it is also not surprising that the decline in the number and quality of

law school applicants observed in the 1980s has been felt primarily by the

lower ranked law schools.21 In a sense, the higher ranked private schools

had a "captive" audience. One may wonder then, why these schools did not

try to "confiscate" some of the benefits students received from attending

them by increasing tuitions above their then-current levels. Part of the

answer is that annual and/or lifetime borrowing limits that students faced

under federal programs may have limited the schools' ability to do so.22

One should also note that, other things held constant, equal percentage

tuition increases at higher rated and lower rated private institutions, or

at private and public schools over time, would widen the absolute tuition

level differential between the two groups of institutions. Unless the

absolute earnings advantage the higher tuition schools provided their

students also widened, they would find fewer students willing to enroll in

them. Highly rated private schools are not immune to market pressures.



III. Has Law School Attendance Become Less Attractive Financially in
     Recent Years?

    The previous section addressed issues relating to the market for law

students at a point in time; here I consider what has happened to that

market over time. In particular, I examine whether rising law school

tuition levels, coupled with changing earnings levels in law and other
                                      14

occupations, have decreased the relative financial attractiveness of law

as a career.

     Historical data on the salaries earned by new lawyers are hard to

come by. For the last 13 years, however, Student Lawyer has published

starting salaries for lawyers in law firms and corporations in a number of

cities; the 1987 survey covered 18 cities.23 The Student Lawyer salary

data are easily accessible and because they go back to the mid-70s I use

them in my analyses below, focusing on the salaries paid by nonpatent law

firms.

     Although law firms are the major employers of new lawyers, a

substantial minority of lawyers enter corporate practice, government

careers, judicial clerkships, public interest practices, or academic

careers. Starting salaries in the latter four categories tend to be lower

than those for law firms. For example, while the average starting salary

of graduates of the law school class of 1986 was $32,752 nationwide, the

average starting salary for lawyers entering private practice was $36,050,

for lawyers in business and industry $34,512, for government lawyers

$26,659, for lawyers in judicial clerkships $24,416, for lawyers in public

interest practices $21,792. and for academic lawyers $28,852.24 Thus the

use of law firm salary figures will overstate the average starting

salaries of all new lawyers at a point in time. On the other hand, over

the 1974-86 period, the percentage of law school graduates entering

private practice has risen from 52.2 to 61.6 and the percentage entering

government (including military) judicial clerkships, public interest, and

academic law has fallen from 35.5 to 30.7.25 Focusing on the salaries of

lawyers entering private practice may thus well understate the trend
                                      15

increase in the average law school graduate starting salary over the

period.

     Table 6 takes the Student Lawyer starting salary data for seven

cities for whom data has been published continuously since 1976 and asks

how these salary figures for each city compare to the tuition and fees

charged by a law school in the same city. Of course, not all graduates of

a law school practice law in the city in which the school is located nor

do all new lawyers in a city come from law schools in that city.

Nonetheless, these data provide initial suggestive evidence on the

financial benefits and costs of attending law schools. In the main, the

law schools I have chosen for each city are relatively high-priced private

law schools, although one public institution is included.

     Panel A presents the ratio of each law school's tuition in a year to

the average annual starting salary of starting lawyers in nonpatent law

firms in the city during the 1975-76 to 1985-86 period. Harvard's tuition

is used for Boston and during the period the ratio in Boston rose from .22

to .34; a 50 percent increase. Increases of similar magnitudes were

observed for NYU (New York). Georgetown (Washington) and Pennsylvania

(Philadelphia). Somewhat smaller increases were recorded for Chicago

(Chicago) and Marquette (Milwaukee), while nonresident law school tuition

in the one public university in the sample. UCLA, actually remained

relatively stable, as a fraction of starting salaries in the city (Los

Angeles), during the period.

     To the casual observer, the rapid rise in these ratios for the elite

private law schools may suggest they are in danger of pricing themselves

"out of the market". However, as should be clear from equation (1),
                                       16

ratios can be deceiving. What is relevant is not the ratio of tuition and

fees to starting salaries but rather the difference between the two

variables in       terms. That is, after controlling for changes in the

price level, what is relevant is how the difference between annual

starting salaries and annual law school tuition and fees has moved.

     Panel B of Table 6 presents the answer to this question. For some

law schools (Chicago and UCLA), the difference has actually increased.

For the others, the difference has decreased. However, save for

Georgetown, the decrease was relatively small (less than 10%), so the

decline in the attractiveness of attendance at law schools (if it occurred

at all) was not as large as the ratio comparisons in panel A suggest.

     In fact, even the comparisons in panel B are misleading and do not

give the reader an accurate picture of the changes that have occurred in

the financial attractiveness of pursuing a career in law. To see this,

refer to equation (1), which showed the expected present value of the

financial gain from attending law school. If one first differences this

equation one obtains


     (4) PV—N(S-A) -L(T+C+M).

where the symbol       indicates the change that occurs between two years in

a variable in      terms (holding prices constant). The change in

expected present value is seen in (4) to depend on the change in lawyers'

starting sa1aries (AS), the change in starting salaries in other

occupations (LA), the change in law school tuition and fees (AT), and the

change in other law school costs (AC). This equation makes clear that the

calculations in Table 6 ignore what is happening to earnings in other
                                           17

occupations law students might enter. It also implies that equal dollar

increases in starting lawyer salaries and in law school tuition and fees

actually increase the relative financial attractiveness of entering the

legal profession. The latter occurs because the number of years

individuals plan on practicing law (N) is considerably longer than the

length of time it takes to complete law school (L).

     If one is willing to assume that changes in other law school costs

(books and additional living costs) have been small in real terms, one can

ignore them and compute whether the financial attractiveness of attending

law school has changed during a time period from


     (5) PV — N(S     -
                          A)   -
                                   L(T   + M)

If the expression in (5) is positive, the financial attractiveness has

increased during the period, while if the expression is negative,

attractiveness has declined.

     To make such computations requires one to have data on expected

earnings in law, on expected earnings in alternative occupations, and on

law school tuition costs. Some illustrative data that can be used at the

national level are found in Table 7 for the 1974-75 to 1986-87 period.

     For lawyers' expected earnings (LSAL), I have constructed an

unweighted average (across the seven cities listed in Table 6) of the

starting salaries of lawyers in nonpatent law firms from the annual

Student Lawyer surveys. While the focus on lawyers in private practice

(see footnote 24) and limitation to lawyers employed in large cities may

cause this average to overstate the true average starting salary of
                                          18

lawyers,for the two years that NALP has published average nationwide

starting salary data from their annual survey, their averages and mine are

not too far off.26

        Data on annual starting salaries in other occupations prospective law

students might enter come from the College Placement Council.27 One

option prospective law students have is to attend business school, the

relevant comparison salaries I have used to capture this option are the

average annual starting salaries of MBA graduates who had nontechnical

(ASAL1) and technical (ASAL5) undergraduate degrees. Another option is to

find employment directly Out of college; the comparison salaries I have

used for this are those for college graduates who majored in the

humanities      (ASAL2), other social sciences (ASAL3), and economics (ASAL4).
Finally, the table reports average private and public law school tuitions

(TPRV, TPUB) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The calculations that

follow all set the price index in 1975 equal to 1.00 and deflate the

dollar values of all variables in each subsequent year by the relative

price index in that year so that all variables are expressed in real

terms.

        While one   cannot derive conclusions about the expected financial gain

from attending law school simply by focusing on the starting salaries of

lawyers relative to the salaries in the alternative occupations

prospective lawyers might enter, such comparisons are instructive and are

found    in   Table 8.28 Although lawyers' starting salaries declined relative

to   those of MBA students between the class of 1975 and the class of 1983,
from 1983 to 1987, the relative starting salary of lawyers rose by over 20
percent (Ri, P5). Similarly, while substantial declines occurred in the
                                      19

starting salaries of lawyers vis-a-vis college graduates with humanities

CR2), other social sciences CR3) and economics (R4) degrees through 1983.

by 1987, lawyers' relative starting salaries had returned to their 1975

levels. At least in recent years, lawyers' earnings have grown at higher

rates than earnings in alternative occupations that prospective law

students might enter.

     More formal calculations about how the expected present value of a

law school degree has changed relative to the expected present value of

alternative degrees are presented in Table 9. These calculations use

equation (5) and make use of the average private law school tuition,

rather than the average public law school tuition. Since changes in the

former have been much greater (in real terms), this will bias the findings

against finding law school attendance increasing in attractiveness. They

also assume an expected work life (N) of 15 years (to be conservative) and

that law school completion (L) takes an extra three years when the

comparison group is college graduates, but only an extra one year when the

alternative is getting an MBA degree.29

     Table 9 suggests that while the financial attractiveness of a law

degree fell relative to that of an MBA degree throughout most of the 1975-

76 to 1982-83 period, it actually has risen in more recent years.

Moreover, throughout the 1975-76 to 1986-87 period, the financial

attractiveness of a law degree has risen relative to the financial

attractiveness of entering the labor market directly upon college

completion. Taken at face value, these results suggest that the practice

of law remains, and probably is becoming increasingly, a financially

attractive career and they may help to explain the slight increase in law
                                      20

school applicants observed in 1986-87 and the dramatic increase observed

in the 1987-88 academic year.3°

     Of course, these conclusions all are derived from expected present

value calculations that made a number of very stringent simplifying

assumptions. In particular, they ignore inflation, discounting (or the

costs of borrowing funds), and real growth in lawyers, earnings and the

earnings in other occupations over individuals' life cycles. While it is

difficult to obtain occupation specific life-cycle earnings growth figures

based upon longitudinal data, the limited data that are available for

lawyers suggests that lawyers' earnings grow at least initially at rates

that far exceed likely rates of discount.

     To illustrate this, Table 10 presents average salary data for lawyers

employed in nonpatent law firms for eight cities for five years. These

data, which come from Student Lawyers annual salary surveys, allow us to

trace the earnings of young lawyers during the early years of their

careers. So for example, the average starting salary for lawyers in

Boston in 1982 was $24,000. With a year's experience in 1983, these

lawyers would be earning $27,000 on average and a year later, with two

year's experience they would be earning $34,000 on average. More

generally, to trace the earnings history of a typical lawyer employed by

these firms over time, one moves diagonally downward to the right in the

table.

     Focusing on workers who were first employed in 1982 in each city, I

have underlined in the table the salaries they earned on average each year

through 1986. Quite strikingly, over the five-year period, their nominal

salaries at least doubled in four of the six cities and in the other two.
                                     21

Atlanta and Washington, their earnings increased by over 80 percent. For

earnings in 1986 discounted back to 1982     to be worth more in real

terms than earnings in 1982, the discount rate would have to be at least

15.8 percent for the latter two cities and over 18.9 percent for all the

other cities.31 Given the rate of inflation that prevailed during the

period, it is highly unlikely that discount rates could be that high. The

rates of interest charged on federal educational loans were much lower

during the period.32

     Of course, not all lawyers who start in average paying firms maintain

their employment in these firms for four years. Of those who do, some

fail to make partnerships after six years and many of these wind up in

lower paying positions or in self-employment. On the other hand, those

who do reach partner status do appreciably better financially. For

example, across the 18 cities that Student Lawyer surveyed in 1986 the

average salaries of partners in nonpatent law firms was 465 percent of the

average starting salaries of new lawyers in these same firms.33 While in

the absence of data on life-cycle earnings growth rates in other

occupations one cannot draw definitive conclusions, in recent years

entering law school, on average, still seems like a good investment. As

emphasized by Kramer, the real issue is whether limitations on the annual

and total amounts of funds prospective law students can borrow, and

restrictions on the length of the period over which they must repay the

loans, will constrain students borrowing and hence law schools' future

ability to raise tuitions.34

IV. Optimal   Financial Aid Policies for Selective Law Schools

     To say that on average law school is a worthwhile investment, is not

to say that the investment will be equally profitable for all individuals

nor is it to say that law school costs will not influence individuals'

career choices. High tuition levels and subsequent high debt levels may

discourage students from low-income families from entering law schools.

High debt levels, along with growing differentials between high-paying

(e.g. private practice) and low-paying (e.g. ,   public   interest) fields of

law may discourage students from entering the latter.35

     Of course, both law schools and applicants to law schools behave

selectively. Law schools select who they will admit; in a recent year

over half of ABA-accredited law schools reported admitting less than 50

percent of their applicants, while almost one-tenth reported admitting

less than 25 percent of their applicants.36 Accepted applicants in turn

select from the schools at which they have been admitted,arid decide

whether and where to enroll. Indeed, the fraction of accepted applicants

who actually enroll is less than 50 percent in over three quarters of all

ABA-accredited law schools.37

     Law schools obviously believe that targeting financial aid to bright,

needy, or minority students will influence these students' decisions to

enroll, as substantial resources are devoted to "merit", "needs-based", or

"minority" scholarships.38 Similarly, law schools obviously believe that

"loan-forgiveness" programs for law students who enter "low-income"

careers (such as public interest law) can either help them attract

students with such interests and/or influence existing students career

choices.39 Do such strategies make sense? More generally, if a law
                                       23

school wants to optimally allocate its financial aid resources, what

strategies should it pursue?

      To answer such questions requires one to be a bit more precise about

what law schools are trying to accomplish and to specify the constraints

that they face. Elsewhere, I have formally addressed the issue of

"optimal financial aid policies" for selective undergraduate colleges and

I adapt my previous discussion to law school financial aid policies

below.40 As I shall show, the design of financial aid policies is not as

simple as one might think.

      Suppose that a selective law school faces K different categories of

applicants. These categories may depend upon applicants' minority status,

their socioeconomic backgrounds, their academic abilities, whether their

parents are alumni, the types of law the applicants claim to be interested

in pursuing or any other attributes the law school cares about. To take

an example, if the law school cares only about its applicants' minority

status, whether they came from low-income families, or whether they scored

above a certain threshold on the LSAT exam, there would be eight

categories of applicants (yes/yes/yes, yes/yes,no, yes/no/no, ...).     Let

Xj   denote the number of applicants from category i that a school admits.

       Suppose next that the law school establishes a tuition and fees level

that does not vary across categories of students but that it varies its

financial aid policy so that the share of tuition and fees subsidized in

the form of financial aid (ar) varies across groups. Determining how this

share should vary is our objective.

       Given the school's tuition and fees level, the proportion of accepted

applicants from each category that actually enroll (Ft), its acceDted
                                         24

applicant yield, is inversely related to the share of the category's

tuition and fees that is subsidized


     (6) Fi—Fi(ai)

Increased financial aid increases the likelihood that accepted applicants

will enroll. Quite crucially, the sensitivity of applicants, enrollment

decisions to financial aid may well ygy across groups. Note also that it

is assumed that when aid is zero, some fraction (poasibly zero) of

accepted applicants from a group will enroll. This fraction, the group's

propensity to enroll, may also differ across groups.

     Why   does   a law school care about its accepted applicant yield? The

product of the number of admitted applicants in a group and the group's

yield is the number of students from the group who actually enroll. If

the yield falls, a law school could always admit more applicants from the

group to get the same number of enrolled students. The cost of doing

this, however, is that the "deeper" the school dips into a group's

applicant pool, the lower the average quality (as measured say by LSAT

scores) of enrolled students in the group (q) is likely to be


     (7) q —      qj(X).

Crucially, how sensitive applicant quality is to the number of applicants

admitted may also differ across groups. For example, the average quality

of minority applicants may fall off much more rapidly with the number

admitted than does the average quality of white male applicants.

     Suppose the law school values the total "quality units" of students

who actually enroll in each category (Ei —    F(aj)q(X)X)     and that the
                                     25

weights it places on attracting students from different categories can be

summarized by a utility or welfare function of the form


     (8) U - U(E1,E2,   ...   E).
     Note that this formulation distinguishes between the objective

academic aualitv of applicants and their subjective relative

attractiveness to the law school. The former depends on measurable

academic attributes. The latter, however, depends on the law school's

subjective valuations of applicant characteristics (such as minority

status and family socioeconomic background) that are summarized by

equation (8). Category i applicants are defined as being relatively

attractive to the law school than category j applicants if, when the

school has enrolled the same number of quality units of applicants from

both categories, it would get greater marginal utility from enrolling an

additional quality unit of students from category i than from category j.

     Given a fixed budget that the law school wants to commit to financial

aid, suppose that it seeks to maximize its utility function subject to the

constraints imposed by its accepted applicant yield and average quality

functions. Under suitable assumptions about the shapes of the various

functions, one can show that its financial aid policies should depend upon

four factors.4'

     First, other things equal, applicant groups that are relatively more

attractive should receive more aid. Second, other things equal, groups

with lower propensities to enroll if admitted should receive more aid,

 there is no reason to subsidize groups that would enroll even in the

 absence of aid. Third, other things equal, the more sensitive a group's
                                     26

enrollment decisions are to financial aid, the more aid they should

receive. Finally, other things equal, the more sensitive a category's

average quality is to the number of applicants admitted, the greater the

aid that category should receive.42 While the relative attractiveness

of different categories of applicants must be subjectively determined by a

law school, the other "parameters" it needs to know (groups' propensities

to enroll, sensitivities of yield to financial aid, sensitivities of

average qualities to numbers admitted) are all objectively determined and

can be estimated by institutionally-based empirical studies.43

     These findings have a number of implications for the financial aid

policies law schools should pursue. Law schools may want to attract the

brightest possible students to help increase their perceived ratings.44

They may also feel it socially desirable to increase the number of lawyers

coming from low-income and minority backgrounds. Other things equal,

groups that are relatively more attractive optimally should receive more

aid; this seems to argue in favor of financial aid being merit-based.

need-based, and more generous for minorities. However, other things are

    necessarily equal, propensities to enroll, sensitivities of yield to

aid, and sensitivities of enrolled student quality to the number admitted

may also differ across groups. While sometimes these other factors may

reenforce aid decisions based solely on the "relative attractiveness"

criteria, they need not always and these other factors should enter into

aid decisions.45

     Law schools may also want to influence the distribution of their

graduating students across types of practices. In particular, they may

want to encourage people to enter public interest law or to practice law
                                      27

in low-income areas where legal representation is scarce. Other things

equal, to the extent that they judge students interested in these types of

practice relatively more attractive, such students should receive higher

aid levels.

     Of course, announced intent to pursue a certain type of legal career

does not mean students will actually wind up in such a career. Hence,

contingent loan forgiveness programs that are announced prior to students

enrolling in law school appear to make more sense than does direct

scholarship aid for these students. Decisions about allocation of

resources to grant aid and to loan forgiveness programs must therefore be

made together. Shifting up front scholarship money into loan forgiveness

programs, as some have people have suggested, may well make sense.

     Eligibility for existing loan forgiveness programs at some law

schools is based on law school graduates' earnings after they leave law

school, as well as on the type of law practices they enter. However, in

other schools, eligibility is based solely on the graduates' earnings.46

The latter type of programs provide a form of insurance for those people

who enter types of practice that, on average, are lucrative but who fail

to do well financially. It is not obvious that law schools should provide

this type of insurance for their students.



V.   Concluding Remarks

     This paper has consisted of four interrelated sections. The first

summarized the lessons we have learned from prior empirical research about

the market for law students. The second conducted an empirical analysis

of how this market functions at a point in time, using law schools as the
                                     28

units of analysis, and concluded that it behaves in a manner that

economists would consider quite rational. The third examined recent data

on law school tuition levels, starting lawyers' earnings, and earnings in

other occupations and concluded that, on average, law school still appears

to be a worthwhile investment. The last sketched a model of how law

schools should allocate their limited financial aid resources, indicated

the types of information law schools need to intelligently make such

decisions, and traced the implications of the model for financial aid

policies.

     Together, these sections should stress to the reader how useful

rather simple economic models and empirical analyses can be in improving

our understanding of how the market for law students operates. Moreover,

empirical analyses of this market have only begun. If ways could be found

to grant researchers access to the annual NALP surveys of salaries of law

school graduates for individual law school's, the analyses I presented in

section II could be considerably expanded and improved upon. For example,

studies could be done of the determinants of starting salaries that more

fully control for the race and gender composition of a school's graduates,

as well as the types of practices they enter and the geographic areas in

which they reside.

     One could also analyze the extent to which starting salaries of

graduates vary for each jaw school and then study whether such variability

influences law school applicants' decisions. One reasonable conjecture is

that potential students will be more attracted to law schools that offer

them (upon graduation) hjg expected starting salaries        to those that

offer them a greater certainty (that is J   variability   of starting
                                           29

salaries) of what they will likely face at the end of their studies. It

may well be the case that the better law schools offer potential students

both higher expected starting salaries and greater certainty.47

       While we can infer something about age-earnings profiles for lawyers

who   remain   with the same law firm   over   time (Table 10), we actually have

very little information on the career earnings profiles of most lawyers in

the United States. Serious longitudinal data collection efforts by NALP

or some other organization that follow a cohort of lawyers over time,

would clearly also be worthwhile. Finally, if law schools are to

"optimally" allocate financial aid among categories of recipients, section

IV indicates that they must conduct institutionally-based empirical

studies to ascertain the magnitudes of various parameters.

reanalyzed the data Weisbrod used and found that once one accounts for

several statistical problems (more formally, self-selection bias and

choice-based sampling), one fails to find that public interest lawyers are

earning substantially less than they would have earned in alternative

types of practices.

       12. There are, of course, many other factors that influence a

school's starting salaries, including the specific geographic areas in

which the school's graduates tend to be employed. In the absence of such

data, I ignore these other factors here.

       13. I appreciate the assistance of Jane Thieberger, Chair of the

NALP   Research   Committee, in making these calculations.

       14. Since the NALP    data   contain a host of other information,

including (see footnote 12) detailed area of employment information, it

clearly would have been preferable to use them.

       15. The Gourman Score comes from The Gourtugn Reoort which is claimed

by the author to be an objective evaluation based on a wide number of

criteria. No details are provided by Gourman on precisely how these

scores are calculated. Many people connected with legal education have

questioned Courman's methods and consider his ratings to be unreliable.

David Webster (1984) details similar concerns about Gourman's analogous

rankings of undergraduate colleges.

       Since other rankings do not always agree with Gourman, it would be

desirable to redo the analysis below using other rankings. It is

interesting to note, however, that the correlation between the rankings of

the top 20 law schools ranked by Deans of law schools in a recent iLL.

News and World ReDort article and the rankings of the same scores in the

Opurman ReDort is about .85. Hence, the Gourman Scores may be

sufficiently accurate for my purposes. (An earlier study of college

graduates (Lewis Solomon (1973)) found that their earnings were
                                      36

significantly related to the analogous Gourman rankings of their

undergraduate institutions.)

     The actual Gourman Scores of accredited law schools in the Gourman

Reoort range from 2.10 to 4.95. I ignored the decimal points in my

analyses and thus will act as if the scores range from 210 to 495.

     Finally, it is worth stressing that the Gourman and other rankings of

law schools would find it near impossible to get sufficient information to

actually measure the quality of legal education that any law school

provides. At best what they measure is the quality of inputs used in the

educational process (e.g., student quality, faculty quality, library size)

or subjective impressions of a law school's reputation. My goal is to see

if the legal labor market appears to reward attendance at "high quality"

institutions, as measured by such rankings.

     16. Note that once public sector, public service, and public

interest law employment is controlled for, minorities are seen to receive

significantly higher job offers than nonminorities (some $11,000 or 30

percent higher). Thus, affirmative action pressures do seem important in

the legal labor market.

      17. These are computed, respectively, by ((exp(- .50l))-1)*lOO and

 ((exp(_l.390))_l)*100.

      18. As the bottom panel of Table 5 indicates, no such relationships

 are found when the analyses are restricted to public law schools.

      19. What is missing from this "picture" is an explanation of why

 some law schools locate at the high rating-high cost end and others at the

 low rating-low cost end of the market. Is it due to differences in law

 school endowments, to the general status of the university a law school is
                                         37

attached to, or to unique historical factors? An analysis of this issue

is far beyond the scope of this paper.

     20. Implicitly, I am assuming here that starting salary

differentials across schools persist over graduates' lifetimes. If

earnings of graduates from higher rated schools tend to grow at a more

rapid (slower) rate, this will increase (decrease) the financial

attractiveness of attendance at these schools. Some evidence suggesting

that such differentials may decrease over time, as the 'true ability" of

individual lawyers is observed, is presented in Spurr (1987).

     21. Vernon and Zimmer (1987).

     23. The 1987 survey, covering the class of 1987, was conducted by

the Chicago-based legal placement firm David J. White and Associates (as

were many of the earlier surveys) during the March to May 1987 period.

The published results were based on a survey of 8,000 law firms (with a

27.5% response rate) and on salary information from positions listed with

David J. White and Associates.

     24. NALP (l987a).

     25. NALP (1987b).

     26. Average starting salaries of NALP respondents in their surveys

of the classes of 1985 and 1986 were 29,124 and 32,757 respectively (see

NALP (1987c) (1987a). If we take these figures as the "true" averages,

the computed LSAL variable is off by 11.4% for the class of 1985 and 4.4%

for the class of 1986. Prior to 1985, NALP did not report national

average salary information. While such figures could be calculated in

principle from the detailed data they report, such an effort is beyond the
                                                 38

scope    of this paper.

        Typically starting lawyers in the federal government are hired at the

CS-li    grade.   In the fall of 1975 this grade's salary level was slightly

greater than the 1975 estimated LSAL value of $15,688. By the fall of

1987, the CS-Il salary had grown to slightly over $27,000 but LSAL had

risen to almost $37,000. This dramatic decline in the ratio of government

to private sector starting lawyers. salaries undoubtedly helps to explain

the declining proportion of new lawyers entering government service.

        27. College Placement Council (1985) (1986) (1987).

        28. I must again caution that equations (1) and (5) indicate that

the differences in salaries, not the ratios, are what determines expected

financial gain.

        29. A hidden assumption in the comparison of law schools and

business schools is that tuition levels for given quality schools of each

type are equal.

         33.   Law School Admission Service (1987), pp. 25-31. On the other
hand, these rates did tend to increase over the period and such increases

would, other things held constant, tend to decrease the financial return

 from investing in a legal education.

     38. In academic year 1986-87 private law schools' grants to students

averaged 10.5 percent of tuition and fees, while public law schools'

grants averaged 17.4 percent (ABA Memorandum QS8687-37, "Overview of

Scholarship Programs for 174 ABA-Approved Law Schools", March 17, 1987).

     39. See Lynn   Miller   (1987). As of the fall of 1987, 13 of the 175

ABA-accredited law schools had some form of loan forgiveness program.

Annual income eligibility cut-offs for these programs ranged from $26,000

(at Pennsylvania) to $40,000 (at Yale) and eligibility under these

programs began as early as the first year after law school (Harvard) and

as late as six years after (Cornell).

     41. See Ehrenberg and Sherman (1984) for formal proofs.

     42. More formally, sensitivity is defined here as the percentage

decline in applicant quality that occurs in response to a given percentage

increase in the number of applicants. The intuition behind this last

result can be illustrated by an example. Suppose that the quality of

minority applicants to a law school falls off rapidly with the number

admitted but that it has a large number of fairly indistinguishable white

male applicants. It should, other things equal. give more aid to the

former as keeping their yield high will avoid the need to admit

substantially less qualified applicants. While it is true that giving

less aid to the latter will decrease their yield, admitting more of them

will not substantially reduce the average quality of enrollees from the

group.

    44. Recall from section II that higher rated schools can charge

higher tuition levels.

     45. Ehrenberg and Sherman (1984) examined data on undergraduates at

one selective university and showed that all of the factors argued in

favor of an undergraduate financial aid policy at that university that

provided larger scholarships for minorities and high-ability students.

     46. These statements are based on Miller (1987) and conversations

with administrators at a number of law schools. Several of the latter

were kind enough to provide me with copies of their school's formal

program documents.

     47. I am grateful to Dean Peter Martin of the Cornell Law School for

suggesting this point to me.
