The Long-Term Effects of Military Conscription on Mortality: ¸˛Estimates from the Vietnam-era
Draft Lottery

                                             ABSTRACT

Research on the effects of Vietnam military service suggests that Vietnam veterans experienced
significantly higher mortality than both non-Vietnam veterans and the civilian population at large. These
results, however, may be biased by non-random selection into the military if unobserved background
differences between veterans and non-veterans affect mortality directly. The present study generates
unbiased estimates of the causal impact of Vietnam era draft eligibility on male mortality. Using
records from the Vietnam draft lottery to assign decedents born 1950-1952 draft lottery numbers, the
study estimates excess mortality among observed draft eligible male decedents as compared to the (1)
expected proportion of draft eligible decedents given Vietnam draft eligibility cutoffs and (2) observed
proportion of draft eligible female decedents. The results demonstrate that there appears to be no effect
of draft exposure on mortality (even cause-specific death rates). When we examine population subgroups—
including splits by race, educational attainment, nativity and marital status—we find weak evidence for an
interaction between education and draft eligibility. On the whole, these results suggest that previous
research, which has shown that Vietnam-era veterans experienced significantly higher mortality than
non-veterans, may be biased by non-random selection into the military and may thus overstate the need for
compensatory government pensions.

The Long-Term Effects of Military Conscription on Mortality: Estimates from the
Vietnam-era Draft Lottery


Introduction

Over eight million men and women served in the military during the years of America’s

formal involvement in the Vietnam War with well over three million deployed to the

theater of combat in Southeast Asia (US Department of Veteran Affairs 2008a). The war

claimed more than fifty-seven thousand American lives and left many thousands more

service men and women wounded. In 2008, Vietnam veterans constituted over thirty

percent of the United States’ veteran population, the largest period of service cohort by

far, and received a greater proportion of service-related disability benefits than veterans

of World War II, the Korean Conflict, and the Gulf War combined (US Department of

Veteran Affairs 2008b).

       Although not as severe in terms as casualties as World War II, the Vietnam War

remains one of the most controversial military engagements in American history and,

according to a wealth of previous research, one of the most taxing to its veterans as well.

While World War II era veterans were granted generous state-financed educational

benefits through the GI Bill (Teachman 2005) and by some measures experienced a

significant earnings premium compared to nonveteran peers (Berger and Hirsch 1983),

studies of Vietnam veterans have documented a sizable wage penalty as well as a host of

mental and physical health problems. The National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment

Study in the 1980s, for instance, found that the lifetime incidence rate for post-traumatic

stress disorder (PTSD), a disorder whose symptoms may persist up to forty years after




                                                                                              3
service (MacLean and Elder 2007), was over thirty percent in male Vietnam veterans

(Kulka et al. 1990).

       The consequences of service for the health and happiness of Vietnam-era veterans

has thus been a subject of considerable research (see, e.g., Call & Teachman 1996;

Davison et al. 2006; Gamache, Rosenheck & Tessler, 2001; Hearst, Newman & Hulley

1986; Hearst et al. 1991; Liu et al. 2005; London & Wilmoth 2006; Settersten 2006).

Military combat has been associated with increased incidence of physical and mental

illness and has important consequences for lifetime health and mortality rates among

veterans beyond the immediate risks due to exposure to war (Cook et al. 2004; Davison et

al. 2006; Gamache et al., 2001; Hearst et al. 1986; Liu at al. 2005; Ruger et al. 2002). In

addition to the trauma of combat, some Vietnam-era combatants faced exposure to the

environmental toxin, Agent Orange (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin), which has

been associated with Hodgkin’s disease, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma,

and chloracne (Institute of Medicine 1994). Vietnam veterans also report high rates of

recreational drug use, including “hard” drugs like heroin—both in the field and upon

return to the U.S. (Wright, Carter & Cullen 2005). Vietnam veterans typically also came

home to a hostile and certainly less supportive social and political environment than did

previous generations of veterans, perhaps increasing their stress levels (Angrist &

Krueger 1994; Sampson & Laub 1996).



Selection Bias in Estimates of Military Service Effects

While past empirical and theoretical work suggests that the effects of military service

may be both a fruitful and policy-relevant line of inquiry, nearly all studies of veterans,




                                                                                              4
regardless of war-time period, have been plagued by the problem of selection bias. Since

entry into the military is typically far from random, the men in the ranks of the armed

forces may not be representative of the male population as a whole, making identification

of a treatment effect of military service difficult at best.i      Specifically, unobserved

differences between veterans and non-veterans may influence substantive outcomes

directly and may therefore contaminate efforts to estimate a treatment effect of military

service or even an intent-to-treat effect of exposure to conscription.

      To illustrate, an early investigation by Seltzer and Jablon (1974) found that, even

more than twenty years after military service, white male World War II veterans had

drastically lower mortality rates compared to the overall white male population. Reduced

mortality rates for tuberculosis, cardiovascular disease, and ulcers were particularly

pronounced and underscored the potential long-term impact of selection bias on health

outcomes.    Specifically, if military pre-induction screenings weeded out males who

appeared unhealthy or otherwise unfit to serve, reduced mortality rates may have

reflected not the ameliorative effects of military service but instead a lasting health

selection gradient.

      Selection effects may work in the opposite direction, as well.         For example,

Boehmer et al. (2004) find significantly elevated all-cause mortality for Vietnam era

veterans in the first five years after the end of the conflict and elevated cardiovascular

related death rates for men discharged from service after 1970 during the second half of a

30-year follow-up frame (also see Settersten 2006 with respect to mental health

outcomes). However, just as pre-induction health screenings may select only the most

physically fit for actual service, those who are initially motivated to apply for military




                                                                                         5
service (or who fail to evade conscription) may differ in important ways from the

population at large making the net effect of selection bias on health outcomes largely

indeterminate.



Causal Estimation Strategies

Between December 1969 and February 1972, the United States Selective Service held

four Vietnam draft lotteries. Each of these draft lotteries randomly assigned men in the

1950, 1951, 1952, and 1953 birth cohortsii order of induction numbers through a hand

drawing of three hundred sixty-five birth dates (and three hundred sixty-six for the leap

year lottery of the 1952 birth cohort). Following the lotteries, men in a particular birth

year classified as either 1-A or 1-A-Oiii were called to report in order for possible

induction up to a yearly draft eligibility cutoff (see Table 1). Draft lottery numbers, then,

are highly correlated with Vietnam military service but likely uncorrelated with

unobservables that directly influence mortality outcomes (see Angrist [1990]). The draft

lottery thus provides a unique opportunity to utilize a random assignment method as a

‘natural experiment’ and cleanly estimate the causal impact of exposure to military

conscription on important outcomes net of selection bias.

      This “randomized natural experiment” of the Vietnam draft lottery has been used

by several existing studies to sort out the unique experience of the Vietnam-era cohort.

As the first to deploy this novel estimation strategy, Hearst et al. (1986) documented the

short-term consequences of Vietnam military service on subsequent mortality risk.

Between 1974 and 1983, Hearst et al. found that draft eligible Vietnam era men living in

California and Pennsylvania experienced significantly higher mortality rates than draft




                                                                                           6
ineligible men—particularly from suicide and motor vehicle accidents. Later work by

Angrist (1990) utilized draft eligibility as an instrument variable (IV) for military service

to study income and earnings for male veterans. Angrist’s study showed that white

veterans experienced a 15 percent drop in lifetime earnings compared to similar white

non-veterans while non-whites faced no wage penalty as a result of military service. (It

should be noted, however, that since there were other behavioral responses to draft lottery

number on the part of both the individuals and employers, the effect should rather be

interpreted as an estimate of “intent-to-treat.”) Caveats aside, these findings jointly

suggest that the effect of military service on the lives of these veterans may be causal

instead of simply a remnant of differential selection into the military. Moreover, the

work of Angrist (1990) suggests, in line with a significant sociological literature on the

ameliorative effects of service for minorities (Lundquist 2004; Lundquist 2008; Sampson

& Laub 1996), that the effects of military service may vary by subpopulation.

      Nonetheless, the more recent research using IV estimation by Angrist and Chen

(2008) suggests that, despite early evidence to indicate that the negative effects of

military service may indeed have been causal, such putative deleterious effects may have

faded over time. Using the 2000 Decennial Census, Angrist and Chen (2008) find that

the wage penalty for white veterans has dissipated along with the elevated mortality rates

previously documented by Hearst et al. (1986) for whites and non-whites alike.

      Important questions remain, however, about the potential causal impact of military

service on health outcomes. While Angrist and Chen (2008) find little evidence for a

long-term effect of Vietnam military service on mortality, their study may mask

important variation in the effects of Vietnam military service on specific causes of




                                                                                           7
death—as Hearst et al.’s early study implies—as well as important subgroup variation in

mortality rates. Using a different, complementary data source, the present study attempts

to flesh out the long-term effects of Vietnam draft eligibility on mortality outcomes using

a variation of the Vietnam draft lottery technique adapted from Hearst et al. (1986).iv



Data and Methods

Our data come from the National Center for Health Statistics multiple cause of death file,

1989-2002. This file contains all deaths processed by the NCHS for each calendar year.

For the time period 1989-2002, all deaths in the United States were processed by the

NCHS. Each record in the multiple cause file contains background information on the

decedent taken from the decedent’s U.S. Standard Certificate of Death including race,

sex, and level of education as well as the decedent’s day, month, and year of birth. The

file also contains information on underlying cause of death.v

       Due to problems with the assignments of lottery numbers prior to 1970vi, we

restrict our analyses to those decedents born between 1950 and 1952. To further ensure

comparability of our analyses across birth cohorts, we use only the data years for each

birth cohort corresponding to ages 39-49 (e.g. data years 1989-1999 for the 1950 birth

cohort). Thus, our sample includes a total of 372,128 decedents including 246,504 males

and 125,624 females. Of these decedents, 245,088 are non-Hispanic whites, 89,589 are

non-Hispanic blacks, and 27,947 are Hispanic with a remaining 9,504 classified as non-

Hispanic “other” on the U.S. Standard Death Certificate.

       Using publicly available records of the Vietnam-era lottery resultsvii, we begin by

assigning each decedent, females included, the random sequence number or draft lottery




                                                                                           8
number corresponding to his or her date of birth. We then calculate the observed

proportion of draft eligible and draft ineligible male and female decedents based on the

highest draft lottery number called to report for a given draft year. In 1950, for instance,

the highest draft lottery number called to report was 195. Thus, all decedents with a

lottery number below or equal to the eligibility cutoff are coded one for draft eligible, and

all of those decedents above the 195 cutoff are coded zero as draft ineligible. Expected

proportions for each draft eligible birth cohort are given in Table 1.

        We next calculate the frequencies of draft eligible and ineligible males and

females as a proportion of all male and female decedents. For example, for draft eligible

men we compute




(1)



where pEM is the observed proportions of draft eligible male decedents out of the total

number of male decedents in our “sample”. Again, we proceed by calculating these

relative frequencies for each of the four groups--draft eligible and ineligible men and

women--using the equation (1) specified above.

        After each relative frequency has been calculated for draft eligible and ineligible

men and women for a variety of subgroups, we utilize an estimation strategy that deploys

two counterfactuals to assess excess mortality among draft eligible men. First, we

compare the observed proportion of draft eligible males to the observed proportion of

draft eligible females. Women, logically, should not demonstrate a “draft effect”. That

is, there is no reason to expect that any fertility difference by birth date differed


                                                                                               9
significantly by sex and thus any significant difference between the proportions of draft

eligible males and draft eligible females may thus indicate a “draft exposure” effect.

       Our second comparison utilizes information on the proportion of draft eligible

birth dates in each draft lottery calendar year to detect excess mortality among draft

eligible men. We do this by comparing the observed proportion of draft eligible males

(pDEM) to the expected or theoretical proportion of draft eligible males given the

proportion of males draft eligible for each birth cohortviii. Thus, we compute the

proportion of expected draft eligible men as




(2)



where max1950 represents the highest lottery number called to serve for the 1950 birth

cohort and days1950 represents the number of days in the 1950 calendar year. The

difference between the observed proportion of draft eligible males minus the expected

proportion of draft eligible males (      -      ) yields our estimate of excess mortality.

Again, we may test the difference of proportions to assess the significance of the draft

exposure effect.

       Since previous research has turned up evidence to suggest that a draft exposure

effect may be most pronounced for certain causes of death, we repeat both of the above

counterfactual analyses by a variety of causes that have been linked to military combat.

These causes include malignant neoplasms (cancer), ischemic heart disease, chronic liver

disease and cirrhosis, motor vehicle accidents, and suicide. (See Appendix A for coding

decisions.)


                                                                                           10
          As a final specification check, we run several regression discontinuity (RD)

models that regress the frequency of deaths by draft number on draft number in both

linear and quadratic form for each birth cohort. Thus we estimate:




 (3) ŷ = β 0 + β1DRAFTNUM + β 2 DRAFTNUM + β 3ELIGIBLE + β 4 MONTH
                                         2




where the right-hand side variables are draft number in both linear and quadratic form, a

dummy variable indicator for eligibility status (ELIGIBLE) and, as a robustness check, a

vector of dummy variables for month of birth (MONTH).



Results

We begin with results for our first counterfactual, which compares the observed

proportion of draft eligible men to the proportion of draft eligible women for our sample

overall and for a variety of subgroups. As shown in Table 2, our first comparison turns

up only slight evidence for a draft exposure effect. The results for the combined sample

are largely insignificant with one exception--decedents with thirteen or more years of

education. In this case, the proportion of draft eligible male decedents is larger than the

proportion of draft eligible female decedents indicating a slight draft exposure effect.

Highly educated draft eligible male decedents thus exhibit excess mortality of about

1.17% compared to draft eligible females.



                                      <<Table 2 Here>>




                                                                                         11
       We next present results for our second counterfactual. Again, for this comparison

we calculate the observed proportion of draft eligible male decedents, as above, and the

theoretical proportion of draft eligible males based on the highest called draft lottery

number for each birth cohort. Table 3 presents the results for the sample overall as well

as for a variety of subgroups. Here, too, we find little evidence of a draft exposure effect

in the form of excess (or reduced) mortality amongst draft eligible male decedents. The

one exception is a slight but statistically significant mortality reduction for male

decedents with twelve years of schooling or less.



                                     <<Table 3 Here>>



       Finally, we conclude our counterfactual analysis with results by particular causes

of death. Even though our previous analyses turned up little evidence to indicate a draft

exposure effect, it could be the case that exposure to the draft elevated (or reduced) the

probability of mortality due to certain conditions as research by Hearst et al. (1986)

suggests.

       Table 4 presents results for each unique cause of death for the first comparison,

males versus females. We here find no evidence of elevated (or reduced) mortality for

draft eligible men for any of the particular causes of death that have previously been

linked to Vietnam combat.       The differences between draft eligible males and draft

eligible females for each cause are small and statistically insignificant.

       Lastly, Table 5 displays the cause of death results for the second counterfactual,

which compares the observed proportion of draft eligible male decedents in our sample to




                                                                                         12
a theoretical or expected proportion of draft eligible decedents based upon the highest

lottery number called to report for service. Here, too, we find no evidence of a draft

exposure effect on eligible male decedents. All of the calculated differences are small

and statistically insignificant.



                                   <<Tables 4 & 5 Here>>

        Finally, estimation of several regression discontinuity models corroborates the

results of our counterfactual analyses.ix There appears to be no draft exposure effect for

any of the 1950-1952 birth cohorts even after controlling for month of birth and adding

an interaction term for draft eligibility and birth year.

Discussion and Conclusion

Given the considerable difficulties involved in identifying a true treatment effect of

military conscription, our study contributes to a growing body of knowledge about the

long-term health consequences of service in general and service during the Vietnam era

in particular. Using a novel estimation strategy, we have assessed--and detected very

little--excess mortality for the 1950-1952 draft lottery cohorts.

        In contrast to the work by Hearst et al (1986), we find little convincing evidence

of a lasting draft eligibility effect on the Vietnam era birth cohorts. Our analysis

indicates that, even after controlling for a variety of potential confounders such as

education and nativity status, mortality for the draft eligible population appears

unaffected compared to both the expected proportion of eligible males by birth date and

the female population. Similarly, analyses by underlying cause of death turned up little




                                                                                         13
evidence that exposure to the draft may have elevated mortality due to, for example,

suicide or motor vehicle accidents.

      Coupled with recent null findings by Angrist and Chen (2008) on the long-term

consequences of Vietnam service, our analysis suggests that the short-term elevation in

mortality rates following combat may have dissipated over time or, alternately, may have

been remnants of sampling (in the case of Hearst et al [1986]) or study design (in the case

of Boehmer et al [2004]). More importantly, however, the absence of a long-term effect

of conscription on mortality for the Vietnam cohorts may imply that the deleterious

effects of military service on health have been greatly overstated.

        Since such labor market losses and deleterious health effects of military service in

general and combat in particular have long justified the state’s role in compensating

veterans for their sacrifices in the line of duty, these null findings are of significant

theoretical and policy importance. As Skocpol (1992; 1993) and others have argued, the

introduction of generous pensions to both Union Army veterans and their families may

have actually preceded benefits granted to industrial wage-earners, long considered the

primary beneficiaries of modern welfare state. Beyond pensions, however, other scholars

have recognized military service as one of the most important pathways to claims based

on citizenship. As Gifford notes, “as a service to the state itself, and typically imbued

with notions of patriotism, valor, and self-sacrifice, military service is an unambiguous

citizenship-defining experience” (2003: 25-6). In the language of T.H. Marshall (1950),

military service has historically guaranteed veterans not only civil and political rights but

social rights as well. It is in this context that sorting out the causal impact of service,

particularly during a conflict as controversial and consequential as the Vietnam War and




                                                                                              14
particularly on an outcome as important as mortality, becomes especially important in

order to weigh political and economic claims made by veterans and their representatives.




ENDNOTES


i For the purposes of this study, we restrict our analysis of the effects of military service

to male veterans simply because during the Vietnam-era an overwhelming majority of

military personnel were men (Kulka et al. 1990).


ii The first draft lottery held on December 1, 1969 actually assigned all men born

between 1944-1950 order of induction numbers. However, for reasons explained below,

we deal only with the 1950-1953 cohorts.


iii Men available for immediate military service were classified as 1-A and conscientious

objectors to military training and combat were classified as 1-A-O or “conscientious

objector.”


iv It is complementary in that the Census measures men still alive and residing in the

United States while the death records we use those who died in the U.S. The Census-

approach might overstate the effect of military conscription since it would count those

who fled to Canada and did not return as dead, while our approach would underestimate

an effect since those who fled to Canada would appear to still be living since they would




                                                                                           15
not appear in U.S. death records. This is not so much of a concern in the end since we

arrive at similar results, at least with respect to the overall impact.


v For data years 1989-1998, underlying cause of death is coded using the International

Classification of Diseases (ICD) 9th Revision. In 1999, the NCHS began implementation

of the updated ICD 10th Revision. Thus to ensure comparability across data years, we

code the underlying cause of death for all years based on the 34-category classification of

the ICD-9.


vi The 1970 draft lottery also applied to men born between 1944 and 1949, but most of

these veterans had already entered the service prior to the lottery drawing. Thus, the

remaining men eligible for induction under the 1970 lottery may not constitute a

representative sample as Angrist (1990) indicates.


vii See http://www.sss.gov/lotter1.htm.

viii
       viii This comparison assumes that birth dates are uniformly distributed across the

calendar year and thus any differences by lottery number are due to an eligibility effect

rather than variation in fertility rates. Hence we also use an alternate “check” using the

male-female comparison, which should implicitly correct for the possibility of varying

fertility rates.
