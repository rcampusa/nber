Disability benefit recipients in the United States have nearly doubled in the past two decades,
growing substantially faster than the population. It is difficult to estimate how much of this
increase is explained by changes in population health, as we often lack a valid counterfactual. We
propose using undocumented immigrants as the counterfactual, as they cannot currently claim
benefits. Using NHIS microdata, we estimate models of disability as a function of medical
conditions for both the legal and undocumented populations. The relationship between health and
disability is far stronger for those with legal status than it is for those who are undocumented. We
find that almost all of the difference in disability trends between the two populations can be
explained by different responses to underlying health impairments.

I. Introduction

       Disability claims have nearly doubled in the past two decades (Social Security 2017a),

even though the size of the working age (16+) population only increased by 25% and the size of

the population aged 55+ increased by 67% (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2017).

       There are two explanations for the sizable increase in the size of the disability rolls: 1) it

is the product of both an aging population and decreasing overall health; and/or 2) it is the result

of lowering the minimum threshold of health limitations required for individuals to claim and be

awarded disability benefits (Autor and Duggan 2006; Liebman 2015; Mueller, Rothstein, and

von Wachter 2016; Gelber, Moore, and Stand 2017; Milligan and Schirle 2017). This latter

hypothesis, of course, encompasses both the increased use of the program by those who are

somewhat disabled but still able to engage in productive employment, as well as outright fraud

by the nondisabled.

       To unambiguously distinguish between these two hypotheses, we need to establish what

the disability rolls would have looked like in a counterfactual world. This counterfactual scenario

would help us document what those persons who now receive disability benefits would have

done had the disability program not been an option. Would they still be unable to work due to

their poor health? Or would the lack of disability benefits persuade them to take a job despite

their physical limitations?

       In this paper, we propose a novel technique that allows us to distinguish between the two

possibilities. In particular, we use the foreign-born undocumented population residing in the

United States to create a counterfactual sample of physically disabled persons who, by law, do

not qualify for disability benefits. This eligibility provision has been enforced strictly in recent




                                                  1
years, especially since the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 requires proof of citizenship when

applying (Sommers 2010).

        The Department of Homeland Security estimates that 11.4 million undocumented persons

lived in the United States in January 2012 (DHS, 2017). These individuals reside in many of the

same labor markets as the persons who have legal status (including of course, the native born,

“green card” holders, and naturalized citizens), yet they are unable to claim public disability

benefits. The sample of undocumented persons allows us to estimate a model that can be used to

predict if a disabled person would work in the absence of social insurance programs. We can

then use this model to establish if the “exodus” of persons from the labor force to the disability

rolls was the result of decreasing health in the population or the lowering requirements needed to

qualify for disability benefits.

        In addition to providing a new way of examining the long-standing question of why the

disability rolls have increased dramatically, our analysis also provides the first credible

measurement of the health status of the large undocumented population in the United States. Past

research on immigrants (which typically include both legal immigrants as well as the

undocumented) concludes that they tend to have lower disability rates and use fewer disability

services than natives (Benjamin et al., 2000), but are more likely to receive disability payments

when they live near others of their ethnic group who have higher take-up rates (Furtado and

Theodoropoulos, 2016). This research has not examined the difference in disability rates between

documented and undocumented immigrants because of the inherent difficulties associated with

identifying undocumented status in microdata.

        In recent years, however, there has been progress in developing methods that impute the

undocumented status of foreign-born persons in micro data sets, such as the Current Population




                                                  2
Surveys. These attempts build on the framework first developed by Warren and Passel (1987),

and since adopted by the Department of Homeland Security, to estimate the size of the

undocumented population. In particular, Passel and Cohn (2014) develop an algorithm that

identifies persons in the micro surveys who are likely to be legal immigrants (e.g., naturalized

citizens, refugees, persons who are married to either citizens or permanent residents, etc.), and

define the residual group of foreign-born persons as “likely undocumented.” Borjas (2017a)

applied this algorithm to examine differences in labor supply among the various populations in

the post-1994 CPS files that contain the requisite background information for foreign-born

persons.

       Although much of the existing literature on the health of the immigrant population

(Giuntella and Stella, 2016; Akbulut-Yuksel and Kugler, 2016) does not differentiate between

the legal and undocumented groups, we know of three papers where the difference is explored.

Goldman, Smith, and Sood (2006) use an algorithm where noncitizen foreign-born survey

respondents who did not answer yes to having at least one of a permanent resident card, green

card, or document allowing them to stay in the U.S. for a limited time were classified as

“undocumented”. This analysis, however, uses the 2000 Los Angeles Family and Neighbor

Survey, which although having detailed information on respondents’ legal and visa status, covers

only one city and has a relatively small sample size.

       The other two papers use variations of the Passel-Cohn residual method, albeit with fewer

variables and reasons for excluding a foreign-born person from the undocumented population.

Stimpson, Wilson, and Su (2013), uses matched National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)-

Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data to study the per-capita health spending of undocumented

immigrants, and find that it is an order of magnitude smaller than that of the native born.




                                                 3
Similarly, Pourat, Wallace, Hadler, and Ponce (2014), use the 2009 California Health Interview

Survey (CHIS) to examine health care consumption among undocumented immigrants, and find

that undocumented immigrants consume substantially less health care than either natives or legal

immigrants. Neither of these studies, however, examine disability status in the undocumented

immigrant population.

       Further, none of the existing studies use the perspective of viewing the undocumented

immigrant population as a counterfactual for the legal immigrant and native-born populations.

This is a key contribution of our study, as many of the other studies on disability benefits cited

above have lacked a counterfactual for what disability rates would have been in the complete

absence of benefits. Some studies have instead exploited kinks in the Disability Insurance

benefits formula (Gelber, Moore, and Strand 2017) or variations in benefit durations of other

programs, such as Unemployment Insurance (Mueller, Rothstein, and von Wachter 2016). Both

of these studies provide less opportunity to measure the extensive margin, i.e., how does

eligibility affect whether an individual claims benefits at all?

       Our analysis, therefore, extends the literature by applying the residual method of

identifying undocumented status to the National Health Insurance Survey (NHIS) and addresses

three related issues: 1) we compare the health and disability status of undocumented immigrants

to both legal immigrants and the native population; (2) we exploit the available information on

disability, employment, and health to determine what share of disabled workers would actually

be employed if the disability benefits were not available; and (3) we estimate the cost to the

disability program of an “amnesty” that would regularize the status of undocumented immigrants

and give them full access to disability benefits.




                                                    4
II. Data

       We use publicly available microdata from the National Health Interview Survey for the

post-1997 period. The NHIS is an annual, repeated cross-section, household-level survey of

about 40,000 households, containing 100,000 individuals per year. For most households, a

sample adult and a sample child are interviewed in greater depth, and the questions asked for this

subsample contain the information needed to determine both immigration status and specific

health conditions. These sample adults and children also report scaled-up survey weights so that

they can be used to produce nationally representative estimates of the entire population. It is

worth noting that the NHIS samples are sufficiently large to allow a statistically reliable estimate

of the undocumented population.

       Our analysis of the link between health conditions and disability status focuses on a set of

specific health problems: heart disease, cancer, diabetes, hypertension, asthma, emphysema, liver

disease, joint pain, ulcers, and bronchitis. We focus on this subset because these are the health

impairments used by the Social Security Administration to determine whether an individual is

disabled (Social Security 2017b). One important caveat is that all the health conditions in the

NHIS microdata are self-reported, and self-reported health issues may not be unbiased measures

of the actual underlying health conditions (Johnston, Propper, and Shields 2009). While using a

data set such as the National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES), which provides objective

measures of health status, would correct for the self-reporting bias, the NHANES lacks the

variables that are necessary to identify undocumented immigrants. In addition, the smaller

sample size in the NHANES would make it nearly impossible to conduct our empirical analysis.

       Our measure of a person’s disability status is based on the NHIS variable that reports

information for why an individual did not work in the week before the interview. While the




                                                 5
specific response categories are not entirely consistent over the survey years, our initial strategy

is to classify a person as disabled if he or she lists one of the following as the main reason for not

working in the reference week: “unable to work for health reasons”, “temporarily unable to work

for health reasons”, or “disabled”. We use this variable to define disability status, instead of the

variables for receipt of disability benefits, because undocumented immigrants do not qualify for

disability benefits. We will use the benefit information to differentiate legal immigrants from

undocumented immigrants

       Our imputation of undocumented status applies the methods developed by Passel and

Cohn (2014), as adapted by Borjas (2017a; 2017b) to the 1994-2015 Current Population Surveys.

In rough terms, we use a set of characteristics that suggest that a foreign-born person in the

survey is likely to be a legal immigrant. Such “signals” would include whether the person

entered the country as a refugee, whether the person works in an occupation that requires

licensing, whether the person receives specific types of public assistance, or whether the person

has a family relationship that grants them legal status (e.g., married to a US citizen). The residual

sample of foreign-born persons then composes the sample of undocumented immigrants.

       The NHIS was substantially redesigned in 1997, so that our empirical analysis uses only

the data drawn from the post-1997 surveys. In addition, two of the annual surveys lack some of

the information required to impute undocumented status at the micro level. In particular, the

1997 survey does not report if the person is a naturalized citizen, and the 2004 lacks a variable

reporting a person’s Hispanic ethnicity, which necessary to identify immigrants from Cuba (who

are all legal because they are admitted as refugees). As a result, our analysis uses the 1998-2003

and 2005-2015 NHIS cross-sections.

       Table 1 reports the number of observations affected by each subsequent restriction used




                                                  6
to classify foreign-born persons into the two groups of legal and undocumented immigrants. Out

of the 1.6 million observations in the NHIS Sample Adult and Sample Child files over the years

used in our study, 1.3 million are native born and another 100,000 are naturalized citizens. A

sizable number of the remaining non-citizens receive government benefits (which are typically

available only to legal immigrant)1, or are married to US citizens, or are the children or

grandchildren of someone with legal status.2 Because of the family preference system that

regulates U.S. immigration policy since 1965, these family connections imply that the NHIS

respondent will likely be a legal immigrant. After imposing all the restrictions used by the

imputation method, we are left with a population estimate of 12.7 million undocumented persons

in the typical sample year of the NHIS (or roughly about 6,100 observations per year).

                       Figure 1 contrasts our estimates of the number of undocumented immigrants with the

official DHS estimates. Although the two estimates are reasonably close to each other, follow the

same upward trend in the 2000-2007 period, and are both roughly constant in the 2007-2011

period, it is notable that the imputation method in the NHIS leads to about 1 million more

undocumented persons in a given year. Using the CPS, Passel and Cohn (2014, p. 48) report a

similar tendency for the imputation method to “overcount” the number of undocumented

persons. They then use a “probabilistic method” to correct for the overcount and reweigh the

sample so that the weighted number of undocumented immigrants is, by construction, exactly

equal to the DHS official statistic. To make our analysis transparent and fully reproducible, we

do not make any adjustments to the sample weights in the NHIS and simply note that the trends

illustrated in Figure 1 suggest that the persons that we impute to be undocumented seem to

correctly summarize key trends in the undocumented population.

       We limit much of the regression reported below to persons aged 18-65. There are

extremely few individuals aged 65+ in the NHIS sample that our algorithm labels as

undocumented, and therefore we lack the statistical power to draw robust conclusions for the

elderly sample. Second, substantial government benefits (i.e., Medicare and Social Security)

phase in for the vast majority of legal immigrants at age 65. This would exacerbate differences

between the two groups in claiming disability status as there is a substantial break in the types of

benefits available to the two elderly groups.

       Table 2 reports summary statistics for many of the variables used in our empirical

analysis. It is evident that undocumented immigrants self-report themselves to be far healthier

than both legal immigrants and the native born. In particular, they are less likely to suffer from

any of the dozen medical conditions that we use in our analysis. The probability that an

undocumented immigrant suffers from any of the dozen ailments is only 25%, as compared to

41% percent for a legal immigrant and 54% for someone who is native born. Undocumented

immigrants are also 5 years younger and have much less education. In particular, 45 percent of

the undocumented immigrants lack a high school diploma, as compared to only about 12 percent

of the legal immigrants and 11 percent of the native born.

         We can use the self-reported measures for the various medical conditions in the NHIS to

construct a variable that summarizes the overall health status of the undocumented and the

pooled native born and legal immigrant populations. In particular, we aggregate across the

  Throughout this paper, we pool the native born and legal immigrants. In the appendix, we repeat our analysis
comparing undocumented immigrants to native born and legal immigrants separately, and find broadly comparable
results.

  The modification is due to a lack of data on all of the component diagnoses. This is necessary because the index
was designed to work with hospital discharge data that contains ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes, as opposed to survey data
regarding broad categories. As with the original index, we assign one point for 1 point for each of the following
conditions: myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, chronic lung disease, connective
tissue disease, or ulcer. We assign 1.5 points for diabetes (since in the unmodified index diabetes is 1 point and
whereas diabetes with end organ damage is 2 points). We assign 2 points for liver disease (chronic liver disease is 1
point in the unmodified index and moderate and severe liver disease is 3), or moderate or severe kidney disease. We
assign 4 points for cancer (as cancer/tumor is 2 points in the original index and malignant tumor/metastatis is 6). We
do not have any data on the other components of the index (peripheral vascular disease, dementia, AIDS, or
Hemiplegia/paraplegia) and omit them from our modified index here.

immigrants rises rapidly after about age 45. Interestingly, the overall health of undocumented

persons also worsens as the population ages, but the rate at which the medical conditions worsen

is not as steep for the undocumented. It seems, therefore that the undocumented are healthier

(relative to the the pooled native born and legal immigrants) particularly as the groups approach

retirement age.

IV. Results

                           It is instructive to begin our analysis of the link between employment and disability status

by contrasting the trends in the number of disabled persons as we have defined them in the NHIS

and the number of disabled persons receiving Social Security Disability benefits (SSDI) or

Supplemental Security Income (SSI) (or at least one). Figure 3 illustrates several trends,

revealing that all measures have been increasing rapidly

                                                                   12
       The NHIS data, where disability is defined by the number of persons who did not work in

the reference week due to health reasons, typically indicates about twice as many disabled

persons as the number of persons who actually receive either type of disability benefits, whether

from the NHIS data or from the official Social Security Administration (SSA) data. In 2010, for

example, our definition of disability in the NHIS data implies a count of 16 million persons

disabled. This contrasts with the 8 million or the 7 million that the official SSA data or the NHIS,

respectively, report as receiving Social Security disability benefits.

       The “excess” number of disabled persons given by our definition is not surprising. Our

count includes not only the persons receiving disability benefits, but also the legal immigrants

and natives who are unable to work for health-related reasons but do not receive benefits, as well

as the undocumented persons who are ineligible for benefits. Note also that the NHIS estimates

of the number of persons receiving benefits are of the same order of magnitude as the estimates

from the SSA data, although the NHIS estimates are somewhat lower.

       Our regression model predicts the probability that a person is disabled based on his or her

self-reported medical conditions and on a vector of socioeconomic characteristics. The model is

given by:

     (Pr yiaeqy  1)  F (  γD iaeqy  age a  education e  quarter q  year y  genderi   iaeqy )

where y is a dummy variable indicating if individual i, in age bracket a, with educational

attainment e, surveyed in year y and quarter q, is disabled. The vector D contains dummy

variables giving the medical conditions used by the Social Security Administration to evaluate

disability status: heart disease, cancer, diabetes, hypertension, asthma, emphysema, liver disease,

joint pain, ulcer, and bronchitis (Social Security 2017b). Finally, the age, education, quarter,




                                                    13
and year variables and are vectors of fixed effects for 10-year age brackets, educational

attainment brackets, survey quarter, survey year, and gender, respectively.

        We use three alternative functional forms for the distribution function F: a linear

probability model, a probit function, and a logit function. Our results are not sensitive to the

choice of the distribution function. Table 3 reports the marginal effects (dy/dx) for each medical

condition across the alternative statistical specifications when we estimate the regression model

using the pooled sample of legal immigrants and native born. It is evident that all medical

conditions increase the probability that a person did not work in the reference week due to health

reasons, and all of the effects are statistically significant.

       We re-estimated the regression model using the sample of undocumented persons, and

Table 4 reports the relevant coefficients. Table 4 again shows that all of the coefficients are

positive and statistically significant. The OLS results in column 1 are somewhat less significant

than in Table 3, but this is probably because the linear probability model is misspecified (after

all, the mean disability rate for undocumented persons is only 1.4 percent).

       To summarize the implications of the two regression models we perform an Oaxaca-

Blinder decomposition (Oaxaca 1973; Blinder 1973). This exercise decomposes differences in an

outcome between two groups into what can be explained by differences in the levels of a set of

common covariates as opposed to differences in the coefficients on those covariates. For

example, in the linear model, if

                                            yL  Lx L
                                            yU  U x U

meaning that average outcome variable for each group (legal/native born and undocumented)

equals the coefficient vector for that group times the vector of the average of each covariate. We

can then subtract one equation from the other, add zero, rearrange, and factor:

The first set of terms on the right-hand side of the equation tells us how much of the difference is

due to the difference in covariates, given the lower set of coefficients. The second set of terms

tells us how much of the difference is due to the difference in coefficients, given the actual

covariate levels of the higher group. The third term represents the interaction of the two

differences. The Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, therefore, helps us determine the extent to

which the difference in disability rates between the pooled native born and legal immigrant and

undocumented samples arises because the two groups have different underlying health

conditions, or because, for a given set of medical conditions, the two groups are behaving

differently in terms of how they approach the work decision.

       Table 5 summarizes the decompositions. In all cases, the difference in the regression

coefficients (i.e., how much each condition increases the propensity of an individual to report

being disabled according to legal status) explain about 75 percent of the variation in the mean

disability rate, whereas the differences in endowments (i.e., that the undocumented population is

younger and healthier) only explains about 25%. In short, the different disability rates between

the two groups is mostly attributable to the fact that adverse medical conditions are far less likely

to lead to withdrawal from the labor force in the undocumented sample than in the pooled native

born and legal immigrant sample.5

        An equally interesting application of our regression models is to use the regression model

for one group to predict the trend in the disability rate of the other group. In other words, what

would the trend in the disability rate of the legal immigrant population look like if they

responded to medical conditions in the same way as observationally equivalent undocumented

immigrants? Or what would be the trend in the disability rate of undocumented workers if they

responded to adverse medical conditions in the same way as observationally equivalent legal

immigrants?

 This result is consistent with Borjas (2017a), which finds the labor supply curve of undocumented workers to be
substantially inelastic.

            This counterfactual analysis helps us address two crucial questions: 1) How much would

the reported disability rate drop if the native born and immigrants with legal status could not

claim benefits?, and 2) How much would the reported disability rate of undocumented persons

rise if they could claim benefits? This exercise allows us to estimate both extensive margins: the

impact of the removal of benefits and the impact of the introduction of benefits. This is contrast

to previous studies (Mueller, Rothstein, and von Wachter 2016; Gelber, Moore, and Stand 2017;

Milligan and Schirle 2017) have mostly focused on the intensive margin (i.e., changes in the

generosity of benefit) or the interaction with other programs (e.g., unemployment insurance).

            Figure 4 shows the actual and predicted disability rates for the legal immigrant and native

born population. The figure illustrates two alternative measures of the predicted disability rate.

First, the disability rate as predicted by the regression model fitted on data from the legal


                                                    19
immigrant population. Second, the disability rate as predicted by the model fitted using the

sample of undocumented persons.

       It is visually obvious that the two trend lines corresponding to the actual disability rates

and those predicted from the “own” regression model are very close to each other, and show the

substantial upward trend in disability rates described earlier and shown in Figure 3. In contrast,

the trend predicted from the regression model estimated in the sample of undocumented persons

shows both a lower overall disability level and no noticeable time trend. In other words, if the

legal immigrants behaved as if they were undocumented workers (and lacked access to disability

benefits), they would be far less likely to be absent from work due to health reasons, and we

would not have witnessed the substantial increase in the disability rate of this population.

       We repeated this exercise to illustrate the actual and predicted disability for the

undocumented population. Figure 5 shows that the actual level of the disability rate for

undocumented immigrants is quite low, has no time trend, and is very well predicted by our

regression model.

       In contrast, when we use the regression model fitted in the pooled native born and legal

immigrant population, the predicted disability rate for undocumented persons is markedly higher

and shows a noticeable upward time trend. Put differently, if the undocumented workers behaved

as if they were legal immigrants (partly because they become eligible for disability benefits),

their disability rate would increase by about 6 percentage points, and that disability rate would

have almost doubled from about 4 percent to 8 percent between 1997 and 2015.

V. Robustness checks

            We now address the sensitivity of the evidence by including additional health conditions

in the analysis, examining the results in sub-populations of immigrants, and replicating the

analysis in two alternative data sets, the California Health Insurance Survey (CHIS) and the

CPS-ASEC. These sensitivity tests show that our evidence is robust. Undocumented immigrants

are healthier than the legal population at every age, and disability rates would be far lower today,

with no upward trend in the past two decades, had the Social Security disability program not

existed.

            We first replicate the Oaxaca-Blinder using many more measures of health status beyond

those used by the Social Security Administration (2017b) in determining disability status. Table

A-1 shows the results. The first column replicates the evidence from our earlier analysis. The


                                                   21
second column adds the following health conditions to the vector of health variables: heart

attack, angina, other heart disease, stroke, and kidney disease. Finally, the last column of the

table adds indicators for different types of common cancers, including breast, cervical, colon,

kidney, leukemia, lung, lymphoma, thyroid, and uterine cancers. The evidence from the most

complete specification shows that the share of the difference explained by coefficients declines

only from 83.2 to 80.6 percent. In short, the difference in disability rates between undocumented

persons and the “legal” population, whether legal immigrants or legal immigrants and natives, is

explained mostly by differences in the coefficients that determine disability status. In other

words, the undocumented have lower disability rates not because they tend to be healthier on

average, but because they respond differently to the underlying health conditions.

        We now conduct several placebo comparisons to again illustrate the robustness of the key

evidence. In particular, we first compare two groups who should not have any difference in the

ability to claim disability benefits: native-born and legal immigrants who came into the country

as children.6 We estimated the disability regressions in each of these two groups, and then

predicted what the disability rate would have been had natives (or legal immigrants) responded

to health conditions as did the legal immigrants (or natives). As Figures A1 and A2 show, the

trends in disability rates are essentially similar, so that the status of being native versus being a

legal immigrant who entered the country as a child provides no information whatsoever about

disability rates. We also compared two alternative groups who should not qualify for benefits:

legal immigrants who entered the country recently (up to 5 years prior to the survey) and


6
  The categories for NHIS’s variable for years in the US are: <1, 1-4, 5-9, 10-14, and 15 or more. To be
conservative as to whether an immigrant came as a minor, we subtracted the lower bound of each category from the
individual’s age. We categorized an individual as immigrating as a minor if this result was less than 18.
Additionally, given that the NHIS variable for years spent in the US topcodes at 15 years, we cannot determine
whether a legal immigrant came as a minor not if that individual is older than 32. Therefore, Figures A3 and A4
repeat figures A1 and A2 for only those 18-32. This also results in us dropping the age bucket dummy variables
from this entire analysis, with the exception of the one for 18-27 (vs. 28+).


                                                       22
undocumented immigrants. As Figures A5 and A6 show, the trend in disability rates in these two

groups is again quite similar.

       In short, the analysis of alternative placebos—in one case, both groups can claim

benefits, and in the second case, neither group can claim benefits—shows that the evidence

reported in the previous section arise specifically because we are comparing two populations that

have different access to the Social Security disability system.

       Next, following Pourat, Wallace, Hadler, and Ponce (2014), we re-estimated our

regression models using CHIS (2017). It is much more difficult to apply the method that imputes

undocumented status in microdata in the CHIS data, as there is no information on the rest of a

respondent’s household (and so immigrants with legal spouses, parents, or grandparents cannot

be dropped) and there are only extremely broad occupation and industry codes (limiting

dropping those in licensed occupations). Additionally, many of the variables for medical

conditions are entirely missing or only exist in certain years of the data.

       We address this data problem by including two dummy variables for each conditions: one

for whether the individual has it (as in our analysis of the NHIS data) and one for whether there

is no information available for that condition for that individual. This causes the model to be

more unstable, and it only converges for a probit specification. Nevertheless, in Figure A12 we

show that our age/health profile result holds (where the legal and native born population is sicker

at every age). In Table A5 we shown that our Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition result (that the

difference is coming from the coefficients) also holds. In Figures A13 and A14 we show that as

above predicting for the legal population using the undocumented model reduced the level and

removes the trend, and vice versa increases the level and introduces a trend.

       Finally, we also check our results using the CPS ASEC data from IPUMS (Flood et al.




                                                 23
2017), as used in Borjas (2017a; 2017b). First, given the large sample, with reasonable

confidence we can check the sums of survey weights for undocumented immigrants for

California against the sums of survey weights for the CHIS data. This result is in Figure A15.

While the trends over time do not match (likely due the lack of sufficient family and occupation

variables in the CHIS data), the levels are reasonably comparable.

       Repeating our results without information on specific health conditions forces us to use

the single variable for self-reported health status, in addition to the demographic and time

controls used above. Nevertheless, we repeated the logistic regressions from above of disability

status (defined by not working for reasons of illness or disability) on these variables. We then

used the coefficients from those two regressions to predict the two counterfactuals described

above. Figures A16 and A17 show the results of this analysis, which are largely consistent with

Figures 4 and 5 above.

VI. Discussion and Implications

       We can use the estimates from our analysis of the NHIS data to quantify the answers to

our questions: (1) What would be the cost savings if disability rates were reduced to the risk-

adjusted levels that would be seen if the disability benefits were not available? And (2) what

would the cost to the disability program of an “amnesty” that would regularize the status of

undocumented immigrants and give them full access to disability benefits?

       Table 6 shows the each element of our calculation:

    Total annual savings                                   =$77 billion ( $6.49 billion * 12)

In 2015 (the last year of NHIS data used in our analysis), the sum of the survey weights

corresponds to 187 million native born and legal immigrants ages 18-65. Figure 4 shows the

disability dropping from the measured 8.1% (~15.2 million individuals) to only 2.3% (~4.1

million individuals) when the model fitted on the undocumented population is used. Looking in

the NHIS data at the disabled legal and native born population 18-65, in 2015 38.3% receive

SSDI and 26.1% receive SSI.7 In January 2017, the average monthly benefits for SSDI were

$1,171.25 (Social Security 2017a) and for SSI $542.5 (Social Security 2017c). A corresponding

drop in payouts would potentially save $6.5 billion per month ($77 billion per year). In January

2017, approximately $10.3 billion was paid in SSDI (Social Security 2017a) and $4.7 billion in

SSI (Social Security 2017c). So this represents a 43% decline in payouts. That said, there are

    Specifically, these individuals said yes when asked if they received each of Social Security and SSI due to a disability.



                                                              25
likely individuals in an intermediate space where they are not definitely disabled (the 2.3%) nor

in the tail of the 8.1% and claiming fraudulently who would still claim disability status and

benefits in a harsher regime. In other words, while there are some savings to be had, the estimate

of $77 billion is almost certainly an upper bound.

          Another way to look at this is to see that there is no trend in the level of undocumented

for those with legal when predicted from the undocumented model. This suggests that the entire

rise that we’ve seen in the past two decades – from 5.8% to 8.1% - is likely nonessential benefits

and can be explained by changing coefficients, and not by a population that is getting older and

sicker.

          The second exercise, and quite relevant from the current policy discussion about

regularizing the status of undocumented immigrants, is to calculate the increase in payouts if

undocumented individuals were granted legal status. Table 7 shows the each element of our

calculation:

 Total annual cost                             =+$6.1 billion (+$511 million * 12)

The most recent DHS estimate is that there are 11.4 million undocumented immigrants

(Department of Homeland Security 2017), which closely matches the sum of survey weights

from our analysis (11.8 million) and which we use above for consistency. In January 2017, the

average monthly benefits for SSDI were $1,171.25 (Social Security 2017a) and for SSI $542.5

(Social Security 2017c). The predicted increase in the share of undocumented immigrants who

are disabled if they were “treated like” legal immigrants was from 1.3% to 7.2%. Allowing all of

the 7.2% of these individuals to claim benefits (as even the ones who previously reported

disability can now claim) would lead to an increase in federal liabilities of $6.1 billion per year,

which represents an increase of 3.4%. Note, however, that many undocumented immigrants may

already be paying taxes to the disability system but have not qualified for benefits (Goss et al.

2013; Social Security 2015; Gee, Gardner, and Wiehe 2016).

       Finally, we can use our empirical results to answer the opening question of this paper:

how much of the rise in disability rates can be explained by an aging population? A


                                                 27
straightforward way to answer this would be to use the 2015 age distribution (say in 5-year

brackets) of the population but the 1998 disability rates for each of those brackets. Unadjusted,

the disability rate for the 18-65 population (of any immigration status) was 5.6% in 1998 and

7.7% in 2015. If the disability-by-age rates had remained constant but the population had aged,

the predicted rate would have been only 6.2%. So the aging of the population can only explain

29% of the increase. The rest must be due to changes in other factors such as the impact of

medical conditions increase the probability that a person did not work in the reference week due

to health reasons.

VII. Conclusion

        This paper applies newly developed methods that can be used to impute undocumented

status to the foreign-born population to the NHIS micro data. The imputation allows us to

investigate the health of undocumented immigrants, compare their health status to both of

persons legally in the country (both legal immigrants and natives), and allows us to calculate

counterfactuals that help us understand how disability status responds to legal constraints on the

availability of benefits.

        Our empirical analysis reveals that undocumented immigrants are healthier than those

with legal status (either native- or foreign-born) at every age and are less likely to be disabled (in

the sense that a health condition limits work). We also found that the differences in the disability

rates among the various groups can mostly be explained by differences in how medical

conditions, age, and education affect disability status and not by differences in the mean values

of those variables for the groups. In other words, undocumented immigrants are less likely to be

disabled not because they are younger and healthier, but because their labor supply is far less

responsive to those characteristics than they are for persons legally in the country. Put




                                                 28
differently, the relationship between health and disability is stronger for those with legal status

than it is for those who are undocumented.

        We used those insights to construct two counterfactual scenarios: one where the legal

population could not claim disability benefits and one where the undocumented population

could. In the first case, the level of the disability rate for the legal population drops substantially

and there is no longer the upward sloping time trend in disability over the past two decades. In

the second, the level of the disability rate substantially increases and an upward sloping time

trend appears.

        These results suggest two policy applications. The first is that there is likely both

substantial fraud in the current disability benefits system and numerous situations where an

individual with improved economic circumstances could find work. Crafting policy around both

of these outcomes could substantially reduce federal outlays and mitigate the upward-sloping

trend in disability rates.

        The second is that legalizing the undocumented population might be accompanied by a

modest increase in fiscal outlays without a corresponding increase in revenue, as many

undocumented immigrants may be already paying taxes.
