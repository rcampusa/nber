                                             ABSTRACT

There is no evaluation of the consequences of Disability Insurance (DI) receipt that captures the effects
on households' net income and consumption expenditure, family labor supply, or benefits from other
programs. Combining detailed register data from Norway with an instrumental variables approach
based on random assignment to appellant judges, we comprehensively assess how DI receipt affects
these understudied outcomes. To consider the welfare implications of the findings from this instrumental
variables approach, we estimate a dynamic model of household behavior that translates employment,
reapplication and savings decisions into revealed preferences for leisure and consumption. The model-based
results suggest that on average, the willingness to pay for DI receipt is positive and sizable. Because
spousal labor supply strongly buffers the household income and consumption effects of DI allowances,
the estimated willingness to pay for DI receipt is smaller for married than single applicants.

1     Introduction
Over the past 50 years, disability insurance (DI) rolls have risen dramatically in many OECD
countries. In the U.S., SSDI benefits receipt has risen from less than 1 percent to 4.7 percent of
the non-elderly adult population between the program’s inception in 1956 and the present (U.S.
Social Security Administration, 2017). In many European countries, the increases are even more
striking, from 1 percent to 7 percent in the U.K and from 2 percent to almost 10 percent in Norway.
These increases have made DI one of the largest transfer programs in most OECD countries. In
the U.S., for example, outlays for DI exceed those for food stamps, traditional cash welfare, or
the Earned Income Tax Credit.1 For families without small children, DI is often the primary cash
benefit available after unemployment benefits expire, and it has become an increasingly important
component of the social safety net in numerous industrialized countries (OECD, 2010).
    To potentially curtail DI program growth, several countries have significantly tightened disability
screening criteria, and many others are considering similar policies.2 These enhanced gatekeeping
policies can reduce the fiscal burden of disability insurance, both by lowering the DI caseload and by
increasing tax revenue if rejected applicants return to work. At the same time, stricter screening may
result in net welfare losses if individuals and families value public disability insurance at more than
its fiscal cost.3 Assessing this tradeoff requires a comparison of the public costs and private benefits
of DI awards for applicants at the margin of allowance versus denial, since it is their outcomes
that would be changed by shifts in screening stringency. To implement this comparison, we need
data on two economic quantities that are rarely measured: the economic value that individuals and
families place on disability insurance; and the full cost of DI allowances to taxpayers, summing
over DI transfer payments, benefit substitution to or from other transfer programs, and induced
changes in tax receipts. Credibly estimating these quantities is typically hindered both by a lack of
comprehensive linked data measuring these many outcomes, and by the difficulty of distinguishing
the causal effects of DI receipts from the many unobserved factors that simultaneously determine
disability status, earnings, tax payments and transfer receipts, and consumption.
    This paper addresses both the measurement and the identification challenge in the context
of Norway’s DI system, enabling us to offer empirical evidence on the fiscal costs, income and
consumption gains, and welfare consequences of DI receipt. Our work draws on two strengths of
    1
      In 2016 the U.S. paid out $143 billion to 10.6 million disabled workers and their families, with an additional $49
billion in federal SSI payments to blind and disabled workers, and approximately $107 billion on Medicare expenditures
for disabled workers (OASDI Trustees Report, 2017, Table III.A.5; SSI Annual Report, 2017, Table IV.C1; 2017, Table
II.B1). In 2013, DI cash payments constituted 1.4 percent of GDP in the U.S. and 1.7 percent of GDP across the
European OECD-countries (OECD, 2015).
    2
      For example, the U.S. tightened the criteria for new disability awards in the late 1970s and introduced an aggressive
program of continuing disability reviews in 1980; however, Congress responded by halting the reviews and, in 1984,
liberalizing the program’s screening criteria along several dimensions. Another example is the Netherlands: in 1994,
the eligibility criteria were tightened and the growth in DI rolls reversed.
    3
      In the U.S., all private disability insurance is provided through employer-based group policies. These policies
’wrap-around’ the public SSDI system, so that most of the wage insurance risk and all of the medical cost risk is
ultimately borne by the public program (Autor et al. , 2014). There is not a strong standalone private market in
disability insurance, likely because of adverse selection. In the Norwegian setting that we study, private disability
insurance is rare.



                                                            1
the Norwegian environment. First, Norwegian register data allow us to characterize the household
impacts and fiscal costs of disability receipt by linking employment, taxation, benefits receipt, and
assets at the person and household level. Our measure of fiscal costs includes virtually all forms
of government cash transfers and revenues from (direct) taxes, and accounts for changes in labor
supply and substitution to other transfer programs. Our measures of household impacts of DI
receipt include net government transfer payments from all sources, employment and earnings of DI
applicants (both allowed and denied) and their spouses, as well as households’ total income and
measures of their consumption expenditure. Second, we obtain plausibly exogenous variation in DI
allowances by exploiting the random assignment of DI applicants to Norwegian judges who differ
systematically in their leniency. As a measure of judge leniency, we use the average allowance rate
in all other cases a judge has handled. This leniency measure is used as an instrumental variable for
DI receipt, as it is highly predictive of judicial rulings in incumbent cases but uncorrelated with case
characteristics. This instrumental variables approach recovers the causal effects of DI allowance on
individuals at the margin of program entry.
   Our first set of analyses, which estimate the causal effects of DI receipt on earnings, total income,
consumption expenditure, and fiscal costs, yields four main findings. First, granting DI benefits
to applicants on the margin of program entry induces a fall in annual earnings of approximately
$5,200, which is about 45 percent of the annual DI transfer benefit awarded. Second, DI allowances
raise average household income and consumption expenditure by 16 and 18 percent, implying that
DI receipt provides partial consumption smoothing across states of nature for a given individual.
Third, the external costs to taxpayers from providing DI benefits—stemming from transfer payments
and reduced payroll tax revenues—substantially exceed the net increases in household incomes
accruing to DI beneficiaries. Fourth, the consequences of DI allowances differ substantially by
marital status. Among single and unmarried applicants, DI awards have large direct impacts on
household income and consumption expenditure—incrementing each by about 40 percent relative
to baseline. Conversely, DI allowances do not significantly increase the household incomes or the
consumption of married applicants on average; indeed, we can reject positive impacts of more than
nine percent of baseline income. The reason is that spousal labor supply adjustments and benefit
substitution are estimated to offset the effect of DI transfers on household incomes—though we
stress that this does not imply that household welfare is unaffected by these transfers.
   These causal effects estimates provide key data points for a welfare analysis, but they do not
by themselves tell us how much DI allowances affect household welfare, since this also depends on
the preferences for leisure and consumption. To explore these welfare implications, we estimate a
dynamic model of household behavior with heterogeneous, forward-looking individuals. The model
translates employment, savings and reapplication decisions of applicants and their spouses into
revealed preferences for leisure and consumption. Brought to the data, the model matches well the
instrumental variables estimates of the impact of DI allowances, and moreover, provides plausible
parameter estimates for labor supply elasticities. We use the estimated model to compute the welfare
benefits of DI receipt—by which we mean the cash equivalent value of receiving a DI allowance—and



                                                   2
to perform counterfactual analyses that allows us to infer the extent to which the welfare value
of receiving a DI allowance is influenced by household labor supply responses, savings, and the
possibility of reapplying for DI. The model-based results suggest that on average the welfare effect
of DI benefits is positive and sizable, and particularly so for single individuals. Notably, because
spousal labor supply responses provide partial insurance against the impact of DI denials on income
and consumption of married households, the welfare value of DI benefits for married households is
considerably smaller than for single individuals.
    Our paper contributes to an active literature analyzing the economic consequences of public
disability insurance systems (for a review, see Autor & Duggan, 2006; Autor, 2011; Liebman, 2015).
While the core of this literature focuses on the impacts of disability benefits on the employment and
earnings effects of DI allowance, little is known about either the fiscal costs or the household level
effects on labor supply and consumption.4 Meyer & Mok (2013) and Kostol & Mogstad (2015) offer
to our knowledge the only prior study that documents changes in income and consumption that
follow changes in health and disability. Our identification strategy, which uses judge assignments
to isolate quasi-experimental variation in disability allowances, builds on three recent studies using
U.S. data to estimate labor supply impacts of DI receipt.5 Exploiting variation in DI allowances
stemming from differences in disability examiner leniency, Maestas et al. (2013) and Autor et al.
(2017) find that DI receipt substantially reduces earnings and employment of applicants. French &
Song (2013) pursue a similar strategy—using variation in the leniency of appeal judges rather than
initial examiners—and find comparable labor supply effects of DI receipt among appellants.
    Our study makes two contributions to this active literature. It combines quasi-experimental
variation in judicial disability determinations with extensive register data on disability applicants
and household members to provide novel evidence on the income gains, consumption benefits and
fiscal costs of DI receipt. Second, the subsequent structural model estimation offers a welfare
assessment of these findings. Our structural model mirrors the life-cycle model used by Low &
Pistaferri (2015) to analyze the insurance value and incentive costs of DI benefits. We deviate from
Low and Pistaferri in two important ways. While Low and Pisteferri model individual behavior, and
hence do not consider insurance from spousal labor supply, we model household behavior, which is
important given our finding of a strong spousal labor supply response. Specifically, we estimate a
life-cycle model with two earners making consumption and labor supply decisions. Distinct from
Low and Pistaferri, we do not model the pre-application behavior of households, largely because we
do not have health information for people who do not apply for DI. Our goal is therefore limited to
understanding the post-application labor supply, savings, and reapplication decisions of applicants
and their spouses, taking as given their characteristics and economic circumstances at the time of
application. Our counterfactual estimates do not therefore take into account potential changes in

& Mogstad (2014) as well as the methodologically related papers on DI discussed immediately below. See also Autor
& Duggan (2003) and Borghans et al. (2014) for empirical evidence on the interaction between disability insurance
and other transfer programs in the U.S. and Netherlands.

increased DI participation in the next generation.

the number and composition of applicants.
        Our paper also advances understanding of how households respond to shocks to income.6 Most
work in this literature assumes exogenous labor supply, focuses on a single earner, or imposes
restrictions on the nature and type of insurance available to families. A notable exception is Blundell
et al. (2016b), who estimate a life cycle model with two earners jointly making consumption and
labor supply decisions.7 Consistent with our findings, Blundell et al. find an important role for
consumption insurance through household labor supply, while self-insurance through savings and
borrowing matter less. In line with these results, Persson (2015) finds that husbands increase their
labor supply to offset household income losses following the elimination of survivors insurance for
their wives, and Fadlon & Nielsen (2015) find that wives offset income losses following the death of
a spouse through increased labor supply.
        A related literature tests for the added worker effect, that is, an increase in spousal labor supply
induced by negative income shocks to the other spouse (Lundberg, 1985). Cullen & Gruber (2000)
review this literature and highlight the difficulty in drawing credible inferences from observational
data. The key challenge is to locate a plausibly exogenous shock to the income of one spouse
exclusively that does not directly affect the labor supply of the other spouse, thus overcoming the
problem of simultaneity and correlated unobservables among spouses. Our research design resolves
these challenges by identifying a plausibly exogenous income shock (DI allowance) that directly
affects only one member of the household (the DI applicant), thereby providing a strong test of the
added-worker effect.
        The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 reviews the key features regarding
the DI program in Norway, compares the system with the U.S. system, and describes the research
design. Section 3 describes the data and sample restrictions. Section 4 assesses the relevance and
validity of our instrument. Section 5 estimates the causal effect of DI allowance versus denial on
applicant labor earnings and receipt of transfer income. Section 6 analyzes the household impact
and fiscal costs of DI allowances. Section 7 documents that DI allowances affect household income
and consumption differentially according to marital status, and explores how spousal responses to
the allowance decision may help explain this heterogeneity. Section 8 develops and estimates a
structural model of household labor supply and uses these estimates to explore the welfare value of
disability receipt for marginal applicants. The final section concludes.

next document how the DI system generates quasi-random disability allowances for a subset of DI

    A complementary exception is Finkelstein et al. (2015), who directly estimate the insurance value of Medicaid
in-kind public health plan benefits using variation from a randomized controlled trial. Distinct from our focus, their
work (a) abstracts from labor supply considerations since labor supply appears unaffected by Medicaid provision in
their setting (Baicker et al. , 2014); and (b) estimates both the transfer and ex ante insurance values of public benefits
provision, whereas we estimate only the first component.

appellants (i.e., applicants who appeal their initial denial) and explain how our research design uses
this variation to estimate the economic consequences of DI allowances.

The Norwegian DI program

The Norwegian DI program is designed to provide partial earnings replacements to all workers under
the full retirement age who are unable to engage in substantial gainful activity because of a medically
determined physical or mental impairment that has lasted for at least a year.8 The DI program is
part of the broader Social Security System and is financed through employer- and employee-paid
taxes. The level of DI benefits received is determined using a formula based on an individual’s
earnings history. The benefits schedule is progressive, so that low-wage workers replace a relatively
larger fraction of their earnings with DI benefits. DI payments consist of two components: a basic
benefit amount, independent of the applicant’s earnings history; and supplementary benefits that
increase in pre-disability earnings levels. By law, singles have a higher basic benefit amount than
married beneficiaries, and spousal income (if present) reduces the spousal benefit further.
       The disability determination process involves multiple steps, diagrammed in Figure 1. The
first is the submission of an initial application to the Social Security Administration office for the
Disability Determination Stage (DDS) review. If the applicant meets the non-medical criteria, such
as age and prior employment requirements, disability examiners and medical staff assess written
medical evidence regarding the applicant’s ability to perform work-related activities, accounting for
the applicant’s health, age, education, work experience, and the transferability of her skills. If the
disability examiner concludes that the applicant cannot be expected to engage in any substantial
gainful activity, a disability award is made. Approximately 75 percent of applicants are awarded
benefits at the DDS review. About 30 percent of beneficiaries receive partial awards. Cases that are
more difficult to assess—typically claims of mental illness and lower back pain—are often denied at
this step.
       Those denied at the DDS review may appeal within two months to the Court of Appeals, and
about 25 percent of denied applicants do so. Appellants are assigned to Administrative Law Judges
(ALJs), who either allow, deny, or remand (i.e., return to the DDS for reevaluation) their cases.9
ALJs are required to apply the same criteria used in the initial determination process, but applicants
may present new supporting information in writing. Approximately 15 percent of all appealed claims
are allowed at the ALJ level. If the appeal is denied, the applicant can choose to start a new DI
case by reapplying to the DDS Review stage.
   8
    This definition is almost identical to the one used by the U.S. SSDI program (see Social Security Act §1614).
   9
    Average processing time at the DDS stage is six months, and average processing time at the appeal stage is four
months. Remands are uncommon, accounting for only five percent of appeal outcomes. In our baseline analysis, we
code remanded cases as rejected. As a robustness check, we recoded remanded cases as allowed or denied based on
their eventual outcome after they were reconsidered by the DDS case worker. Results are comparable.

Assignment of DI cases to judges

All Norwegian disability appeals are heard in Oslo. Prior to 1997, there was only one hearing de-
partment; subsequently, there were four equally sized departments, all housed in the same building,
and with no specialization across the four departments. Within each department, the assignment of
cases to Administrative Law Judge is performed by a department head who does not have knowledge
of the content of cases. As stipulated in the rules set forth for the Administrative Law Court, case
assignment should be done “by the drawing of lots.” In practice, cases are assigned on a rotating
basis depending on the date they are received and the alphabetical ordering of a judge’s last name.10
    Unusual among national disability systems, Norwegian judges are not specialized according to
cases characteristic (medical condition, geographic region, or other attributes), and there is never
any personal contact between judges and appellants (all evidence is presented in writing). Appellants
have no option to seek a different judge from the one to whom they are assigned.

Verifying random assignment

Table 1 verifies that the hearing office assignment mechanism generates a distribution of cases across
judges that is consistent with random assignment. There are 75 judges in our sample who have
handled 375 cases each, on average. We measure judge leniency as the average allowance rate in all
other cases a judge has handled (including the judge’s past and future cases that may fall entirely
outside of our estimation sample). To purge any differences over time or across departments in the
characteristics of appellants or the overall leniency rate of the DI system, we always control for fully
interacted year by department dummies (the level at which randomization occurs.)
  10
     We verified these rules with the current Head of the Administrative Law Court, Knut Brofoss. The rules are
explained in “Veileder for Saksbehandlingen i Trygderetten” (Guidelines for Processing Cases in the Court of Appeals).
We have also presented our work at internal seminars with the current set of judges and department heads to confirm
that we have understood how the cases are handled and assessed.

Notes: This table reports an F-test of whether the hearing office complied with the random allocation procedure described in
Section 2. The baseline estimation sample consists of individuals who appeal an initially denied DI claim during the period 1994-
2005 (see Section 3 for further details). There are 75 unique judges. Columns report OLS regressions of appellant characteristics
on (column 1) a dummy variable for whether the case was allowed; and (column 3) our measure of judge leniency. F-statistics
are obtained from OLS estimation on the combined set of appellant characteristics. Each regression controls for fully interacted
year of appeal and department dummies. Characteristics of appellants are measured prior to appeal. Variable definitions are
as follows: children is equal to 1 if appellant has children under age 18 and 0 otherwise; any college is equal to one if a person
has some college or has a college degree; body system codes are based on ICD-10 diagnostic codes. Pre-determined economic
variables are measured one year before appeal, and average indexed earnings is mean earnings for the ten years prior to appeal.
Assets, wealth, liability and disposable income are measured at the household level and normalized by the number of household
members. Nominal values are deflated to 2005 and represented in US dollars using the average exchange rate NOK/$ = 6.


    The first column of Table 1 uses a linear probability model to test whether appellants’ (pre-
determined) characteristics and economic conditions are predictive of case outcomes. As expected,
demographic, economic and health variables are highly predictive of whether an appealed case is
allowed. Column 3 assesses whether these same case characteristics are predictive of the leniency

                                                                7
of the judges to which cases are assigned. We find no such relationship. Jointly, these 21 variables
explain about 0.1 percent of the variation in the judge leniency measure (joint p-value of 0.72), and
none is statistically significant at the 10 percent level.
   A natural question is why some judges are more lenient than others. We have few detailed
characteristics of judges to help illuminate this question, but we do know the number of cases that
each judge has handled. We find that experienced judges appear to be slightly less lenient, but ex-
perience accounts for only a small fraction of the total variation in allowance rates across judges (see
Appendix Figure A.1). Analyzing the underlying sources of the inter-judge differences in leniency
is outside the scope (and reach) of our paper. What is critical for our analysis is that appellants
are randomly assigned to judges (as our data confirm), that some judges are systematically more
lenient than others (as documented in Section 4.1), and that cases allowed by a strict judge would
also be allowed by a lenient one (consistent with the tests in Section 4.2).

Instrument and 2SLS model

We use variation in DI allowance generated from the random assignment of appeal judges as an
instrumental variable to estimate the economic consequences of disability receipt. Because some
judges are systematically more lenient than others, as we document below, random assignment of
appellants to judges rise to exogenous variation in the probability an individual is allowed DI in the
appeals process.
   Our baseline instrumental variables (IV) model can be described by the following two-equation
system:
                                         Ai = γZj(i) + Xi0 δ + εi                                   (1)
                                        Yit = βt Ai +   Xi0 θt   + ηit .                            (2)

Here, Ai is an indicator variable equal to 1 if appellant i is allowed DI at the appeal, and Zj(i) is
the leniency measure for judge j to which appellant i is assigned. The vector Xi contains relevant
control variables, including a full set of year-of-appeal by department dummies. In the second stage
equation, Yit is a dependent variable of interest that is measured for appellant i at some point t
after the allowance decision (e.g. earnings three years after the decision).
   The target of our estimation is the average of βt among individuals who are allowed DI at the
appeal because they were assigned to a lenient judge. To estimate this Local Average Treatment
Effect, our baseline specification uses 2SLS with first and second stage equations given by (1) and
(2). The endogenous variable in our estimation is an indicator for whether an appellant was allowed
DI at appeal, rather than whether or not the appellant is currently receiving DI when outcome Yit
is observed. This specification alleviates concerns about the exclusion restriction: 2SLS estimates
of βt capture the causal effects of the initial judicial disability determination, which may operate
through a number of channels, including participation in DI, subsequent reapplications to the DI
program following denial, or other behavioral changes resulting from the initial outcome at appeal.
We can also estimate the reduced form effect of judge leniency on appellant outcomes by directly


                                                    8
regressing Y on Z and X.


3         Data and Background
3.1         Data and Sample Restrictions
Our analysis draws on multiple administrative data sources that are linked by unique person-level
identifiers. Information on DI benefits comes from social security registers that contain complete
records for all individuals who entered the DI program during the period 1967-2010. These data
include information on each individual’s work history and medical diagnosis, the month when DI
was awarded or denied, and the level of DI benefits received. These person-level records are linked
to hearing office records on all DI appeals during 1989 through 2011, including dates of appeal and
decision, outcomes for each appeal, and unique identifiers for both judges and appellants.
         To capture complete information on DI applicants’ earnings, income and assets, we merge the
social security data with longitudinal administrative registers provided by Statistics Norway covering
every Norwegian resident from 1967 to 2010. These register data enumerate individual demographic
information (including sex, age, and education) and, since 1993, all sources of annual income,
including earnings, self-employment income, capital income, and cash transfers, as well as most
types of assets holdings and liabilities, such as as real estate, financial portfolio, and debt. Income
data are reported in annual amounts, while the values of assets holdings and liabilities are measured
as of the last day of each year.
         The Norwegian data have several advantages over register data collected by many other countries.
Because most components of income and wealth are third-party reported (e.g. by employers, banks
and financial intermediaries), the coverage and reliability are rated as exceptional by international
quality assessments (see e.g Atkinson et al. 1995). Because in Norway, most register data are
a matter of public record, there is no attrition from the original sample due to non-response or
non-consent. The income and wealth data pertain to all Norwegian residents, and are therefore
not limited to those employed in jobs covered by social security, individuals who respond to wealth
surveys, or households that file estate tax returns. Measures of income and wealth are recorded
without any top or bottom coding.11 Finally, unique identifiers allow us to match spouses to one
another and parents to children, thereby constructing measures of per capita household income and
consumption.
         A key challenge in estimating the consumption effects of DI receipt is the lack of reliable longitu-
dinal data on consumption expenditures. One approach to measuring expenditures is to use survey
data, but expenditure surveys typical have small sample sizes and face significant measurement
issues (see Pistaferri, 2015 for a discussion). A second option is to create measures of consumption
from the accounting identity that total consumption expenditure is equal to income plus capital
gains minus the change in wealth over the period. Browning & Leth-Petersen (2003) shows how
    11
    Some individuals are reported with negative income components (e.g. negative cash transfers). In these cases,
we truncate the income components at zero. We also top-code a handful of observations with extremely large income
components. The results do not change appreciably if we retain these outliers.


                                                        9
one can construct such measures of consumption from longitudinal data on income and assets. Eika
et al. (2017) perform a similar exercise combining tax data on income and wealth with detailed
information on households’ financial and real estate transactions. Their analysis shows that the
measures of consumption derived from such data sets conform well to those reported in family ex-
penditure surveys and to the aggregates from national accounts. We use their measures here, and
refer the reader to Eika et al. (2017) for more details.
    Our empirical analysis considers individuals who appeal an initially denied DI claim.12 To
observe individuals for at least four years after the appeal decision, our estimation sample consists
of individuals whose appeal decision was made during the period 1994-2005. To reduce sampling
variation in the instrumental variable, we follow Maestas et al. (2013) and French & Song (2013) in
excluding observations for which the assigned appeal judge has handled fewer than 10 cases during
the 1989 through 2011 period.13 To circumvent the issue of older appellants substituting between
DI and early retirement, we also exclude appellants who are above age 62 at the time of appeal.
    In Table 2, we document characteristics of the sample of individuals who apply for DI and
the subsample who appeal an initially denied DI claim (our baseline sample). Relative to the full
sample of initial applicants, those who appeal are more likely to be female, are less educated, are
more likely to be foreign born, and have lower prior earnings and assets. Seventy percent of DI
appellants claim mental or musculoskeletal disorders, whereas this figure is 63 percent for the full
set of DI applicants.

3.2    Institutional Background
There are a number of similarities and some key differences between the DI systems in the U.S.
and in Norway (see Autor & Duggan, 2006; Kostol & Mogstad, 2014). In both countries, DI is
one of the largest transfer programs. However, the prevalence of receipt of DI benefits is lower in
the U.S. than in Norway, as shown in Figure 2, while the time trends are similar.14 From 1961
to 2012, DI prevalence increased from 2.2 to 9.7 percent in Norway and from 0.8 to 5.0 percent in
the U.S. Norway’s prevalence has leveled off at about 10 percent in recent years. The U.S. SSDI
prevalence rate rose steeply through 2013, after which time growth peaked and reversed (Social
Security Advisory Board, 2015).15
  12
     Some individuals have several denied DI claims over the period we consider. In such cases, we restrict our sample
to the individual’s first denied DI claim.
  13
     Including these judges does not change the estimates appreciably, and neither does excluding judges who handle
fewer than 50 cases.
  14
     The cross-country difference in DI coverage is unlikely to explain the entire discrepancy in the incidence of DI:
although virtually all non-elderly adults are covered in Norway, more than 80 percent of all non-elderly adults are
covered in the U.S. The remaining difference could be a function of underlying differences in screening stringency, the
generosity of the programs, or the frequency with which people apply for disability benefits. Milligan & Wise (2011)
argue that differences in health are unlikely to explain much of the observed differences in DI rates across developed
countries.
  15
     The U.S. Supplemental Security Income program (SSI) also provides disability benefits to adults and children
with work-limiting disabilities. DI and SSI therefore jointly provide disability benefits to a larger share of U.S. adults
than does DI alone. However, the U.S. DI program is more comparable to the Norwegian DI program than is the U.S.
SSI program since SSI primarily provides benefits to adults with little work history. In this sense, SSI is more akin to

Notes: This table reports descriptive statistics for applicants and appellants. The applicant sample consists of all claims made
during the period 1992-2003 by individuals who are at most 61 years of age. The appellant sample consists of the subset of
applicants who filed an appeal during the period 1994-2005 (see Section 3 for further details). All characteristics are measured
the year before application/appeal unless otherwise stated. The final column reports t-statistics of the test of equality between
characteristics of applicants and appellants. Variable definitions are as in Table 1.


    In both countries, the expansion of the DI rolls in recent decades appears to be driven in sig-
nificant part by changes in disability screening criteria, which led to a steep rise in the share of DI
recipients suffering from difficult-to-verify disorders such as mental illness and musculoskeletal dis-
ease.16 Because mental illness and musculoskeletal disease have low associated mortality rates—and
the social assistance program in Norway, which is a need-based and means-tested program, with the difference that
SSI applies only to individuals with disabilities.
   16
      See Autor & Duggan (2006) and Liebman (2015) for discussions of this phenomenon. In the U.S., the 1984
congressional reforms shifted the focus of screening from medical to functional criteria. In Norway, the medical
eligibility criteria were relaxed earlier and more gradually.



                                                                 11
moreover, because mental illness typically has an early onset—DI recipients with such diagnoses
tend to participate in the program for relatively long periods. DI exit rates in both countries have
decreased in the last few decades, with progressively fewer DI recipients either reaching retirement
age or dying in a given year (see Appendix Figures A.2 and A.3). The aging of the Baby Boom
cohorts into their peak (near-elderly) disability age brackets has contributed substantially to the
expansion of the U.S. DI rolls since the mid-1990s (Liebman, 2015).

Notes: This figure displays trends in DI receipt in Norway and the U.S. (see Section 2).. U.S. trends are based on Autor &
Duggan (2006) for 1957-2005 and SSA Office of the Chief Actuary for 2006-2012. Norwegian trends are based on SSA Statistical
Supplements. Incidence of DI receipt defined as the percent of the relevant adult population receiving DI benefits (age 18-67 in
Norway; age 25-64 in the US).


       There are noteworthy differences between the U.S. and Norwegian DI programs. One difference
is their income replacement rates. Kostol & Mogstad (2014) compute the replacement rate for a
typical Norwegian applicant in according to the SSDI rules and the Norwegian program. For the
worker they consider, the pre-tax income replacement rate would be 31 percent in the U.S. program
and 58 percent in the Norwegian program. These calculations disregard income taxation, dependent
benefits, and health insurance, however. Both countries’ DI programs provide dependent benefits.
In addition, DI recipients in the U.S. receive health insurance coverage through the federal Medicare
program, which is a substantial in-kind benefit.17 In Norway, by contrast, all citizens are eligible
for health insurance through the Social Insurance System. Another difference is that the appeal
process plays a more important role in the U.S. than in Norway. While 48 percent of initially
rejected applicants appeal in the U.S. (French & Song, 2013), only 25 percent of those rejected in
Norway appeal. Success rates at appeal are also considerably higher in the U.S. than Norway.
  17
    Autor & Duggan (2006) estimate that Medicare benefits account for approximately 40 percent of the present value
of an SSDI award.


                                                                              12
   Despite these differences in prevalence, benefits structure, and appeals behaviors, there are
important similarities between the applicant, appellant and participant populations across the two
countries. Almost 60 percent of DI recipients in both countries suffer from difficult-to-verify mental
and musculoskeletal disorders (see Appendix Table A.1). And in both countries, appellants are
younger, have lower prior earnings, and are more likely to suffer from difficult-to-verify disorders
than are average DI applicants (see Appendix Table A.2). As a further comparison among the
two programs, Figure 3 uses Norwegian and U.S. data (the latter from Maestas et al. 2013) to
plot earnings trajectories of DI applicants and appellants in Norway and the U.S., before and after
their DI determinations. We focus on years t − 4 through years t + 4 surrounding the initial DI
determination (lefthand panel) and the year of the initial appeal decision (righthand panel).
   The patterns are quite similar across the two countries. DI applicants who are allowed at the
initial determination have on average substantially higher prior earnings than those who are denied.
This likely reflects the fact that workers with high prior earnings who seek DI benefits often face
severe impairments that necessitate a sudden cessation of employment; conversely, applicants with
low prior earnings may in part be compelled to seek DI due to a lack of employment opportunities
rather than by severe health shocks per se. Similarly, earnings diverge immediately between allowed
and denied appellants following the appeal decision in both countries, and this gap is not closed over
the subsequent four post-decision years. The figures in the bottom panel plot the difference between
denied and allowed applicants (left) and appellant labor earnings (right) over time, controlling
flexibly for observable characteristics and lagged dependent variables (up to the year of the initial
decision, after which they are fixed as the mean over the years prior to decision).

Notes: The top four figures display changes in the levels of earnings for allowed (dashed line) and denied (solid line) DI applicants
(left) and for DI appellants (right) in the nine years surrounding the initial DI determination and the initial outcome at appeal in
the U.S. (top panel, sourced from Maestas et al. 2013), and for Norway (middle panel). For the Norwegian data, the applicant
sample consists of all claims made during the period 1998-2003 by individuals who are at most 61 years of age. The appellant
sample filed an appeal during the period 1998-2005 (see Section 3 for further details). The figures in the bottom panel plot the
difference between denied and allowed applicants (left) and appellant labor earnings (right) over the same period, controlling
flexibly for observable characteristics and lagged dependent variables (up to the year of the initial decision, after which they are
fixed as the mean over the years prior to decision). The dashed lines in the bottom panel represent 90% confidence intervals,
where each yearly difference is estimated separately with flexible controls for individual characteristics comprising application
year dummies, dummy variables for county of residence, age at appeal, household size, gender, foreign born, marital status,
children below age 18, educational attainment, and number of medical diagnoses, as well as polynomials of lagged averages
of earnings and disposable income (not including observations after the decision). Nominal values are deflated to 2005 and
represented in US dollars using the average exchange rate NOK/$ = 6.

4     Assessing the Instrument
We begin our presentation of results by providing evidence on the relevance and validity of the
instrument.

4.1    Instrument Relevance
Figure 4 provides a graphical representation of the first stage of our IV model. In the background
of this figure is a histogram for the density of judge leniency (controlling for fully interacted year
and department dummies). The measure of judge leniency is the average judge allowance rate in all
other cases a judge has handled, including the judge’s past and future cases that may fall outside of
our estimation sample. The mean of the leniency variable is 0.15 with a standard deviation of 0.05.
The histogram reveals a wide spread in judge leniency, with a judge at the 90th percentile allowing
approximately 18 percent of cases as compared to approximately 8 percent for a judge at the 10th
percentile.
    The solid line plotted in the figure’s foreground depicts the relationship between judge leniency
and the appellant’s allowance rate (controlling for fully interacted year and department dummies).
The graph is a flexible analog to the first stage equation (1), where we plot a local linear regression
of individual allowance outcomes against judge leniency. The individual allowance rate is mono-
tonically increasing in our leniency measure, and is close to linear. A 10 percentage point increase
in the judge’s allowance rate in other cases is associated with an approximately 8 percentage point
increase in the probability that an individual appellant’s case is allowed.
    Table 3 presents estimates of our first equation for the relationship between judge leniency and
DI allowance rates at appeal (1). In each column, we regress a dummy variable for whether an
individual is allowed DI at appeal on the judge leniency measure. We include fully interacted year
and department dummies in panel A but otherwise include no other controls. The four columns
of the table correspond to years one through four following appeal. These columns are identical
except for the very modest impact of sample attrition (less than three percent over four years)
stemming from death or emigration of appellants.18 The point estimate of approximately 0.82 is
essentially identical across columns, indicating that attrition exerts a negligible impact on the first
stage relationship. All else equal, assignment to a judge with a 10 percentage point higher overall
allowance rate increases the probability of receiving an allowance by 8.2 percentage points.




4.2    Instrument Validity
In order for judge leniency to be a valid instrument, appellants’ assignment to judges must be
uncorrelated with case characteristics. Table 1 above provides strong empirical support for the
  18
     Column 1 of Appendix Table A.5 documents that the assignment variable (judge leniency) does not affect the
probability that an appellant either dies or emigrates during the outcome period.

Notes: This figure displays the effect of judge leniency on DI allowance, conditional on fully interacted year and department
dummies. Baseline estimation sample consists of individuals who appeal an initially denied DI claim during the period 1994-2005

judge leniency. The histogram of judge leniency is shown in the background of both figures (top and bottom 1 percent excluded

claim that the DI system in Norway randomly assigns appeal judges within each department and
year. Panel B of Table 3 provides a second confirmation of this fact: adding controls for appellant
characteristics to the regression model has almost no effect on the point estimates, consistent with
random assignment of appellants to judges.
       This random assignment mechanism is sufficient for consistent estimation of the reduced form
effect of judge leniency on appellant outcomes. However, to interpret the IV estimates of equa-
tions (1) and (2) as the causal effects of DI allowances on appellant outcomes requires two further
assumptions. The first is that judge leniency affects appellant outcomes of interest only through
its impact on the appellant’s allowance decision. This exclusion restriction appears particularly
likely to hold in Norway, where all appeals are presented in writing, individuals (and their families)
observe only judges’ allowance or denial decisions, and there is no personal contact between judges
and appellants. One potential violation of the exclusion restriction could occur if appeals processing
times differed systematically with judge leniency and, moreover, exerted an independent effect on
appellant outcomes (as explored in Autor et al. 2017). To test this possibility, we calculated each
judge’s average processing time based on the residual average processing time in his or her other
cases. Panel C of Table 3 shows that the first stage estimates do not change appreciably when
controlling for judge processing time.
       The second assumption needed for a causal interpretation of the IV estimates is the monotonicity
of the judge leniency instrument.19 Monotonicity requires that, for each appellant, the probability

Note: This table reports the first stage coefficients of equation 1. The baseline estimation sample consists of individuals who

In panel A, DI allowance is regressed on judge leniency and fully interacted year of appeal and department dummies. Panel B
includes flexible controls for individual characteristics: fully interacted year and department dummies, and dummy variables for
month of appeal, county of residence, age at appeal, household size, gender, foreign born, marital status, children below age 18,
education, and number of medical diagnoses. Panel C also controls for judge leave-out-mean processing time.



of being allowed at appeal would be at least as high if assigned to a strict judge (low value of Z) as
if assigned to a lenient judge (high value of Z). Since no individual can be assigned to two different
judges at the same point in time, it is impossible to verify this assumption. There are, however, some
testable implications which would allow us to reject the assumptions. The first testable implication
we consider is that the first stage estimate should be non-negative for any subpopulation. If this
were not the case, we would infer that the judges whom we estimate to be more lenient on average
are stricter towards a subset of cases. Reassuringly, when separately estimating the first stages based
on the (pre-determined) observable characteristics of the individual, we find that the estimates are
consistently positive and sizable, consistent with the monotonicity assumption (see Appendix Table
A.3).
    As a second check on this threat to validity, we directly examine whether judges who are stricter
towards one subset of appellants (e.g., young appellants, those with mental disorders) are also
relatively strict towards the complementary group of appellants (e.g., older appellants, those without
mental disorders). We perform this test by again partitioning the data into the subpopulations
that were used in the prior test, but in this case, we recalculate the leniency instrument for each
subpopulation to be the judge’s leniency for cases outside of the subpopulation. For example,
when assessing the effect of judge leniency on allowances for male appellants, we calculate judge
tion would be unnecessary. But we do not find the constant treatment effect assumption plausible in this setting.



                                                               17
leniency using only decisions in cases with female appellants. Column (2) of Appendix Table A.3
reports these results. All estimates using this redefined instrument are positive and statistically
significant, consistent with the maintained assumption that leniency is a judge-specific attribute
that characterizes judges’ decision-making across the panoply of cases that they are assigned.


5         Impacts of DI allowances on the Appellants
This section investigates the impacts of DI allowances on the labor earnings, DI benefits, and total
transfers received of the appellants. These results lay the groundwork for the analysis in the next
section of the household impacts and fiscal costs of DI allowances.

5.1        Effects on Labor Earnings and DI Benefits
In Panels A-C of Table 4, we report 2SLS estimates of equations (1) and (2) with DI participation,
DI benefits payments, and labor earnings as dependent variables in the second stage. As in Table
3, we separately estimate the effects of the initial appeal decision on outcomes for each of the four
subsequent years. All specifications control for observable case characteristics and include a full set
of year by department dummies.
         The first two panels consider the impact of being allowed at the appeal on DI participation
and benefits payments. Column 1 of panel A reports a 2SLS point estimate of 0.989, indicating
that allowances induced by judge leniency increase DI receipt almost one-for-one in the first year
following appeal.20 Over the the first four years following appeal, the causal effect of being allowed
at the appeal on subsequent DI receipt falls by approximately half, from 0.99 to 0.47, reflecting
the fact that a substantial fraction of appellants who are initially denied DI benefits reapply and
are ultimately allowed.21 Panel B displays analogous estimates for DI benefit payments. Receiving
a DI allowance at appeal leads to a large increase in benefit payments relative to the alternative
outcome, with this increment equal to $16,240 in the first year. This contrast declines over time due
to successful DI reapplications, reaching $8,167 in year four. Over the initial four years following
appeal, receiving a DI allowance increases DI benefit payments by approximately $11,900 per annum.
         Panel C of Table 4 displays analogous estimates for annual labor earnings of DI appellants.
DI allowances have sizable negative causal effects on labor earnings. Receiving a DI allowance on
appeal reduces annual earnings by approximately $6,800 in the first year after appeal, equal to
approximately forty percent of the annual DI transfer benefit received. Distinct from the steeply
declining causal effect of an initial allowance on DI participation and DI transfers, the causal effect
of an initial DI allowance on appellant earnings declines only modestly over the four years following
the initial appeal outcome. Thus, over the first four years following appeal, receiving a DI allowance
reduces labor earnings by around $5,200 per annum.
    20
     Note that 0.989 = 0.784/0.793, where 0.793 is the corresponding first stage coefficient from Table 3, panel B
column 1.
  21
     Although this pattern could also be consistent with successful appellants exiting the DI program in years two
through four, such exits rarely occur.

Note: This table reports instrumental variables estimates of the causal effect of receiving a DI allowance at the appeal stage on
DI participation (panel A), annual DI benefits (panel B), and annual labor earnings (panel C), annual total transfers inclusive
of DI benefits (panel D), and annual transfers excluding DI benefits (panel E). Columns 1-4 report separate estimates for each
year, whereas column 5 reports estimates for the average outcome over the four year period. The baseline sample consists of
individuals who appeal an initially denied DI claim during the period 1994-2005 (see Section 3 for further details). There are
75 unique judges. All regressions include fully interacted year and department dummies, dummy variables for month of appeal,
county of residence, age at appeal, household size, gender, foreign born, marital status, children below age 18, education, and a
number of medical diagnoses. All control variables are measured prior to appeal.


    The estimates in Table 4 can be interpreted as local average treatment effects (LATE) for
appellants whose DI decisions are affected by the instrument (i.e., the compliers), meaning they
could have received a different allowance decision had their case been assigned to a different judge.
As shown in Imbens & Rubin (1997), we can decompose these LATEs to draw inference about what
compliers would have received in DI benefits and earned in labor income if denied or, alternatively,
if allowed at appeal. These potential outcomes for compliers may be recovered by combining (i) the
shares of never-takers and compliers to the instrument with (ii) the average observed outcomes of


                                                               19
individuals who were not allowed with the most lenient or strictest judges (that is, those facing the
highest and lowest values of the instrument).22
       In Appendix Figure A.4, we implement these calculations to decompose the LATE into the
potential outcome of appellant compliers if denied or, alternatively, if allowed. Relative to the
regression estimates in Table 4, the figure plots levels of potential outcomes rather than simply
depicting the LATE contrast between potential outcomes in the two states. Although many denied
appellants reapply for, and eventually receive, DI benefits (Table 4), we find that labor earnings
of compliers who are denied at appeal change little following denial. In contrast, labor earnings of
compliers allowed at initial appeal fall steeply, particularly in the year of allowance and the year
immediately thereafter. This pattern suggests that among the population of denied compliers, a
small but non-negligible subset persists in employment following denial, while a larger group works
minimally and pursues further appeals.

5.2      Benefit Substitution in Response to DI denial
As in many European countries, DI is one of several transfer programs available to Norwegians,
and those whose DI claims are denied may potentially substitute towards these other programs.
Conversely, DI beneficiaries may also seek other transfer benefits following the award of DI benefits.
Key transfers programs other than DI benefits are social assistance (i.e., traditional welfare benefits),
housing benefits, and vocational rehabilitation benefits.
       Panels D and E of Table 4 report 2SLS estimates of the impact of an initial DI allowance on
total transfers (DI benefits plus all other cash transfers) and cash transfers excluding DI benefits.
These estimates point to the importance of accounting for benefit substitution when considering the
impacts of disability allowances on household incomes and public expenditure: the net impact of a
DI allowance on total transfers received is about 20 to 40 percent smaller than its gross impact, with
the largest discrepancies in the first two years following the initial appeal decision. On average, the
net impact of a DI allowance on total transfers is about $8,100 per annum, approximately $3,800
less than the estimated gross impact on DI benefits. Both of the average increase in total transfers
and the average decline in non-DI transfers are significantly different from zero at the 10 percent
significance level.
       In Appendix Figure A.5, we decompose the LATE estimates for benefit receipt into potential
outcomes for compliers when allowed and when denied. When compliers are awarded DI benefits, we
see a sizable fall in their payments from non-DI transfer programs, indicating benefit substitution.
Non-DI transfer payments change little in the year following appeal when compliers are denied DI,
however. As many compliers who were denied at initial appeal successfully reapply for DI, their DI
payments rise and non-DI transfers fall in the years after the initial denial. The fact that the net
impact of a DI allowance on appellant transfer payments is smaller than its gross impact indicates
that DI and non-DI transfer programs serve as substitutes. In Section 7, we explore whether spousal
  22
    Imbens & Rubin (1997) show how to derive the potential outcomes of compliers with and without treatment
in settings with a binary instrument. Dahl et al. (2014) extend this to settings with multi-valued or continuous
instruments. We follow the procedure of Dahl et al. (2014).


                                                      20
labor supply provides an additional margin through which married appellants may buffer household
income in the event of DI denial.


6          Household Impacts and Fiscal Costs of DI Allowances
In Table 5, we present estimates of the income and consumption gains that households obtain from
DI allowances, and compare these gains with the fiscal costs that other taxpayers bear. This table
reports 2SLS estimates of the impact of allowances versus denials at appeal on disposable income
and consumption as well as fiscal costs inclusive of DI transfer payments, benefit substitution to or
from other transfer programs, and induced changes in tax receipts. Panel A uses the full sample
of appellants, while Panel B restricts the sample for whom we have detailed measures of household
consumption expenditure.23 To facilitate comparison across households of difference size, we divide
the outcomes by the size of the appellant’s household (so that both income gains and fiscal costs
are per capita).
         Despite both countervailing behavioral responses and countervailing transfer program interac-
tions documented above, DI allowances nevertheless yield meaningful income gains among individ-
uals and their families at the margin of program entry. Panel A.1 of Table 5 indicates that DI
allowances raise income available for consumption per household member by approximately $3,200
per annum. This effect is statistically significant at approximately the five percent level when pool-
ing outcomes over the four years following appeal. At the same time, we readily reject the null
hypothesis that the causal effect of a DI allowance on income (per household member) in each of
the four post-appeal years is as large as its effect on initial DI benefits payments. Thus, the net effect
of DI allowances on household incomes are far smaller than their gross effect due to the influence
of household labor supply, reapplication behavior, and benefit substitution.24
         Given that DI allowances significantly increase disposable income (per household member)
among appellants while reducing household labor supply (and hence tax revenue), we can infer
that DI allowances have net fiscal costs. Panel A.2 of Table 5 provides a direct accounting of these
costs by summing the impact of DI allowances on DI transfer payments, benefit substitution to
or from other transfer programs, and induced changes in tax receipts.25 Our point estimates sug-
gest that DI allowances granted on appeal increase annual net government spending (per household
member) by nearly $7,000. A comparison of the point estimates in panels A.1 and A2. suggests that
DI allowance raise household income by less than 50 cents per dollar of net government expenditure,
    23
      There is no evidence of a significant effect of judge leniency on the likelihood of being excluded from the full sample,
as shown in the fourth column of A.5, indicating that our estimates based on the restricted sample are unlikely to be
biased by endogenous compositional changes. For details on the measurement of consumption expenditure, see Eika
et al. (2017).
   24
      Specifically, the row labeled H0 : βt = ∆DI benefitt1 reports p-values for the null hypothesis that the the causal
effect of a successful DI appeal on household consumption in outcome years t ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4} is equal to its immediate
effect on DI benefits payments (panel B, column 1 of Table 4). We report two-tailed tests of equality. (P-values for
one-tailed tests of ∆DI > ∆HH consumption are equal to one-half the p-values for two-tailed tests.)
   25
      Fiscal costs are equal to transfer income minus taxes, while household income is equal to transfer income minus
taxes plus labor income and other market income (e.g. capital income). Since capital income plays a small role in the
DI appellant sample, most of the offset is due to labor supply impacts.


                                                             21
and we reject the hypothesis that the rise in disposable income (per household member) is as large
as the increase in fiscal costs per (household member) over the pooled four-year outcome period
(see the final column of panel A.2).26
         Panels B.1 and B.2 present 2SLS estimates of the effects of DI allowance on disposable income
and consumption expenditure (per household member) for the restricted sample of appellants for
whom we have complete consumption data. We estimate that DI allowances increase both disposable
income and household consumption by roughly 16 − 18 percent relative to their sample means, with
both effects significantly different from zero at the 10 percent level for outcomes over the four post-
appeal years. The fact that the point estimates for household income are broadly similar to those for
consumption suggests that DI allowances have relatively little impact on household savings among
appellants. Consistent with this observation, our data do not reject the null hypothesis that the
consumption gains induced by DI allowances are equal on average to the income gains.




7          Heterogeneity in Impacts of DI Allowances by Marital Status
Recent evidence points to an important role for family labor supply in self-insuring household con-
sumption against wage shocks (see e.g. Blundell et al. , 2016b). Motivated by this evidence, we
examine whether DI allowances have differential impacts on household income and consumption
among married and non-married households. We then explore how spousal responses to the al-
lowance decision may help explain this heterogeneity.

7.1        Impacts on household income and consumption
Tables 6 and 7 examine how the economic consequences of DI determinations differ by household
structure, and in particular between married and non-married appellants (i.e., those who are single
or cohabiting). All outcomes are reported per household member in $1,000.
         Focusing first on the subpopulation of non-married appellants, Table 6 documents that DI
allowances generate large positive impacts on disposable income and consumption among non-
married appellants, who comprise just over 40 percent of all appellants (Table 2). The panel A
estimates indicate that a DI allowance raises the household incomes of unmarried appellants by
approximately $6,600 per annum over the four years following appeal, and it generates net fiscal
expenditures of approximately $12,300 per annum.27 Our point estimates therefore imply that $0.55
cents of each dollar of public expenditure induced by a successful appeal by a non-married appellant
accrues to household income, though we note that available precision does not allow us to reject the
hypothesis that the effects on household incomes and fiscal expenditures are equal. Panel B focuses
    26
     This test is reported in the bottom row of the panel and denoted p-value for H0 : βt = ∆HH Incomet , indicating
that we are comparing the net fiscal cost to the induced rise in household income in the contemporaneous year (or, in
the final column, for the pooled four-year period).
  27
     As above, we divide impacts on fiscal costs by household size so that both income gains and fiscal costs are scaled
on a per household member basis.

Notes: This table reports the impact of DI allowance on household disposable income and fiscal costs for the baseline sample
(panel A) and household disposable income and consumption for the restricted sample (panel B). All outcomes are reported per
household member in $1,000. Baseline estimation sample consists of DI applicants who appeal an initially denied DI claim during
the period 1994-2005 (see Section 3 for further details). The restricted sample excludes households with housing transactions and
large financial transactions. There are 75 unique judges. All regressions include fully interacted year and department dummies,
dummy variables for month of appeal, county of residence, age at appeal, household size, gender, foreign born, marital status,
children below age 18, education, and number of medical diagnoses. All control variables are measured prior to appeal. P-values
for H0 : βt = ∆DI benefitt1 in panels A.1 and B.1 correspond to tests of whether the effect of a successful DI appeal (in year
t0) on initial DI income (in year t1) is equal to the effect of the successful appeal after on HH consumption in outcome years
t ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}. P-values for H0 : βt = ∆HH Incomet in panels A.2 and B.2 correspond to tests of whether the effects of a
successful DI appeal in year t0 on household income and household consumption are equivalent in outcome years t ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}
.

on the subset of non-married appellants for whom we have detailed consumption data. DI awards
increase both income and consumption in this subpopulation, raising them by approximately $9,400
and $10,400 respectively. These are very large increments to both outcomes, equivalent to 35 to
40 percent of their baseline values. Estimated impacts on household income and consumption are
highly comparable overall and in each year, and the p-values reported in the bottom of indicate
that we cannot reject the hypothesis that DI allowances raise household incomes and consumption
one-for-one in this subpopulation.
       Table 7 reports analogous estimates for married appellants. Accounting for the effect of DI
allowances on household labor supply and net payments across all public transfer programs sub-
stantially alters our picture of the income and consumption effects of disability receipt among
married beneficiaries. As shown in Table 7, DI allowances are not estimated to increase household
income or consumption of married applicants, and we can rule out with 95 percent confidence that
any positive effect exceeds $2,500 (nine percent of baseline income). We can also strongly reject
equality of the average effects of household income (per household member) on singles and unmar-
ried versus married. These estimates imply that the combination of household labor supply and
benefit substitution largely or fully offset the effects of DI benefit payments on household incomes of
married appellants—though we stress that this does not mean that the welfare consequences of these
transfers is nil, a point that we explore in our structural estimates below.28 DI allowances made to
married appellants do, however, incur meaningful fiscal costs through increased cash transfers and
reduced payroll tax revenues. We estimate that each DI allowance to a married appellant generates
a fiscal burden of approximately $4,000 per year in the four years following appeal. We readily
reject the hypothesis that the average annual gain in household income among married appellants
equals the average fiscal cost of a DI allowance for the marginal married appellant.




7.2      Spousal Responses
To help understand why the income and consumption effects of DI determinations differ by house-
hold structure, Table 8 extends our inquiry to consider spousal responses to DI allowance. We
focus exclusively on married households in this analysis since our data do not allow us to determine
whether non-married appellants are single or cohabiting.29
       Panels A and B consider the effects of DI allowances on the labor supply and transfer payment
receipt of the subset of appellants who are married. Though precision is quite limited in this
  28
      In fact, DI allowances appear to weakly lower household income and consumption, plausibly reflecting discrete
choices in labor supply by denied appellants’ spouses (e.g., due to fixed costs associated with working).
   29
      The Norwegian decennial census data allow us to observe cohabitation though unfortunately our annual admin-
istrative data do not. The Census data show that 59% of DI participants (applicants are not identified in the Census
data) are married, 32% are single non-cohabitants, and only 9% are cohabitants. We test whether judge leniency
causes endogenous selection into or out of marital status in Appendix Table A.5. Columns 2, 3 and 4 find no evidence
that judge leniency affects the the likelihood of a change in marital status (overall, from unmarried to married, or
from married to unmarried).

Notes: This table reports the impact of DI allowance on household disposable income and fiscal costs for the full set of unmarried
appellants (panel A) and the subset for whom we have detailed consumption data (panel B). All outcomes are reported per
household member in $1,000. Columns 1-4 report separate estimates for each year, whereas column 5 reports estimates for the
average outcome from 0 to 5 years after the appeal decision. Baseline estimation sample consists of unmarried DI applicants
who appeal an initially denied DI claim during the period 1994-2005 (see Section 3 for further details). The restricted sample
excludes households with housing transactions and large financial transactions. There are 75 unique judges. All regressions
include fully interacted year and department dummies, dummy variables for month of appeal, county of residence, age at appeal,
household size, gender, foreign born, marital status, children below age 18, education, and number of medical diagnoses. All
control variables are measured prior to appeal. P-values for H0 : βt = ∆DI benefitt1 in panels A.1 and B.1 correspond to tests
of whether the effect of a successful DI appeal (in year t0) on initial DI income (in year t1) is equal to the causal effect of
the successful appeal on HH income in outcome years t ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}. P-values for H0 : βt = ∆HH Incomet in panels A.2 and
B.2 correspond to tests of whether the causal effects of a successful DI appeal in year t0 on fiscal costs (A.2) and household
consumption (B.2) in outcome years t ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4} are equal to the corresponding effect on household income.

subsample, we estimate that labor supply reductions and transfer payment increases roughly offset
each other. Panels C and D consider the impact of of allowances versus denials at appeal on potential
compensatory behaviors among appellants’ spouses. The 2SLS estimates show that the labor supply
of appellants’ spouses responds strongly to the outcomes of disability determinations. Relative to
spouses of denied appellants, spousal earnings of allowed appellants fall by approximately $5,000 in
the first year after a successful appeal, and by a further $11,000 to $12,000 in years two through
four following the award as show in panel C. These estimated labor supply reductions in years two
through four, averaging $16,500, are statistically significant. Panel D shows, however, that as much
as 50 percent of the reduction in spousal labor earnings induced by a DI allowance is effectively
offset by a countervailing increase in transfer payments to the spouse.30 We note, however, that
this estimated positive effect on transfer payments is statistically significant only in the fourth year
following appeal. It is also positive and large in years two and three but not precisely estimated.
       The estimated effects on spousal earnings are consistent with the possibility that either spouses
reduce their labor supply if appellants are allowed, or that spouses increase their labor supply if
appellants are denied (or potentially both). The latter would suggest that DI denials induce an
added worker effect; the loss in worker earnings (due to disability) absent an offsetting gain in DI
income spurs spouses to increase their labor supply. The former possibility would be consistent with
DI allowances inducing a decline in labor supply among spouses due to leisure complementarities.
We explore which interpretation is supported by the data by decomposing the causal effects estimates
in Table 8 into potential outcomes of spouses of complier appellants if denied or, alternatively, if
allowed at appeal. This decomposition, found in Appendix Figure A.6, indicates that the behavioral
response found in Table 8 stems almost entirely from spousal responses to DI denials: spouses of
denied appellants strongly increase earnings in the years following denial; conversely, spouses of
allowed appellants exhibit little earnings adjustment. By implication, DI denial induces a powerful
added-worker effect among spouses.
       This result is somewhat surprising at first blush since households do not lose income when DI
appeals are denied, they simply fail to gain it. However, recall from Figure 3 (center right panel) that
average labor income of DI appellants declines by approximately 40 percent—from about $25, 000
to about $15, 000—over the four years prior to appeal, while close to 80 percent of applicants are
awarded DI benefits at their initial determination (Table 2). It thus appears plausible that, from the
perspective of DI appellants and their spouses, the denial of benefits at the appeal stage constitutes
a substantial adverse shock to expected permanent income, potentially spurring an added-worker
response.
  30
     In Appendix Table A.4, we run the analysis of appellant labor income and total transfer payments from Table
4 separately for married appellants versus single and unmarried appellants. While the thinner sample size available
for these estimations reduces precision, the point estimates suggest that DI allowances generate somewhat smaller
reductions in labor earnings, as well as smaller increases in total (individual) transfer payments, among married
appellants as compared to single and unmarried appellants. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the income
effects of transfers on own labor supply are much larger for unmarried disability beneficiaries due to the absence of
implicit spousal income insurance.

    To drill down further on this finding, we have also explored the heterogeneity of the added-worker
effect among households according to the spouse’s sex, education, and prior earnings. While we find
suggestive evidence that the labor supply of female spouses is more responsive to DI denial than is the
labor supply of male spouses, these contrasts are not typically significant due to limited statistical
power. Appellants may also differ in their own labor supply responses or benefit substitution
following the DI determination. To examine heterogeneity in responses according to observable
characteristics, we have also performed 2SLS estimation of equations (1) and (2) for each of the
subsamples reported in Appendix Table A.3, where we split appellants according to diagnosis,
gender, age, education, and the size of the household. These subsample estimates are insufficiently
precise to draw clear inferences.

8         Deriving Welfare Implications using a Structural Model
We now apply the data and findings above to estimate a dynamic model of household behavior
that translates employment, savings and reapplication decisions of appellants and their spouses
into revealed preferences for leisure and consumption. We use this estimated model to compute
the welfare benefits of DI receipt—by which we mean the cash equivalent value of DI allowance
at appeal—and to perform counterfactual simulations that allow us to infer the extent to which
spousal labor supply and other mechanisms attenuate the loss in household welfare from DI denial
at appeal. Our goal is limited to understanding the post-appeal labor supply, savings, and DI
reapplication decisions of appellants and their spouses, taking as given their characteristics and
economic circumstances at the time of appeal, such as savings, disability severity, education, and
past labor market experience. As a consequence, our model does not speak to the full insurance
value of the DI system to workers prior to disability onset; only the cash equivalent value of DI
allowances at the time of appeal.

8.1        Description of model and estimation procedure
Preference specification

We consider a unitary model of the household with non-separable preferences between consumption
and leisure and, for married households, interactions between the value of leisure (or equivalently
disutility of working) of the spouses.31 The household utility function depends on consumption (per
household member) C, indicators for employment PA ∈ {0, 1} and reapplication R ∈ {0, 1} for the
appellant, and an employment indicator PS ∈ {0, 1} for the spouse (if present).32 As in Low &
Pistaferri (2015), we allow for preference heterogeneity according to disability severity. Following
their paper, we construct an index of disability severity with three levels: H = 0 indicates low-
severity, H = 1 indicates mid-severity, and H = 2 indicates high-severity. We construct this index
by estimating the probability of being initially allowed at appeal as a function of the diagnosis codes,
and we assign appellants to three groups of equal size based on these predicted probabilities.
         We follow Low & Pistaferri (2015) in the parametric specification of preferences. At time t, the
instantaneous utility function of unmarried households with a given disability severity is:


                                                 1
                  U1 (Ct , PA,t , Rt ; H) =          (Ct exp {−PA,t φ1,A,H } − Rt exp ω1 )1−µ1 ,                 (3)
                                              1 − µ1
    31
      This flexible specification of preferences accommodates non-market production and work-related expenses and
allows for the possibility that spouses may enjoy leisure more when they are together. For evidence on such non-
separability, we refer to Browning & Meghir (1991), Blundell et al. (1994), Aguiar & Hurst (2013) and Blundell et al.
 (2016b).
   32
      As in Maestas et al. (2013) and Kostol & Mogstad (2014), employment is an indicator variable that is equal to
one if annual earnings exceed the annual substantial gainful activity threshold, set annually by the Norwegian Social
Security Administration (at approximately USD 10,000 per year). We are unable to measure labor supply at the
intensive margin because we lack reliable data on working hours.




                                                         29
where φ1,A,H , µ1 , and ω1 are the utility parameters. The bracketed expression reflects how the
marginal utility of income changes with working; it is normalized to zero if the appellant is not
working. For married households with appellants of a given disability severity, we use a similar
parametric specification of preferences:


                                           1
     U2 (Ct , PA,t , PS,t , Rt ; H) =          (Ct exp {−PA,t φ2,A,H − PS,t φ2,S } − Rt exp ω2 )1−µ2 ,   (4)
                                        1 − µ2

where φ2,A,H , φ2,S , µ2 , and ω2 are the utility parameters, and the bracketed expression is normalized
to zero if both spouses are not working.



Earnings Process

Like Low & Pistaferri (2015), we specify the process of (latent) earnings of appellants to depend
on disability severity H and other observable characteristics Q. The vector Q includes a constant,
indicators for high school drop out, high school completion, and college completion; and an indicator
for young age, where we follow Low & Pistaferri (2015) in defining young disability appellants as
those less than 45 of years age at time of appeal. The observable characteristics are measured
prior to the appeal decision, capturing heterogeneity in experience, skills, and abilities that may
affect potential earnings. In addition, we include a fixed effect fA in earnings estimated from
pre-application earnings data to allow for heterogeneity in latent ability as measured prior to the
application.
   We specify the annual earnings process of the appellant to be:

                                                2
                                                X
                                        0
                        log WA,t = Q κM,A +           ψM,A,j Hj + τ A,t + aM,A (fA ) ,                   (5)
                                                j=0


where M = 1 denotes single households and M = 2 denotes married households, aM,A is a (third
order) polynomial in the pre-application fixed effect, Hj = 1 {H = j} is an indicator for disability
severity j = {0, 1, 2}, and the stochastic component τA,t is specified as a random walk:

                                                                          2
                                                                              
                               τA,t = τA,t−1 + νA,t ,        νA,t ∼ N 0, σA,M   .

Similarly, the annual earnings process of the spouse (if present) is specified as:

                                                  2
                                                  X
                                            0
                             log WS,t = Q κS +          ψS,j Hj + τS,t + aS (fS ) ,                      (6)
                                                  j=0

where:
                                                              νS,t ∼ N 0, σS2 .
                                                                             
                                 τS,t = τS,t−1 + νS,t ,

   As pointed out by Heckman (1979), a potential concern with the (latent) earnings processes is

                                                        30
that earnings are not observed for those who do not work and the decision to work depends on the
earnings offer. While the observable characteristics and the pre-application fixed effects may help
address this concern over selection bias, we also perform a robustness check. As in Low & Pistaferri
(2015), we perform a selection correction of the earnings processes by estimating a probit regression
of employment on H, Q , and aM,A and including the inverse Mills ratio of this estimated value
in the earnings process regressions. Under the assumption that the error terms of the employment
equations and the earnings processes are jointly normal, this procedure provides the appropriate
parametric selection correction. Appendix Table A.7 and A.9 present parameter estimates of the
earnings processes and the corresponding labor supply elasticities with and without the selection
correction. As shown in Appendix Table A.10, neither the estimated cash equivalent value of DI
allowance nor the results from the counterfactuals are materially affected by inclusion of the selection
terms in the earnings processes.

Disposable Income

As in Heathcote et al. (2014) and Blundell et al. (2016b), we approximate the tax-transfer system by
specifying flexible functions mapping household earnings into disposable household income (earnings
plus transfers minus taxes). Below, we show that the chosen functions approximate well the effective
tax rates implicit in the complex Norwegian tax-transfer system.
   For unmarried households that supply labor, we use the following specification of the relationship
between disposable income I1,t and appellant earnings EA,t in year t:


                                I1,t = (1 − Λ1,Dt ,K,t ) (EA,t )(1−Ψ1,Dt ,K,t )                     (7)

where D ∈ {0, 1} denotes current DI receipt and K ∈ {0, 1} denotes the presence of a dependent in
the household. Similarly, the specification for married households that supply labor is:


                            I2,t = (1 − Λ2,Dt ,K,t ) (EA,t + ES,t )(1−Ψ2,Dt ,K,t )                  (8)

where ES,t and I2,t denote annual spousal earnings and disposable income in year t, respectively. For
households that do not supply labor, disposable incomeIM,t is only a function of transfer payments
as captured by the specification:


                                             IM,t = ΦM,Dt ,K,t                                      (9)

   The parameters Λ, Ψ and Φ are allowed to vary over time t and by marital status M , DI receipt
Dt , and presence of dependents K. In a proportional tax-transfer system, Ψ = 0 and Λ is the
proportional effective tax rate. By contrast, if 0 < Ψ < 1, then the marginal effective tax rate is
increasing in earnings.




                                                      31
Process for Approval of Reapplication

Like Low & Pistaferri (2015), we model DI approval upon reapplication for single and unmarried
households as:
                                              Dt+1 = Dt + Rt (1 − Dt ) πM,H,t .                                                  (10)

where πM,H,t ∈ [0, 1] is the probability of DI approval upon reapplication (R = 1), which we allow
to vary with time t, marital status M , and disability severity H.




The Household’s Problem

Letting St denote savings, ζ denote the intertemporal discount factor, and O1 denote household
heterogeneity, the dynamic optimization problem of unmarried households is:

          V1,t (Dt , τA,t , St ; O1 ) =           max            U1 (Ct , PA,t , Rt ; H) + ζEV1,t+1 (·, ·, St+1 ; O1 ) ,
                                            Ct ,PA,t ,Rt ,St+1


where O1 = (H, K, Q, fA ). The expectation is taken jointly across the distribution of Dt+1 and
τA,t+1 , and the choices are subject to the exogenous earnings process, the exogenous DI approval
process, the borrowing constraint St+1 ≥ 0, the tax-transfer system, and the intertemporal budget
constraint:
                                                 St+1 = (1 + r) (It + St − Ct )                                                  (11)

where r is the real interest rate. To close the model, we follow Low & Pistaferri (2015) in assuming
exogenous and fully anticipated retirement at age 62. Retirement is characterized by consuming
out of savings and retirement benefits b1 . At the end of retirement, death occurs exogenously. The
terminal condition of zero savings must be satisfied upon death.
   The dynamic optimization problem of married households is analogously,

 V2,t (Dt , τA,t , τS,t , St ; O2 ) =           max                U2 (Ct , PA,t , PS,t , Rt ; H) + ζEV2,t+1 (·, ·, ·, St+1 ; O2 ) ,
                                        Ct ,PA,t ,PS,t ,Rt ,St+1


where O2 = (H, K, Q, fA , fS ). The expectation is taken jointly across the distribution of Dt+1 ,
τA,t+1 , and τS,t+1 , and the choices are subject to the exogenous earnings process of each spouse,
the exogenous DI approval process, the borrowing constraint, the tax-transfer system, and the
intertemporal budget constraint. The model for married households is closed the same way as for
single and unmarried households, with retirement benefits denoted by b2 .
   The model for married households allows two sources of interdependencies between spouses.
As usual in models of household labor supply, spouses depend on one another through the house-
hold budget constraint, as the earnings of each spouse is assumed to be shared in the household’s
consumption. This means the wages and labor supply of one spouse affect the incentives for the
other spouse to work through the resources available for household consumption. In addition, the

                                                                      32
household utility function is specified such that the labor disutility of one spouse may depend on
whether the other spouse is working, which accommodates leisure complementarity (or the value
of caring for a non-working disabled spouse). Blundell et al. (2016b) find evidence of such leisure
complementarity in a model of household labor supply.




Estimation and identification

To take the model to the data, we adopt a three-step procedure. In the first step, we estimate the
parameters of the earnings process similarly to Low & Pistaferri (2015), as described above. In the
second step, certain model parameters are set externally. We follow Low & Pistaferri (2015) in fixing
the relative risk aversion coefficient to µM = 1.5, the intertemporal discount rate to ζ = 0.9756,
and the interest rate to r = 0.016. We specify annual retirement benefits as the minimum pension
benefits provided under Norwegian law.
       In the third step, we use the method of simulated moments to jointly estimate all remaining
parameters, conditional on the estimated earnings parameters from the first step and the externally
set parameters from the second step. For any given candidate parameters, we simulate the model
recursively beginning with the terminal condition and ending with decisions made in the period after
initial DI allowance.33 The output of the model simulation is the set of optimal choices that would
be made by the household given the candidate parameters. We choose the optimal parameters
as those candidate parameters that minimize a weighted distance metric between observed data
moments (discussed below) and corresponding moments simulated from the model. See Appendix
B for further details.
       All estimated model parameters except for the disutility parameters are identified directly from
sample data moments given the distributional assumptions about the error terms. The parameter
πM,H,t in Equation (10) is the DI approval rate upon reapplication for households with marital
status M and disability severity H at time t, identified from the observed DI approval rate in the
sample conditional on (M, H, t). Equation (8) can be expressed equivalently as the linear regression
of log disposable income on log earnings of the household, where the terms log (1 − ΛM,Dt ,K,t ) and
1 − ΨM,Dt ,K,t are the intercept and slope, respectively. Conditional on (M, Dt , K, t), the parameters
are identified from the mean of log disposable income and the mean of the expectation of log
disposable income conditional on log earnings among households in which neither the appellant
  33
    The value function does not have a closed form solution. To solve for it, we discretize the state-space by forming
a grid in each of savings, appellant potential earnings state, and spousal potential earnings state (if a spouse is
present), as detailed in Appendix B.1. Each grid is formed using equally-spaced quantiles from the observed marginal
distributions of savings and earnings, so that more grid points are positioned around denser regions. To compute the
continuation value, bivariate Gaussian quadrature is used to integrate across the joint distribution of earnings shocks
for the appellant and spouse (if present). Cubic spline interpolation is fit to map the discretized value and policy
functions into continuous value and policy functions, as detailed in Appendix B.2. The value functions are computed
and cubic splines fit separately for each discrete type in the state-space of the model. Finally, the cubic splines are
applied to the full sample in each observed time period to simulate the optimal choices of each household as a function
of their discrete and continuous state-space values.

Notes: The x-axis is the parameter representing the disutility of labor for spouses in married households, which we vary while
fixing all other parameters to their estimated values. The y-axis is the average labor supply of spouses. The solid line indicates
the observed value in the data, while the dashed line indicates the value simulated from the estimated model. The spousal
disutility of labor is pinned down as the point on the x-axis that corresponds to the crossing of the solid and dashed lines.



nor the spouse (if present) is working. Analogously, ΦM,Dt ,K,t is identified as the mean transfer to
unemployed households conditional on (M, Dt , K, t). Although the tax-transfer parameters could
be estimated in a first step like the earnings process, we estimate these parameters simultaneously
with the other model parameters in order to improve efficiency.
    While the mapping between model parameters and sample moments is less direct for the disutility
parameters, there are data moments that intuitively provide identifying information. While all
parameters are estimated simultaneously, it can be instructive to focus on one parameter at a time.
For instance, consider the disutility of labor supply of an unmarried appellant of a given health
H, φ1,A,H . This parameter is pinned down by seeking the value of the disutility of labor supply
that is consistent with the observed employment rate for this group of appellants given the gains in
disposable income from working, which are in turn determined by the wage equation and the tax
transfer function (which are identified separately). Appendix Figure A.7 illustrates this exercise by
using the model to simulate or predict the employment rate for any given value of φ1,A,H . Holding all
other parameters fixed, the simulated employment rate is monotonically decreasing in φ1,A,H . The
disutility of labor is pinned down as the parameter value that equates the simulated employment rate
to its observed value. The other disutility parameters are recovered by similar revealed preference
arguments. Figure 5 and Appendix Figure A.7 demonstrate that each disutility parameter has a
unique value that matches the simulated moment to the observed data moment.
    We estimate the model separately for married couples (47 parameters) and unmarried individuals
(46 parameters). To pin down these parameters, we match 57 moments (47 raw data moments
and ten IV estimates) for married couples and 52 moments (46 raw data moments and six IV
estimates) for unmarried individuals. We choose two sets of moments to match. The first set

                                                                         34

consists of raw data moments, chosen based on the identification arguments above. These moments
are mean log disposable income and expected log disposable income conditional on log earnings
among households that supply labor; mean disposable income among households that do not supply
labor; and employment rates and reapplication rates among those not receiving DI. Each of these
moments is matched conditional on observable types over which the parameters vary in order to
pin down all of the type-specific model parameters. The second set of moments is the IV results for
consumption, disposable income, and earnings among appellants and spouses. These are included
to discipline the model to recover our estimates of the causal effects of DI allowance.34

8.2      Empirical results
Parameter estimates and model fit

The externally set parameters and estimated utility parameters are presented in panels A and B
of Appendix Table A.8, respectively, while the estimated parameters from the earnings processes
are reported in Appendix Table A.7. The parameters are precisely estimated. As anticipated,
and in agreement with results by Low & Pistaferri (2015), we find that the disutility of labor
for appellants is strictly increasing in the severity of disability for married as well as single and
unmarried households.
       To interpret the magnitude of the utility parameters, we use the fitted models to simulate
how employment rates of appellants and spouses change with a permanent one percent increase in
  34
    We equally weight the two sets of moments. Within each set, we use the diagonal weighting matrix to form the
objective function, which is equivalent to weighting each deviation between an observed and simulated moment by the
inverse of the standard deviation of the observed moment. This is the form of the objective function in Equation (13)
of Blundell et al. (2016a) and is motivated by the finding of Altonji & Segal (1996) that the asymptotically efficient
weighting matrix has poor small-sample properties. We use a particle swarm numerical optimization algorithm to
solve for the globally optimal parameters, and we validate the optimum locally using the BFGS algorithm. We use
the block bootstrap to perform inference. See Appendix B.3 for further details.

disposable income from working, obtaining (Marshallian) labor supply elasticities (see Appendix
Table A.9). Because few appellants on DI are working, we focus on employment responses in the
non-DI state. We obtain plausible labor supply elasticities. Our own-wage labor elasticities range
from 0.20 to 0.36. Keane (2011) provides a survey of own wage Marshallian labor elasticities, which
range from -0.47 to 0.51 in papers published over the past two decades. In more recent work,
Blundell et al. (2016b) obtain estimates ranging from -0.08 to 0.42, while Blundell et al. (2016a)
obtain estimates ranging from 0.22 to 1.36 for females only. Our cross spouse wage labor elasticities
range from -0.35 to -0.30. By comparison, Blundell et al. (2016b) reports estimates ranging from
-0.75 to -0.22.
    Table 9 compares the IV estimates of the causal effects of DI allowance on disposable income
and consumption (repeated from Tables 6 and 7) to the effects simulated from the model.35 The
model is relatively successful in replicating both consumption and income effects of DI allowance.
Figure 6 compares the IV estimates of the effect of DI allowance on spousal labor earnings over time
in the data versus the simulation. Importantly, the model is able to replicate the time trend in the
effects of DI participation on spousal employment. When we consider the other targeted moments
(which vary much less over time), the model also performs well. Appendix Figure A.8 summarizes
how the models fit all 109 moments (including the IV estimates and the raw data moments). Since
the variables behind the moments are measured in different units (e.g. income versus employment),
we divide the difference between an actual and a simulated moment by the standard deviation of
the respective variable. The distribution is centered around zero, and only for a small fraction of

Household valuation of DI receipt

Building on the successful fit of the structural estimates to the IV estimates of the effects of DI
allowance on earnings and total household income and consumption—and the plausible labor supply
elasticities implied by the model—we now apply the estimated structural model to explore house-
holds’ willingness to pay for an initial DI allowance, by which we mean the yearly disposable income
that appellants would be willing to give up to be allowed DI at appeal. We refer to Appendix B.4
for details on how this willingness to pay value is computed.
    The results of this estimation are shown in Table 10. Panel A presents the average willing-
ness to pay for initial DI allowance and compares it to the average income and fiscal cost effects
presented above. We find that non-married households have statistically significant and relatively
high average willingness to pay for a DI allowance ($11,316 yearly, per household member). By
comparison, the average willingness to pay is relatively low for married households ($2,300 yearly,
per household member). Note that this willingness to pay value is annualized for comparability
with the annual income and fiscal cost effects; the total lifetime value of an initial DI allowance is of
course many times greater than the annualized value. Comparing the willingness to pay to the effect
of DI allowance on disposable income, we estimate that average willingness to pay among married


                                                            37
households is about $4,400 greater (per year) than the net effect of an initial DI allowance on house-
hold income. For unmarried households, estimated willingness to pay is about $1,900 greater than
the net effect of the allowance on household income. This pattern of results indicates that married
households primarily value receiving a DI allowance because it enables a reduction in labor supply
whereas unmarried households primarily value receipt of a DI allowance because it raises household
disposable income.

Note: This table shows estimates of the average welfare benefit ($1,000, per household member, annuitized over the four years
after initial DI allowance) of DI receipt for married people and single and unmarried individuals. In the row titled, “Net of
income effect,” we subtract the average effect of DI on disposable income from the average willingness to pay. In the row titled
“per dollar of fiscal costs,” we divide the average willingness to pay by the average effect of DI on fiscal costs. In the row titled
“as a share of household consumption,” we divide the willingness to pay by the level of consumption for each household. The
hypothesis test H0 : W T P = 0 correspond to testing whether the willingness to pay for DI receipt is equal to zero. P-values are
based on reestimating the model on 20 block bootstrap replicates of the data (where the block corresponds to the individual).


     Comparing the willingness to pay for a DI allowance relative to its fiscal cost suggests that, on
average, each net dollar in public expenditure induced by a DI allowance raises the (money metric)
welfare of single and unmarried awardees by nearly $0.92. While the fiscal costs of DI allowance
are nearly twice as large as the money-metric welfare benefits accruing to married households, the
estimated willingness to pay of $0.58 per dollar of fiscal costs remains substantial. Benchmarking

                                                                 38
willingness to pay against consumption levels, the average DI allowance is valued at about about
43% of annual consumption for single and unmarried households and 9% of annual consumption for
married households. Panel B displays several moments of the estimated willingness to pay for DI
allowances across households. The difference in willingness to pay between unmarried households
and married households is $3,166 at the 25th percentile, $6,274 at the median, and $12,563 at the
75th percentile.
       While the results in Table 10 suggest that valuation of DI receipt is substantially lower among
married than unmarried households, we note that these estimates do not account for the ex ante
insurance value of DI, and hence may understate total household valuation of the DI system. It is
therefore important to bear in mind that these estimates do not preclude the possibility that both
unmarried and married households value the DI system at more than its cost.

Quantifying the importance of spousal labor and other insurance mechanisms

In table 11, we report results from counterfactual analyses that help us assess the extent to which
spousal labor supply, savings, and reapplication buffer the household welfare consequences of a DI
denial versus allowance at appeal.
       In the first counterfactual exercise, reported in panel B, we set each spouse’s labor supply to
be equal to his or her labor supply in the year prior to the appeal decision. In effect, the spouse is
prevented from adjusting labor supply in response to whether the appellant is initially allowed or
denied DI. Eliminating the option for a spousal labor supply response substantially increases the
willingness of married households to pay for DI; indeed, this restriction substantially eliminates the
difference in the willingness to pay of married versus unmarried households. This result underscores
the importance of spousal labor supply as an alternative household-level mechanism for buffering
income losses from disability that are not compensated by the DI program.
       In the next counterfactual exercise (reported in panel C), we set the savings of each house-
hold equal to zero at the time of the appeal decision. This has little effect on willingness to pay
for DI receipt since appellant households tend to have little savings, and so savings provides little
self-insurance against disability in this population. By contrast, the possibility of reapplying has
important implications for households’ valuations of an initial DI allowance. When we impose the
constraint in panel D that denied appellants cannot reapply for DI benefits, we find that households
would be willing to pay far more for an initial allowance on appeal: 6.7 times as much among mar-
ried households and 1.7 times as much among unmarried households.36 This substantial increase in
willingness to pay underscores that a key mechanism that insures households against the financial
costs of an initial unsuccessful appeal is the opportunity to reapply for benefits—where more than
half of initially appellants receive a DI allowance within four years (Table 4 panel A). Stated dif-
ferently, appellant households are willing to pay far less for an initial successful appeal than they
would be willing to pay to ultimately receive DI benefits. By the same logic, the marginal fiscal cost
  36
     Formally, we set the probability of being allowed DI upon reapplication equal to zero—so appellants who are denied
at the appeal never reapply—and then compare appellants’ willingness to pay in the constrained and unconstrained
settings.

of granting one additional DI allowance is far higher than the marginal fiscal cost of granting an
initial appeal since the majority of initially denied appellants will be subsequently granted benefits.

spousal labor,” we compute the willingness to pay for DI receipt while constraining the spousal labor supply to the observed
labor supply during the year before DI allowance is announced. In the rows titled “No reapplication,” we compute the willingness
to pay for DI receipt while constraining denied appellants from reapplying for benefits by setting the probability of transitioning

Robustness to relaxing the borrowing constraint

Following Low & Pistaferri (2015), we have so far assumed that households can save but not bor-
row—meaning that they cannot have negative net wealth. To examine the sensitivity of our findings
to this assumption, we relax the borrowing constraint when computing willingness to pay for DI.


                                                               40
This is done by simulating optimal consumption and employment profiles with a modified budget
constraint that allows households to borrow up to $5,000. We find that the mean WTP for single
households falls from about $11,300 to about $10,400, while the mean WTP for married households
is unaffected at around $2,300.
    Why does allowing for borrowing have such a small effect on our WTP estimates? Three factors
disincentivize borrowing in our setting. First, DI appellant households tend to be relatively old and
do not anticipate high future income against which to borrow. Indeed, income after retirement is
often less than working income, so households will tend to save rather than borrow so as to maintain
consumption in retirement. Second, there are several sources of uncertainty in our model, including
the risk of lost wages and the risk of DI denial. This uncertainty disincentivizes borrowing, instead
leading households to desire a buffer stock of savings. Third, while borrowing may help households
smooth the effects of modest, transitory shocks, DI denials typically generate relatively large and
persistent changes in income. As a consequence, forward–looking households will not seek to smooth
these income changes through borrowing.


9    Conclusion
While a mature literature finds that DI receipt discourages work, the welfare implications of this
finding depend on two rarely studied economic quantities: the value that individuals and families
place on receipt of disability benefits; and the full cost of DI allowances to taxpayers, summing
over DI transfer payments, benefit substitution to or from other transfer programs, and induced
changes in tax receipts. We assess these missing margins in the context of Norway’s DI system,
drawing on two strengths of the Norwegian environment: Norwegian register data, which allow us
to characterize the household impacts and fiscal costs of disability receipt by linking employment,
taxation, benefits receipt, and assets at the person and household level; and random assignment of
DI applicants to Norwegian judges who differ systematically in their leniency, allowing us to recover
the causal effects of DI allowance on individuals at the margin of program entry.
    Accounting for the total effect of DI allowances on both household labor supply and net payments
across all public transfer programs substantially alters our picture of the consumption benefits and
fiscal costs of disability receipt. While DI denial causes a significant drop in household income
and consumption on average, it has little impact on income or consumption of married appellants;
spousal earnings and benefit substitution counteract the effect of denial of DI benefit payments on
household income.
    To explore the welfare implications of these findings, we estimate a dynamic model of household
behavior that translates employment, reapplication and savings decisions into revealed preferences
for leisure and consumption. We use the estimated model to compute the welfare benefits of DI
receipt, and to perform counterfactual exercises that help us infer the extent to which spousal labor
supply, savings, and reapplication attenuate the welfare loss from DI denial at appeal. The model
estimates suggest that the cash-equivalent value of DI benefits is positive and sizable: on average,



                                                 41
each net dollar in public expenditure induced by a DI allowance raises the (money metric) welfare
of single and unmarried awardees by nearly $0.92 and of married households by $0.58. The value of
DI receipt is smaller for married than unmarried DI appellants in substantial part because spousal
labor supply of married DI appellants strongly buffers the household income and consumption
consequences of DI allowance or denial.
   When considering the interpretation and generality of our study, we emphasize four caveats.
First, our structural model permits us to estimate the economic value of the transfer component of
DI benefits—that is, the cash equivalent value of a DI award—but does not encompass the ex ante
insurance value of the DI system for potential applicants. Since this insurance value is doubtless
positive and potentially large, our estimates should not be interpreted as a full accounting of the
welfare value of the DI system.
   Second, in considering the implications of our findings for the U.S. Social Security Disability
Insurance system (SSDI), it is worth noting that the SSDI program features a lower income replace-
ment rate than the Norwegian system, and hence allowances and denials might be expected to have
less pronounced effects on spousal labor supply. Conversely, the cash and in-kind transfers available
to non-SSDI households in the U.S. are surely less comprehensive than in Norway, so the marginal
impact of a DI allowance on individual and household consumption may be as large or larger for
U.S. than Norwegian households, despite the lesser generosity of the U.S. program.
   Third, we emphasize that the estimates we obtain from quasi-experimental variation in judicial
disability determinations correspond to the average effect of DI allowance for individuals who could
potentially have received a different allowance decision in the appeal process had their case been
assigned to a different judge. Since the work capacity of individuals at the margin of program entry
is likely to differ from that of inframarginal individuals, one must be cautious in extrapolating the
causal estimates obtained here to the broader population at large as well as other programmatic
settings. Nevertheless, the economic consequences of DI receipt for marginal DI claimants are
relevant for policy. In both Norway and the U.S., the rise in DI rolls in recent decades is driven in
significant part by de jure or de facto changes in the screening criteria applied to claimants reporting
difficult-to-verify disorders, such as back pain or mental disorders (Autor & Duggan, 2006; Kostol
& Mogstad, 2014). Logically, reforms aimed at altering DI screening criteria are likely to have the
largest impacts on applicants on the margin of program entry, a substantial share of whom are
applicants with difficult-to-verify disorders. These observations suggest that while the estimates
provided by this paper are not directly generalizable to the full DI population, they are likely to be
informative for policymaking.
   Fourth, our structural model makes several strong assumptions. For example, we ignore that
many households allocate a considerable portion of their budgets to consumption items that are
not easily adjustable (e.g. durable goods and housing). The presence of such so-called consumption
commitments is likely to re-enforce spousal labor supply responses to temporary or moderate income
cuts to the other spouse (see e.g. Chetty & Szeidl, 2007). In particular, by increasing labor supply
after a negative income shock, the household can maintain current consumption and avoid a costly



                                                  42
adjustment to a shock which may prove transitory. If, however, shocks are large and persistent—as
may be true for DI denials—then consumption commitments will matter less for spousal labor supply
response since shocks of this type will induce households to optimally abandon their previously
committed expenditures. Note finally that the presence of consumption commitments should lead
to larger spousal labor supply responses in the short than long run, since these commitments can
normally be unwound over time. In contrast, we find that spousal labor supply responses to DI
denials build over time, suggesting that the adjustment cost of adjusting hours, accumulating skills,
or seeking new employment may play a more important role than consumption commitments in
determining the trajectory of spousal labor supply.

Notes: The figure plots judge allowance rate against the total number of cases handled by each judge. There are 75 unique
judges, and on average, each judge has handled a total of 325 cases. Allowance rates are normalized by subtracting off year
× department deviations from the overall mean. Cases are restricted to claimants appealing their first denied case during the
period 1994-2005. Dot size is proportional to the number of cases a judge handles in the estimation sample (which is weakly
smaller than the number of cases they have ever handled, as plotted on the x-axis).

                         (g) Married: Reapplication disutility (h) Unmarried: Reapplication disutility
Notes: These figures illustrate local identification of the six labor disutility parameters for appellants and two disutility pa-
rameters associated with reapplication. In each figure, the x-axis is the parameter representing the disutility. The y-axis is the
corresponding moment, which is the average labor supply rate by severity type for labor disutility parameters and the average
reapplication rate for reapplication disutility parameters. The solid line indicates the observed value in the data, while the
dashed line indicates the value simulated from the estimated model, holding all other parameters fixed to their estimated values.
The disutility is pinned down as the point on the x-axis that corresponds to the crossing of the solid and dashed lines.

Notes: This table reports heterogeneity in first stage estimates using the baseline instrument (1) and the reverse-sample instru-
ment (2). The first stage specification in (1) corresponds to panel B in Table 3. The reverse-sample instrument (2) is constructed
by calculating judge leniency using all cases except for those in the specified subsample (e.g., judge leniency for the subsample
of older applicants is constructed using judges’ decisions for younger applicants). We exclude appellants whose judges handled
fewer than ten cases in the reverse sample.

Note: This table reports the impact of DI allowance on earnings and total transfers among married (panel A and B) and
unmarried appellants (panel C and D). Baseline estimation sample consists of unmarried DI applicants who appeal an initially
denied DI claim during the period 1994-2005 (see Section 3 for further details). There are 75 unique judges. All regressions
include fully interacted year and department dummies, dummy variables for month of appeal, county of residence, age at appeal,
household size, gender, foreign born, marital status, children below age 18, education, and number of medical diagnoses. All
control variables are measured prior to appeal.

Note: This table reports the impact of judge leniency on the probability of death or migration, the probability of a change
in marital status, or membership in the restricted sample. Baseline estimation sample consists of individuals who appeal an
initially denied DI claim during the period 1994-2005 (see Section 3 for further details). The second to fourth columns exclude
those who die or migrate during the year of the appeal. The second column tests whether DI allowance affects the likelihood of
a change in marital status (married to non-married or vice versa) for the baseline sample, and the third and fourth columns test
whether DI allowance affected marriage entry and exit rates respectively. There are 75 unique judges. All regressions mirror the
reduced form specification of Table 4.

individuals who appeal an initially denied DI claim during the period 1994-2005 (see Section 3 for further details). There are
75 unique judges. All regressions include fully interacted year and department dummies, dummy variables for month of appeal,
county of residence, age at appeal, household size, gender, foreign born, marital status, children below age 18, education, and a
number of medical diagnoses. All control variables are measured prior to appeal.

Notes: This table compares labor supply elasticities for married households and single and unmarried households by severity
of disability. Because few appellants allowed DI are working, we consider in the immediately following year the subsample
initially denied DI. These are Marshallian elasticities, that is, labor supply responses to permanent wage shocks. We compute
the elasticity using the finite-difference evaluated at a one standard deviation permanent shock to the log wage.

Note: This table shows estimates of the average welfare benefit ($1,000, per household member, annuitized over the four years
after initial DI allowance) of DI allowance at appeal for married households and single and unmarried households. In the rows
titled “Unconstrained”, we use the estimated model to compute the welfare benefit of DI receipt. In the row titled, “Constrained
spousal labor,” we compute the willingness to pay for DI receipt while constraining the spousal labor supply to the observed
labor supply during the year before DI allowance is announced. In the rows titled “No reapplication,” we compute the willingness
to pay for DI receipt while constraining denied appellants from reapplying for benefits by setting the probability of transitioning
into DI equal to zero. The hypotheses tests correspond to testing equality in the average willingness with and without correcting
for selectivity bias in the estimation of the earnings processes. P-values are based on reestimating the model on 20 block
bootstrap replicates of the data (where the block corresponds to the individual).

B.1      Solving the Model, given a Discrete State Space
Here, we detail the algorithm used to compute the value function at each time period for each
type of household, given a discrete state space. In particular, we present the algorithm for value
functions after retirement (both single and married households), before retirement with DI (for single
households only), and before retirement without DI (for single households only). The algorithms
before retirement for married households are identical to those for single households, except that
there is an additional choice (spousal labor supply) and an additional source of uncertainty that
must be integrated out (spousal wage shocks), so we omit the algorithms for married households for
brevity. The algorithms rely on a discretized state space in the continuous state variables, savings
St and log wages log Wt ; denote the associated grids by S for savings and W for log wages.

B.1.1      Solution Algorithm after Retirement

We begin the solution method by solving for the value function at the years during retirement,
which is simpler than the working age model because it does not involve labor supply (and the
associated wage uncertain) or disability insurance (and the associated reapplication process).

    1. Year of death (t = T + 10, where T is retirement year). In the final year of life, the household
       optimally consumes all remaining savings ST +10 plus retirement benefits b, so consumption
      is optimally given by CT +10 = ST +10 + b. The value function is then VM,T +10 (ST +10 ) =
          1
        1−µM   (ST +10 + b)1−µM , so given parameters (b, µM ), VM,T +10 is known for all ST +10 . We
      evaluate VM,T +10 for all ST +10 ∈ S.

  2. Year prior to death (t = T + 9): The value function is simply,
      VM,T +9 (ST +9 ) = maxCT +9 ,ST +10        1
                                               1−µM   (CT +9 )1−µM + ζVT +10 (ST +10 ) subject to the budget
      constraint ST +10 ≤ (1 + r) (ST +9 + b − CT +9 ). Given (b, µM , r, ζ) and VM,T +10 from 1., we
      find ST +10 ∈ S such that VM,T +9 is maximized, ruling out those ST +10 that do not satisfy the
      budget constraint. This is done for each ST +9 ∈ S.

  3. We then repeat the procedure in 2. for t = T + 8, t = T + 7, . . . , t = T + 1. Note also
      that the terminal condition is always satisfied, since all remaining savings are consumed at
      t = T + 10 and ST +11 = 0. Lifetime utility would be infinitely negative if CT +10 = ST +10 + b
      were negative with positive probability, so households will use precautionary savings across
      the lifecycle to ensure that ST +10 ≥ −b.

This procedure yields VM,t (St ) for each t = T + 1, . . . , T + 10, for each St in the grid of possible
values, given only the parameters (b, µM , r, ζ).

B.1.2     Solution Algorithm before Retirement for a Single Household with Disability
          Insurance

A single household (M = 1) with DI (Dt = 1) chooses appellant labor supply (PA,t ) and savings,
which also determines consumption through the budget constraint. This is only more complicated
than the retired household’s problem due to the need to account for the labor supply decision and
associated wage uncertainty, as well as the tax-transfer system that maps earnings, DI status, and
household characteristics into disposable income.

  1. One year prior to retirement (t = T ): The household’s problem is,
      V1,T (Dt = 1, log WA,T , ST ; O1 ) = maxPA,T ,CT ,ST +1      1
                                                                 1−µ1   (CT exp (−φ1,A,H PA,T ))1−µ1 +ζVT +1 (ST +1 )
      subject to the budget constraint ST +1 ≤ (1 + r) (ST + IT − CT ). Note that we express the
      value function in terms of the observed log wage log WA,t rather than the shock τA,t , as
      each is known from the other given O1 and t (see the wage equation in the main text).
      Furthermore, disposable income is determined by I = (1 − Λ    T  ) (E )(1−Ψ1,1,K,T ) if
                                                                                   1,1,K,T   A,t
      PA,t = 1 and IT = Φ1,1,K,T if PA,T = 0, where ET = WA,T PA,T is earnings. Recall that
      VM,T +1 is known from the retirement solution. Given V1,T +1 (ST +1 ), we evaluate the objective
          1
        1−µ1   (CT exp (−φ1,A,H PA,T ))1−µ1 + ζVT +1 (ST +1 ) for each PA,T ∈ {0, 1}, ST +1 ∈ S, choos-
      ing the objective-maximizing combination as the optimal household solution, which yields
      V1,T (Dt = 1, log WA,T , ST ; O1 ), given each state space combination ST ∈ S, log WT ∈ W, O1 .

  2. Two years prior to retirement (t = T −1): The household’s problem is V1,T −1 (DT −1 = 1, log WA,T −1 , ST −1 ; O1 )
      maxPA,T −1 ,CT −1 ,ST     1
                              1−µ1   (CT −1 exp (−φ1,A,H PA,T −1 ))1−µ1 + ζEV1,T (DT = 1, ·, ST ; O1 ). Since
      we know from 1. how to compute V1,T (Dt = 1, log WA,t , ST ; O1 ) for each log WA,T ∈ W, we can
      integrate across the distribution of log WA,T to compute the expectation EV1,T (DT = 1, ·, ST ; O1 ).
      In particular, since we have assumed log WA,t follows a random walk process, then log WA,T
      is Normally distributed with mean log WA,T −1 , so we can use Gaussian quadrature to ap-
      proximate the integral numerically. Given EV1,T (DT = 1, ·, ST ; O1 ), we evaluate the objective
          1
        1−µ1   (CT −1 exp (−φ1,A,H PA,T −1 ))1−µ1 + ζEV1,T (DT = 1, ·, ST ; O1 ) for each PA,T −1 ∈ {0, 1},
      ST ∈ S, choosing the objective-maximizing combination as the optimal household solution,
      which yields V1,T −1 (DT −1 = 1, log WA,T −1 , ST −1 ; O1 ), given each state space combination
      ST −1 ∈ S, log WT −1 ∈ W, O1 .

   3. We then repeat the procedure in 2. for t = T − 2, t = T − 3, . . . , t = 1. Recall that T = 27
      for single households that are young at the time of appeal and T = 11 for households that
      are old at the time of appeal, so we must compute the algorithm separately for young and old
      households.

This procedure yields V1,t (Dt = 1, τA,t , St ; O1 ) for each t = 1, . . . , T , for each discretized (St , log WA,t , O1 )
combination, given the model parameters.

B.1.3     Solution Algorithm before Retirement for a Single Household without Disabil-
          ity Insurance

A single household without DI chooses appellant labor supply, reapplication (Rt ), and savings,
which also determines consumption through the budget constraint. This is only more complicated
than the solution algorithm with DI because the household must choose DI reapplication and we
must account for the probability of receiving DI approval in the next period.

   1. Year prior to retirement (t = T ): The household’s problem is,
      V1,T (Dt = 0, log WA,T , ST ; O1 ) = maxPA,T ,CT ,RT ,ST +1        1
                                                                       1−µ1   (CT exp (−φ1,A,H PA,T ) − RT exp (ω1 ))1−µ1 +
      ζVT +1 (ST +1 ) subject to the budget constraint ST +1 ≤ (1 + r) (ST + IT − CT ), where earnings
      and disposable income are determined analogously to the case with DI. Recall that VM,T +1
      is known from the retirement solution, so for each O1 , we can directly compute the objec-
      tive       1
               1−µ1   (CT exp (−φ1,A,H PA,T ))1−µ1 + ζVT +1 (ST +1 ) for each combination of PA,T ∈ {0, 1},
      RT ∈ {0, 1}, ST +1 ∈ S, log WT ∈ W , choosing the maximizing combination as the optimal
      household solution, which yields V1,T (Dt = 1, log WA,T , ST ; O1 ), given each state space combi-
      nation ST −1 ∈ S, log WT −1 ∈ W, O1 . Note that RT = 0 is always optimal, since reapplication
      incurs a cost but no benefits are received due to retirement in the next period.

   2. One year earlier (t = T −1): The household’s problem is V1,T −1 (DT −1 = 0, log WA,T −1 , ST −1 ; O1 ) =
      maxPA,T −1 ,RT −1 ,CT −1 ,ST     1
                                     1−µ1   (CT −1 exp (−φ1,A,H PA,T −1 ) − RT −1 exp (ω1 ))1−µ1 +ζEV1,T (·, ·, ST ; O1 ).
      Note that we can write,
      EV1,T (·, ·, ST ; O1 ) = (1 − π1,H,T −1 ) EV1,T (DT = 0, ·, ST ; O1 )+π1,H,T −1 EV1,T (DT = 1, ·, ST ; O1 )
      using the DI approval rate π1,H,T −1 . Since we know from 1. how to compute V1,T (Dt = 0, log WA,t , ST ; O1 )
      for each log WA,T ∈ W, we can integrate across the distribution of log WA,T to compute the ex-
      pectation EV1,T (DT = 0, ·, ST ; O1 ). Given EV1,T (DT = 1, ·, ST ; O1 ) and EV1,T (DT = 0, ·, ST ; O1 ),
         we evaluate the objective of V1,T −1 (DT −1 = 1, log WA,T −1 , ST −1 ; O1 ) at each combination of
         PA,T −1 ∈ {0, 1}, RT −1 ∈ {0, 1}, ST ∈ S, choosing the objective-maximizing combination as
         the optimal household solution, which yields V1,T −1 (Dt = 1, log WA,T −1 , ST −1 ; O1 ), given each
         state space combination ST −1 ∈ S, log WT −1 ∈ W, O1 .

   3. We then repeat the procedure in 2. for t = T − 2, t = T − 3, . . . , t = 1. Again, we must
         compute the algorithm separately for young and old households.

This procedure yields V1,t (Dt = 0, τA,t , St ; O1 ) for each t = 1, . . . , T , for each discretized (St , log WA,t , O1 )
combination, given the model parameters.

B.1.4       Feasible Discretization of the State Space

The algorithms described above rely on the discretized state spaces S and W. We construct a
grid in each using equally spaced quantiles of the observed marginal distributions of savings and
wages, respectively. In practice, we use ten points to represent the state space for St and ten
points to represent the state space for log Wt . We investigate the robustness of the model results
to this approximation for single households by allowing for 100 points in the state space for St
and 100 points in the state space for log WA,t , so that there are 100 times as many grid points
and the model requires approximately 100 times longer to compute. We find that the model fit is
similar, suggesting that the model solution is not very sensitive to additional fineness of the grid.
When integrating across the distribution of log WA,t , we construct the 10 × 10 transition matrix
representing the probability of transitioning to any point on the grid from any other point on the
grid using the conditional Normal probability distribution function evaluated at each point.
       The implied computational burden is substantial. For single households before retirement with-
out DI that are young at the time of appeal, one simulation of the model requires millions of distinct
numerical evaluations, with even more for married households.1 We must then also perform these
evaluations for young single and married households with DI, old single and married households
without DI, and old single and married households with DI, as well as compute the single and
married household value functions after retirement. As discussed below, estimating the unknown
model parameters will require that we repeat these solution algorithms thousands of times, while
bootstrapping the estimates requires thousands more times.
       One other point to note: This approach does not simulate or approximate the initial distribution
of the state space. Instead, it uses the exact observed values. That is, for each household, our
approach computes its predicted optimal choice variables conditional on its observed characteristics,
preserving the exact initial distribution of observed characteristics.
   1
     This is because we must evaluate the value function objective at (10 current savings state points) × (10 next
period savings choice points) × (10 current appellant wage state points) × (2 appellant labor supply choice points)
× (2 DI reapplication choice points) × (12 static household types) × (27 time periods), for a total of over a million
distinct numerical evaluations. For married households, there are also 10 current spouse wage states and 2 spousal
labor supply choice points to consider, for a total of over 20 million distinct numerical evaluations.
B.2      Interpolating the Discretized Model to a Continuous State Space and Sim-
         ulating Sample Moments
Our aim is to use the value functions to infer optimal choices of consumption, labor supply, and
DI reapplication for the households in our sample, given the model parameters. The computational
algorithms described above provide an approximate mapping from the state space to the value
function for a discrete grid of points in the state space. For example, for single households, it
provides a numerical solution to the value function, V1,t , when given a time period t, the vector
of static household characteristics O1 , and the current values of savings in S and log wages in W.
However, it does not provide the value function V1,t or associated optimal choices for St ∈
                                                                                          / S or
log Wt ∈
       / W, which is nearly the entire sample of households.
   In order to approximate optimal household choices (i.e., consumption, labor supply, and DI
reapplication) for all (St , WA,t ) pairs in the observed sample, we use interpolation. In particular, for
each of the choice outcomes, interpolation uses the state space points for which we know the optimal
choices, S × W, to approximate the optimal choices for other state spaces. Our chosen interpolation
method is cubic spline interpolation in the consumption choice and cubic spline interpolation of the
underlying index functions for labor supply and DI reapplication choices. This is implemented using
the “gam” function from the published R package mgcv, version 1.8-12. To allow full flexibility in
the discrete components of the state space, we interpolate separately for each (observed time period
t = 1, 2, 3, 4) × (current DI state 0 or 1) × (household static characteristic OM ) × (marital status
M ). This way, the interpolation method only requires smoothing approximations on the continuous
components of the state space (St , WA,t ), but is unrestricted across discrete components of the state
space.
   For each individual in our sample at each time period, the interpolation fit on the discretized
model provides a prediction of consumption, labor supply, and DI reapplication at times t = 1, 2, 3, 4.
Using these predictions, we then construct the simulated moments from these predictions. For
example, average spousal labor supply is simulated as the mean predicted labor supply of spouses
provided by the interpolation.
   Figure 1 (of this appendix) demonstrates the performance of the interpolation in out-of-grid
prediction for the value function as well as the optimal choice of consumption. In particular, we
first compute V1,t (Dt , log WA,t , St ; O1 ) for t = 1 on the grid G = S × W, separately for each of
the 12 O1 types. Second, we also compute V1,t (Dt , log WA,t , St ; O1 ) for an alternate grid H, where
G ∩H = ∅. We then interpolate V1,t (Dt , log WA,t , St ; O1 ) computed on G onto the points H, which is
an out-of-grid prediction. We choose the points in H to be particularly difficult to match by selecting
the midpoints between any two grid points in G (midpoints maximize the distance between H points
and G points within the same interval).
   The figure shows the out-of-grid prediction of H as triangles, and the in-grid prediction of H from
directly-computing V1,t (Dt , log WA,t , St ; O1 ) on H as circles, where each is formed from averaging
across the 12 O1 types. Visually, the goal of the interpolation is to approximate the circles with
the triangles. This allows us to approximate the value function and optimal choices at thousands of

Notes: This figure demonstrates the performance of the interpolation in out-of-grid prediction  for the value function as well as
the optimal choice of consumption. In particular, we first compute V1,t Dt , log WA,t , St ; O1 for t = 1 on the grid G = S × W,
                                                                                                
separately for each of the 12 O1 types. Second, we also compute V1,t Dt , log WA,t , St ; O1 for an alternate grid H, where
                                                           
G ∩ H = ∅. We then interpolate V1,t Dt , log WA,t , St ; O1 computed on G onto the points H, which is an out-of-grid prediction.
We choose the points in H to be particularly difficult to match by selecting the midpoints between any two grid points in G
(midpoints maximize the distance between H points and G points within the same interval). The figure shows         the out-of-grid
prediction of H as triangles, and the in-grid prediction of H from directly-computing V1,t Dt , log WA,t , St ; O1 on H as circles,
where each is formed from averaging across the 12 O1 types.



out-of-grid points in the sample using only a small grid. We see that the out-of-grid interpolation
predictions track the in-grid directly-computed circles. It performs especially well across the savings
grid and at interior values of the log wage grid. The approximation is less precise at the end points
of the log wages grid, but these points represent only a small sample of outlier observations in the
data.

B.3                                 Solving for the Optimal Parameters
We choose two sets of moments to match. The first set consists of raw data moments, chosen based
on the identification arguments in the text. These moments are mean log disposable income and
expected log disposable income conditional on log earnings among households that supply labor,
mean disposable income among households that do not supply labor, and employment rates and
reapplication rates among those not receiving DI. Each of these moments is matched conditional on
observable types over which the parameters vary in order to pin down all of the type-specific model
parameters. The second set of moments is the IV results for consumption, disposable income, and
earnings among appellants and spouses, included to discipline the model to recover our estimates
of the causal effects of DI allowance.
                           To simulate the moments, we solve the value function, estimate the interpolation splines and
predict the choice of each household, then compute the moment on the predicted household choices.
We compare each simulated moment to the same moment computed on the observed household
choices from the data. We form the objective function by forming the difference between the
observed and simulated moment, and divide by the standard deviation corresponding to the observed
moment. This weighting is equivalent to using the diagonal weighting matrix to form the objective
function, as in Equation (13) of Blundell, et al. (2016) and motivated by the finding of Altonji and
Segal (1996) that the asymptotically efficient weighting matrix has poor small-sample properties.
We weight up the IV moments so that the sum of their weights is equal to that of the raw data
moments.
   We solve numerically for the parameters that minimize this objective function. For each vector
of candidate parameters, we compute the value function on the discrete state space conditional on
these parameters, interpolate to form the model prediction of optimal choices for each household,
then evaluate the objective function for the simulated moments. To minimize the objective function,
we apply two approaches. First, we use a particle swarm optimization algorithm to search for the
globally optimal parameter vector, utilizing the “psoptim” function from the published R package
psoptim, version 1.0. Second, we use the standard BFGS optimization algorithm, initialized at
the optimal parameters found by psoptim, to verify that psoptim has found the locally optimal
parameters. Together, these optimization algorithms require over a thousand complete evaluations
of the model. We perform inference using the block bootstrap, where each bootstrap also requires
estimation using these optimization algorithms. In particular, we randomly draw block replicates of
the sample, where each “block” is a household’s four-year history, then repeat the approach described
above to find the optimal parameter vector for this replication sample. The distribution of each
parameter across replication samples is then used to compute block bootstrap p-values for inference.

B.4    Extracting Willingness to Pay
Once the optimal parameter estimates are obtained, we can use the estimated model to perform
counterfactual exercises. The counterfactual exercise of interest is to solve for the amount of income
a household would be willing to give up each year across the remainder of the working life in
order to be initially approved for DI. In particular, for single households, we parameterize this by
modifying the budget constraint to include a Cost parameter: St+1 ≤ (1 + r) (St + It − Cost − Ct ).
Denote the value function with this budget constraint by V1,t (Dt , log WA,t , St ; O1 , Cost). Then, the
willingness to pay from time t = 1, denoted WTP , solves this equation:

       V1,1 (D1 = 0, log WA,t , St ; O1 , Cost = 0) = V1,1 (D1 = 1, log WA,t , St ; O1 , Cost = WTP )

In words, WTP is the value of Cost that makes the household indifferent between being initially
denied DI (D1 = 0) but paying Cost = 0, and being initially approved DI (D1 = 1) but paying
Cost = WTP annually.
   In practice, we cannot solve the above equation exactly because we do not have a closed-form
representation for V1,1 , so we instead use numerical optimization. For each household in our sample,
we express WTP as the solution to a one-dimensional optimization problem in which we search for
the value of Cost that minimizes the squared deviation from the above equality:

WTP = arg min {V1,1 (D1 = 0, log WA,t , St ; O1 , Cost = 0) − V1,1 (D1 = 1, log WA,t , St ; O1 , Cost = c)}2
              c
We then report the average WTP across the sample of single households, and perform the analogous
procedure for married households.
