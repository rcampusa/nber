        Asset allocation, the decision of how much of a portfolio to allocate to different types of

securities, is one of the fundamental issues in financial economics. For taxable individual investors,

the proliferation of tax-deferred opportunities for retirement saving, such as Individual Retirement

Accounts, 401(k) plans, Keogh plans, and 403(b) plans, has added a new dimension to the traditional

asset allocation problem. A taxable investor needs to make choices not just about the amount to hold

in various types of assets, but also about where to hold these assets. If there are two asset classes,

broadly defined as riskless and risky assets, the asset allocation problem facing a tax-exempt investor

involves a one-dimensional decision: choosing the fraction of the portfolio to allocate to the risky

asset. A taxable investor with a tax-deferred retirement saving account, however, faces a more

complex problem, since he must decide how much of the risky asset to hold in his tax-deferred

account, and how much to hold in his taxable account. Shoven (1999), Shoven and Sialm (2000),

and Dammon, Spatt, and Zhang (2000) label the problem of deciding where to hold a given asset as

the asset location decision.

        How the decision to hold a given asset in a taxable or tax-deferred account affects an

investor's long-term wealth accumulation depends on the tax treatment of the asset in question, as

well as on the menu of other assets that are available. Given the set of assets that an investor wishes

to hold, long-run wealth accumulation will generally be maximized by placing the most heavily taxed

assets in the tax-deferred account (TDA), while holding the less heavily taxed assets in a taxable

account. We refer to the latter as a conventional savings account (CSA).

        The asset location problem is a practical question in applied financial economics, and it

confronts many households as they save for retirement and other objectives. Yet much of the

“conventional wisdom” on asset location for individual investors derives from research on a related

problem confronting corporations. Nearly two decades ago, Black (1980) and Tepper (1981) studied

the problem of asset allocation for a corporation that could choose to hold assets in the company’s

defined benefit pension plan, or on the company’s taxable corporate account. These studies explored


                                                                                                          1
the impact of corporate asset location problems with respect to taxable bonds and corporate equities.

Taxable bonds were assumed to generate heavily-taxed interest income, and corporate equities were

assumed to generate lightly-taxed returns because capital gains are not taxed until they are realized.

These studies concluded that because bonds are taxed more heavily than stocks, a firm could

maximize its shareholders' after-tax cash flow by placing bonds in the pension account and stocks in

the taxable corporate account. The pension account, in this setting, is the equivalent of the individual

investor's tax-deferred account. Something like this analysis underlies the suggestion, made by many

financial advisors, that individual investors should hold taxable bonds in their tax-deferred account

before holding them in their taxable account.

        This common analysis neglects two important aspects of the investment decisions that face

most taxable investors. First, heavily-taxed corporate or government bonds are not the only way for

taxable investors to participate in the market for fixed-income securities. Taxable investors could

also choose to hold tax-exempt bonds. Over the last four decades, the average yield on long-term

tax-exempt bonds has exceeded the after-tax yield for individual investors in the highest marginal tax

brackets. Including the opportunity to hold tax-exempt bonds in the portfolio selection problem can

therefore offer taxable investors the potential to hold fixed-income securities for which the “implicit

tax rate” is lower than the statutory tax rate on taxable bonds.

        The second shortcoming of the standard asset location analysis is that it assumes that

investments in corporate stock are lightly taxed. In practice, many taxable investors hold equities

through equity mutual funds. Many equity funds, particularly actively managed funds, are managed

in a fashion that imposes substantial tax burdens on taxable individual investors. Dickson and

Shoven (1995), Dickson, Shoven, and Sialm (2000), Bergstresser and Poterba (2000), Arnott, Berkin,

and Ye (2000), and others have computed before-tax and after-tax returns for equity mutual funds in

the United States. These studies suggest that because such funds often realize capital gains more




                                                                                                          2
quickly than a tax-deferral strategy might dictate, the effective tax rate on equity investments through

mutual funds is often substantially greater than the tax rate on a buy-and-hold equity portfolio.

        Both of these omissions from the standard analysis of asset location work to overstate the tax

burden on bonds relative to that on stocks. In this paper, we investigate whether these two factors

are important enough to reverse the conventional wisdom offered by financial advisors. We study

whether investors would, historically, have accumulated more after-tax wealth by holding equity

mutual funds in their tax-deferred account, and municipal bonds on taxable account, than by holding

taxable bonds in their tax-deferred account and equity mutual funds on taxable account.

        This paper uses the historical performance of actual mutual funds to explore the asset

location problem. Our earlier work on asset location was either theoretical (Shoven and Sialm

(2000)) or used hypothetical or simulated mutual funds (Shoven (1999) and Shoven and Sialm

(1998)). While using historical data provides information on how following alternative investment

strategies would have fared in past decades, it is possible that the future performance of equity

mutual funds, particularly with respect to their tax efficiency, may vary from their past outcomes.

        We consider a stylized investor who made equal annual contributions to a tax-deferred

account (TDA) and a conventional saving account (CSA) over the period 1962-1998. We assume

that this investor rebalanced his portfolio each year to hold half of his total assets in equities, and half

in fixed income investments. We assume that all equity investments are carried out through one of a

set of equity mutual funds for which we collect returns information, and that fixed-income

investments can be made in tax-exempt as well as taxable bonds.

        Our empirical analysis computes the investor’s after-tax wealth at the end of 1998 under two

different assumptions about the investor’s asset location strategy. The first strategy specifies that

equity, held through one of the equity mutual funds in our data set, will be given a priority location in

the tax-deferred account. Under this rule, if the total market value of the assets in the TDA is less

than half of the combined market value of the assets in the TDA and the CSA, the investor holds only


                                                                                                           3
an equity mutual fund in his tax-deferred account. If the total amount that the investor could hold in

the TDA were more than half of the combined value of the TDA and the CSA, then some of the

TDA, as well as all of the CSA, would be held in fixed income instruments. This would involve

holding taxable bonds in the TDA, and tax-exempt bonds in the CSA.

        The second asset location rule reverses this priority and holds that fixed income assets should

be held in the TDA before any such assets are held in a taxable format. In this case, if the total value

of the TDA assets were less than half of the combined value of the TDA and the CSA, the investor

would hold only taxable bonds in his TDA.

        The paper is divided into five sections. Section one describes the data on equity mutual fund

returns and bond returns that underlie our calculations. We collect data on the annual returns on

twelve large equity mutual funds that have been continuously traded over the 1962-1998 period.

Our calculations use the actual returns on these funds to evaluate the two asset location rules. This

section also describes our assumptions about the marginal tax rates facing the hypothetical taxable

investors whose wealth accumulation we analyze.

        The second section presents our core findings on the amount of wealth that investors would

have accumulated if they had followed two different asset location strategies over the 1962-1998

period. For virtually all of the actively managed mutual funds in our data set, an investor would have

had more end-of-period wealth if he had allocated his mutual fund shares to his tax-deferred account

before holding any equities in his conventional saving account. The differences in end-of period

wealth between the two asset location strategies are substantial for all of the actively-managed funds

in our data sample. These differences are much smaller when consider equity index funds. Our

findings, which stand in contrast to much "convention wisdom," are due both to our recognition of

the opportunity to hold tax-exempt bonds as well as taxable bonds, and to the higher tax burden on

corporate stock that follows from holding equities funds rather than directly.




                                                                                                         4
        In section three, we explore the sensitivity of our findings to the particular pattern of equity

and bond returns that have characterized the last four decades. We evaluate the robustness of our

findings by drawing sequences of thirty-seven returns (with replacement) from the empirical

distribution of returns on each mutual fund. Our results suggest that while the recent history of

returns has been particularly favorable to the asset location strategy that gives priority to equities in

the tax-deferred account, in most cases this strategy generates more after-tax wealth than the “fixed

income in the TDA” strategy.

        The analysis in the first three sections considers an investor whose universe of portfolio

options consists of a corporate bond mutual fund, a tax-exempt bond fund, and equity mutual funds.

In section four, we expand this universe to allow for inflation-indexed bonds such as the Treasury

Inflation Protected Securities that have been available in the United States since 1997. We consider

two ways that investors might hold inflation-indexed bonds: by purchasing TIPS directly, and by

holding inflation-indexed Series I savings bonds. We show that if inflation-indexed bonds with a

four percent real return had been available throughout the 1962-1998 period, then holding equity

mutual funds in the TDA and inflation-indexed savings bonds in the CSA would have given investors

a higher expected utility than holding equity mutual funds in their TDA and tax-exempt nominal

bonds in their CSA. Finally, section five concludes with a summary of our findings.



1. Data on Asset Returns and Investor Tax Rates

        Our analysis of the economic effects of different asset location choices relies on data from

1962-1998. We consider the returns to twelve actively managed equity mutual funds that were

available to investors for the entire 37-year period. Table 1 summarizes the total asset values of the

twelve funds in our dataset. The equity funds are sorted according to their total valuation in

December 1961 and 1968 as listed by Johnson's Charts (1962, 1969). The first five funds ('Top-5-

Funds') were the five largest equity funds at the end of December 1961. Selection and survivorship


                                                                                                            5
bias is important because funds with above-average past performance tend to be larger and are less

likely to be discontinued, as discussed in Carhart (1997). Results using these five largest funds are

not subject to these biases, whereas results using the other funds might be.

        We also collected data for the ten largest equity funds on December 31, 1968, according to

Johnson’s Charts (1969). We augmented this data sample with information on two other funds,

Fidelity Magellan and Vanguard Windsor. Our whole sample represents 29.2 percent of the total

value of mutual funds in 1961 and 33.6 percent in 1968. The sample becomes less representative in

more recent years, as a result of both increase in the total number of mutual funds and a sharp

increase in inflows to equity mutual funds during the 1980s and 1990s. As these inflows were

distributed across the funds in existence in those decades, many of which were new entrants that

were not available in the 1960s, the share of assets in these "old" equity funds declined. In 1998,

data from the Investment Company Institute (2000) suggest that our twelve actively managed mutual

funds held only 2.2 percent of the assets invested in mutual funds.

        The data on the pretax returns and post-tax returns of the equity funds for the years prior to

1992 are taken from Dickson and Shoven (1995). Their dataset is updated using the Standard &

Poor’s Dividend Records (1993-1999) and the Moody’s Dividend Records (1993-1999) for the

distributions (dividends, short-, medium-, and long-term capital gains) and Interactive Data (part of

Financial Times Information) for the net asset values of the funds. The annual total return is defined

as the percentage change in the value at the end of the current year of one mutual fund share

purchased at the end of the previous year. The returns are adjusted for splits as necessary. We assume

that the distributions are re-invested in the mutual funds on the ‘ex-date’.

        To model the taxable and tax-exempt fixed income investment options available to our

hypothetical investor, we use the Vanguard Long-Term Bond Fund and the Vanguard Long-Term

Municipal Bond Fund. The annual distributions and net asset values of the two bond funds are taken

from Morningstar. Both bond funds pay monthly dividends and we assume monthly compounding


                                                                                                         6
when computing their annual returns. In addition to the twelve actively-managed funds that we

consider, we have also constructed a time series of returns that we view as corresponding to a

passively managed S&P 500 index fund. When they are available, we use the returns on the

Vanguard Index 500 Fund for the index fund returns.

         Unfortunately, data for the two bond funds and the index fund are only available after the

mid-1970s. To indicate the type of returns that investors in such funds would have earned if such

funds had been available during the first decade and a half of our sample period, we construct

"synthetic funds." The returns on the synthetic bond funds are calculated from the year-end yields to

maturity of long term corporate bonds (Moody’s Aaa-rated bonds) and of long-term tax-exempt

bonds (with an average rating of A1) as reported in the Statistical Release of the Federal Reserve.

The synthetic bond funds are assumed to hold the bonds for one year. The interest income of the

funds paid at the end of the year equals the yield to maturity at the issue date minus expenses of 50

basis points. Each year, we calculate the capital gain or loss for each bond fund by calculating the

capital gain or loss on 20-year par bonds that were newly-issued at the beginning of the year.1

         Positive capital gains in the synthetic mutual funds are distributed to the shareholders

annually and capital losses are carried forward. To check whether the characteristics of the synthetic

funds are similar to those of the actual funds, we computed returns on the synthetic funds for the

period when we also had returns on the actual equity index fund and on the two bond funds, and we

compared their performance. This is the period 1979-1998. The income and capital gains

distributions of the synthetic bond funds correspond closely to the distributions of the actual bond

funds for this period. The synthetic funds have 100 percent turnover each year, whereas the

1
 The capital gain (CG) of the synthetic bond fund between time t and time t+1 is computed as the difference
between the price of a 19-year bond at time t+1, p19t+1 , and the price of a 20-year bond at time t, p20t. By
convention, bonds are issued at par, so p20t = 1. We define the yield to maturity of a 20-year bond at time t, and a
19-year bond at time t+1, as y20t and y19t+1, respectively. We assume that yields at all maturities are equal, so that
y19t+1 = y20t+1. In this case,
                     CGt+1 = p19t+1/ p20t – 1 = (y20t / y19t +1)*[(1 - (1+ y19t+1)-19] + (1+ y19t+1)-19 - 1.
The interest return at time t+1 of the synthetic bond fund is set equal to the coupon rate at time t, y20t.


                                                                                                                         7
corporate and the municipal bond funds have average turnovers of 81.5 and 85.0 percent,

respectively. The average expenses for the actual corporate bond fund were 0.49 percent, and those

for the actual municipal bond fund were 0.31 percent.

        The synthetic bond funds have slightly higher mean returns (0.21 percent for the corporate

bond fund and 0.43 percent for the municipal bond fund), and considerably higher standard

deviations (3.14 percent for the corporate bond fund and 2.53 percent for the municipal bond fund)

than the actual bond funds. The correlation coefficients between the returns of the actual and

synthetic funds are 0.94 for the corporate bond fund and .99 for the municipal bond fund.

        We create a synthetic index fund corresponding to the Vanguard 500 Index Fund using the

return data of the large stock index of Ibbotson Associates (2000). The synthetic fund distributes the

dividends net of expenses, with expenses set to 25 basis points. The fund’s turnover rate of 5 percent

results in short- and long-term capital gains distributions, which are distributed if they are positive

and carried forward if they are negative. The actual index fund and the synthetic index fund yield

very similar returns during the period from 1979-1998. The average return on the synthetic index

fund is slightly higher (by 0.10 percent per year) than that on the actual index fund, and the standard

deviation of the synthetic index fund return is 0.05 percent higher than that of the actual index fund

return. The correlation between the returns on the actual and the synthetic index funds is 0.9997.

        When we consider investor performance over the 1962-1998 period, we splice together the

returns on our synthetic bond and index funds for the early part of our sample, with the actual returns

on these funds in the later part of the sample. We label these "spliced funds."

        We translate the before-tax returns on the various mutual funds in our sample into after-tax

returns using two sets of marginal tax rates. We develop time series of tax rates for hypothetical

high- and medium-tax individuals. We assume that the high-tax individual has taxable income that is

ten times the median adjusted gross income (AGI), less the standard deduction for a married couple

with three exemptions, in each year. The medium-tax individual has taxable income equal to three


                                                                                                          8
times this quantity. Median AGI is taken from the Statistics of Income of the Internal Revenue

Service. The tax rates between 1962 and 1992 are taken from Dickson and Shoven (1995); we

updated these using tax forms for the years 1993 to 1998. We assume that our medium-tax investor

has an income roughly three times the median AGI because stock and bond investors, particularly

those with the asset location problem we study, have much higher incomes than average households

do. We use data on the short- and long-term capital gain distributions of the equity mutual funds in

our sample, as well as on their dividend distributions, to compute after-tax returns. We also consider

"medium term" capital gain distributions for the applicable years, 1997 and 1998.

        Table 2 presents summary statistics on returns for the mutual funds in our sample. The twelve

actively managed equity funds have an average nominal return of 12.68 percent over the 1962-1998

period, and an average standard deviation of the annual returns of 17.07 percent. The rate of

consumer price inflation has a mean of 4.74 percent and a standard deviation of 3.17 percent

(Ibbotson Associates (2000)). The nominal return on the corporate bond fund averages 7.44, which

translates to an average real return of 2.73 percent.

        The mean nominal returns and the standard deviations of the funds differ considerably during

this period. The Van Kampen Enterprise Fund has the highest average nominal return (16.89 percent)

and the highest standard deviation (28.77 percent). The IDS Stock Fund has the lowest average return

(10.74 percent) and the Affiliated Fund has the lowest standard deviation (14.10 percent). The 'Top-

5-Funds' have a considerably lower mean return than the remaining seven funds (11.66 percent vs.

13.41 percent), possibly because of survivorship bias.

        Table 2 describes the composition of returns received by investors, with particular attention

to the division between dividends, realized capital gains, and unrealized gains. The twelve funds

distributed on average 72.57 percent of their total return annually either as dividends or capital gains,




                                                                                                        9
and 30.44 percent of the total average returns were either dividends or short-term capital gains. 2

Capital gains that are not distributed are deferred until the investor sells the mutual fund shares. The

most successful fund (Van Kampen Enterprise Fund) distributed only 43.81 percent of its total

returns, whereas the relatively poorly performing United Accumulative Fund distributed 88.45

percent of its total return. The 'Top-5-Funds' tend to impose somewhat higher tax burdens on their

investors than the other funds since they distribute a larger portion of their total returns and since a

slightly larger portion of their distributions do not qualify as long-term capital gains.

         The passively managed "spliced" index fund has an average nominal return of 12.78 percent

and a standard deviation of 15.91 percent. The average return on the index fund is similar to that for

our whole sample of equity funds, and it is considerably higher than the return on the bias-free 'Top-

5-Funds'. The passively managed index fund exhibits a smaller difference between pre-tax and post-

tax returns than the actively managed equity funds. Only 39.21 percent of its total nominal returns

were distributed on average to shareholders, and only a small portion of those distributions resulted

from the distribution of realized capital gains.

The "spliced" corporate bond fund has a mean nominal return of 7.44 percent and a standard

deviation of 8.27 percent, while the "spliced" tax-exempt municipal bond fund has a lower mean

nominal return (5.87 percent) and a higher standard deviation (11.16 percent). The average implied

tax rate of the municipal bond fund, defined as 1-E(rM)/E(rB) where E(rM) and E(rB) are the expected

nominal returns of municipal bonds and corporate bonds, respectively, is 21.10 percent. Both bond

funds distribute a very large proportion of their total returns as interest income.




2
  The data sources do not always distinguish between short- and long-term capital gains. We assume that capital
gains are long-term if the sources do not indicate the term of the gains. This results in an overstatement of the actual
tax-efficiency of the mutual funds.


                                                                                                                      10
2. Asset Location and Investor Returns: Historical Evidence

         In this section we present asset location results for the period 1962-98 for the twelve actively

managed equity mutual funds as well as the three spliced funds. The investor is assumed to have

made identical contributions (in constant dollars) each year to a tax-deferred pension account (TDA)

and to a conventional taxable savings account (CSA). We use 1998 as our price level benchmark, so

the actual 1998 contributions were 50 cents to each account, whereas the earlier contributions were

less in nominal dollars. The total real investment over the 37-year period was $37 at 1998 prices.

         We assume that half of each annual investment placed in the TDA and half in the CSA, and

that the investor wants half of his or her total portfolio in stocks and half in bonds.3 We assume that

the initial 1962 investments are half to stocks and half to bonds. Thereafter, the investor annually

adjusts the portfolio to maintain a 50 percent proportion in stocks and 50 percent in bonds. The

necessary rebalancing is first accomplished by adjusting the composition of new investments. If

necessary, assets are sold and bought in order to bring about the desired 50-50 stock-bond balance.

At the end of the year, the investor is taxed on the taxable mutual fund distributions and the realized

capital gains from selling fund shares in the taxable account. Realized losses are carried forward and

subtracted from future capital gains. At the end of our sample period, the investor liquidates all assets

and pays the necessary capital gains taxes as well as the ordinary income taxes on withdrawals from

the TDA. The dollar figures shown in our tables thus represent retirement accumulations after the

payment of all taxes.

         We evaluate two possible asset location strategies. Strategy one gives the equity mutual fund

priority for placement inside the TDA. The corporate bond fund would be held in the TDA only if

3
  When we compute the stock proportions we do not adjust the value of assets held in the two different accounts to
reflect deferred taxes. There are at least two issues in this regard. First, the investor only owns (1-t) of the assets
invested in the tax-deferred account, because the government will tax withdrawals from a tax-deferred account at the
rate t. Second, the realized returns of assets in the CSA are taxed annually; this reduces their accumulation. Whether
one invested in the TDA is more valuable than one dollar invested in a CSA depends on the investment horizon.
One dollar invested in a CSA is more valuable at sufficiently short investment horizons and one dollar invested in a
TDA is more valuable at sufficiently long horizons.


                                                                                                                    11
there is room after all of the equity is in the TDA. Municipal bonds have a preferred location in the

CSA. Strategy two gives the corporate bond fund priority for placement inside the TDA. The equity

mutual fund is given priority for placement in the CSA. If it is necessary to hold bonds in the CSA

to maintain the desired 50-50 asset allocation, then the investor would hold the municipal bond fund.

        Table 3 shows our basic asset location results. Strategy 1 works out better for all twelve of

the actively managed equity mutual funds for the high-income, high-tax investor and for eleven of

the twelve funds for the medium-income, medium-tax investor. The additional wealth accumulated

by following strategy 1 (giving equities preference for placement in the TDA) can be quite large. For

the twelve actively managed funds as a whole the average gain of strategy 1 over strategy 2 is 8.9

percent for high-tax retirement accumulators. For the five largest funds in 1961, the gain of strategy

1 over strategy 2 averages 7.7 percent. For someone who contributed $10,000 ($1998) per year to

both the CSA and the TDA in each year between 1962 and 1998, the 7.7 percent differential would

translate to additional wealth of more than $140,000 in 1998.

        The equity mutual fund that gains the most from strategy 1 is the Vanguard Windsor fund.

Its before-tax performance was better than average over the 1962-98 period, while it imposed a

higher than average tax burden on its investors. With Vanguard Windsor, strategy 1 results in more

than 17 percent more retirement wealth than strategy 2. The actively managed fund for which the

advantage of strategy 1 is the smallest is the Fundamental Investors Fund. Its before-tax

performance was worse than average and its investor tax burden was better than average. For high-

income investors using Fundamental Investors in a 50-50 stocks-bonds asset allocation plan, strategy

1 offers an advantage of less than 1 percent. For the medium-income investor using Fundamental

Investors, strategy 2 actually works better than strategy 1, although the difference is extremely small.

For the eleven other funds, strategy 1 yields between 1 and 17 percent more after-tax wealth than

strategy 2 at the end of the sample period.




                                                                                                        12
        Interestingly, when we consider the S&P 500 Index Fund, strategy two yields the highest

terminal wealth. This involves giving the equity fund locational preference in the CSA and corporate

bonds locational preference in the TDA. The Index Fund had slightly better before-tax returns than

the average actively managed fund, almost all due to the lower expenses of the index fund, and

imposes much lower tax burdens on its investors. In this case the advantage of strategy 2 is

considerable. A high-tax investor holding an S&P 500 fund in the TDA and municipal bonds in the

CSA would have ended up with 1.7 percent less retirement wealth than a similar investor who put

corporate bonds in the TDA and held the index fund in the CSA.

        Table 3 suggests that over the 1962-1998 period, 50-50 stock-bond investors who had access

to tax-deferred accounts, and who favored actively managed equity mutual funds for their equity

investments, achieved higher after-tax wealth by following strategy 1 than by following strategy 2.

Strategy 1 implies that the equity fund should be first in line for placement in the tax-deferred

pension account. On the other hand, those who used index funds for their equity positions, or other

tax-efficient equity mutual funds, attained higher end-of-period net worth by following strategy 2.

This is the strategy that gives the corporate bond fund priority for placement in the TDA, while the

equity index fund is held in the CSA.4

        It is interesting to note that the index fund runs a very close second against the twelve

actively managed funds under strategy 2, but a much more distant fifth if all equity funds are located

according to strategy 1. (The index fund also came in fifth place in the gross-of-tax average return

rankings of Table 2.) All this means is that it is very hard for an actively managed fund to generate

more end-of-period wealth than an index fund over 37 years in a fully taxable environment. It is

much easier in the tax-deferred and tax-neutral TDA environment.



4
 While we have modeled people who choose a particular equity mutual fund and stick with it, many investors
periodically switch funds. Such switching generates taxable capital gains in a CSA, which raises the relative wealth
accumulation from strategy 1 relative to strategy 2.


                                                                                                                  13
        One reason that strategy 1 yielded higher end-of-period wealth than strategy 2 for most

actively managed equity funds during our sample period is that equities have experienced higher

rates of return than bonds, and thus would have generated higher tax bills in a taxable environment.

This is related to the well-documented equity premium puzzle described by Mehra and Prescott

(1985). One could ask whether strategy 1 would still generate higher end-of-period wealth if the

average return advantage of equities were lower. Table 4 answers this question for our high-tax,

high-income investor. Each successive column presents results that are based on a 100 basis point

reduction of realized fund returns, relative to those in the previous column. All fund distributions

(dividends and capital gains) are reduced proportionally. Each additional 100 basis point reduction

lowers the average advantage of strategy 1 over strategy 2, but by decreasing amounts. Even an

unrealistically high reduction of 500 basis points (i.e. eliminating the premium of equity funds over

corporate bonds) would leave strategy 1 generating higher end-of-period wealth than strategy 2 for

nine of the twelve actively managed funds. The results in Table 4 suggest that the relative wealth

accumulation from strategies 1 and 2 would be attenuated, but slowly, if the average return to stocks

was lower than that in the 38-year period that we study.

        The results in Table 4 are driven both by the fact that capital gain distributions on actively

managed equity funds raise their effective tax burden, and by the fact that the implicit tax rate on tax-

exempt bonds has been below the statutory marginal tax rate throughout our sample. Table 5 helps

to indicate the relative importance of these two factors. In Table 5, the investors do not take

advantage of municipal bonds. Instead, they invest in a single equity mutual fund and a corporate

bond fund. The only location decision is between giving the equity fund preference in the TDA with

the corporate bond fund having locational preference in the CSA (strategy 1) or vice versa (strategy

2). Without the use of municipal bonds, strategy 1 generates higher end-of-period wealth for only

three of the twelve actively managed mutual funds for the high-income investor. For the other equity

mutual funds, strategy 2 (i.e. conventional wisdom) produces more retirement wealth, often quite a


                                                                                                         14
bit more. The average gain of strategy 2 for the twelve actively managed funds is 3.8 percent.

Strategy 1 yields more attractive relative wealth values (Table 5) for the medium-income, medium-

tax investor, producing more retirement wealth for six of the twelve actively managed equity funds.

In fact, even without allowing municipal bonds, the average retirement wealth from following

strategy 1 is slightly greater than that from following strategy 2 for the medium-tax investor.

        Our interpretation of the results of Tables 3 and 5 is that the average actively managed

mutual fund produces a higher effective tax rate for its high-income taxable holders than the implicit

tax rate on municipal bonds. Hence, most of the actively managed funds would have gained more

from being in the TDA environment than would corporate bonds, given the availability of tax-exempt

bonds for investments in the CSA. The only equity mutual fund that would have generated a

significantly lower effective tax rate than the implicit tax rate on municipal bonds was the passively

managed index fund. The reason that the presence of municipal bonds in the analysis is less

important for the medium-income investors is obvious. For them, the effective tax rate on the equity

funds is lower (due to lower tax rates on ordinary income and capital gains) but the implicit tax rate

on municipal bonds is the same. Tables 3 and 5 underscore the fact that the "conventional wisdom"

that it is best to give preference to corporate bonds for placement in the TDA is based on analysis

that does not consider the availability of municipal bonds.

        One caution about our comparison of taxable and tax-exempt bond yields, and our calculation

of implicit tax rates from these yields, should be noted. Investors in taxable and tax-exempt bonds

may face somewhat different risks, and the yield differential between the yields on these bonds may

reflect both tax considerations and the pricing of these risks. One particularly important risk, noted

in Poterba (1989), is that of tax reform. Investors in tax-exempt bonds hold assets that could

experience substantial valuation changes if the current income tax treatment of taxable and tax-

exempt bonds were to change. Quantifying the price that investors demand for bearing this risk, and

modifying the implicit tax rate accordingly, is very difficult.


                                                                                                         15
        Table 6 is also presented to help interpret the main results of Table 3. In Table 6, we apply

the 1998 tax law, rather than the contemporaneous tax laws, to the 1962-98 returns generated by the

CSA assets. Figure 1 shows the evolution of marginal tax rates for our high-tax and medium-tax

investors between 1962 and 1998. The tax rate on ordinary income was lower in 1998 than it was

through most of the 1962-98 period. The 1998 tax rate on realized long-term capital gains was near

its 1962-98 average. Table 6 shows that the after-tax wealth from strategy 1, relative to strategy 2,

would have been much lower if the 1998 tax law had been applied throughout the 1962-98 period,

particularly for the high-income investors. Nonetheless, strategy 1 would have still yielded a higher

end-of-period wealth for eight of the twelve actively managed mutual funds. The counterfactual tax

assumption of Table 6 affects the results less for the medium-income investor, with strategy 1 still

generating more retirement wealth for ten of the twelve actively managed mutual funds.

        Table 6 does not describe what actually would have happened if the 1998 tax code had

prevailed over the entire 37-year period. We have not adjusted the implicit tax rate on municipal

bonds even though it would have presumably dropped in the presence of lower marginal tax rates on

the wealthy. Similarly, we have not adjusted the before-tax rates of return of any of the assets even

though a significant tax change would presumably have substantial general equilibrium effects.



3. Asset Location and Investor Returns: Simulation Evidence

        The foregoing asset location results show the performance of different strategies using

historic data over the period from 1962-1998. This time-period was in many respects

unrepresentative; equity returns were relatively high, the rate of inflation was high and very volatile,

and marginal tax rates changed considerably. To determine whether our results are robust, we run

some bootstrap simulations. Each simulation proceeds in two steps: we first randomly select one

mutual fund from our sample, and we then draw a random sequence of years with replacement. For

each year selected, we draw the selected fund's return, as well as the returns of two bond funds, the


                                                                                                        16
inflation rate, and the tax rate. We compute the wealth levels of investors making constant real

annual contributions to the CSA and TDA for 37 years, just as described above. All the simulations

are repeated 10,000 times.5

         Figure 2 shows the probability distributions of the real wealth levels at retirement of

strategies 1 and 2 for a high-tax individual choosing from the set of the five largest mutual funds in

December 1961. Strategy 1 outperforms strategy 2 at all probability levels except for the four lowest

simulations out of 10,000. This means that the probability of reaching a particular wealth level or

higher is almost always higher using strategy 1. Even if we focus on the lower tail of the wealth

distribution in Figure 3, we can hardly discern the intersection of the two cumulative distribution

functions. Table 7 summarizes a few points of the probability distribution. The real wealth level of

strategy 1 exceeds the one of strategy 2 by 3.7 percent at the first percentile, by 6.1 percent at the

median, and by 16.4 percent at the 99th percentile. The portfolio selection of this investor is quite

risky. There is a more than 20 percent probability that the real wealth level accumulated at retirement

does not exceed the 37 real dollars invested and there is a more than 20 percent probability that

retirement wealth under strategy 1 exceeds twice the total real investments (74 real dollars).

         The median wealth level at retirement with strategy 1 equals $51.81. This is considerably

lower than the $86.46 from Table 3 that was computed using the actual history as opposed to the

simulated returns. A realization of $86.46 would be an outcome at the 87th percentile in our

bootstrap simulations. The main reason for this discrepancy is the ordering of the returns between

1962-1998. The ordering of the identical returns has a substantial effect on the wealth levels at

retirement for investors making contributions over many years to their savings accounts. The

arithmetic average of the real returns of the S&P 500 Index was 2.2 percent during 1962-1979 and

13.9 percent during 1980-1998. The computations that used actual historical returns had the low


5
  Our bootstrap results are generated from the actual 1962-1998 set of data. It is possible, of course, that future
returns will be generated from less or more favorable distributions.


                                                                                                                      17
returns in the first half of our investment horizon (when the accumulated contributions were

relatively small) and the high returns in the second half (when the accumulated contributions were

large). These back-loaded returns generate higher wealth levels at retirement compared to a more

equal distribution of returns which occurs in the bootstrap simulations.6

         If we let history run backwards (i.e., the 1998 returns occur first, the 1997 second, and the

1962 returns last), then we accumulate a real wealth level of $32.70 under strategy 1, which

corresponds to the 15th percentile of the bootstrap distribution. This is because the low returns then

occur when the investor has a large accumulated asset balance.

         Table 7 also summarizes the distribution for investors who randomly choose funds from the

whole set of twelve actively managed equity funds and who choose the "spliced" index fund.

Strategy 1 outperforms strategy 2 at all indicated points of the cumulative distribution for the actively

managed equity funds. The probability distribution function for the whole sample usually lies to the

right of the one for the ‘Top-5-Funds’, because the five largest funds did not perform as well as the

other seven funds. Strategy 2 outperforms strategy 1 for the index fund. Figure 4 shows that the

distributions of the two investment strategies are quite close if an investor holds a passively managed

index fund; this underscores our earlier point that asset location is less important in this case than in

the case of actively managed funds.

         To facilitate the comparison between the different cases we summarize the whole probability

distribution of the 10,000 simulations by computing the certainty equivalent wealth level of an

individual with a Constant-Relative-Risk-Aversion (CRRA) utility function. The expected utility of

real wealth EU=E[U(W)] of the investor is defined as:


6
  The ordering of the returns rt is irrelevant if investors make only a single investment to an account. In this case the
final wealth level is simply the product of the return relatives W0=ΠΤi=0(1+ri ). The ordering has a significant effect
on accumulated wealth levels for investors making multiple contributions to an account. We can think of the
portfolio with multiple contributions as the sum of a sequence of single-contribution portfolios with decreasing
maturities ΣΤt=0 [Wt]= ΣΤt=0 [ΠΤi=t(1+ri)]. The returns during the last years affect most of these single-contribution
portfolios, whereas the returns during the first years only affect a few of these single-contribution portfolios.


                                                                                                                       18
(1)             EU=E[U(W)]= n-1Σi[Wi1-α/(1-α)].

Simulations are indexed by i, the real wealth level is Wi, and we denote the risk-aversion coefficient

by α and the total number of bootstrap simulations by n. The certainty equivalent wealth level is the

certain wealth level that makes an individual indifferent to the outcome of the random 10,000

simulations. We assume that income from assets accumulated in the CSA and the TDA is the only

source of income during retirement. The certainty equivalent is given by:

(2)             CE(EU)=U-1(EU)=[(1-α)EU]1/(1-α).

        Table 8 summarizes the certainty equivalents for five levels of risk-aversion. The values with

a risk-aversion of α=0 equal the expected wealth levels. Most economists think that coefficients of

relative risk-aversion between 1 (log-utility) and 5 are plausible. The average real wealth level at

retirement for investments in the five largest mutual funds using strategy 1 equals $58.09. Investing

in all the twelve mutual funds and in the index fund results in considerably higher average wealth

levels. All the certainty equivalents for the actively managed equity funds are larger in strategy 1

than in strategy 2. Using strategy 1 instead of strategy 2 results in a 5.2 percent higher certainty

equivalent for an individual with a risk-aversion of 3 investing in the top-5 funds. However, strategy

2 outperforms strategy 1 for intermediate levels of risk-aversion if investors hold the index fund. The

index fund has a higher certainty equivalent than the actively managed funds. These results confirm

the deterministic results above.

        Figure 5 shows the relationship between the real wealth levels of the two location strategies

using exactly the same simulation results as in Figures 2 and 3. The 45-degree line represents the

cases where the wealth levels are identical for the two strategies. There are 7,116 points (out of

10,000) below the 45-degree line and 2,884 points above. Thus, strategy 1 outperforms strategy 2

roughly 71.2 percent of the time. The distribution of the relative wealth levels of the two strategies is

summarized in the third row of Table 8. Strategy 1 outperforms strategy 2 in 64.0 percent of the



                                                                                                        19
simulations if investors choose between all twelve funds and in 48.5 percent of the cases with the

index fund.

        The previous results analyzed the optimal asset location choice for an asset allocation of 50

percent stocks and 50 percent bonds. This ‘rule-of-thumb’-allocation is not necessarily optimal.

Moreover, the optimal stock proportion for an investor might depend on his location strategy, since

the two strategies have different effective stock exposures. To derive the effects of different asset

allocations, we perform bootstrap simulations for eleven different target stock proportions (0.0, 0.1,

0.2, ... 1.0) and compute the corresponding certainty equivalents of the two location strategies. Figure

6 plots the results for a high-tax individual with a risk-aversion of 3 investing in the ‘Top-5-Funds’.

The certainty equivalent is exactly identical with pure asset allocations, i.e., when the investor holds

either only bonds or only stocks. In these two cases asset location is irrelevant, because the investor

holds the same assets in the two locations.

        We find that the certainty equivalent of strategy 1 is always higher than that of strategy 2 for

interior stock proportions. The certainty equivalent is maximized at a stock proportion of between 80

and 100 percent with strategy 1 and 100 percent with strategy 2. At stock proportions this high, the

effect of optimal asset location is smaller than when the stock proportion is 50 percent.

        Asset location is more important if investors have a risk-aversion of 5, as shown in Figure 7.

Asset location increases the certainty equivalent by 4.9 percent (the maximal certainty equivalent

wealth level with strategy 1 is 37.21 and with strategy 2 is 35.46). A 100 percent stock portfolio has

a higher certainty equivalent than a 100 percent bond portfolio for both levels of risk-aversion.

Table 9 summarizes the certainty equivalents of the two location strategies if the return of equity

funds is decreased by 2.5 percentage points. The fund distributions (dividends, short-, medium-, and

long-term capital gains) are adjusted proportionally. The certainty equivalent is maximized at a stock

proportion of between 40 and 60 percent with strategy 1 and between 10 and 30 percent with strategy




                                                                                                          20
2 (with α=3). The benefit of asset location in this case equals 4.8 percent (35.96 for strategy 1 vs.

34.32 for strategy 2).



4. Asset Location with Inflation-Protected Bonds

        The high optimal stock proportion and the relatively low benefit of asset location that we

found in the last section might result from our non-representative data-sample. Average equity

returns were relatively high, and inflation was unexpectedly high and volatile during our sample

period. Both factors decrease the certainty equivalent utility level associated with holding nominal

bonds. This section shows that for plausible parameter values, investors demand substantially larger

amounts of bonds if bonds are protected against inflation uncertainty and if they offer the real returns

that are currently available on indexed bonds in the United States.

        The corporate and municipal bond funds in the asset allocation and asset location analysis of

the previous sections are exposed to at least three risks that can be reduced with recently introduced

government securities. These risks are (1) default risk of individual issues, (2) inflation risk and (3)

reinvestment risk. Reinvestment risk results from the fact that the bond or bond fund investor cannot

be sure of the terms on which future interest payments can be reinvested. The inflation risk results

from the fact that corporate and municipal bonds are nominal contracts. While investing in high-

grade securities can control default risk, corporate and municipal borrowers are usually considered

riskier than the U.S. federal government.

Since 1997, the U.S. government has issued securities -- inflation indexed bonds -- that essentially

eliminate all of the risks just described. There are two forms of inflation-indexed bonds. The first

are Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS). These are U.S. government bonds with fixed

maturities (so far 5, 10, and 30 year bonds have been issued), with real interest payments, and with

the principal amount adjusted to reflect CPI inflation. Both the interest payment and the adjustment




                                                                                                        21
in the principal amount are fully taxable if TIPS are held in conventional savings accounts, but these

considerations are not relevant in a TDA. TIPS essentially eliminate the default and inflation risks of

corporate and municipal bonds, but they still are subject to reinvestment risk.7 The real return on

TIPS is currently near 4.0 percent.

        The other U.S. government inflation indexed security is the Series I savings bond. The I

Bonds are savings bonds issued in denominations from $50 to $10,000. Like all savings bonds, I

bonds are zero-coupon instruments with taxation deferred until redemption. Like all federal notes,

bills and bonds, the interest on I bonds is exempt from state and local income taxation. I bonds are

non-transferable and non-marketable, but are redeemable at par at any time. There is a forfeiture of 3

months interest if the bonds are redeemed in less than 5 years. Interest is compounded monthly and

accrues for up to 30 years. Investors are limited to purchasing $30,000 of Series I savings bonds per

year. They have one other unusual feature which they share with Series EE savings bonds. The

interest realized upon redemption can be exempt from taxation if it is used for college tuition

expenses. This tax-free redemption possibility is available to households with adjusted gross income

less than roughly $80,000. After that, the tax-free possibility is phased out until it is completely

eliminated for AGIs above roughly $110,000.

        The features of various forms of bonds are listed in Table 10. The primary advantage of

Series I Savings Bonds for retirement accumulators using bonds in a CSA is their tax deferred nature.

The combination of zero-coupons (and therefore no reinvestment risk) and redeemability at par at

any time up to 30 years are also advantages. It should be noted that neither TIPS nor I bonds are

completely inflation protected when they are held in a CSA environment. That is because the taxable

interest increases with inflation and therefore the after-tax real return is lower at higher rates of

inflation. In a TDA, either TIPS or I bonds offer a true inflation-indexed real return. Currently I

                                                                                                                   22
bonds yield 40 basis points less than TIPS. Given this modest interest rate discount, I bonds (with

their tax deferred feature) would result in more long-term wealth accumulation than TIPS for

investors holding bonds in a CSA, while TIPS could generate greater long-term wealth accumulation

in a TDA. Holding I bonds in a TDA would render the tax deferral feature of these bonds worthless.

        We repeat the asset location computations with the historic returns used above by replacing

the municipal bonds in the taxable CSA with Series I bonds and the corporate bonds in the TDA by

TIPS.8 We assume a real return of 3.6 percent for I bonds and a 4 percent real return for TIPS, which

corresponds closely to the current real yields. We should be careful when we compare the results in

the earlier sections with the results of this section. The previous sections used the actual real returns

of bonds, whereas this section uses hypothetical real returns for inflation-protected bonds, and holds

this return at its current level for the entire sample period. (Corporate bonds had a real return of only

2.73 percent between 1962-1998, while the simulations that we report here assume that indexed

bonds offer a four percent real return.)

        Table 11 summarizes our findings when we use historic returns on equity mutual funds, and

allow investors to hold inflation-protected bonds with their current yields. Strategy 1 (giving equities

preference for placement in the TDA and I-bonds preference for placement in the CSA) yields higher

end-of-sample wealth than strategy 2 for 9 of the 12 actively managed equity funds for a high-tax

individual and for all funds for a medium-tax individual. Strategy 1 outperforms strategy 2 on

average by 5.25 percent for a high-tax and by 6.08 percent for a medium-tax individual. Those gains

are similar to the ones in Table 3 with nominal bonds. With inflation-protected bonds, strategy 1 is

relatively more beneficial for medium-tax individuals than for high-tax individuals. The taxation

advantage of I-bonds over stocks is greater for medium-tax investors than it is for high-tax investors.



8
  I-series bonds are currently only available with a maximum maturity of 30 years. Our computations assume that
the tax on those bonds can be deferred until retirement. The benefits of holding I-series bonds would decrease if the
taxation of the bond returns could only be deferred for 30 years.


                                                                                                                  23
Strategy 2 is again superior for the index fund. The accumulated wealth levels in Tables 3 and 11 are

quite similar.

        Table 12 reports the average wealth levels at retirement of different sets of mutual funds for

different real yields of the inflation-protected bonds. The average wealth levels decrease significantly

as the real yield decreases. However, strategy 1 still outperforms strategy 2 for all cases using

actively managed mutual funds. The relative advantage of strategy 1 increases slightly as the real

yield of the bonds falls, because sheltering bonds in the tax-deferred account is less beneficial if

bonds pay a lower yield. Holding the passively managed index fund in the CSA continues to

generate higher after-tax wealth at the end of the period than other allocations using this fund.

        The most significant benefit of TIPS and I bonds is their inflation-protection. To quantify this

benefit we perform bootstrap simulations with those two real securities. The bootstrap simulations

follow the same method that we used in the last section, although the real yields on the inflation

protected bonds are not affected by our randomization algorithm since we assume that these yields

are fixed. Figure 8 depicts the wealth distribution at retirement for a high-tax individual investing in

the largest five funds during a period of 37 years and using location strategy 1. The figure shows the

cumulative distribution functions for an environment with the historic nominal municipal and

corporate bonds, and with the hypothetical real bonds (I-Bonds). The distribution function for the

nominal bonds is exactly identical to the one in Figure 2. Introducing inflation-protected bonds

increases the outcomes at the lower tail significantly and does not affect the outcomes at the upper

tail much. Comparing Panel 2 of Table 7 with the same panel in Table 13 shows that the wealth level

increases under strategy 1 by 34.4 percent at the 1 st percentile and by 23.9 percent at the 10th

percentile. It is almost identical at the 90th percentile, and decreases by 11.8 percent at the 99th

percentile.

        Tables 8 and 14 show that the certainty equivalent of an investor with a risk-aversion of 3

investing in the top-5-funds increases by 19.4 percent from 43.30 (with nominal bonds) to 51.69


                                                                                                       24
(with real bonds). In particular, risk-averse investors value inflation-protection because they put a

much higher weight on the lower tail of the probability distribution.

        Figure 9 plots the probability distributions of the two location strategies for a high-tax

individual investing in one of the ‘Top-5-Funds’. The two functions are quite close at low wealth

levels and strategy 1 dominates strategy 2 at higher wealth levels. Table 13 shows that strategy 1

usually dominates strategy 2 for the actively managed mutual funds but not for the passively

managed index fund. The certainty equivalents from Table 14 indicate that strategy 1 is preferable to

strategy 2 at all listed levels of risk-aversion for the actively managed mutual funds. Strategy 2

dominates strategy 1 for the index fund unless individuals are extremely risk-averse. By simply

comparing Panel 3 with the other two panels, we once again see that using the index fund has a

higher certainty equivalent outcome than a randomly selected actively managed fund.

        We conclude this section by analyzing the importance of asset location if investors use

inflation-indexed bonds and follow different heuristic allocation rules. Figures 10 and 11 show the

certainty equivalents of the two strategies at different stock proportions. With a risk-aversion of 3,

the certainty equivalent is maximized at stock proportions between 40 and 60 percent with strategy 1

and 50 and 70 percent stocks with strategy 2. The benefit of asset location in this case equals 1.5

percent (51.51 for strategy 1 vs. 50.75 for strategy 2). Introducing inflation-protected bonds

increases the attractiveness of holding fixed-income securities. The stock proportion with the

maximum certainty equivalent decreases significantly at a risk-aversion of 5. The gain of using

strategy 1 instead of 2 equals 3.3 percent (47.38 for strategy 1 vs. 45.86 for strategy 2).



5. Conclusion

        The findings in this paper suggest that asset location decisions are very important for

retirement accumulators who hold assets in both tax-deferred pension accounts and in taxable

accounts. We compiled the actual 37-year performance of twelve actively managed equity mutual


                                                                                                         25
funds along with the results of a passively managed index fund and two (corporate and municipal)

bond funds.

        We have come to two rather robust conclusions regarding the after-tax wealth that high-

income and medium-income investors would have accumulated over the 1962-1998 period, if they

had invested in both stocks and bonds and held assets in both pension and taxable accounts. First, if

an investor chose to use an actively managed equity mutual fund for stock investments, then after-tax

wealth was maximized by holding as much of the equity mutual fund as possible in the pension

account. Such an investor would hold corporate bonds in the pension account only if there is room

for them, while holding municipal bonds in taxable accounts. Second, we find that an investor who

used a passively managed equity index fund for stock investments would have accumulated wealth

most quickly by first locating corporate bonds in the pension account, and by holding the index fund

in the outside taxable environment. Our findings suggest that the tax burden that equity mutual

funds, particularly actively managed funds, impose on their investors, and the availability of both

municipal bonds and inflation-protected Treasury securities as alternatives to corporate bonds, need

to be factored into the asset location policy.

        The effect of following different asset location strategies, in terms of retirement wealth, can

be quite substantial. The improvement in the average or certainty equivalent outcome can be as high

as 9 percent. With particular actively managed funds, the ex-post gain can be as high as 17 percent.

        The explanation of our findings is fairly transparent. At least historically, most actively

managed equity funds imposed a higher effective tax rate on their shareholders than the implicit tax

on municipal bonds. Therefore, the typical actively managed fund gains more from being in a tax-

deferred pension environment than a corporate bond gains from being held in the TDA, as an

alternative to a tax-exempt bond held in a taxable setting. The story is just opposite with index

funds, although it appears the stakes from optimal location are lower in this case. Passively managed




                                                                                                          26
index funds impose low enough tax burdens on their investors that they gain less from the pension

environment than the premium of corporate bond yields over municipal bond yields.

        Even though our purpose was not to enter the debate between actively-managed and

passively managed equity funds, our simulations do shed light on the relative advantage of the two

fund types for someone saving consistently over 37 years. The bootstrap simulations that we

performed indicate that a risk averse retirement accumulator would likely fare better with an index

fund, and an asset location strategy that held this fund in a taxable setting, than with a randomly

chosen actively managed fund, held in the tax-deferred account.

        One important issue that arises in using our history-based results to predict the future

concerns the extent to which actively managed funds will recognize the tax consequences that

managerial decisions impose on taxable investors. If actively managed funds are more tax aware in

the future, and the recent emergence of tax-managed funds and other financial products that are

designed to reduce investor tax burdens suggests that they might be, then our findings may be

attenuated.

        While most of our analysis was done for someone following a rule-of-thumb 50-50 stocks-

bonds asset allocation, we did look at the outcome for different allocations in our bootstrap

simulations. Not surprisingly, an investor’s optimal asset allocation is a function of his risk aversion.

Still, given the well-known equity premium puzzle and the fact that even our bootstrap results were

based on the realized returns from 1962-98, mildly risk averse retirement investors would have

achieved their highest certainty equivalent outcomes by allocating substantially more than 50 percent

of their portfolio to stocks. Whether such results would also hold if the start of the investment period

was the current day, given changes in the equity premium, is not clear.

        We also looked at using the relatively new inflation-protected Treasury bonds as part of a

retirement accumulation portfolio. These bonds come in two types: Treasury Inflation Protected

Securities (TIPS) and Series I Savings Bonds. TIPS are bonds with a real coupon rate and an


                                                                                                       27
inflation-adjusted principal amount. Both the coupon and the principal adjustment are taxable

income. Series I bonds, on the other hand, are zero-coupon inflation protected bonds with taxation

deferred until sale. Given these features, the inflation-linked securities pose their own location

question. Is it better to give stocks priority in a pension account and hold I bonds outside, or give

TIPS preference in a pension environment and hold stocks outside? Our results suggest that the

solution depends on the type of equity mutual fund that the investor holds. If index bonds had been

available for the last four decades, and their yields had been similar to those on current index bonds,

then investors would have generated more wealth by holding actively managed funds in a pension

account (with I bonds outside) than by following other strategies with such actively managed funds.

Investors who wished to hold index funds, however, would have accumulated more wealth by

holding such funds outside their retirement accounts, with TIPS in their pension accounts.

Table 1: Equity Mutual Funds in Dataset
The total asset values of the 12 equity funds in our dataset are summarized. The top 5 equity mutual funds
correspond to the five largest equity funds at the end of 1961. The results of those 5 funds should not be subject to
selection bias. Ten funds (all funds except Fidelity and Vanguard Windsor) were the ten largest equity funds at the
end of 1968.

The Mass Investors Trust and Mass Investors Growth Funds changed their names to MFS Mass Investors Trust and
Growth, respectively. Investors Stock changed to IDS Stock, Affiliated to Lord Abbett Affiliated, the Enterprise
Fund to Van Kampen Enterprise, and Windsor to Vanguard Windsor. Investor's Mutual and the Wellington Fund
were both larger than United Accumulative in 1961. Those two funds are not included in our dataset because they
were balanced funds and held a significant portion of bonds. We excluded the Investors Mutual and the Investors
Stock Fund because they were balanced mutual funds in 1968. Moreover we excluded the ISI Trust Fund, because
this fund did not issue shares in 1968, but rather 10 year participating agreements.

Table 2: Summary Statistics of Mutual Funds (1962-1998)
This table reports the annual mean nominal returns, the standard deviations of the annual returns, and the
distribution characteristics of the funds. Dividend-, ST-CG-, and LT-CG-Dist. are the returns that are distributed to
shareholders as dividends, short-term, and long-term capital gains. The last two columns show the total proportions
of the average returns that are distributed to shareholders as short-term distributions and as short- and long-term
distributions. Unfortunately it is not possible to get long-run data on the S&P 500 Index Fund, taxable corporate, and
tax-exempt municipal bond funds. Actual data are available for the Vanguard 500 Index fund after 1977 and for the
Vanguard Long-Term Corporate Bond Fund and the Vanguard Long-Term Municipal Bond Fund after 1978. The
synthetic funds use market data to replicate the payoffs of those funds before 1977 and 1978 and the data from the
actual funds afterwards. CPI is the Consumer Price Index.

Table 3: Asset Location Results
The real wealth levels at retirement are reported for an individual making annual real contributions of $0.50 to both
a tax-deferred account (TDA) and a conventional taxable savings account (CSA) during a period of 37 years (i.e.,
from 1962-1998). The investor annually adjusts the portfolio to maintain a 50% proportion of stock funds (the
remaining 50% are allocated to either taxable corporate bonds or tax-exempt municipal bonds). Strategy 1 gives
preference to stocks in the TDA and municipal bonds in the CSA and strategy 2 gives preference to corporate bonds
in the TDA and stocks in the CSA.

Table 9: Different Asset Allocations with Lower Equity Premium
This table summarizes the certainty equivalents of the two allocation strategies at different stock-proportions. The
return of the equity funds is assumed to be 2.5 percent lower than observed in the period from 1962-1998. The fund
distributions are adjusted proportionally. Investors randomly choose in which fund they want to invest at the
beginning of the investment horizon out of the set of the top 5 funds in 1961. The returns are bootstrapped 10,000
times.

Table 11: Hypothetical Asset Location Results with Inflation Protected Bonds
This table modifies Table 3 by replacing the municipal bonds in the CSA with I-Series Bonds and the corporate
bonds in the TDA with Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS). The real annual return is 3.6 percent for I-
Series Bonds and 4 percent for TIPS. All the taxes of the total return of the I-Series bonds held in the CSA are
deferred until the funds are withdrawn at the end of the time horizon.

Table 13: Wealth Distribution with Inflation Protected Bonds
The probability distribution of the real wealth levels of a high-income individual is shown for the two location
strategies. Individuals randomly choose one equity fund initially and contribute as described in Table 3. The returns
of the assets are bootstrapped 10,000 times. The annual real return of I-Bonds is 3.6 percent and of TIPS is 4
percent.
