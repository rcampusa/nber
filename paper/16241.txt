                                                 ABSTRACT

This paper uses three different sources of data to investigate the association between the business cycle—measured
with unemployment rates—and environmental concern. Building on recent research that finds internet
search terms to be useful predictors of health epidemics and economic activity, we find that an increase
in a state’s unemployment rate decreases Google searches for “global warming” and increases searches
for “unemployment,” and that the effect differs according to a state’s political ideology. From national
surveys, we find that an increase in a state’s unemployment rate is associated with a decrease in the
probability that residents think global warming is happening and reduced support for the U.S to target
policies intended to mitigate global warming. Finally, in California, we find that an increase in a county’s
unemployment rate is associated with a significant decrease in county residents choosing the environment
as the most important policy issue. Beyond providing the first empirical estimates of macroeconomic
effects on environmental concern, we discuss the results in terms of the potential impact on environmental
policy and understanding the full cost of recessions.

1. Introduction

This paper investigates the relationship between environmental concern and the business cycle.

The fact that both have undergone such remarkable changes in recent years provides a unique

opportunity to evaluate how economic conditions affect public opinion about the environment,

which in turn has implications for the likely passage of new environmental policies and the

implementation of those that already exist. It is well-known that the end of 2007 was the

beginning of the most significant economic downturn in the United States since the Great

Depression. Throughout much of 2008 and 2009 gross domestic product (GDP) experienced

negative growth, and unemployment rates are now more than double what they were only four

years ago. At the same time, we have witnessed a substantial erosion in public concern about

environmental issues. Polling results from the Pew Research Center (2009) on what has become

the headline issue of climate change, for example, indicate that between April 2008 and October

2009, the percentage of Americans believing in solid evidence that the earth is warming

decreased from 71 to 57 percent (a decline of 14 percent); and those thinking climate change is a

very serious problem decreased from 44 to 35 percent (a decline of 9 percent).

         In this paper we investigate how changes in economic conditions—proxied with

unemployment rates—affect three different indicators of environmental concern. We first use

data on keyword searches through the internet as complied by Google Insights. Researchers are

beginning to use these data as a leading indicator of what issues the public is concerned about;

for example, keyword searches for “swine flu” in specific areas at specific points in time are

being used as predictors of actual flu activity (Pelat et al. 2009; Valdiva and Monge-Carella

2010).1 Recent studies have also shown that Google searches are a powerful tool for predicting

economic activity such product demand for automobiles, home sales, retail sales, and travel

behavior (Choi and Varian 2009). Using panel data by month for each state, we find that an

increase in a state’s unemployment rate is associated with a decrease in keyword searches within

the state for “global warming” and an increase in searches for “unemployment.” We also find

that in more Democratic leaning states, the decline in global-warming searches is larger, but the

increase in unemployment searches is smaller.

       The second part of our analysis also takes place at the state level and is based on two

waves of a survey conducted by the Yale Project on Climate Change in October 2008 and

January 2010. The surveys were based on a national sample and were designed to gauge public

opinion about climate change. We take advantage of questions that were asked in both waves of

the survey, which enables estimation of pooled cross-sectional models that include a variable for

the state unemployment rate, controls for respondent characteristics, and state fixed effects. The

main results indicate that an increase in a state’s unemployment rate is associated with a decrease

in several areas of concern related to climate change, ranging from whether respondents think

global warming is happening to whether the government should be doing more or less to address

the problem.

       The third part of our analysis focuses at the county level in California and is based on the

Public Policy Institute of California’s (PPIC) monthly survey from 2008 and 2009. The survey

question of interest is one that asks residents to choose which issue among a given set is the most

important facing California at the time of the survey. One of the possible choices is

“environment,” among others related to the economy, education, health, immigration, etc.

Merging these data with county-level unemployment rates by month, we estimate a multinomial

logit model that takes advantage of the pooled monthly cross sections and controls for




                                                 2
respondent characteristics. We find that respondents who live in counties featuring a higher

unemployment rate are less likely to prioritize the environment. Based on estimates from a linear

probability model that controls for county fixed effects, we also find that an increase in the

unemployment rate decreases the probability that a respondent chooses the environment as the

most important issue.

        Together, these three sets of results reveal a strong association between local business

cycles, as proxied by state and county unemployment rates, and concern about environmental

issues in general and climate change in particular. Each piece of evidence that we present has

advantages and limitations, both of which we discuss in more detail later in the paper. But the

general pattern is clear: higher unemployment rates—at least when levels reach those observed

during the recent recession—erode public concern about the environment.

        While there is a sizable literature on public opinion about the environment, we are not

aware of any studies using comparable data sets that investigate the influence of macroeconomic

trends. Instead, much of the research is focused on how environmental concern is shaped by

demographic characteristics (e.g., van Liere and Dunlap 1980, Elliot et al. 1997), political party

affiliation (e.g., Dunlap et al. 2008), international differences (e.g., Bloom 1995), and media

coverage (e.g., Shanahan et al. 1997). Other studies have examined the influence of

environmental public opinion on public policy (e.g., Dunlap 1995).2 More related to our study,

because it considers a macro-economic variable, is a paper by Elliot et al. (1997) that finds

evidence of a positive correlation between per capita disposal income and survey questions about

whether respondents think more spending should be allocated toward improving and protecting

the environment. Caution should be taken when interpreting these results, however, as they are

based on a time series of only 38 data points representing national averages.

        Beyond the literature on public opinion, the results of this paper are important for both

public policy and economics. Political scientists argue that economic conditions exert a strong

influence on public opinion about regulation, because more expensive regulatory efforts are

considered more feasible during good times (Vogel 1989). A more nuanced argument is that

favorable economic conditions promote support for more liberal policies, whereas tougher

economic conditions promote support for more conservative policies (Durr 1993). What is more,

beyond environmental issues, it is well established that changes in public opinion have a

significant impact on public policy (Page and Shapiro 1983; Burstein 2003). Hence a better

understanding of how the business cycle affects environmental concern is important for

understanding how environmental policies are ultimately passed, funded, and implemented.

        The paper also contributes to the literature on the cost of recessions. While much

attention is given to costs related to consumption, real estate, health, and labor, the

environmental costs of recessions have gone unrecognized.3 Environmental policies are

designed, in principle, to correct market failures typically due to negative externalities and the

under-provision of public goods. Environmental policies thus have welfare benefits. It follows

that if recessions reduce levels of environmental concern, which we find, a further consequence

based on existing research is that environmental policies are likely to receive less funding and

new environmental legislation is less likely to pass. A specific example of how recessions can

impact implementation of environmental policy is the upcoming ballot initiative (Proposition 23)

in California to delay the state’s climate-change policy (AB32) until the unemployment rate is


3
 Environmental benefits may also occur during recessions, perhaps most importantly because of lower pollution
emissions due to diminished economic activity (Kahn 1999; Chay and Greenstone 2003).


                                                       4
reduced below 5.5 percent.4 Regardless of whether existing environmental policies become less

effective or fewer new policies pass, there are welfare consequences that should be accounted for

when delineating and/or estimating the costs of recessions.5 An important step in this process is

to understand the relationship between recessions and environmental concern.

        The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next three sections present

separately our analyses on Google keyword searches, the national survey on public opinion about

climate change, and the California survey about priority issues. Section 5 concludes with a

summary, a discussion of policy implications, and directions for future research.



2. Google Keyword Searches

Google Insights is a publically available online tool for tracking aggregate Google search activity

over time for specific geographic areas such as states.6 As discussed previously, recent research

shows that Google search terms are a powerful tool to predict public health epidemics and

economic activity. Here we use Google searches to investigate how changes in the business cycle

affect internet search activity related to environmental concern. In particular, we use Google

Insights to create a weekly database from January 2004 through February 2010 of searches for

two words—“global warming” and “unemployment”—by state. The basic idea is to analyze how

changes in a state’s unemployment rate affect search activity for these two keywords. We

hypothesize that increases in a state’s unemployment rate will result in fewer searches for

  Cross-national comparisons find evidence of a “J” curve for environmental regulation, whereby more wealthy
nations enact more laws to protect the environment (Seldon and Song 1995; Hilton and Levinson 1998). When
considering the environmental cost of recessions due to existing laws becoming less effective and fewer new laws
being enacted, one should think about a domestic “J” curve and the dynamic welfare implications of moving up and
down on it due to recessionary effects.

                                                       5
“global warming.”7 We also hypothesize that increases in a state’s unemployment rate will

increase searches for “unemployment.”

         The data available on Google Insights is not the actual number of keyword searches, but

rather a scaled variable that enables relative comparisons of trends through time within a

keyword and also between keywords. For purposes of our analysis, we standardize the search

frequency data by keyword and by state. This means that the search data is distributed N[0,1] for

each keyword over time within each state. We follow this procedure because our identification

strategy is based on variation within a state, and the uniform scaling facilitates comparison of

magnitudes between the different keywords of global warming and unemployment.8 With these

weekly internet search data we merge corresponding monthly state unemployment data from the

Bureau of Labor Statistics. These data are the seasonally adjusted unemployment rates reported

as a percentage.9 The mean unemployment rate in the data is 5.638 percent with a standard

deviation of 2.049.

         To study the relationship between a state’s monthly unemployment rates and a state’s

weekly internet search activity, we estimate models of the form

         Searchitk = Unemployment_rate it + i + μt + itk,

where i indexes states, t indexes each month-year, k indexes week of the month, Searchit is the

standardized variable for either global warming or unemployment searches, i is a unique

intercept for each state, μt is a unique intercept for each month-year, and ijk is a normally


7
  We also examined other search terms such as “climate change” but the search volume for this more nuanced term
is very low.
8
  We exclude some observations because of a high frequency of zeros for small states such as North Dakota. In
particular, we drop observations for a given week if both the global warming and unemployment search volume is
zero. This leads us to drop 250 observations (only 1.8 percent of the data), and most of the dropped observations are
from the year 2004, the first year that Google Insights reports search volume. We also exclude Wyoming from the
analysis because of some peculiarities of the data for that state. The main results, however, do not change with
inclusion of these dropped data.

distributed error term. The coefficient of interest is , as it provides an estimate of how, on

average, changes in a state’s unemployment rate affect keyword search activity within that state.

Advantages of the model are that identification comes from variation within a state, after

controlling for changes through time that are common to all states, such as macro-economic

trends, new information, heat waves, and cultural events, e.g., Al Gore’s Nobel Prize in 2007.

We estimate the models with the fixed effects estimator weighted by each state’s population in

2000, and we report standard errors clustered at the state-month-year, reflecting the unit at which

the unemployment data varies.

       Table 1 reports the results for global warming and unemployment in columns (1) and (3).

The coefficient on the unemployment-rate variable is highly statistically significant in both the

global warming and unemployment models, but as hypothesized, it has the opposite sign

between the two models. Higher unemployment rates decrease internet search activity for global

warming, but increase search activity for unemployment. Based on this revealed preference for

interest in global warming, therefore, it appears that recessions crowd out concern for the

environment, while not surprisingly increasing concern about unemployment. Interestingly, the

magnitudes of the coefficients are very similar despite having opposite signs, which is at least

consistent with the notion that one crowds out the other.

       Given the well-known ideological divide between “Red States” and “Blue States” on

environmental issues, we also explore how overall state political ideology affects the association

between state unemployment rates and Google searches. For each state, we collected additional

data on the share of votes cast for the Democrat John Kerry in the 2004 Presidential Election. We

define this variable as Kerry, and across the states it has a mean of 0.468 and standard deviation

of 0.082. With the new variable, we estimate an augmented version of the previous model:




                                                  7
        Searchitk = 1Unemployment_rate it + 2Unemployment_rate it  Kerryi + i + μt + itk,

where the coefficient on the interaction, 2, indicates how the marginal effect of a state’s

unemployment rate on Google searches differs with different political ideology within a state.

Note that Kerryi does not enter the model independently because, due to its time invariance, it is

perfectly collinear with the state fixed effects.

        Table 1 reports the augmented-model results in columns (2) and (4). The coefficient on

the interaction is negative and statistically significant in both cases, though only at the 90-percent

level for the unemployment model. With respect to the global-warming model, the result is

interpreted such that, on average, increases in a state’s unemployment rate reduce the number of

Google searches for global warming within the state, but the reduction is larger in states that lean

more Democratic. Hence it appears, perhaps somewhat counter-intuitively, that concern about

global warming is more negatively correlated with the business cycle in states that lean

democratic rather than republican. One possible explanation is that Republican concern about

climate change is simply lower and less variable. With respect to the model for internet searches

on unemployment, the result implies that, on average, increases in a state’s unemployment

increase the number of Google searches for unemployment, but the increase is lower in states

that lean more Democratic. In other words, Democratic leaning states appear less responsive to

declines in business cycle regarding increases in unemployment internet searches.



3. National Survey on Public Opinion about Climate Change

We obtained data from two surveys conducted by the Yale Project on Climate Change that were

designed to gauge public opinion about global warming and related topics. The surveys were

administered by Knowledge Networks and were conducted between (1) October 8 – 14, 2008



                                                    8
and (2) December 24, 2009 – January 3, 2010. The nationally representative sample sizes for the

two surveys are, respectively, 2,189 and 1,001 adults over the age of 18. The two samples are

independent so that no respondents are represented in both surveys.10

         Our empirical strategy takes advantage of five different questions that were asked in both

waves of the survey. The questions are reproduced here verbatim, along with the response

categories for each and the corresponding numerical codes for our analysis:

     1. Do you think global warming is happening? 1 = yes, 0 = no or don’t know.11

     2. How sure are you that global warming is happening? [Asked only if response to the

         previous question is “yes”] 1 = not sure at all, 2 = somewhat sure, 3 = very sure, 4 =

         extremely sure.

     3. How big of an effort should the United States make to reduce global warming? 1 = no

         effort, 2 = a small scale effort, even if it has small economic costs, 3 = a medium-scale

         effort, even if it has moderate economic costs, 4 = a large-scale effort, even if it has large

         economic costs.

     4. How much do you support or oppose the regulation of carbon dioxide (the primary

         greenhouse gas) as a pollutant? 1 = strongly oppose, 2 = somewhat oppose, 3 =

         somewhat support, 4 = strongly support.

     5. Do you think the U. S. Congress should be doing more or less to address global

         warming? 1 = much less, 2 = less, 3 = currently doing the right amount, 4 = more, 5 =

         much more.

   Details about the surveys and descriptive statistics beyond those reported here are available in numerous reports
about survey results at http://environment.yale.edu/climate/.
11
   The original survey question had “no” and “don’t know” as separate response categories, but we combine the two
for purposes of analysis in this paper.


                                                         9
Additional variables taken from the surveys are socioeconomic characteristics for each

respondent: annual household income, gender, age, and education. We also use the

unemployment rate data (described in the previous section) corresponding with each

respondent’s state of residence and the month when the survey was administered.

          Table 2 reports summary statistics for the pooled data. Sixty-seven percent of the

respondents think that global warming in happening. Among these respondents, they tend to be

“very sure” that it is happening. Respondents tend to think the U.S. should make a medium-scale

effort to address global warming, even if it has moderate economic costs. They are also

somewhat supportive of regulating carbon dioxide as a pollutant, and they think congress is

somewhere between doing the right amount and could be doing more to address global warming.

While the average statewide unemployment rate among respondents at the time they were

surveyed is 7.4 percent, the rate increased from 6.3 to 9.9 percent between the two waves of the

survey.

          To evaluate the effect of unemployment rates on survey responses, we estimate

regression models of the general form

          Yij = 1Unemployment_rate ij + 2Incomei + 3Malei + 4Age i + 5Education i + j + ij,

where i indexes respondents, j indexes states, Yij is the response variable for one of the survey

questions,j is a state-specific intercept, and ij is a normally distributed error term. Despite the

fact that survey response variables are categorical, we simplify the analysis by assuming they are

continuous in our specifications, though all qualitative results are robust to models with

categorical response variables. The coefficient of primary interest is 1, as it provides an estimate

of how changes in the unemployment rate affects survey responses based on variation within

each state. The other s estimate how changes in the socioeconomic variables affect responses,



                                                  10
also based on variation within each state. In all models, we report fixed effects estimates and

clustered standard errors at the state level.

        Table 3 reports the results of all five models. Coefficients on the unemployment rate

variable are all negative and highly statistically significant, indicating that higher unemployment

within a state is associated with less concern about climate change, according to the five

questions. We find that a 1-percent increase in the unemployment rate is associated with a 3.4-

percent decrease in the probability that a respondent thinks global warming is happening.

Moreover, among those that do think it is happening, the increase in unemployment decreases

confidence about their assessment. With higher unemployment, respondents also think the U.S.

should be making less of an effort to reduce global warming, are less supportive of regulating

carbon dioxide as a pollutant, and think congress should be doing less to address global

warming. While the coefficient on income is negative in all models, it is statistically significant

with respect to the effort question only; that is, somewhat counter-intuitively, respondents with

higher income are more likely to respond that the U.S. should be doing less to reduce global

warming if there are economic costs. Age has only a small and mostly insignificant effect. The

results for Education are interesting with respect to whether respondents think global warming is

happening: one more year of education is associated with nearly a 2-percent increase in the

probably that one thinks global warming is happening, and more education is also associated

with greater confidence in this viewpoint.

        Taken together, the results in Table 3 provide robust evidence that higher unemployment

rates decrease concern about climate change. The primary advantage of our empirical strategy is

that these effects are identified off of changes in the unemployment rate within each state.

Technically, this is possible because there are two waves of the survey, meaning that we can




                                                 11
include the state fixed effects. A limitation of the models, however, is that they do not control for

things that change between the two waves of the survey other than macroeconomic conditions

captured by the unemployment rate. Though we do not report the results here, we did attempt to

account for common effects across all states in models that include of a dummy variable for

average differences between waves of the survey. These models also produce negative

coefficients on the Unemployment_rate variable, but they are not statistically significant,

presumably due to the fact that there is far less variation in the change in unemployment rates

among states upon which to identify an effect.



4. California Survey on Priority Issues

The state of California is widely recognized as the leading environmental trend setter in the

nation. It was the first state to pass rigorous standards in the early 1970s on vehicle emissions

and energy efficiency. In 2006, California also passed the landmark AB32 bill that requires sharp

reductions in the state’s greenhouse gas emissions. Given the state’s progressive culture and its

active environmental leadership, it is compelling to ask whether California residents have

continued to support environmental causes as the recession of 2008 has unfolded.

           In order to address this question, we use public opinion data at the household level to test

whether a county’s monthly unemployment rate is negatively associated with the way

households prioritize environmental concerns. Our measure of public opinion is based on micro

data collected by the Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC).12 We pool repeated cross-

sections of the PPIC monthly surveys from January, March, April, May, August and September

of 2008 along with those from January, February, March, April, and May of 2009. Omitted

months are those for which the PPIC did not ask the exact policy-priority question that is central

to our analysis.

           In the eleven waves of the survey that we consider, each respondent was asked the

following question: “Which ONE issue facing California today do you think is the MOST

important?” While the actual survey includes roughly 30 categories among which respondents

can choose, we aggregate the categories into 9 groups in order to reduce dimensionality of the

analysis: economy, environment, jobs, education, health, immigration, deficit, taxes, and other.

We also collected data on each county’s unemployment rate by month from the State of

California’s Employment and Development Department.13 The unemployment data were then

merged with the survey data so that each respondent observation is matched with the

corresponding unemployment rate at the time of the survey in his or her county of residence.

           Table 4 reports descriptive statistics. These, along with the statistical models presented

below, are weighted according to the PPIC weights to make the sample representative of

California’s population based on the sample criterion. Among the aggregated response

categories, the economy is considered the most significant priority area (chosen 33 percent of the

time), followed by jobs (10 percent) and education (8 percent). Environment is chosen much less

frequently as the most significant priority area (less than 2 percent of the time). The mean age is

51 years, and about 50 percent have educational attainment of at least a college degree. The

mean unemployment rate is 8.8 percent with a standard deviation of 3.1.

           We first estimate a multinomial logit model to predict the probability that a respondent

will choose each of the categories as the most important priority issue. We include all of the

socioeconomic variables listed in Table 4 as explanatory variables, in addition to the

unemployment rate in the respondent’s county at the time of the survey. We use “economy” as

the unit at which the unemployment data varies. Table 5 reports all coefficient estimates that are

interpreted relative to the omitted category (economy as the priority issue, and a female

respondent who did not complete high school). There is a clear demographic difference among

those who prioritize environment as the state’s major policy priority compared to the economy.

Older people are less likely to prioritize the environment, and more education tends to increase

the probability of prioritizing the environment.

       After controlling for these demographics, the key finding is the negative and statistically

significant coefficient on the unemployment rate. The result suggests, ceteris paribus, that higher

levels of unemployment in a county are associated with respondents in that county being less

likely to prioritize the environment compared to the economy. In contrast, greater unemployment

rates in a county are associated with respondents in that county being significantly more likely to

prioritize jobs compared to the economy. For all other issue areas, with the exception of taxes,

greater unemployment rates decrease the likelihood of the issue being a priority, though it is

noteworthy that the magnitudes are less than that for the environment.

       To judge the size of the coefficients, we use the model to predict how changes in the

unemployment rate change the average probability of prioritizing each of the different issue

areas. We first generate predicted probabilities for each issue area for every observation using

observed values for the demographic variables and holding the unemployment rate at its overall

mean of 8.84 percent. We then repeat the same procedure but increase the unemployment rate

one standard deviation, that is, 3.15 percent. The means of the predicted probabilities for both

distributions are reported near the bottom on Table 5. We find, for example, that an increase in

the unemployment rate of one standard deviation from the mean causes an increase in the




                                                   14
probability of a respondent choosing economy as the priority issue from 33.1 to 36.0 percent. To

facilitate comparison across issue areas, we also report in the last row the proportional

differences. Though environment starts with a relatively low probability, the same increase in the

unemployment rate decreases its probability of being the priority issue by more then 50 percent,

while the increase in the probability for economy and jobs is roughly 9 and 35 percent,

respectively.

       The multinomial logit model provides evidence that increases in the unemployment rate

within California counties affects how individuals prioritize among issue areas, but we should

mention two potential concerns with the preceding empirical strategy. The first mirrors that for

our analysis in Section 3: the model does not account for average effects through time that are

common to all counties. Though not reported here, we did run specifications that include

dummies for each wave of the survey; but just as we found for the national survey analysis, the

results on unemployment are statistically insignificant when we control for unobserved and

common, average time effects. Hence our interpretation of the results in Table 5 implicitly

assumes that changes in unemployment are what only matters through time when estimating how

local economic conditions affect how individuals prioritize the issues.

       The second potential concern is that the multinomial logit model does not control for

county fixed effects. As a robustness check, therefore, we estimate linear probability models (one

for the choice of each priority issue) that enable us to include county fixed effects. Table 6

reports these results, excluding a model for the “other” category. The qualitative pattern of

results is robust to these specifications and the inclusion of the county fixed effects. Notably,

increases in the unemployment rate within a county decreases the probability that environment is

chosen as the priority issue within that county, but increases the probability that either the




                                                 15
economy or jobs is selected. In terms of magnitudes a 1-percent increase in the unemployment

rate decreases the probability of choosing the environment by approximately half a percent,

while it increase the probability of choosing the economy or jobs by 17 and 18 percent,

respectively.



5. Discussion and Conclusion

This paper uses three different sources of data to investigate the association between the business

cycle—measured with unemployment rates—and concern about climate change in particular and

environmental issues in general. Building on recent research that finds internet search terms to be

useful predictors of health epidemics and economic activity, we study the relationship between

Google keyword searches within a state and a state’s unemployment rate. We find, on average,

that an increase in a state’s unemployment rate decreases searches for “global warming” and

increase searches for “unemployment.” We also find that in more Democratic leaning states, the

decline in global-warming searches is larger, but the increase in unemployment searches is

smaller.

       While the Google analysis provides evidence based on a revealed preference related to

concern about climate change, our other evidence is based on stated preferences that ask about

environmental concern directly. We take advantage of two waves of a national survey with

common questions about climate change to investigate how responses differ within states based

on changes in the states’ unemployment rate. We find that an increase in a state’s unemployment

rate is associated with a decrease the probability that residents think global warming is

happening, and with a reduction in the certainty of those who think it is. Higher unemployment

rates are also associated with views that we should do less with respect to policies designed to




                                                16
reduce global warming. In terms of more general environmental concern, our evidence comes

from eleven monthly waves of a California survey that asks respondents to indicate the issue area

that they think is most important. We find that an increase in a county’s unemployment rate is

associated with a significant decrease is county residents choosing the environment as the most

important issue area.

       Together, the results presented here provide the first empirical estimates of how

unemployment rates affect environmental concern. But what mechanisms are likely to underlie

the results? During a recession, households are likely to focus on day-to-day well being rather

than more abstract, long term, and uncertain threats such as global warming. The fear of losing

one’s job, along with concern for friends and family in their efforts to remain employed, are

likely to focus attention on the short-run health of the economy and coping with macro

uncertainty. Such behavior is consistent with psychological theory based on Maslow’s (1943)

hierarchy of needs. It is also consistent with our results on increasing concern about the economy

and unemployment at the same time we observe decreasing concern about global warming and

the environment.

       Anticipating such shifts in focus, the national media has an incentive to increase coverage

of the recession and decrease coverage of environmental issues like global warming. Based on

data that we collected from Google News and the Vanderbilt Television News Archive, Figures

1 and 2 show trends in actual coverage of global warming and unemployment by the national

media between January 2006 and January 2010. Figure 1 shows a downward trend in the number

of print media stories about global warming in major national newspapers since the beginning of

2007. At the same time, the number of print media stories about unemployment exhibits an

upward trend. Figure 2 reports television media coverage in terms of minutes of coverage by




                                                17
month. Note that prior to November 2007, global warming and unemployment receive a similar

number of minutes, but thereafter coverage of global warming drops off (with the exception of

the spike at the end of 2009 corresponding with the COP 15 meetings in Copenhagen);

meanwhile coverage of unemployment is substantially higher, especially beginning in the Fall of

2008 when the recession started to take hold. We must recognize, however, that while media

coverage reflects the population’s priorities at a given point in time, it also influences peoples’

priorities through the spread of information. This is important in the context of recent studies that

emphasize the causal role of the media in determining economic and political outcomes (Besley

and Burgess 2002; DellaVigna and Kaplan 2007; Eisensee and Stromberg 2007). Accordingly,

future research that further investigates the causal relationship between media coverage and

environmental concern would be useful.

       Social interactions are also likely to play a role. It is easy to imagine multiple equilibria,

whereby a population can become highly concerned about global warming and interaction with

like minded friends and colleagues reinforces this world view. Cultural events, such as watching

An Inconvenient Truth, may help such individuals connect in residential communities and/or on

the internet. Participating in “green consumer” markets with purchases such as a Prius hybrid

car, solar panels, or green power may reinforce interest and community discussion of

environmental issues (Kahn 2007; Kotchen and Moore 2007, 2008). But, of course, the same

phenomena can also operate in ways that diminish concern about the environment. A

modification of Becker’s (1991) bandwagon model offers one possible modeling strategy; for

example, one’s interest in global warming may decline if his or her peer group’s interest

declines. From an empirical perspective, a recession may thus represent an exogenous shock that




                                                 18
ultimately reduces concern through both individual and peer-group effects. Further research that

builds on these ideas would be of value.

       Finally, we conclude with emphasis on why understanding the relationship between

environmental concern and recessions is important for public policy and economics. It is well-

known that public opinion affects which public policies ultimately pass and how they are funded

and implemented. With this in mind, the results of this paper suggest that effective

environmental policy in general and climate-change policy in particular is more likely during

economic booms. At present, however, we face significant economic challenges concurrent with

increasing pressure for substantive climate and energy policies at the state, national, and

international levels. Whether or not something happens in the near future remains to be seen, but

making the connection between the business cycle and environmental concern is a important link

in the process of understanding the prospects for environmental policy and the full cost of

recessions.
