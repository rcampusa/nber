        Short—Term and Long—Term Expectations of the Yen/Dollar Exchange Rate:
                              Evidence from Survey Data




                                         ABSTRACT



                Three surveys of   exchange rate expectations allow us   to measure

   directly    the expected rates of return on yen versus dollars. Expectations
   of yen appreciation against the dollar have been Cl) consistently large,
   (2) variable, and    (3)   greater than the forward premium,   implying   that
   investors   were willing to accept a lower expected    return on dollar     assets.

   At   short—term horizons expectations exhibit bandwagon effects, while at

   longer—term horizons they show the reverse. A 10 percent yen appreciation

   generates the expectation of a further appreciation of 2.11 percent over the

   following week, for example, but a depreciation of 3.1$ percent over the

   following year. At any horizon, investors would do better to reduce the

  absolute magnitude of expected depreciation. The true spot rate process

  behaves more like a random walk.

1. Introduction

            With most of Japan's restrictions on international capital flows

recently removed, the yen is now properly thought of as subject to the

asset—market model of exchange rates: the demand for yen versus dollars

responds   instantaneously to. the   expected rates of return on the two assets.

The most evident component of      variation in recent years has been interest
rates.   The difrerentiai. between    U.S. and Japanese interest rates can be
used   to explain the increased demand for dollars and the sharp appreciation
of   the dollar against the yen from 1979 to 198I1, and   the   subsequent

reversal in 1985.B6.2 But the other major determinant of the         expected
return differential, the expected rate of future appreciation        of the yen,

is   much less easily observed than interest rates.
            One view is   that   the expected rate of depreciation can be
measured by the discount in the forward market. According to this view,

yen/dollar exc-ange rate, es:ecially since the 1979—80 liberalization.

and Loopesko (1956).

the 3 per cent yen—dollar forward discount that prevailed in the early
19805    represented investors' expectations that the dollar would in the
future depreciate, presumably back toward some equilibrium level. An
implication is that investors acting on this expectation — "speculators"
— had a lower demand for dollars during the strong—dollar period                than they

would have had acting solely       on   the basis   of the   interest differçntial     or

other   factors;   in other words, speculation was stabilizing.

            An   alternative   view is that the expected rate of depreciation is

much    closer to zero than to the forward discount. Many empirical studies
have found that the rationally, or mathematically, expected rate pt
depreciation is close to zero, (i.e., that          the   exchange rate follows a
random walk) so.there is a prima facie case that the same is true of
investor expectations. If expected depreciation is zero ("static
expectations"), then there is no stabilizing effect in the form of
speculators selling a currency       when it is     strong. A    more   extreme view   is

that there is a bandwagon effect: at each point during the 1980—814 period,

the appreciation of the dollar against the yen generated expectations of

further futur appreciation, notwithstanding the fact that the dollar was

selling at a forward discount against the yen.               It would follow from this

view that speculators ——again, defined as investors acting on the basis

of expectations of exchange rate changes—— drove the yen/dollar rate to a

higher level than would have otherwise prevailed. It would follow that

speculators have exaggerated the reverse swing in 1985—86 as well. Whether

expectations are stabilizing or destabilizing in this sense is one of the

questions examined in this paper.
                                    —3—
            Another question, which would be of particular interest to

policy—makers   if' one were to conclude that exchange rates have been
undesirably unstable, is whether government intervention in the foreign
exchange market otters a way of affecting the exchange rate even in the
absence of a change in macroeconomic policy. The question of    whether

intervention can have an effect, even if sterilized so as to leave the

money supply unchanged, is generally thought to depend on the question

whether yen and dollar assets are imperfect substitutes in investors'

portfolios. Under the special case in which assets are perfect

substitutes, investors will be willing to absorb indefinitely—large

quantities into their portfolios, as long as the assets pay the going rate

of return, with no effect on the price of the asset. The condition one

would like to test is uncovered interest parity: risk—neutral investors

drive the yen interest rate into equality with the dollar interest rate

corrected for expected depreciation.

            Exchange rate expectations are crucial for each of these

important questions, and for others as well. Measuring investors'

expectations is always difficult. Probably the most commonly—used measure

of expected depreciation is the forward discount, which arbitrage (in the

absence of barriers to capital flows) in turn equates to the interest

differential. But using the forward discount or interest differential

prejudges   the question of perfect substitutability. The other common
approach is to assume that market expectations can be measured as the
mathematical expectation of the realized exchange rate within the sample
                                      —4—

period,   conditional on some particular information set. But this approach,

too, prejudges much.

             This   paper proposes a third measure, survey data on exchange rate
expectations, to answer various questions of interest regarding the
yen/dollar   market. The data come from three sources. The American Express

Bank Review surveys 250—300 central bankers, private bankers, corporate

treasurers, and economists once a year, with some surveys going back to

1976. The Economist's Financial Report has conducted telephone surveys of

currency traders and currency—room economists at 14 leading international

banks each six weeks since June 1981. Money Market Services, Inc. (MMS),

has also been surveying approximately 30 currency traders by telephone

every two weeks since January 1953, and every week sInce October 19811.

These data are discussed and analyzed in Frankel and Froot (1985) and Froot

and Frankel (1986). The results reported in the present paper are new,

in two respects. First, they focus exclusively on the yen/dollar rate,

where the earlier two papers examined simultaneously the yen, pound, mark,

French franc, and Swiss franc. Secondly, they distinguish between

short—term expectations on the one hand——at horizons of one week, two weeks

or one month——as reported in the MMS survey, and long—term expectations on

the other hand——at horizons of six months or twelve     months——as reported in
the   other two surveys. The short—term and long—term expectations turn out

to behave very differently.



3The first paper investigates how investors form expectations from the
contemporaneous spot rate and other variables. The second paper
investigates the standard regression equation of exchange rate changes
against the forward discount. Both papers include tests of the proposition
that the expectations measured in the survey are unbiased.
                                       —5—
          In section 2 we relate expected depreciation as measured by the

surveys to the      forward discount, in order to test   the hypothesis of

perfect substitutability. In section 3 we investigate some standard models

of expectations formation——distributed lag, adaptive, and regressive

expectations. In each case one motivation is to see if expectations are

stabilizing, versus the alternative of static or even bandwagon

expectations. In each case a second motivation, which we pursue in section

M, is to test whether the expectations formation process is similar to the

process describing the mathematical expectation or the actual spot rate,

that is, whether the expectations are unbiased conditional on the

particular information set. Included here is a test of the proposition

that investors would do better in forming their expectations if they put

more weight on the contemporaneous spot rate and less weit on other

variables. Finally,in section 5 we briefly summarize our findings.



II. The Forward Discount: Risk Premium or Expected Depreciation?

          Our first question is whether investors treat assets denominated

in yen and dollars as perfect substitutes. If positions in different

currencies were perfectly substitutable, investors would be indifferent

between holding open positions in foreign assets and selling the assets

forward. This would imply that the forward discount exactly equals the

expected depreciation of the currency:



               e              k
(1)       As         =   fd
               tk             t
                                      —6—
where fd is the forward discount at term k (the log of the current forward rate

minus the log of the current spot rate) and             is the log of the

expected spot rate k periods into the future minus the log of the current

spot rate. On the other hand, if investors need to be rewarded for

exposure to the additional risk or holding an open position in the foreign

currency, they will demand a risk premium in addition to the forward rate:




(2)         L5t+k =   fd — rp.
            Because both expected depreciation, Ase, and the risk premium,

rp,   are unobservable, additional information or assumptions are required      to

isolate   them. If, for example, we were to assume that realized future spot
rates are unbiased measures of expected spot rates, then we could estimate
expected depreciation (and therefore the risk premium) from the time—series

of realized depreciation.M A second method of identification wotild be

to assume the validity of a particular model of investor portfolio

optimization (such as 1-lodrick and Srivastava (198±4) or Frankel (1982)) and

use it to obtain estimates of the risk premium. A third approach, the one

taken in this paper, is to employ survey data on expected depreciation.

While surveys of agents' expectations may in many contexts be less

desirable than data on their actual market behavior, the surveys are direct

estimates   that do   not require us to assume any   particular model of expected
depreciation   or of the risk premium.



Perfect substitutability, or uncovered interest parity (which, given
covered interest parity, is art equivalent condition), is tested for Japan
versus the United States by Ito (198±4) and McKenzie (1986).
                                       —7—

      -
               First   we look at simple averages over the sample period.

(Below we will consider variation over time.) In Table 1 we present the

time—series means for each set of survey data.        The results are ordered by

length of forecast horizon, from the shortest—term one—week expectations,

to the longer—term one—year expectations. The surveys cover a wide variet.

of sample periods as well. In the first column, averages of actual

depreciation are reported. During the periods of the one—week and

one-month    KMS surveys, from October 19814 to February 1986, the dollar
depreciated    against the yen at an annual rate of 27.5 percent. During the

period    covered by the three—month IIMS surveys as well as the three, six and

twelve    month Economist surveys, the rate of depreciation is much smaller.

             Column (2) reports corresponding averages of the survey expected

depreciation. The time—series means of realized depreciation perform very

poorly as measures of the investors' expectations reported in the surveys.

In contrast to the considerable swings in the sign and magnitude of average

actual spot rate changes, the survey consistently called for upward

movements   in the value of the yen against the dollar. The expectations are
the  same in sign, but larger in magnitude than the time—series averages of
the forward discount reported in column (3).
            The   last column in table 1 presents the risk premium on dollar—
denominated assets as implied by the     surveys. Strikingly, during both

periods   of appreciation and periods of depreciation the risk premium is
negative.    Far from regarding the two assets as perfect substitutes,

investors appear to be willing to sacrifice the substantially higher

expected returns from holding yen in order to hold dollars. Indeed, the

magnitudes are surprisingly large. In the three—month Economist data, for

example,- respondents expected they could earn an additional 7.99 percent

per annum on assets denominated in yen compared with dollars. It is hard

to justify such large exchange risk premia using the theory of optimal

portfolio choice with conventional estimates of risk—aversion (Frankel

1985, and Mehra and Prescott 1985).
          -

              One explanation proposed for why investors were willing to hold

dollars at lower expected rates of return is that the United States

provided a "safe haven" from capital controls and other political risks

(for example, Dooley and Isard, 1985; but see Franke]. and Froot, 1986).

Grounds    for this argument seem especially lacking vis—a—vis the yen: Japan
was not directly involved in either the Latin American debt crisis or
concerns of "Europessimism", and the 1980s have been a period during which

Japanese financial markets have been steadily liberalized, if anything

reducing fears of prospective capital controls. Furthermore, only exchange

rate risk should in theory be relevant, not factors relating to the

political jurisdiction of Japan, because the spot and forward rates are

determined offshore in the Euroinarket. But whatever the reason, table 1

suggests that investors distinguish between assets denominated in different

currencies, demanding a higher return on the yen than on dollars. This is

also clear in Figure 1.

              While the evidence so far indicates that a risk premium exists,

it is not necessarily evidence that the risk premium varies over time. The

proposition that the risk premium is time-varying rather than constant

comes   out of   most of the conventional empirical literature on the forward

market, as wu]] as the theury of optimizing i]lvestoz-s, and is also a
 property   of models in which sterilized foreign exchange intervention has

 important effects.

            Thus we would also like to know whether changes in the forward

discount indicate a changing risk premium. This is precisely the type of

time—varying risk premium that the literature testing forward rate unbiasedness

has sought.5 The degree to which changes in the forward discount reflect

changes in the risk premium can be inferred from a regression of expected

depreciation on the forward discount:



(3)         óSt+k              bfd +E+k

The null hypothesis in equation (3) is that assets are perfect substitutes,

i.e., a=O and b=l. The estimated coefficient, , converges in probability to:


                               e         k        k
            b       coy t+k' fd) / var (fd)

                =                    k       k      k

                    1—   [   coy

A finding that b is near zero or less than zero is evidence that changes in

the forward discèunt reflect changes in the risk premiwa, while a finding

that b is near one is evidence that such changes in the forward discount

reflect something else, namely equivalent changes in expected depreciation.

         The conventional approach to testing equation (2) uses ex post

spot rate changes to infer the behavior of the unobservable market expected



5Fama (1984), Hodrick and Srivastava (1984, 1986) and Froot and Frankel
(1986) discuss whether changes in the forward discount primarily reflect
changes in the risk premium or in expected depreciation.

depreciation.      Under the assumption of rational expectations, the future

spot rate realizations are viewed as noisy measures of investors'

expectations. This noise is assumed to be uncorrelated with the forward

discount, and therefore can be identified with the residual term in

equation (3). Table 2 reports estimates of equation (3), using ex post

changes in the spot rate as the lefthand—side variable.6 All of the

point estimates of b are less than zero! and most are significantly less

than one. The conventional approach would therefore seem to imply that

changes in the forward discount predominantly reflect changes in the risk

premi urn.


              Our alternative test of equation (3) uses the survey expected

depreciation on the lefthand side, in place of the actual spot rate change.

The existence of heterogeneous beliefs, the use or the median survey

response, and the lack of perfect synchronization, are reasons to suspect

that the surveys may also be noisy estimates or market expectations. Now

the error term in the regression equation may be interpreted as measurement

error in the surveys. We make the assumption that this measurement error

is random, which is analogous to the assumption of rational expectations

used in the conventional technique above, i.e., that the expectation error

is random..


6A11 of the regre8sions in this paper are estimated using OLS. The
Economost surveys, MMS one—month and three—month surveys, and the AMEX
twelve—month survey were conducted at intervals shorter than their
respective forecast horizons. This implies that the error term in equation
(2) is serially correlated even under the null hypothesis. Consistent
estimates of the standard errors were obtained by the usual method of
moments procedure (see Hansen and Hodrick (1980), or Froot and Frankel
(1986) for a more detailed description). For additional information on the
construction of the data sets used in this paper, see the appendix to
Frankel and Froot (1985).

             Though the two approaches are analogous, there are several
reasons to prefer the surveys to the actual spot rate data in tests of

equation     (3). The first   is   that, under    the hypothesis that   both actual

spot     rates and the surveys contain only the market expectation plus purely
random noise, the noise element in actual spot rate changes turns out to be
much larger than the noise element in the surveys. In Froot and Frankel
(1986, table 3) we report estimates of the variances of actual and survey
expected spot rate changes and find that the former is greater by a factor
of   7   to 10. This implies that, for    any given    sample, a more precise
estimate of b may be obtained       by using the surveys. A second reason to
prefer the surveys is that they free us from imposing the restriction that

there are no systematic prediction errors in the sample, a proposition that

we would like to be able to test rather than impose. Such systematic

errors, which the conventional technique must assume away, could occur

because of a failure of rational expectations, or because important events

which affect expectations did not happen to occur a representative number

of times in the sample (the "peso problem"), rendering the ex post

distribution of spat rate changes a biased estimator of the ex ante

distribution.

             Tests of equation (3) using the survey data on the lefthand side

are reported in table 3. In each of the seven data sets the estimates of b

are greater than those in table 2. In most cases we cannot reject the

hypothesis that b equals one. In other words, we cannot reject the

hypothesis that the survey risk premia reported in table 1 do not vary over

time. There is not even much sign that the risk premium on yen had an

 exogenous downward trend during the 1981—85 period, as it would under the

 hypothesis that internationalization was causing investors around the world

 to become more willing to hold yen. (Figure 1 shows, on the negative axis,

 the risk premium on dollars, i.e., the rorward discount or interest

 differential minus the expected appreciation of the yen.) In all cases,

however, we can reject the hypothesis of perfect substitutability, a—O and

b=1 jointly. In other words, the risk premium does show up in the constant

term.

            To summarize, in Table 3, as in Table 1, it appears that the ex

post depreciation nay be a very poor measure of expected depreciation.

Table   3 provides evidence that changes in the forward discount reflect
primarily changes in expected depreciation rather than changes in the risk
premium.



111. Models of Expected DepreciatLDrl
            The results from the first three tables suggest that   there   is

information on expectations in the surveys which is not contained in either

realized spot rates or forward rates. We may thus gain new insights by

using this data source to reexamine several old formulations of exchange

rate expectations that   are standard to the literature.7

           A general framework for testing various specifications of

expectations is to model expectations of the future spot rate as giving

some weight to the contemporaneous spot rate as well as some weight to

other variables In investors' information set. In each case below, our


7The tests reported in this section are similar to those reported in Frankel
and Froot (1985) for the dollar against five other currencies. But they
did not include the results for the shorter—term forecast horizons.
                                              — 13 —

null    hypothesis will he that of static expectations: investors place a

weight of one on the contemporaneous spot—rate and a weight of zero on the

other   information,         so that expected depreciation is zero. The alternative

hypothesis   depends on the precise variable chosen to represent the "other"
information. Suppose, for example, that                investors   assign a weight of g to
the   lagged spot rate and a weight of l—g to the current spot rate in
forming their expectations of the future spot rate:


                       — (l—g)      +



where 3 is the logarithm            of   the current   spot rate. Subtracting   s from
both sides we have that expected depreciation is              proportional   to the
most recent change in the spot rate:


                 e
                            g


            We       term   the model in equation (5) extrapo:flive expectations. If

irivestors place positive weight on the lagged spot rate, so that g is

positive, then equation          ('1) says that investors' expected future spot rate
is a simple distributed lag. On the other hand, if investors tend to
extrapolate the most recent change in the spot rate, so that                g is negative,
then equation (5) may be termed "bandwagon" expectations. In this latter
case a current appreciation by itself generates expectations of further
future appreciation. By defining "speculation" as the buying and selling
of yen in response to non—zero expected exchange rate changes, we can
                                                  — 114   —



 interpret    a finding of g>O as implying that                 speculation   is stabilizing and

a   finding   of gCO as implying that             speculation     is destabilizing.

              Table II reports regression estimates of equation (5), using the

survey expected depreciation as the lefthand—side variable. The regression

error   can be interpreted as random measurement error. Under the joint
hypothesis that the mechanism of expectations formation is specified
correctly and that measurement error is random, the parameter estimates are
consistent.         It should    be noted     that the joint hypothesis is a particularly
strong assumption        because the spot         rate appears on the right—hand—side; if
a change    in     expected    depreciation feeds back to affect both the

contemporaneous spot           rate   and   any element       of the regression error, then the

estimate of        g will be   biased and inconsistent.            However this is    not a

problem under our null hypothesis that expected depreciation                      is constant.

              The findings      are   once    again ordered by the length of the forecast
horizon. It is itinediately evident that the shorter—term expectations ——

one week, two weeks and one month ——                all    exhibit large and significant

bandwagon     tendencies:      that   is, s   <   0. In the one—week expectations, for

example, an        appreciation of 10 percent in one week generates the
expectation that the spot rate will appreciate another 2.11                    percent over the

next seven days.

              In   contrast with the shorter—term expectations, the longer—term
results all point toward distributed lag expectations, the stabilizing case.

to    be 3ignificantly greater           than   zero.8 The Economist 12 month data,

for example, imply that a current 10 percent appreciation by itself

generates an expectation of 3.11 percent depreciation over the coming 12

months.      Thus longer—term expectations feature a strongly positive weight
on    the lagged spot rate rather than complete weitt on the contemporaneous
spot rate, and in this sense are stabilizing.
         -
             A    second popular specification for the expected future spot rate

is that it is a weighted average of the current spot rate and the

long—run equilibrium spot rate, :




(6)          5tk         (1—e)       +



or in terms of expected depreciation:



                     =   °       —


If    ® is positive, as, for example, in the Dornbusch (1976) overshooting

model, the spot rate is expected to move in the direction of ;.


Expectations are therefore regressive. Alternatively, a finding of 0 < 0

implies that investors expect the spot rate to move away from the long—run

equil ibri urn.




81n Frankel and Froot. (1956), we correct for the low Durbin—Watson
statistics itt similar regressions using five different currencies (and
those in Tables 6 and 7) using a three—stage least squares estimation
technique which allows for first order serial correlation iTt the residuals.
The technique is not repeated here since the corrected results obtained in
that paper are very similar to the uncorrected OLS e:itimates..

            Table 5 presents tests of equation ('1). Estimates of changes in S

were calculated using CPI's to measure changes in the relative price levels

in the United States and Japan, under the assumption of purchasing power

parity (PPP). Once again, there is strong evidence that shorter—term

expectations are formed in a manner different from longer—term expectations.

The shorter forecast horizons all yield estimates of t.nat 0 are negative,

additional evidence that shorter—term speculation may be destabilizing.

Indeed, the 1—week data suggest that the contemporaneous deviation from the

long—run equilibrium is expected on average to grow by 3 percent over the

subsequent seven days. In other words, short—term expectations are          -




explosive.    What about the longer—term horizons? In   Frankel and Froot

(1985)   we found a highly significant speed of regression   at the longer—term

horizons. The longer-term estimates of e    in Table 5 do not, however,
exhibit   regressivity for the yen that is as hily significant. Only the

American Express 12—month data, which is available as far back as 1976,

shows an estimate that is significant even at the 10 percent level. It may

be that relative CPI's are not the appropriate indicator of the equilibrium

yen! dollar rate. It has been suggested that due to rapid productivity

growth in Japan, Japanese producers gain in international competitiveness

even to the extent that F?!' is observed to hold. Marston (1986)

demonstrates that even though estimates of real exchange rate changes using

CPIs show real appreciation of the yen against the dollar over the last

decade, estimates using manufactured goods prices give a very different

answer. 9

             The final specification we consider is adaptive expectations. In

this   case, agents are hypothesized to form their expectation of the future

spot rate as a weighted average of the current spot rate and the lagged

expected spot rate;




      3tk (1—1)         +   Y   s.

Expected depreciation is now proportional to the contemporaneous prediction

error:

                                —


           Table 6 reports estimates of equation (9). Once again, the
weight placed on the variable other than the contemporaneous spot rate, in

this case the lagged expectation, is sensitive to the forecast horizon of

the surveys. Shorter—term expectations again appear to be strongly

destabilizing, while the longer—term expectations are significantly

stabilizing. For example, the one—week data indicate that an unanticipated

appreciation of 10 percent by itself generates an expectation of

continued appreciation over the subsequent seven days of 1.3 percent. At

the other extreme, the Economist 12—month data suggest that an

unanticipated appreciation of 10 percent generates an offsetting

expectation of depreciation of 1.5 percent over the subsequent year.

           The results of Tables 4, 5, and 6 suggest that in all three of

our standard models of expectations——extrapolative, regressive and

adaptive——short—term and long—term expectations behave very differently
                                   — 18 —

 from one another. Longer—term expectations consistently appear to be

 stabilizing, while shorter—term forecasts seem to have a destabilizing

 nature. Within each of the above tables, it is as if there are actually

 two models of expectations operating, one at each end of the spectrum of

forecast horizons, and a blend in between.

           It may be that each respondent is thinking to himself or herself,

"1 know that in the long run the exchange rate must return to the

equilibrium level dictated by fundamentals. But in the short run I will

ride the current trend a little longer. I only have to be careful to watch

for the turning point and to get out of the market before everyone else

does." If this is the logic of the typical investor, then he is acting

irrationally; it is not possible for everyone to get out before everyone

else. But so far we have not presented any evidence that the actual spot

process behaves differently from investors' expectations. We consider such

evidence in the following section.1°



IV. Rationality of the Survey Expectations

          Now that we have a sense for the behavior of the survey expected

depreciation, we turn to an analysis of whether the predictable component



100ne possibility is that the MMS short—term survey is picking up
predominantly the expectations of floor traders, people who buy and sell
currency on a short—term basis, and that the other two, longer—term,
surveys are picking up predominantly the expectations of investors who have
a longer—term perspective. Under this interpretation, it may be that the
traders have developed the habit of ignoring economic fundamentals in their
expectations formation, rather going with time series trends (as in
"chartism" or "technical analysis"), and that the latter group pays more
attention to fundaiaentals. The chartist/fundamentalist dichotomy and its
implications for the determination of the value of the dollar in the 1980s
are pursued in Frankel and Froot (1986).

of   the true spot process behaves in the same way, i.e., whether

expectations are rational. One way to proceed would be to re—estimate each

of the models given in equations (5)—(8), only now using realized

depreciation as the lefthand—side variable. The hypothesis that

expectations are rational would imply that these regressions should yield

coefficients that are statistically indistinguishable from those obtained

earlier using the surveys on the lefthand aide. A more direct way to test

the same hypothesis is to regress the difference between the survey

expectation and the actual future spot rate, the survey prediction error,

on each set of regressors in equations (5)-(3). Under the null hypfthesis

that expectations are rational, this prediction error should be purely

random (conditionally independent of all information available at time t)

and therefore should be uncorrelated both with the righthand—side variables

and with past errors. We test whether the coefficients are jointly zero.

           Table 7 reports regressions of the survey prediction errors on

the most recent change in the spot rate. The estimated F statistics give

some evidence of systematic expectational errors: five of the nine data

sets reject the joint hypothesis that both the constant and slope

coefficients equal zero. In view of the discussion in the previous

section, an inspection of the slope coefficient, g, can help us to

determine whether investors place the correct weight on the lagged spot

rate. A finding of g1>O would indicate that expectations are

"insufficiently" extrapolative: investors give too much weight to the

lagged spot rate and too little weight to the contemporaneous spot rate

relative to what is rational. Conversely, a finding of g,<O would indicate

that expectations are "overly" extrapolative. Table 7      suggests   that
predictions    at the shorter forecast horizons tend to be overly
extrapolative,   while those at the longer horizoha are insufficiently

extrapolative. Such a pattern suggests that the contrast in Table 5

between the behavior of short—term and long—term expectations is too

extremerelative to what the actual process generating spot rate changes
would predict. Few estimates of Zi' however, are significantly different
from zero. There is thus not enough evidence so far to conclude that, at

any of the reported forecast horizons, investors place too little or too

much weight on the lagged spot rate relative to what is rational.

            In Table 8 we test whether investors' expectations give the

correct weight to the long—run equilibrium spot rate1 L Here the

results   are surprisingly consistent across all of the forecast horizons:
expectations seem to be insufficiently regressive in that they give less
weight to §,   and   therefore more weight to the contemporaneous spot rate,
than does the true process governing the behavior of the spot rate. In
Table 9 we perform    the analogous test using lagged expectational errors on

the righthand side. In this case, the alternative hypotheses are that

expectations are either overly or insufficiently adaptive. As in Table 7,

the results in Table 9 do not suggest any clear tendency on the part of

investors to give too much or too little weitlt to the most recent

expectational prediction error.

           The tests of rational expectations presented so far in Tables

7—9 are appropriate when we take as given the specific models of

expectations   formation discussed in the previous section. Each regression
                                      — 21 —

 was designed to test whether investors assign the correct weit to a

 single element in their information set when predicting the level of the

yen/dollar rate. If, however, both expectations and the        true spot   process

depend on other unspecified infornation, then the above tests of

rationality are not necessarily the most enlightening nor the most powerful.

A more robust test would ask whether expectations assign too little weight

to the contemporaneous spot rate and (by default) too much weight to all

other variables in their information set. This test is performed by

regressing the survey prediction error on the survey expected depreciation:

and testing the hypothesis that the coefficients are jointly zero. The

alternative hypothesis is that investors place too much (or too little)

weight on variables other than the contemporaneous spot rate relative to

what is rational. Following Bilson (1981), we term this alternative

hypothesis "excessive speculation", because investors could improve their

forecasts by consistently reducing toward zero their expectations of

depreciation.

            Table 10 reports our estimates of equation (10). Here we find

much more evidence of systematic expectational errors in the surveys. All

but one   of the data sets reject the hypothesis that   the   constant and slope
parameter are   jointly   zero. Four of the seven estimates of b are also
statistically different from zero, so there is considerable evidence of
excessive speculation. Unlike the     results of the preceding tests of

 rationality,    our estimates here are uniformly positive and do not appear

 related to the length of forecast horizon. In every case we are also

 unable to reject the hypothesis that b—i, which would imply that the

expectations contain no useful information at all as to the future spot

rate, i.e., that the spot rate follows a random walk.

        -   We   mentioned earlier the possibility of measurement error in the

survey data. In any of the regression equations where the expectations

variable appears only on the lefthand side, namely the cases of

extrapolative expectations (Tables 14 and 7) and regressive expecations

(Tables 5 and 8) random measurement error does not impair the regression

estimates. But in the case of adaptive expectations (Tables ô and 9). as

well as in the present case of excessive speculation (Table 10), the

expectations variable appears also on the righthand side of the equation,

so that measurement error would affect the estimates.

            When the issue of possible random measurement error in these

regression equations is addressed the results are qualitatively unchanged.

In the test for excessive speculation we can eliminate the problem of

measurement error (so long as it is random) by using the forward discount

as the righthand—side variable. Table 11 again shows systematic

expectational errors: investors could do better by routinely betting

against the forward discount,11




11See Froot and Frankel (1986) for further explanation. In the case of
estimating adaptive expectations, we would argue that the bias introduced,
though nonzero, is small, because the variance of actual spot rate changes
is approximately 10 times larger than the variance of expected depreciation
(Table 3, ibid.).

 V.   Conclusions

 (1) The survey data on exchange rate expectations appear to contain new

 information about market expectations which is not apparent from either ex

post spot rate changes or the forward discount. Our measures show that,

despite the large swings in both directions in the value of the yen since

1980, the surveys consistently called for a large appreciation of the yen

against the dollar.


 (2) These measures of expected appreciation are also substantially in

 excess of the forward pre!tiu.'n.
                                     An implication is that investors were

wiiitg to accept a lower expected rate of return on dollar assets than on

 comparable asseta denominated in yen.



(3)   Contrary   to what is commonly assumed in most models in which

Sterilized foreign exchange intervention is efrective, variation in the

forward discowfl does not reflect a
                                        statistically significant degree of
variation in the risk premium.



(14) Variation in the forward disc6unt
                                           primarily reflects, instead of
changes in the risk premiwn, changes in expected depreciation.



(5) The expectations given in the short—tern surveys exhibit bandwagon

effects, which could imply that short—term speculation is destabilizing.



(6) Expectations at longer—term horizcns, in ccntrast, appear to put less

than full weight on the contemporaneous spc: r: and positive weight on
                                   24 —

several   other variables such as the lagged spot rate, the long—run

equilibrium spot rate, and the lagged expected spot rate.



(7) Investors could improve both their short—term and their long—term

forecasts by reducing the absolute magnitude of expected depreciation

toward zero. This finding of "excessive speculation" would also follow

from the result that expected depreciation is not zero together with the

popular hypothesis that the true spot process follows a random walk.
