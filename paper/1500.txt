                                  ABSTRACT


       This paper reports on the current status of the microeconomic
research on labor supply behavior. The purpose is to direct attention to
microeconomic research that may be helpful in the continuing evaluation of
aggregate models designed to explain the dynamic behavior of wages,
employment and unemployment. The approach is hopelessly empirical, and the
emphasis throughout is on models specified completely enough to allow
confrontation with the kind of data actually available.

        The first part of the paper is addressed to microeconomists,
however. It is a brief attempt to provide a sketch of the stylized facts
that aggregate models of the labor market are meant to address. These
include (1) the serial 'persistence' in the change in unemployment (or
employment), (2) the absence of persistence in the change in the real wage
rate, and (3) the continued existence of a negative correlation between
nominal price changes and unemployment rates.

        The microeconomic (longitudinal) data turn out to be difficult to
square up with the simplest life—cycle models of labor supply. Contrary to
the predictions of the models, the data indicate that (i) average hours and
average real wages move in the same direction only some of the time, and
that (2) the within life—cycle, person—specific correlation between hours
and wages is negative. The microeconomic (experimental) data indicate other
puzzles. More elaborate models incorporating measurement error, non—
separable preferences, and unanticipated wage movements may explain these
findings, but they are also likely to contain parameters that are not
easily identified with the kind of data actually available.

        Perhaps an alternative approach may be more fruitful in reconciling
the long run determination of hours worked by worker preferences with the
short run interaction of observed employment and earnings.

     When it comes to public policy discussions of the labor market,

 there is no doubt that th big picture of time—series movements in

 unemploymet, employment and wages is the major topic of public con-

 cern. Since there is a great deal of active empirical microeconomic

 research on labor markets, it seems natural to occasionally inquire as

 to the implications of the findings from this research for the larger

 issues of macroeconomics. I have often found that this is not always a

 straightforward undertaking, however, as very little of this microeco—

 nomic research is designed with an eye toward its broader implications.

 This may be all for the best, as it keeps the microeconomists away from

 the heat of battle and maybe also from the temptations to cook the

 data. Nevertheless, it is often the case that a line of research will

 cut across both macroeconoomic and microeconomic issues, and when this

 does not happen, it may even be a signal that something is amiss in one

 area or another.

     In this paper, I report mainly on my perception of the current

status of the microeconomic research on labor supply behavior. The

purpose is to direct attention to microeconomic. research that may be

helpful in the continuing evaluation of aggregate models designed to

explain the dynamic behavior of wages, employment, and unemployment. My

approach is hopelessly empirical and the emphasis throughout is on

models specified completely enough to allow confrontation with the kind

of data actually available.

     The first part of the paper is addressed to microeconomists,

however. It is a brief attempt to provide a sketch of the stylized facts
                                  —2—

that aggregate models of the labor market are meant to address. The goal

here is to Lnnmarize for (a perhaps skeptical) reader some simple

empirical regularities that seem strong enough to deserve explanation.

If they are presented in a convincing enough fashion, perhaps even the

microeconomists will find them wQrthy of attention.


          I. Facts and Theories of the Aggregate Labor Market


     Although the catalogue could surely be longer, I would like to

emphasize three basic characteristics of the aggregate labor market that

must surely top the list of important empirical regularities. The first

of these is the high serial correlation or "persistence" in measures of the

change in unemployment (or employment). The existence of this per-

sistence is relatively easy to document and its existence is rarely

questioned. Here I want only to indicate the nature of the serial

correlation and indicate its striking similarity in several countries.

     The second empirical regularity I should like to emphasize is the

absence of persistence in measures of the change in the aggregate real

wage rate. Especially for the U.S., the aggregate real wage is very

close to a random walk (with drift) and only weakly correlated with

nominal variables. The absence of persistence in the change in the real

wage is less well known, and perhaps more difficult to document, than is

the presence of persistence in the change in the unemployment rate.

    The third empirical regularity I should like to emphasize is the

consistent existence of a correlation between nominal price changes and

unemployment rates. The existence of this "Phillips Curve" relationship

is sometime1 doubted by the skeptics, although the high unemployment!

lower inflation experience of the last two years in the U.S.,   Canada,
and Europe must surely have caused even the doubters to think twice.

There is nevertheless plenty of room for skepticism about the nature and

even the existence of this relationship, so that the question of whether

a simple method exists for convincing the doubters may remain open.


A.   Persistence in the Change in Unemployment


     The first three columns of Table 1 contain the fit of second—order

autoregressions to annual data on the unemployment rate for the U.S.,

the United Kingdom and Canada for various time periods. The results in

these tables reveal three relatively straightforward "facts about time—

series movements in aggregate unemployment. First, the unemployment

rate in none of these countries can be well represented by a simple

first—order autoregressive process. Shocks to unemployment result in the

hump—shaped moving average representation reported in columns 1—3 of

Table 2 for long time—series of annual data or for quarterly or monthly

data. These shocks first result in an increase and then a slow decline

in future unemployment rates. Quarterly results that demonstrate this

pattern have been extensively reported elsewhere for the U.S. and the

U.K. in the post—war period.1 It is not a pattern that results

solely from movements in the labor force, because a similar pattern

appears in uarterly U.S. employment data2 and in monthly U.S. data

on manhours worked.3

     Second, the autoregressive (AR) structures for unemployment

sometimes bear a striking similarity across countries when fit for the

sane time period. Although far from identical, the AR(2) represen-

tations for the U.S., the U.K. and Canada are quite similar over the

period 1894—1983 in Table I. As a consequence, the moving—average

representations depicted in Table 2 are also similar.

     Third, the exact empirical form of the persistence in the change in

the unemployment rate does not appear to be temporally stable over

long periods. This may be seen by comparing the AR(2) representations

for the 1894—1945 period with the same representations for the 1946—83

period in tables 1 and 2. The moving average representations

have a typical htmped shape in the longer period, but the impact of

innovations to unemployment is more damped in the Post—War period.

provides a very good fit to either quarterly or annual data. With trend

removal, ho&ever, these autoregressions always imply damped, slowly

decaying moving average representations.4

     Columns 5—7 also report some very simple estimates of the effect of

lagged price changes on the real wage rate. In the post—War quarterly

data, at least, there is fairly strong evidence that rational forecasts

of real wage rate changes may be a negative function of current price

changes with an elasticity of —.3 to —.4. As we shall see, this is an

important result, because it provides one simple potential link between

a microeconomic model that emphasizes the role of real wage rates in the

detenination of labor supply and a macroeconomic model that admits a

role for nominal price changes in the determination of labor supply.


C. Price Changes and Unemployment


    Figures 1, 2, and 3 contain plots of the inflation/unemployment com-

binations for the years 1893—1945 for the U.S. and the U.K., and for the

years 1921—1945 for Canada. Also indicated on each of these figures is

the area within which the inflation/unemployment combinations for the

years 1954—81 that are contained in Figures 4,5 and 6 would have fallen.

Although it is natural to focus attention on the data for the later

years contained in Figures 4,5 and 6, it is important to put these in

context. First, it is clear that until recently, at least, the Post—War

range of U.S., Canadian, and U.K. unemployment experience has been

historicall! small. Second, it is obvious that the relationship between

inflation and unemployment appears very weak in the pre—War data.

Examining these data alone would have been very poor preparation for the

experience recorded in the 1950's and 1960's.

    Indeed, it is especially interesting to consider how the contem-

porary inflation/unemployment data in Figures 4,5 and 6 would have

looked to an observer in 1970. This is easy enough to do since all of

the inflation/unemployment combinations after this year are in the

upper right—hand half of the figures. It is extremely tempting to

portray this as a sequence of short—run Phillips Curves that is con-

tinuously shifting up and to the right in these figures. Precisely how

these short—run and long—run relationships can coexist is presumably one

of the key questions that any aggregate model of the labor market is

meant to address.

    Of course, in the face of the extraordinarily weak contemporaneous

correlations between inflation and unemployment that exist in both the

pre—War and post—War data, a skeptic might simply deny the existence of

any short run or long run relationship between these variables. One

simple set of facts that I have found useful in confronting the skep-

tics is contained in Figure 7. This figure contains the scatter diagram

of the difference between the Canadian and U.S. inflation rates against

the difference between the U.S. and Canadian unemployment rates. The

idea behind this comparison is a simple one, inspired, in part, by
                                        —7-.

Lucas's   (1973) argument that price expectations might usefully be

treated as     latent variable in the determination of the deviation of

unemployment from its natural rate.' With similar slopes in their

short run Phillips Curves and similar price expectations, apart from a

random error, these inflation/unemployment differences will lie along a

common short run Phillips Curve. The very loosely determined and negati-

vely sloped empirical relationship in Figure 7 suggests that there may

be something to this idea.

    Table 4 contains the regression estimates of the relationship

depicted in Figure 7, except that the coefficients on the inflation rate

variable are unconstrained. As the table indicates, these coefficients

are remarkably well determined and insignificantly different from each

other. A similar analysis in Table 4 is somewhat less convincing when

U.K. and U.S. employment rate differences are examined. The equality of

regression coefficients on the U.K. and U.S. inflation rates is only

striking when a quadratic trend is included in the regression equation.

      In my view It is importiant to find simple structural methods for

estimating the nature of the short run correlation between inflation and

unemployment so that this relationship can be sorted out from shifts in

the underlying determinants of structural (or "frictional" or "natural")

unemployment. So long as this is not possible, the simple correlation

between inflation and unemployment, whatever its sign, will       continue    to

be used by the general public as an Indication of causation. Just as

the negative correlation between these variables in the 1950's and

1960's was taken to imply that an increase in inflation might reduce

unemployment, the positive correlat ion that has      materialized with the
experience      of the 1970's is now taken to imply that a reduction in

inflation will reduce unemployment. I doubt whether either inference is

the appropriate one to draw from these data, but in the absence of a

simple and convincing demonstration to the contrary it is inevitable
that more will be inferred from these correlations than is appropriate
for   wise public policy decisions. The simple analyses      in Figure 7 and

Table 4 are no doubt little more than an example of how a more con-

vincing1 but simplified analysis might proceed.


1). Aggregate ltdels of Labor Supply


      As   John Taylor   (1983) observes in a recant survey, much of the last

decade of research in macroeconomics has been inspired by a desire to

produce explicit structural models that might rationalize the Phillips

Curve      observations in   Figure 4. The line of research started by Lucas
                                      —9—

and Rapping(l969) and Lucas (1973) puts together a model of intertem—

poral labor supply with an assumption of rational expectations to do

this job. Lucas and Rapping observe that demand shifts are the logical

candidates for the cause of business cycle fluctuations in employment.

Maintaining the assi.ption of continuous market clearing, however,

requires that the short run labor supply curve be upward sloping or

these demand shifts will result in real wage movements without

corresponding movements in employment. Although long run labor supply

is known to be generally insensitive to the real wage rate, or even

backward bending [see Xillingsworth (1983)), in a simple intertemporal

model the short run elasticity of labor supply with respect to the real

wage must be strictly positive.

      To complete the Phillips Curve rationalization a correlation between

short run movements in labor supply and changes in nominal prices must

still be established. Either of two routes may be taken. In the case set

out by Lucas (1973) workers may be incompletely informed about the

aggregate nominal wage, the aggregate price level, or both. In this

case workers may erroneously (but rationally) believe that their actual

unexpected nominal wage increases (or price decreases) are "good draws"

that will not be repeated. They will then want to capitalize on these

good draws to a greater or Lesser extent depending on the size of

their intertemporal labor supply elasticity.

     Alternatively,    it may be the case that nominal prices or wages are
a   useful   predictor of future real wage rates, for reasons otherwise
                                  —10—

unspecified1 As Table 3 indicates, there is clearly some evidence based

on the historical record that simple forecasts of future real wage rates

might sensibly depend negatively on the current inflation rate, although

the elasticity is small.6 It follows that workers may reasonably

asstte that their current real wage rates are high, relative to what

they may expect in the future, when inflation rates are high. Again,

workers may use this information to capitalize on the "good draws" that

higher current price inflation implies they may be getting if there is

intertemporal substitution of labor supply.7

    This intertemporal substitution model of the business cycle is

internally consistent, complete, and it is clearly amenable to econo-

metric testing. Most important of all, this macroeconomic model of the

labor market is entirely consistent in its logic with the microeconomic

models of labor supply behavior that have been the subject of con-

siderable theoretical and empirical development over the last decade.8

Indeed, research that establishes the empirical adequacy of the

microeconomic models might even be taken to establish at least partial

credibility for the macroeconomic model. So long as the microecononists

are satisfied with the empirical success of models that assume the con—




 6This is also the case in Canada. See Card (1983).

7Detailed examples of this argument are contained in Altonji and
 Ashenfelter (1980) and Ashenfelter and Card (1982).

8Cocipare, for example, Altonji's (l982a) study of aggregate labor
 supply with his 1984 microeconomic study of life—cycle labor supply.
                                      —11—

tinuous clering of spot labor markets it appears that only one question

remains: Are the microeconomic elasticities of labor supply big enough

to explain the macroeconomic fluctuations?

    As   I have observed, the aggregate fluctuations in employment and
unemployment are substantial.    On   the other hand, macroeconomic fluc-
tuations    in real wage surprises are apparently small. After   all, the
aggregate   real wage is close to a random walk with a very small error

variance. Alternatively, although price inflation rates are useful pre-

dictors of future real wage rates, this  elasticity is also small.
Apparently,   intertemporal labor supply elasticities must be "large" if
the macroeconomic model is to have any explanatory power.9

E. Empirical Tests of the Aggregate 1&,del

    With   refreshing candor, even the earliest empirical tests of the

intertemporal substitution explanation for aggregate fluctuations in

employment,   unemployment and inflation were not   oversold. In an infre-

quently cited paper, Lucas and Rapping (1969, p. 349) describe their

intertemporal substitution explanations for the Phillips Curve data by




 9This ignores any role for real interest rates, but most of the
  post—War evidence suggests near constancy for real rates until the
  early 1970ts. See Ashenfelter and Card (1982). Of course, this
  leaves open the role of real interest rates in explanations of
  employment and unemployment fluctuations since the early 1970's.
                                    —12—


saying,    "Asreported econometric models go, ours can scarcely be called

successful, but we think its failures are suggestive along several

lines." They proceed to suggest that their findings are both empiri-

cally and theoretically consistent with a short run, but the absence of

a long run, inflation/unemployment tradeoff. Their main conclusion,

however, Is that the estimated empirical relationships are highly

unstable over time, and that a proper accounting of expectations may

increase   their explanatory power.10

    This early empirical work by Lucas and Rapping predated the intro-

duction of empirical methods for implementing the rational expectations

hypothesis about expectation formation, and for a while their original

empirical challenge was largely ignored. in an extremely thorough

recent study, Altonji (1982) takes up the challenge and continues the

careful empirical testing of the intertemporal substitution model in the

rational expectations framework. Altonji's (1982, p. 784) main conclu-

sion is that the empirical results for a long time—series of annual data

in the U.S. do not support the intertemporal substitution model as a

structural explanation for aggregate fluctuations in employment because,

"For most specifications, the current real wage, the expected future

real wage, and the expected real rate of interest are either insignifi-

cantly related to unemployment and labour supply or have the wrong

sign." Although differing in detail, broadly similar conclusions on the

empirical weakness of the intertemporal substitution model as an expla—



t0For the period 1946—65, for example, there is not a single regression
  coefficient on a wage or price variable that is much larger than its
  standard error in any regression that Lucas and Rapping report.

nation of te aggregate data were reached early on by Sargent (1973),

and subsequently by Altonji and Ashenfelter (1980), Andrews and Nickell

(1982), Ashenfelter and Card (1982), and Kennan (1983). In all of these

studies, a major difficulty is the identification from the data of an

intertemporal labor supply elasticity that is (positive and) large

enough to reconcile the dramatically greater fluctuations in employment

than in wage rates that are observed.

    There are, of course, many acknowledged difficulties in extracting

labor supply elasticities from aggregate time—series data. These

include problems of aggregation, simultaneity in the determination of

employment and wage rates, structural shifts in monetary policy rules

and in government employment policies, and the like. No doubt partly to

overco these difficulties, it is natural to turn to microeconomic stu-

dies of labor supply to see whether they have met with greater empirical

success and have resulted in more precise estimates of key parameters.

If some important parameters can be determined from the microeconomic

studies, these may naturally be included as the building blocks in more

persuasive aggregate models of employment fluctuations)1 The

question then remains as to how well these microeconomic models of




11See Kydland and Prescott (1982) for an example of the application of
  such methods. In many ways this is also the spirit of Kennan's (1983)
  continuing work, although his approach is to "estimate" supply and
  demand parameters from the aggregate data and then inspect them for
  their reasonableness.

          II. Hicroeconomic Evidence of Intertemporal Substitution
                              in Labor Supply


    The empirical setting for microeconomic analyses of intertemporal

movements in labor supply must clearly be the life cycle. In fact,

setting out the simple theoretical models available serves two purposes.

First, it shows the clear connection between the life—cycle labor supply

model and the permanent income theory of consumption. Indeed, the

latter is simply the conswnption plan derived from the former, and per—

nanent income is nothing more than the appropriately discounted present

value of future wage rates. Second, to be tractable, the empirical ana-

lyses are going to require some form of linearity and some simple method

for stunmarizing a consumer—worker's future prospects. Intertemporally

additive utility and special functional forms are necessary to provide

the Justification for these simplifications.

    Intertemporal movements in labor earnings in (2) are solely a result of

life cycle or time—series movements in              •   These movements are

governed entirely by the parameter             .   To see this, note that A1

is a constant in (2) so that changes in labor earnings are

Indeed, the proportional change in earnings is


             Ls(wh)/wh —           (Tb! ht)[wI wJ
In this model the so—called intertemporal elasticity of labor supply is

therefore ('rh/he) — 1   •   Since     Tb ) ht is required for convexity of

the worker's indifference curves, this implies that the intertemporal

elasticity of labor supply must be non—negative. This result does not

constrain the income effects in this model at all. It is in this sense

that the intertemporal additivity of the model does not constrain the

data to produce "small? interteinporal elasticities of labor supply.13
            F
    Ham and I have fit this model to data from the Panel Survey of Income

Dynamics (PSID), but before reporting those results let me turn to some

data that provide a very simple method for estimating          .        This scheme
is based on the observation that           in (4) is essentially a regression

without a constant term. One consistent estimator for                  is therefore

the ratio of the mean of A(wh) to the mean of aw .            The advantage

of this estimator is that it remains consistent even when zero—mean

measurement errors are appended to          and wth in equation (2).14

    To get a feeling for the estimates obtained in this way consider the

mean changes in real earnings and real wage rates reported from the PSID

in Table 5. The third coli.unn reports the estimates of            ,   while   the

fourth column reports the average of mean hours worked in the two years

considered. There are two disturbing features about these estimates of




Indeed, the effect of a lifetime change of Awt on labor earnings is

  be smaller tian the intertemporal labor supply elasticity,

  lenght of the time horizon; it may, of course, be zero.

141n fact, this is precisely Wald's (1940) method for "fitting a
  straight line if both variables are subject to error." Consistency of
  this estimator demands primarily that the probability limit of the
  denominator in this ratio be non—zero.

         First1     they are very unstable. Second, in three of the years con-

sidered they are lower than the actual mean of hours worked. Discarding

as extreme outliers the results for 1969—70 and 1973—74 leads to an

average ratio of the ratios Ih/ht          1.04 ,   which implies an intertem—

poral labor supply elasticity of .04. Obviously, with these data vir-

tually any estimate of Th may be obtained depending on what the

empirical analyst wants to see.

      There are clearly difficulties in using this simple estimator to

calibrate the size and stability of the intertemporal labor supply

elasticity. Perhaps most disturbing are the possibility that aggregate

supply shocks or their determinants will obscure movements along the

supply schedule (4). ?tre generally, anything that might successfully

and correctly be removed from the panel data by the addition of year

dtmmy variables will produce a specification bias in these results. It

is important to emphasize, however, that the consistency of many of the

estimates of the intertemporal labor supply elasticity that I report

below are dependent on the sane assumptions necessary to ensure the con-

sistency of the estimates of            in Table 5 and typically on further

a s 5 tmipt ions.


     Ham and I have also fitted equation (4) to the P510 micro data

directly. These results are even more disappointing. We obtained very

precise estimates of            based on the pooled covariances in the data of

around 1,900 hours.- This result also implies a negative intertemporal

elasticity of labor supply.

     A diffeent model that leads to a log linear labor supply function

has been suggested by Heckman and Macurdy (1980) and MaCurdy (1981). As

Abowd and Card (1983) observe, with a constant real interest rate and

negligible initial assets this model leads to precisely the log linear

labor supply function initially proposed by Lucas and Rapping (1970).

by Abowd and Card (1983).

    The estimates of n      in   Table 6 are qualitatively consistent

with the results in Table 5 except for the year 1970—71. In general,

however, the data in Table 6 are far more congenial to an estimate of

the intertemporal labor supply elasticity that is positive and large in

magnitude.    Only two of the ten estimates of n       are   negative, and the

simple average of all the estimates is 1.14. Ileting the two extreme

outliers leads to an estimate of the intertemporal labor supply elasti-

city of .89. (This is equivalent to deleting the two estimates with the

denominators closest to zero in absolute value.) As before, however,

these estimates are very unstable and this instability casts serious

doubt on the credibility of this model.

    There are several ways to use the covariances in the data to esti-

mate ii   .   The simplest method is simply to compute the regression

coefficient of A ln h on A ln w •          Abowd and Card (1983) report all

of the necessary data to do this from the P510 and from the National

Longitudinal Survey of Older Men (NLS). Although it does not appear to

be widely reported in the literature, this regression coefficient is

always negative and significantly different from zero at quite small

probability levels. In the PSID it is —.36 and in the NTJS it is —.28

    I do not want to suggest that it is impossible to use the covarian—

ces in the data to find a regression coefficient with the sign implied

by equation (5). For example, MaCurdy (1981) observes that adding

nA ln ht to both sides of (6) produces the relationship

    (7)          In Ii      (nil + ri)i   in   wtht
This suggests computing the regression coefficient of the change in the

log of hours on the change in the log of earnings. In the P5W and WLS

data these regression coefficients imply estimates of n   of around .78
and .61 ,   respectively.
    It does seen clear, however, that simple applications of either the

linear earnings equation (4) or the log linear hours equation (6) will

require some subtle manipulation of the data before they will produce

credible estimates of the intertenporal labor supply elasticity. As a

result, these estimates are likely to be sensitive to the model spe-

cified, although preliminary indications are that they are not likely to

be larger than .7 or .8.


3. ?tdels of Life—Cycle Labor Supply with Measurement Error


    The presence of measurement error has been suggested as one impor-

tant reason for modifying equations (4) and (6). One suggestion is to




   first became aware of this fact" after seeing Altonji's (1984) two
 estimates of this regression coefficient. Using two different measures
 of the wage rate from the PSID, Altonji reports estimates of the
 regression of A ln h    on A in ht of —.40 and zero. The former is
 essentially based on Fhe same data as reported by Abowd and Card (1983).
                                  —22—

recognize thi presence of measurement error in both A in w and

A in ht at the micro level. As I have observed, the simple ratio of

means estimates in Tables 5 and 6 need not suffer from bias induced by

measurement error. kt the other hand, the usefulness of this simple

procedure depends critically on the assumption that unmeasured economy

wide shocks to real. interest rates or other aggregate variables can be

safely ignored.   Using the covariances in the panel data with time means

subtracted out does not run this risk.

    MaCurdy (1981) circumvents these issues by estimating equation (5)

by an instrumental variables scheme. With time means subtracted out of

the data his estimates of the regression coefficient of A in h on

A in w are .10 and .15 with standard errors of about the same magni-

tude.   His estimates of the regression coefficient of A ln ht on

A in wh Imply estimates of r of .45 and .30 with standard errors of

about two—thirds these magnitudes. These are not large elasticities and

the imprecision of their estimation is disturbing.   The imprecision no

doubt results from the inevitably poor quality of what are essentially

time—invariant instrumental variables. 16

    In an extremely thorough empirical study Altonji (l982b) reports

several efforts to account for measurement error in an attempt to

estimate (6). Be reports three alternative sets of results from the

PSID data. The first set uses an instrumental variables scheme designed

to reproduce MaCurdy's results. The estimated intertemporal labor



161t is well known that wage rates in a cross—section are roughly a
  siilogarithmic function of schooling, experience, and experience
  squared. The first—difference in the log wage is therefore approxima-
  tely a linear function of experience, the main instrument available.
                                  —23—

supply elasjicity falls in the range .08 to .50 depending on whether

time means are subtracted out of the data and whether age is included in

the labor supply equation. Estimated sampling errors fall in the range

.12 to .4, however1 so that elasticities are still imprecisely esti-

mated. A second procedure uses an alternative (but contemporaneously

measured) wage variable as an instrument for the wage in a classical

instrumental variables set up for handling measurement error, With this

procedure the estimates of the intertemporal substitution elasticity are

around .04 to .07, depending on specification. Estimated sampling

errors are very small also, at around .07, so that substitution elasti-

cities larger than .25 may be ruled out. In a third procedure Altonji

recognizes that a contemporaneously measured alternative wage variable

may be contaminated by common measurement errors or, in a txdel with

uncertainty, correlated with labor supply function errors. Using a

lagged alternative wage variable Altonji estimates intertemporal labor

supply elasticities around .05, but estimated sampling errors are now

around .45. All of these estimates rule out substitution elasticities

greater than unity. Altonji concludes that these estimates suggest an

intertemporal labor supply elasticity in the range 0 to .35, although I

prefer to state all these results and their limitations so that they

speak for themselves.

   kltonji (1984) also presents estimates of 1   based on a procedure

that exploits the marginal condition for the consumption plan associated

with equation (5). The basic idea is that the marginal condition for
                                    —24—

optimal contnption requires that      i/ct a Apt   ,    so that equation (5)

can also be written as


     (5a)
              lnhaA+n lnw—n lnpc
Differencing this equation and using data on food consiunption in the

PSID, and an instrumental variables procedure, Altonji estimates n in

the range of .04 to .30 under various specifications. These estimates

have somewhat smaller sampling errors than those reported previously,

so that large estimates of the intertemporal labor supply elasticity may

be ruled out if these estimates are accepted.

     Abowd and Card (1983) have presented some persuasive evidence that

much of the variation in both hours and earnings in the available longi-

tudinal data may be a result of measurement error. To see the nature of

this evidence consider any measured variable zt whose true value is
       Suppose that measurement error e1 is serially uncorrelated, that

et
      is uncorrelated with z , and that sz         is       serially uncorrelated.

Then cov(azt1 Az1,) — —a         and var(Azt) = 2a2          so that the first—order

autocorrelation coefficient of         is cov(iz, sz1)/var(Az) =                l/2
and the serial correlation coefficients at all higher order lags are

zero. In effect, these assumptions imply that z'               is   a first order

     Abowd and Card present data that imply first—order autocorrelation

                                          —25—

Neither the #second nor third order autocorrelation coefficients in

their data are as large (in absolute value) as —.04. Although this is

hardly conclusive, it suggests the possibility that a substantial frac-

tion of the panel data movement in hours and earnings may         be   composed

of measurement error. Indeed, Abowd and Card take the null hypothesis

against which they test equation (6) to be a simple model of measure-

ment error much like equation (8). Although they reject this model as

a complete explanation for the data, a major message in their paper is

the importance of dealing with this problem.

     Altonji (1984) provides further evidence of measurement error in

the main wage series used in a typical panel data study of labor

supply. The change in the conventional wage measure in these studies is

      the change in the ratio of labor earnings to annual hours at work.

For hourly workers in the PSID the change in the hourly wage rate,

       is    also recorded. Assuming      that both        and Aw* are addi-

tive combinations of the change in the error free wage, Aws and

independent   measurement errors, et           and et*, then

                      t

                          r         +


It follows that cov(Aw             **)/var(4tft) and co-v(tw lxw**)/var(Aw**)

give measures of the fractional components of the two wage change

measures that are not mesurement error. In Altonji's P510 data

coy (awt ,          = .0049                      .0498, and var(twt*) = .0177
                               ,
                                    var(Awt)
This implies that 90 percent of the variance in w* and 72 percent
                                      —26—



of the yankee in t* is measurement error. reover, since
var (Awt*) > var (w), it follows that l_var(Awt*)/var(Aw) is a

lower bound on the percentage of the variance in           due to measure-

ment error of around 60 percent. I do not mean to suggest that the

wage change data contain only mesurement error.       Still, it seems clear

that the longitudinal data series available for identification of an

intertemporal labor supply elasticity are very noisy.


C.   Experimental Evidence on Labor Supply

     By now there exist    several   experimental studies of labor supply, at
least one of which is designed to address the importance of the Hf e—
cycle   model as an   explanation for hours changes. These   studies are

experimental in the sense that families are randomly assigned to a nega-

tive income tax treatment or a control group. The Seattle—Denver

program is by far the largest, and it was designed explicitly to

address the effect of negative income tax programs of different lengths

on labor supply. It is precisely the possibility that a transitory

negative income tax program might have different effects on labor supply

from a permanent program that is at the heart of the life—cycle model.

Prom the standpoint of judging the transfer costs of a negative income

tax program, of course, this issue is mainly of concern in determining

the extent to which a short tent experiment simulates the impact of a

long term program, and this was the public policy issue being addressed.

        Some very straightforward estimates of treatment effects from this
                                     —27—

experiment are contained in Table 7. These are computed from co-

efficients on dummy variables that describe the particular treatments

indicated and that contain only pre—experimental measures of other

variables in the regressions. All of these estimates indicate a decline

in hours at work among the treatment groups relative to the control

groups, and many of these declines are statistically significant.

      Since these are short duration programs, to the extent that the

life—cycle is the basis for decision—making the tax effects should be

exaggerated compared with what would be observed as the result of a per-

manent wage change. For example, in the Stone—Geary model the labor

supply elasticity with respect to a permanent wage change (ignoring

discounting) is (1h/h)(l_3ln)_l where n is the length of the hf e—

cycle.   This long run   labor supply elasticity is strictly smaller than

the   intertemporal   labor supply elasticity, Yh/ht_l.

      The   data in Table 7 are not easily explained by the life—cycle
model, however. First, the five year program appears to have a con-
siderably greater effect on labor supply than does the 3 year program.

This suggests that income effects must be an important component of the

labor supply response. On the other hand, labor supply effects after

completion of both programs are essentially negligible, which suggests

that these income effects have not been distributed smoothly over the

life—cycle in accord with the predictions of the model.

      Another disturbing feature of the results in panel B of Table 7 con-

cerns the apparent tax effects in the data. This panel shows three two

way contrass (at different guarantee levels1 which is the income

received at zero work hours) of 70 versus 50 percent tax rate programs.

In every case the decline in work effort is smaller under the higher

tax rate program. This also suggests that income effects are playing a

far more important role in these data than would be consistent with a

major role for interteaporal substitution.

     Surprisingly, research to date has only scratched the surface of

what is possible with the experimental data available. A careful analy-

sis of these data for the purpose of exploring and testing the detailed

predictions of the life—cycle model of labor supply is long overdue.


                            III. Conclusion

     In my view the microeconomic empirical work based on the

life—cycle model of labor supply represents one of the finest amalgams

of careful data analysis and applied theoretical work that exists in

modern economics. It seems clear, however, that these analyses of

intertemporal labor supply have not yet produced a coherent empirical

explanation of the aggregate movements in hours of work in the available

panel data. A simple way to see this is to first examine the time—

series movements in the average hours at work in column 2 of Table 6

(for the PSID). The basic idea of the intertecuporal labor supply model

is to explain these changes as movements along a fixed supply curve.

There are three problems in doing this. First, average hours and the

average real wage must move in the same direction, which, as the table

indicates, occurs most, but riot all of the time. Second, as column 4
                                  —29—

indicates, he slope of the labor supply function must fluctuate con-

siderably from year to year in order to square up the aggregate hours

and wage rate changes. Finally, the average labor supply elasticity

must apparently be quite large to square up these hours and wage rate

movements, while the available estimates of its slope that I have sur-

veyed are, in fact, very small. The basic empirical problem seems to be

that within the life—cycle, the person—specific correlation between

hours and wages is simply too small to explain the time—series movements

in average hours relative to the time—series movements in average wage

rates. The intertemporal substitution hypothesis originally advanced by

Lucas and Rapping was, of course, precisely the suspicion that this was

not the case.

     It remains to consider what light these findings shed on the more

familiar data that register movements in the business cycle and to which

nacroeconoinists are accustomed. Apparently the connection is not very

straightforward, as the last tw columns of Table 6 indicate. The fifth

column of this table contains the annual first difference of the male

unemployment proportion for workers aged 35—44. This is an often used

cyclical indicator and it moves in tune with the unemployment rates for

most other groups. A comparison of the PSID hours changes in column 2

of the table with these unemployment changes (they are in a similar

scale). indicates that these series are by no means identical. To be

sure, both series indicate similar magnitudes for the 1974—75 recession,

but they move very differently in the three preceding years and in the
                                     —30—

last year o the sample. The last column of Table 6 shows that acorn—

parison of the P519 average hours data with an index of aggregate

manhours from the BLS payroll data fares no better. These latter data

are no doubt heavily influenced by demographic and other trends, but it

is by no means clear that any simple detrending will reconcile them with

the PSID data. It appears that a careful reconciliation of the basic

microeconornic and macroeconomic data is going to be necessary before

further conclusions are warranted. Such a research project deserves

high priority for future research.

    In tracing through the status of the empirical research on

microeconomic models of life—cycle (or intertemporal) labor supply, it

is difficult to come away with the impression that these simple imple—

mentable models are providing good descriptions of the available longi-

tudinal data)7 In this regard it seems that the macroeconomic and

microeconomic models of labor supply share much in common. Of course,

it is always possible to attribute the empirical difficulties of both

types of models to measurement error or flaws in functional forms.

It is even possible that the measurement error in the microeconomic

data is so severe that there is little or nothing to be gained from any

analysis of it. Likewise, it may he that the restriction to linear

functional forms is too restrictive, although it is hard to imagine




17Others have come (independently, I should add) to similar conclusions.
  Pencavel (1984, p. 147) writes, after a survey of the intertemporal
  labor supply research: '...the greater part of the variations in male
  labor supply across workers and over time is left unexplained by this
  research. A great deal of effort has been brought to bear on what
  appear to be relationships of second—order of importance."
                                 —31—

that the ki?d of data currently available could credibly support

anything more elaborate.

    It Is important to emphasize that the empirical difficulties in

estimating intertemporal labor supply elasticities are not a problem

primarily at the macroeconomic level. If there is something missing

from these models of labor supply it is apparently missing both from

the inicroeconomic and the macroeconomic models. What night it be?

    In my view it must surely be the case that the long run behavior of

average hours at work are mainly a result of worker preferences as

between the consumption of goods and leisure. At the same time, it

seems reasonable to suppose that demand induced movements in hours

worked, at predetermined wage rates, may likewise have a role to play in

the short run interplay of hours and earnings determination.'8 It

should be emphasized that the existence of such demand related hours

shocks has no particular normative implication for any public policies.

Moreover, demand shocks as an explanation for employment fluctuations

date at least to Adam Smith, who wrote:


          the wages of labour in different occupations vary with the

    constancy or inconstancy of employment. Employment is much more

    constant in some trades than in others. In the greater part of

    manufactures, a journeyman may be pretty sure of employment




18The empirical implications of the supply side of such a model have
  been worked out in Abowd and Ashenfelter (1979, 1981), but the empiri-
  cal models estimated in those papers are not notably successful.

    almost every day in the year that he is able to work. A mason

   or bricklayer, on the. contrary, can work neither in hard frost

   nor in foul weather, and his employment at all other times depends

    on the occasional calls of his customers. Be is liable, in con-

    sequence, to be without any. %Qhat he earns, therefore, while he is

   employed, must not only maintain hint while he is idle, but make

   him some compensation for those anxious and desponding moments

   which the thought of so precarious a situation must sometimes

    occasion.


It seems clear that Smith did not expect the wage rates of masons to

fluctuate with hard frost or the occasional calls of their customers,

and that he did not expect to explain employment fluctuations as a

response to such wage rate fluctuations. Constructing a testable model

that might reconcile the long run determination of hours worked by

worker preferences with the short run interaction of observed

employment and earnings may be the missing ingredient in both the

macroeconomic and microeconomic models of labor supply.
