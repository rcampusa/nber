       The evidence presented in this paper leads to three conclusions about

possible effects on the U.S. long-term capital raising mechanism due to the

sharp increase in interest rate volatility that has followed the Federal

Reserve System's adoption of new monetary policy procedures in 1979. First,

the increased volatility has probably led nonfinancial corporations to finance

less of their external funds requirements at long term than they would other-

wise have done. Second, the increased volatility has probably led underwriters

of high grade corporate bonds to increase the spread of a typical new issue's

yield over the prevailing market yield on comparable bonds already outstanding.

Third, there is little firm basis (reported here, anyway) to conclude that

the increased volatility in particular has affected investors' portfolio

behavior in the bond market.

           FEDERAL RESERVE POLICY, INTEREST RATE VOLATILITY, AND THE

                          U.S. CAPITAL RAISING MECEANISM

         The object of this paper is to examine in detail, on the basis of

the experience of the U.S. financial markets under the Federal Reserve

Systems new monetary policy procedures announced on October 6, 1979, one

potentially important effect on the nonfinancial economy due to the resulting

increase in interest rate volatility -—        in   particular, the possibility

that increased volatility has impaired the market mechanism for raising

long—term business capital.

         Interest rate volatility has been a controversial issue in central

bank policy making for a long time. The ultimate objectives that central

banks pursue almost always refer to nonfinancial aspects of economic activity

and   well-being,   like price stability and   economic growth. In carrying out
policies designed to further these ebject±ves, however, central banks typically

operate exclusively in the financial markets. Their actions therefore affect

interest rates directly and visibly. Whether to use this influence on

interest rates to smooth out short—run fluctuations, or alternatively to

implement actions focused solely on other objectives, and hence leave

interest rates to vary freely with the pulse of market pressures, is the

central question.

         In the United States the evolution of the Federal Reserve System's

monetary policy procedures during the last decade, including in particular

the changes announced in October 1979, in effect reversed the attitude
                                         —2—




toward interest rate volatility that had marked the first half-century of

American central banking. When the Congress first established the Federal

Reserve System in 1913, acting in response to a history of financial market

disorders that had periodically depressed business activity, it charged the

new central bank "to provide an elastic currency" to accommodate the economy's

financing needs. That prescription led the Federal Reserve, through most

of its existence, to pursue a policy aimed at stabilizing interest rate

movements. By 1970, however, the drawbacks of focusing monetary policy on

nominal interest rates in an era of rapid and    volatile   price inflation had

become apparent, and   the   Federal Reserve shifted to a policy framewOrk

based   on targeted growth rates for selected monetary aggregates. The imple-

mentation of the monetary targets strategy during the l970s led to some

increase in short-run interest rate volatility. Still, volatility remained

limited, in large part because the Federal Reserve used a short—term

interest rate (the federal funds rate) as the instrument by which it sought

to control the monetary aggregates.

                 6, 1979, the Federal Reserve publicly reaffirmed its
         On October

commitment to the monetary targets framework and also announced a new set
of   operating procedures that, in effect, amounted to using the quantity of

nonborrowed bank reserves as the instrument for controlling the monetary

aggregates. As almost any theory of monetary policy would have predicted,

the short—run volatility of short—term     interest rates increased immediately
and sharply. In addition, the short-run volatility of long-term interest
rates increased as well. The amplitude of interest rate swings during the

one—and—a—half business cycles that have occurred since October 1979 has

been unprecedented in U.S. financial experience. Moreover, the volatility

of interest rates over shorter time horizons —month—to—month, day—to—day,
                                       —3—




and even within the trading day —has also increased dramatically.

        From a public policy perspective, however, the question is:   so what?

Why does interest rate volatility matter? Are whatever effects it may have

quantitatively important? Does increased interest rate volatility constitute a

significant drawback, possibly even one that may warrant discarding an other-

wise useful way of conducting monetary policy?

       To date economists and other commentators on monetary policy procedures

have provided little serious analysis of the effects of interest rate volatility.

Quantitative studies of the subject before October 1979 typically just tried

to estimate how much interest rate volatility would follow from adopting

one monetary policy framework or another, without going on to say anything

about what would happen as a result of that volatility. Today, after more

than two years of experience under the Federal Reserve's new procedures,

the amount of volatility is readily observable but the question of its

consequences still remains largely unexplored in any systematic way.'

Moreover, even the informal discussions of the increased interest rate volatil-

ity since October 1979 have usually focused on its consequences strictly

within the financial markets. In the final analysis, however, purely financial

effects without any nonfinancial counterpart hardly constitute grounds for

choosing one monetary policy framework over another.

       On occasions when discussions of interest rate volatility have addressed

the crucial question of effects on the nonfinancial economy, perhaps the

most familiar idea to be raised is the possibility that increased volatility

may impair the market mechanism for raising long—term capital for business

fixed investment. If true, that would be a very important effect indeed.

The U.S. economy's capital markets are unique in their ability to provide
borrowers with long—term funds. The nonfinancial corporate business sector

in particular relies heavily on external funds to finance its investment in

new plant and equipment, and historically the great bulk of such external

funds have come from borrowing at long term. Especially now that increased

physical capital formation to spur the U.S. economy's productivity and

international competitiveness has become a widely accepted goal of public

policy, any significant erosion of the market system's ability to provide

the requisite financial capital would present cause for serious concern.

Although impairment of the capital raising mechanism is by no means the only

possible effect of increased interest rate volatility, it is surely among

the most important.

         Exploring the effects of increased interest rate volatility on the

long-term capital raising mechanism is the primary objective of this paper.

Hence this analysis too deals with effects strictly within the financial

markets.2 what would ultimately matter for the determination of policy in

this context, of course, is the further implication of any change in the

capital raising mechanism on fixed capital formation. In principle it

would be possible to undertake a direct analysis of the effects of increased

volatility on actual physical investment and other aspects of nonfinancial

economic activity. Nevertheless, the accumulated experience since October

1979 is still too brief in comparison to the time lags involved, and too

many   relevant factors have undergone substantial change during these few
years, to warrant confidence in an   analysis   relating the post—1979 movement
in   fixed investment behavior to the increase in interest rate volatility.

Instead, the compromise sought here is to focus on the long—term capital

raising mechanism, thereby coming as close as possible to physical capital

formation decisions while still limiting the analysis to phenomena observed

within the financial markets.

         Section I seeks to determine whether U.S. nonfinancial business

corporations have raised less of their external funds in the form of long—term

debt as a result of the increased interest rate volatility since October

1979. Because business conditions have hardly been "normal" during 1980 and

1981, simply comparing the bond share of total financing in these years with

the average bond share in prior years is of little value. The operational

question, instead, is whether a well developed model of corporations' bond

financing that explains the data satisfactorily before October 1979 fails to

do so thereafter. The specific model used here to address this question

relates corporations' long—term borrowing, for a given external deficit to

be financed, to a combination of portfolio substitution and expectation

effects based on the prevailing pattern of interest rates on alternative

financing strategies.

         Section   II takes as given the amount of long-term corporate borrowing
done since October 1979 and seeks to determine whether the financial markets
have   made corporations pay more for the underwriting and initial distribution

of this debt. The most obvious measure of new issue costs for publicly

offered debt, the spread between the yields at which investment banking

syndicates buy new securities from issuers and sell them to investors, has

remained essentially fixed for many years on issues priced by negotiation and

usually varies for largely independent reasons on issues priced by competitive

bidding. Another important element of new issue costs, however, is the

spread between the yield at which investors initially buy new securities and

the currently prevailing yield on comparable securities already outstanding.

This element   of the interest rate on new issues is also a genuine cost of
borrowing to the corporation, and at times it is a larger cost than    that

due   to the underwriting spread. Using data on five different categories of
                                    —6—




long—term corporate bond issues, the analysis here compares the average

values of this spread before and after the 1979 increase in interest rate

volatility.

       Section III again takes as given the amount of long-term corporate

borrowing and seeks to determine whether the pattern of distribution of this

debt has changed since October 1979. One consequence of the increased

interest rate volatility frequently alleged by market participants is that

the U.S. long—term bond market has become a vehicle more for "speculation"

than for "investment." Although several possible operational renderings of

that proposition lie beyond the scope of this paper, it is straightforward

to determine whether specific classes of investors —-   for   example, life

insurance companies, or private pension funds, or individuals -— have played

a greater or lesser role in long-term lending than in prior years. To the

extent that these classes of investors typically exhibit portfolio behavior

which is more homogeneous within classes than across classes, such shifts

in the distribution of bond holdings also signify changes in the behavior

of the overall market.

       Section IV briefly summarizes the paper's empirical findings and

re—emphasizes some important caveats.

I. Efft of Volatility on the Volume of Long—Term Corporate Financing

       In considering ways in which the recent increase in interest rate

volatility may have effected the U.S. financial markets, and the implications

that any such effects may have for choosing a monetary policy framework, it

is best to start from the fundamentals. Despite the life of their own that

financial markets seem to lead, the basic role of the financial markets. in

any economy is to facilitate nonfinancial economic activity. In an advanced

economy like that of the United States, one of the most important specific

ways in which the financial markets serve this function is by coordinating

the independent actions of real savers and real investors that together

determine the economy's physical capital formation.

       One of the most widely recognized priorities in American economic

policy today is the need to increase the nation's capital formation. Although

economists and others continue to debate the reasons underlying the slowdown

in U.S. productivity growth during the 1970s, there is broad agreement that

additional investment in plant and equipment would contribute to a recovery

of productivity growth -- and hence growth of the nation's standard of

living --   in   the future. Meanwhile, however, the capital formation rate

has been not rising but falling. After a sharp increase in the l960s attri-

butable to specific investment incentives legislated early in the decade,

investment in business plant and equipment (net of replacement for depreciation

and obsolescence) declined from 4.0% of the gross national product on

average during 1966-70 to 2.8% on average during 1976-80. Reversing this

decline has become a major priority of public policy.

       Financial markets are relevant to this objective because every physical

investment decision has its financial counterpart. More to the point, the

financial transactions associated with physical capital formation are not
                                       —8—




merely a reflection of real resource allocations that would necessarily come

about in any case. The setting in which the financing of capital formation

takes place can also importantly affect the allocation of real resources,

including the total amount of capital formation as well as its composition.

If increased interest rate volatility were to impair the market mechanism

for financing capital formation, in the end it would restrict the economy's

ability to undertake capital formation too.

       Because corporations in nonfinancial lines of business regularly

account for nearly three—quarters of all plant and equipment investment in

the United States, it makes sense to focus the analysis on the economy's

nonfinancial corporate sector. U.S. nonfinancial corporations typically

rely heavily on external funds from the markets to finance their capital

expenditures. External funds constituted 45.5% of total sources of funds for

these firms, on average during the decade ending in 1980. Given U.S. corpor-

ations' traditional reluctance to raise equity capital except by retaining

earnings, most of the external funds raised are usually in debt form (92.2%

during 1971—80). Moreover, given the risk-averse preference for using

obligations of longer maturity to finance investment in long-lived facilities,

most of this debt has taken the form of bonds, mortgages, or other long-term

instruments. Despite the much discussed increase in reliance on short—term

debt in the l970s, net new issues of long—term obligations accounted for an

average 72.4% of all credit market borrowing by U.S. nonfinancial corporations

during 1971-80, and long-term obligations constituted 72.2% of these

corporations'   total debt outstanding as of yearend 1980.
          Has this pattern changed significantly since the Federal Reserve System
implemented its new policy procedures? A simple inspection of financing data
reveals   that business reliance on short—term debt has indeed been high since
                                              —9—




October   1979. Concluding that something fundamental                    has changed is a more
subtle   matter, however. To begin, only two               years   of experience does not

constitute much of a laboratory for judging changes in economic behavior.

Further, the pattern of the business cycle and of interest rate movements

(wholly apart from short-run volatility) has been extraordinary during these

years. Any judgment that a change in corporate financing behavior has

occurred, which may have resulted from increased interest rate volatility,

must therefore rely on a model that takes account of as many key factors as

possible other than the increased volatility.

         The model of nonfinancial corporations' long—term borrowing developed

in Friedman [71     cOmbines the familiar linear homogeneous                   model of portfolio

allocation, applied to the selection of desired liabilities to finance

externally a given cumulated deficit,

               —=

where   L is the corporation's desired amount of the i-th liability outstanding

its flow change; r is the expected "borrowing period" yield on the k-th
liability; L. is the corporation's actual amount of, and AL. the change in,
the i—th liability outstanding ( L. = D, AL. = AD); subscript t indicates
each   particular time period; and the ik'                  and Oik      are   fixed coefficients

         The primary rationale motivating the use of the linear homogeneous

portfolio selection model is, as usual, its convenience and tractability.

In a single—period context, the assumption of constant relative risk aversion

and joint normally distributed yield assessments is sufficient to render

the linear homogeneous model optimal.3 Some adjustment model is then

necessary in a multi—period context in the presence of transactions costs.

The principal advantage of the optimal marginal adjustment model for this pur-

pose is that it represents, in a tractable way, the increased yield sensitivity

of the allocation of the flow AD in comparison with the re-allocation of the

stock Dt1. This distinction is especially relevant when, as is the case in

the United States, most long—term corporate liabilities are non-callable for

at least some substantial time (typically five years for utility companies

and ten years for other corporate borrowers) after the date of issue.4

        Because of the non—callability of corporate bonds, the corporation's

choice between long— and short-term financing at any time is more complex than

a simple comparison of the prevailing yields on long- and short-term debt

instruments. A decision not to finance at long—term leaves open the possi-

bility of continually rolling over short-term debt, as well as the possibility

of relying on short-term debt only temporarily and issuing long-term debt

later on. At the least, therefore, the financing decision depends on the

currently prevailing long-term yield, the expected average long-term yield

in the future, and the expected average short-term yield currently and in

the   future.5   Hence rewriting (1) for the specific case of long—term bonds

gives (at a minimum)

             =
                 BlrB   + BtBt + B3t + B

where B* is the corporation's desired amount of bonds outstanding, rB is the
                                                 —11—




currently prevailing yield on new issues of the corporation's bonds, r is

the corporation's expectation of the average future value of rB and                        is

the corporation's expectation of the average current and future yield on its

short—term securities.

         Combining (3) with the relevant component of (2) then gives, as a

specific expression for the corporation's net new issues of long—term bonds,

         £Bt = TrB•AD         + [   (ii eBk)] Dti
               + B1rB + [(kl.0Bk)1BteDt_1

               + B2rB +              [($k20Bk)1tDt_l

               + B3rS + kk30Bk
               - 0        B               L                                           4
                     BB   t-l kB Bk k,t-l

where   B is the amount of,         and B the change in, bonds outstanding. The

optimal   financing model implies Bl <            0 < B2'        B3 The optimal adjustment
model implies 0BB >           0 (so that the coefficient on Bti is negative). Hence

four of the model's coefficients have known signs a priori. The signs of

     and the 0Bk' kB, are not known a priori, nor is the sign of any of the

combinations shown within           square brackets in (4) known        a priori.

where the particular interest rates used for
                                                 rB and r are, respectively,
the yield on new issues of long-term utility company bonds rated Aa by Moody's

Investors Service, Inc., and the yield on prime 4-6 month commercial paper.

          Apart from the slow adjustment speed indicated by the small (and

insignificant) value for 0BB' the estimated coefficients in (5) are all

plausible in the context of the underlying theory of long-term borrowing

behavior.     The coefficients of the three yield terms in particular each have
the expected respective sign and a satisfactory significance level. The
equation fits reasonably well overall, and the H-statistic does not
indicate   significant .erial correlation. Only four of the equation's. 78
estimated   residuals exceed two standard errors in absolute value, and none

exceeds three standard errors.

          If the relationship estimated in (5) represents nonfinancial business

corporations'    long-term borrowing behavior through September 1979, conditional
on    corporations' external deficit, their existing mix of long- and short—term
debt   outstanding, and the pattern of   long- and short—term interest rate
movements, has the corresponding experience since October 1979 (again,
conditional   on all of the same factors) indicated a significant change?
Table 1 shows the out-of—sample     prediction errors made by this equation for

each   of the seven   quarters beginning in October 1979.   The table also shows
the   estimated residuals for the last three quarters of the sample period, for

purposes of immediate comparison.

         The values presented in Table 1 show that the equation which describes

nonfinancial corporations' borrowing behavior before October 1979 clearly

fails to do so thereafter. In contrast to the absence of any within-sample

residuals greater than three standard deviations, the out-of—sample prediction

error is greater than three standard deviations in five of seven     quarters.

 Indeed,    several of the prediction errors exceed the equation's standard

 error by absurd amounts.

           In   addition, the pattern of sustained under-prediction of long-term
borrowing beginning at midyear 1980 also suggests that some factor representing
a break from prior experience had come into play. Two specific aspects of
this   series of negative values bear comment. First, as is clear from the

actual versus predicted values shown in the table, the problem is not the

familiar story of data moving into a new range into which an equation, with

its coefficients presumably biased toward zero, cannot follow.        Instead,

given the size of corporations' external deficits and the other explanatory

variables, the equation predicts a sharp rise in long—term borrowing which

 (except for 1980:11) never materialized. Second, the series of large (in

absolute value) residuals of the same sign stands in stark contrast to the

within-sample pattern of nearly adjacent offsetting residuals. During the

last three quarters of the sample, for example, the —1.8 standard deviation

residual in 1979:111 about offset the 1.5 standard deviation residual in

1979:1. Similarly, the only four in-sample residuals to exceed 2.0 standard

deviations       also occurred in a nearly adjacent and offsetting way (2.2 and -2.8
standard    deviations in 1975:1 and 1975:111, respectively, and —2.5 and 2.8 in

1977:11 and l977:IV respectively).8

        At a moze formal level, a chow test for the null hypothesis that

the equation's coefficients estimated over 1960:11 - 1979:111 remained

unchanged when estimated over 1960:11 — 1981:11 produced an F—statistic of

6.10 ——    far   in excess of the 2.93 value needed to reject the null hypothesis

at the 1% significance level. By contrast, the result of an analogous Chow

test for stability of the equation's coefficients over the 1960:11 —      1977:IV
versus 1960:11 — 1979:111 samples (that is, deleting the last seven observations
                                              —15—




instead of adding seven more) did not warrant rejecting the null hypothesis,

even at the more standard 5% level.

         Because the •k coefficients in the underlying portfolio selection

model (1) depend on the variarice—covariance structure of the joint distribu-

tion of the associated yields, it is not surprising that a sharp increase

in interest rate volatility like that which occurred after 1979:111 would

have led to instability in an estimated relationship like (5)•9 Indeed,

the results in this regard go further than the Chow test's rejection of the

joint stability of all of the model's coefficients. The results of estimating

(4) over 1960:11 —     1981:11, incorporating shift variables allowing the three
Bi coefficients to assume different values during 1979:IV - 1981:11, indicated

significant evidence of a shift in each of the three)0

         It is also useful to distinguish the respective roles of coefficient

shifts   versus expectation proxy errors in accounting for the over—prediction
of bond financing shown in Table 1.11 The            autoregressive   proxy for long—
term   yield   expectations    (6) closely tracked movements in actual long-term

yields throughout the post—sample period. By contrast, the autoregressive

proxy for short—term yield expectations (7) was typically below the actual

level of short-term yields during this period. Because the expectations that

presumably     matter for corporations' financing decisions are unobservable,
these relationships do not necessarily         indicate either success or failure

of the autoregressive expectations proxies. To the extent that the low

values generated by (7) do indicate a failure of the expectations proxy,

however, given B3 > 0         that   failure is in the direction opposite to that

needed   to account for the over—prediction of long-term borrowing. On the
basis of this limited evidence, therefore, the over—prediction does appear
to be attributable to a shift in the portfolio behavior           represented by (1),
                                     —16—




rather than to a failure of the autoregressive expectations proxies (6) and

(7).


       In sum, the evidence provided by an empirical model of nonfinancial

business corporations' long—term borrowing behavior shows a significant

break between the post October 1979 experience and the relationships that

prevailed over the prior two decades. Moreover, since mid 1980 the change

from prior behavior has been in the direction of less long—term borrowing

than would previously have been consistent with corporations' overall borrowing

requirements and other factors affecting the financing decision.

II. Effects of Volatility on the Costs of Corporate Financing

       The evidence presented in Section I, which shows a shift away from

long-term financing by U.S. nonfinancial business corporations, takes as

given the prevailing level of short— and long—term interest rates. To the

extent that that evidence indicates an effect of the post October 1979

increase in interest rate volatility on corporations' financing decisions,

therefore, it abstracts from effects directly associated with interest rate

levels. Such effects may be highly important, however. If the combination

of borrowers' and lenders' reactions to increased volatility has been to

raise the equilibrium level of long— relative to short—term interest rates,

the model of corporate financing behavior in (5) indicates that over time

corporations would finance less of a given external funds requirement at

long term. Moreover, models of business plant and equipment investment in the

tradition of Jorgenson [11] and Bischoff [l] indicate that over time an

increase in long—term interest rates would also depress capital expenditures,

so that there would be less external deficit to finance -— and less capital

formation to contribute to the economy's productivity.

       Because of the short time interval that has elapsed since October 1979,

together   with the extraordinary pattern of business cycle developments during
this interval, it   is   simply too soon to draw a judgment about the extent (if
any) to which the increase in interest rate volatility has altered fundamental

relationships either among various interest rates or between interest rates

collectively and expected price inflation. The swings in the slope of the

maturity yield curve have been unprecedented during the past two-and-a-half

years, but then so have the swings in interest rates themselves. On average,

long—term rates have been somewhat below short—term rates, but such an

"inverted" relationship is not unknown, especially at times of weak business
                                       —18—




activity. Just within the past year, both long- and      short-term    interest

rates have been unusually high in comparison to observed current price

 inflation, but the conflicting cross—currents at work have prevented easy

inferences about the more important expectations of future price inflation.

Even if data were available to support a judgment     that correctly   inferred

real interest rates were abnormally high, it would be impossible to have

confidence in the attribution of this phenomenon to increased interest rate
            12
volatility.

       By contrast, one aspect of interest rate determination about which an

inference of this kind may   be plausible   on the basis of the limited experience

since October 1979 is the cost of long—term borrowing by corporations over

and above the interest rate prevailing in the bond market at any given time.

This cost is less fundamental in the sense of basic economic theory, but to

the corporate borrower (or would—be borrower) it is no less real than any

other component of the cost of borrowing. If a corporation must pay an

additional 1% per annum to borrow, it does not much matter whether the

increment reflects a higher equilibrium interest rate level, as in most

theoretical models, or a higher cost of borrowing over and above the equilibrium

level. The fact that most theoretical models assume away any market imperfec-

tions that could account for a cost above the equilibrium level is of no

comfort.

       The most obvious element of the difference between the interest rate

paid by corporate borrowers and the prevailing market clearing rate is the

"spread" between the yield (price) at which corporations sell new bond issues

to underwriting syndicates and the yield (price) at which those syndicates in

turn sell the bonds   to investors. This spread is the syndicate members'
compensation for managing, underwriting, and distributing the new securities.
                                            —3.9—




What little variation in this spread has taken place, however, does not

suggest any response to increased interest rate volatility. The spread on

high grade long-term bonds priced by negotiation between the issuing corpor-

ation    and the underwriting syndicate has remained essentially unchanged at
$8.75 per $1,000 of par    value for more than two     decades, despite the presumed
greater    underwriting risk associated with increased interest rate volatility

over    many years. The spread on bonds priced by competitive bidding among
rival   underwriting syndicates: (almost always issued by utility companies:)

is sometimes greater and sometimes smaller than $8.75; but its variation

over tire primarily reflects the ever shifting        competitive pressures within
the investment banking industry, rather than any changes in specific external
factors.
          A second element of the difference between the interest rate      paid by

corporate    borrowers and the prevailing market clearing rate, which has shown a
sharp change since    October 1979, is    the spread between the   yield (price) at

which   underwriting syndicates sell new bond issues to investors and the yield
(price)    at which comparable issues already outstanding are then trading.

Although the spread between new issue and seasoned yields is less straight-

forward to analyze or even to measure than the underwriting spread, it is also

a genuine cost of borrowing to the corporation, and at times it is a larger

cost than that due to the underwriting spread.

          Conard and Frankena   [3], in   their classic study of the new issue versus

seasoned yield spread in the U.S. corporate bond market, hypothesized that one

explanation for the existence of a positive spread is that it reduces under-

writing risk. By pricing new securities at a discount in comparison to

comparable    securities already outstanding, underwriters can enhance prospects
of   rapid distribution of the new issue and therefore minimize the risks
                                            —20—




 inherent in holding large amounts of the securities for several days or even

 weeks. The simultaneous existence of the underwriting spread and the new

 issue versus seasoned spread gives underwriters two tools with which to cope

with a changing market environment. In response to an increase in under-

writing risk associated with increased interest rate volatility, underwriters

can either go ahead and assume the added risk and charge compensation for it

by increasing the purchase versus sale spread, or else offset the added risk

by increasing the new issue versus seasoned spread. Although neither Conard

and Frankena nor Ederington [4 ]        found clear cut evidence for such behavior,

neither study's sample period (1952—63 and 1964—71, respectively) withessed

anything like the increase in interest rate volatility that has occurred since
                   13
October 1979.

          The first     three columns of Table 2   show the number of issues, and

the    mean and standard deviation of the same—day spread between each new
issue's       yield and Moody's comparable seasoned yield index, for five distinct
categories      of U.S. long-term corporate bond issues        first for the period

including 1977, 1978 and 1979 through September, and then for the period

including 1980 and 1981.14 Although the standard deviations are large,

indicating a substantial range of spreads, in four of the five categories

the mean spread exhibited a sharp increase after October 1979. For each of the

three categories of utility bonds (including telephone issues), the mean spread

rose from zero or slightly negative to about 50 basis points, or 1/2% per, annum.

For Aa—rated industrials the mean spread rose from about zero to 1/8% per annum.

Only in the case of A—rated industrials did the mean spread remain unchanged

(at    1/8% per annum). For all five categories combined, the mean spread was
—4    basis   points before October 1979   and 38 basis   points thereafter.

  spreads like those shown in the second column of Table 2 may be misleading

 because of coupon differences between specific new issues and the outstanding

 issues used to compute the comparable seasoned yield indices. If two other-

 wise identical bonds bore different coupons but traded at the same yield

 nonetheless, the bond with the lower coupon would be more attractive to

 investors because of the lower probability of call. In addition, taxable

 investors would find the bond with the lower coupon (and hence lower price)

 more attractive because part of the return to holding it would take the

 form of capital gain and would therefore be subject to preferential tax

 treatment. For both reasons investors would bid up the price of the bond

 with the lower coupon so that in market equilibrium it traded at a lower

 overall yield. Hence when long-term interest rates in general are high in

 comparison to the coupons on the bonds that make up the comparable seasoned

yield indices, so that the bonds in the index are trading at discounts from

par, some positive spread between a new issue's yield and the comparable

seasoned index is to be expected. Because the average level of long-term

interest rates was sharply higher during 1980—81 than during 1977-79 (14.61%

versus 9.22% for new issues of Aa—rated utility bonds, for example), it is

at least possible that the rise in new issue versus seasoned yield spreads

documented in Table 2 simply relected the associated coupon differentials

rather than any effect on the market pricing mechanism due to increased

interest rate volatility. Hence some allowance for the coupon differential

is necessary.

       In the absence of an exact measure of the relevant coupon differential

for each new bond issue,'5 one way to control for the effect of changing

coupon differentials on new issue versus seasoned yield spreads in this

context is to relate the observed spread directly to the seasoned yield,

where rN is the yield on an individual new issue and r5 the yield on the

comparable Moody's seasoned yield index on the day of that new issue, both

measured in basis points; D is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the new issue

appeared in the 1980-81 part of the sample and 0 otherwise; and the i subscript

indicates a specific new issue. The rationale underlying (8) is that, for a

given sample of bonds comprising the seasoned yield index, and for new issues

priced approximately at par (which is usually the case), movements in the

seasoned yield index r will be closely and positively correlated with move-

ments in the differential between the coupon on each new issue and the mean

coupon on the bonds comprising the index. To the extent that movements in

   are a valid proxy for movements in the coupon differential, the implied

coupon—adjusted yield spread is a simple function of the intercept and slope

values in (8) together with the value of the mean coupon on the bonds in

the index.'6 Because the presence of the dummy variable in (8) allows the

intercept and slope to shift after October 1979, it also allows the implied

coupon—adjusted yield spread to change.

       The use of movements in r5 as a proxy for movements in the new issue

versus seasoned yield index coupon differential in (8) is subject to two

biases which act in opposite directions. First, because the mere existence

of a positive coupon differential will cause a positive spread (rN— rh),

movements of r5 would understate the movement of the differential if the

bonds used in compiling the seasoned index remained umchanged throughout the

sample. Second, because Moody's Investors Service does change the composition

of each index over time, however, typically by substitutions that bring the
                                            —23—




 average   coupon of the included bonds more nearly into line with prevailing

 new issue yields, movements of r would overstate the movement of the coupon

 differential if there were no resulting yield differential. On balance,

how good a proxy r8 is for the coupon differential in a regression context

 depends on the extent to which these two biases offset one another.

         Table 3 shows the results of estimating (8) for each of the five

categories of bond issues included in Table 2, first subject to the constraint
   =       = 0,   next subject only to the constraint           = 0 (so that the intercept

may differ in the two parts of each sample), and finally subject to no con-

straint (so that both the intercept and the slope may differ). The basic

regressions with &           =0   consistently show in           the expected positive

effect of the coupon differential (proxied by re), ranging from a maximum

of 14 basis points of yield spread per 1% of coupon differential for Aaa-

rated telephone issues to a minimum of 7           basis   points of spread per 1% of

differential      for A—rated industrials. The intercepts           are uniformly
negative because the correction for the average difference between the mean
level   of r and    the mean level of the coupon differential exceeds the mean
yield   spread after adjustment for the differential. The overall fit of the

equations, and with it the significance level of the estimated slope

coefficients, varies from surprisingly strong for the telephone issues to

negligible for the A-rated industrials.

        The   results of estimating (8) with either the intercept or the inter-
cept and the slope free to differ across the two subsamples are mixed. With
   = 0 still, the intercept shift        typically does not significantly differ

from zero. With both coefficients free to change, the slope shift l is

uniformly positive, and     significantly   so (at least marginally) for three

categories of issues. At the same time              is   uniformly negative, and

                                                     estimated freely.17 The adjusted

means for each specific category of issues differ somewhat from the unadjusted

means, as is to be expected, but the widespread increase from the earlier

to the latter part of the sample is still apparent. For all five categories

combined, the mean adjusted spread was -5 basis points befOre October 1979

and 35 basis points after January 1980.

          Although (8) includes a proxy variable to control for the coupon

differential between new issues and the bonds comprising the comparable

seasoned yield indices, it does not control for any of the other factors that

both researchers and investment bankers have traditionally suggested as deter-

minants   of new issue pricing. 2n            expanded relation that includes three other

often   cited elements of new issue pricing is

where rT is the yield on short-term Treasury bills on the day of the new

issue, measured in basis points; MM is the size of the new issue, as a

multiple of $100 million; and ArT is the most recent one—month change

in rT. The conventional sign expectations for the associated coefficients are

2'        4 > 0.        A positive cost of carrying bonds in inventory, measured by

(rT -   rN),   would lead to a larger spread (rN -
                                                            r)    if it induced underwriters

to price a new issue so as to ensure a quick sale. A large issue size would
                                         —25—




 lead to a large spread either because the market required a concession for

size transactions or because of the greater risk to underwriters of holding

more securities in syndicate. A rising interest rate level would lead to

a larger spread if it created expectations of weaker market conditions

ahead.

         Table 4 presents the results of estimating (9) for each of the five

categories of new issues, first subject to the constraint        =    = 0, next
subject only to the constraint      =   0, and finally subject to no constraint.
Although none of the coefficients on the three new variables included in (9)

is uniformly significant, all three typically exhibit the expected positive

sign, and those on the issue size and expectation variables are at least

marginally significant at least half the time. In the first equation for

Aa—rated utilities, for example, 33 = .19 indicates that an additional $100

million in issue size raises the new issue yield by 19 basis points after

allowance for all other factors. Similarly, in the first equation for Baa—

rated utilities, 14 =   .15 indicates that a recent increase of 1% in short-

term interest rates raises the new issue yield by 15 basis points after

allowance for all other factors.

         Although the inclusion of the three additional variables in (9) leads

to results that may shed interesting light on other questions, it does little

to alter the basic implications for the question of shift in either intercept

or coupon differential slope already contained in the results of estimating

(8). Once again the intercept shift        is typically not significantly

different from zero when the slope shift constraint       = 0 is in effect.

In the absence of constraints,      is again uniformly positive and     almost

uniformly negative, with significance levels somewhat greater than those

shown in Table 3.

III. Effects of Volatility on the Distribution of Bond Purchases

          The evidence presented in Sections I and II, suggesting changes in the

operation of the U.S. long—term corporate capital market since October 1979,

focuses    first on borrowing corporations and then on the market intermediary
as represented by the underwriting mechanism. The other side of the market,
of   course, is the lender -—   that   is, the investor who ultimately holds

nonfinancial corporations' bonds. Just as nonfinancial corporations and

investment bankers may have changed their respective ways of doing business

in response to the increase in interest rate volatility, so too may portfolio

investors.

          Even the most casual conversations with participants in the U.S.

corporate bond market in recent times almost inevitably lead to some form

of assertion that the behavior of investors in the market has indeed changed

during the past two years. The notion which most typically arises is that

purchasers of   long—term bonds have become "speculators" rather than "investors,
making   portfolio   decisions more on the basis of expectations of capital gain

(or fears of capital loss) over very short time horizons instead of assess-

ments of prevailing interest rates in the context of longer—run portfolio

objectives. To be sure, this process has been under way for many years,

as the bond market itself has become more liquid and interest rate (and

hence bond price) fluctuations have intensified since the relatively tran-

quil days of the early l960s, Even so, the overwhelming consensus among

market participants appears to be that the acceleration of this process

during the past two years has constituted a qualitatively new phenomenon.

If true, such a development would be at least consistent with —       if not
directly due to — the sharp increase in interest rate volatility in this

period.

          There are many senses in which it could be true that "speculation"
                                        —28—




has replaced "investment" as a mode of behavior on the lenders! side of

the bond market. The same individuals and institutions that played active

roles in the market before could still be doing so, but could have changed

their respective patterns of portfolio behavior. In addition -- or alterna-

tively ——   the   more risk averse or far sighted individuals could have withdrawn

from the market, with other individuals who are more comfortable with risk

yet more concerned with short-run portfolio performance taking their places;

and a similar exchange of places could have occurred among institutions. While

both of these interpretations of the widespread perception of change are

entirely plausible, providing evidence to document or contradict either possi-

bility lies well beyond the scope of this paper.

       another, more readily explored, sense in which the market's behavior

may have changed is that some specific classes of investors could have reduced

their participation, with other specific investor classes taking their place.

Because of the great diversity of legal and regulatory constraints under which

various kinds of financial institutions operate in the United States, not to

mention the divergence in specific practice appropriate to their respective

lines of business, different classes of institutions typically exhibit

sharply different portfolio behavior.'9 To the extent that such classes of

investors exhibit portfolio behavior which is more homogeneous within classes

than across classes, any shifts in the relative importance of specific classes'

market participation imply changes in the equilibrium characteristics of the
                  20
overall market.

for the first fifteen years of this period, then individually for the five

years leading up to and including the October 1979 change in monetary policy

procedures, and then individually for the two subsequent years in which

interest rate volatility has been so much greater.

           Although many regularities do emerge in an inspection of these data

—-   for   example, the historical and continuing role of life insurance companies

and state—local government retirement funds as major providers of long—term

debt capital to business ——    the   data also convey an impression of enormous

variation from year to year in the distribution of net bond purchases,

depending on the specific market circumstances. Just within the five years

1975—79, for example, the share of total net bond purchases accounted for by

life insurance companies varied from barely one—fourth to over one-half.

Similarly, households accounted for more than one—fourth of all net purchases

in 1976 and nearly one—third in 1979, but were themselves net sellers of

corporate bonds in each of the two intervening years.21

           Against the background of this substantial variation, the chief

aspects of the distribution of bond purchases since October 1979 that have

been clearly out of the ordinary all occurred during 1981: the unprecedented

liquidation of bond holdings by households, the unprecedented absorption

of bonds by securities brokers and dealers, and the unprecedented absorption

of bonds by foreign investors. During the first three quarters of last

year (the latest period for which data are available at the time of writing),

the net sale of bonds by households exceeded the market's entire net new

isue volume. In other words, because of net selling by households, all

other classes of investors together absorbed more than twice the net amount

of bonds that would have been necessary to clear the market if the only

net "sales" had come from net new borrowing by corporate issuers. Securities
                                          —30—




brokers arid dealers and foreign investors, however, increased their bond

purchases by well over a factor of two.

          The massive liquidation of bond portfolios by households in 1981 was

clearly extraordinary, but its connection to the post October 1979 increase

in interest rate volatility is hardly obvious. Not only was there no such

liquidation in 1980, but that which occurred during 1981 took place entirely

in the second and third quarters of the year. These six months were a peak

period for long—term interest rates, and many individuals may have been

responding more to the opportunity to create tax losses before the 1981

legislation lowered marginal tax rates than to any aversion to volatility

per se. More broadly, still other factors like the weakness of personal

income associated with the renewed recession in business activity may also

have been partly responsible. In the absence of a specific model of households'

portfolio behavior that allows for as many such factors as possible --         in
short, an analog to the model of nonfinancial corporations' borrowing behavior

in (5) —- no strong inference linking this shift in households' bond market

activity to interest rate volatility is warranted.22

          The increased   share of net bond purchases accounted for by securities
brokers   and   dealers and by foreign investors is more clearly consistent

with the commonly perceived shift in the market's character.         Wholly apart
from the question of whether the increase in interest rate volatility per

se motivated these two investor groups' increased participation, they are

more likely to exhibit "speculative" behavior than are the traditional

major bond investors like life insurance companies and pension funds.

       In sum, despite an unprecedented change in households' bond market

portfolio    behavior since October 1979, and an   accompanying   change in that of
securities   brokers and dealers and foreign investors, there is no clear
                                    —31—




evidence that the increase in interest rate volatility has altered behavior

on the lenders' side of the U.S. corporate bond market.

IV. Concluding Remarks

       The evidence presented in this paper leads to three conclusions about

possible effects on the U.S. long-term capital raising mechanism due to the

sharp increase in interest rate volatility that has followed the Federal

Reserve System's adoption of new monetary policy procedures in 1979. First,

the increased volatility has probably led nonfinancial corporations to finance

less of their external funds requirements at long term than they would other-

wise have done. Second, the increased volatility has probably led underwriters

of high grade corporate bonds to increase the spread of a typical new issue's

yield over the prevailing market yield on comparable bonds already outstanding.

Third, there is little firm basis (reported here, anyway) to conclude that

the increased volatility in particular has affected investors' portfolio

behavior in the bond market.

       Each of these three conclusions (especially the two positive ones)

bears treating with substantial caution. The experience from October 1979 to

date spans too short an interval to support any judgment with confidence,

given the difficulties that always hinder economic inference. Moreover, the

specific aspects of economic behavior under scrutiny here ——     corporate
finance, investment banking, and portfolio investment —-   are   sufficiently

imperfectly understood at a quantitative level to render sharp judgments

risky even on the basis of more ample data. Further, the research reported

in this paper carries none of the three separate analyses conducted to the

full depth feasible within even the limited data and analytical tools

available.

       Even so, the conclusions reached here about the effects of increased

interest rate volatility on the capital raising mechanism are suggestive.

Because   the potential economic consequences of significantly impairing that
                                    —33—




mechanism are great, even these tentative conclusions should serve both as

a warning of caution for public policy and   as   a spur to further research.

    1. It is always possible, of course, that the increase in interest rate
        volatility since October 1979 has occurred for reasons unrelated to the
        change in Federal Reserve operating procedures. An analysis of the
        effects of that volatility would still be useful in that case, but
        its conclusions would then carry no implications for monetary policy.

    2. The analysis focuses on a subset of the effects investigated empirically
        by Johnson et al. [10] and considered at the a priori level by Lombra
        and Struble [14]; see both papers for references to the relevant earlier
        literature on interest rate volatility.

    3. See Friedman and Role; [9] for a proof of this proposition, together with
        expressions deriving the     and it, in (1) from the parameters of the
        joint distribution of the yield asessments and the borrower's (or
        investor's) coefficient of relative risk aversion. The form of (1) used
        in Friedman [7] also allowed for several non—yield influences on portfolio
        selection, but none of these proved statistically significant in the
        estimated equation presented below; see foothote 6.

    4. See Friedman [51 for the development of the optimal marginal adjustment
        model, and Friedman [71 for its application in the context of corporationst
        choice of liabilities.

    5. The time shapes of these "average" expectations depend on the results of
        a dynamic programing optimization involving, among other factors, the
        associated perceived variances and covariances; see the model of call—
        deferred optimal financing in Bodie and Friedman [2].

    6. The equation  presented here also omits several non—yield variables
        included In Friedman [7], as well as the expected inflation proxy
        included in Friedman [6]. Despite the a priori expectation of a nonzero
        coefficient in the expanded model, in each case preliminary experimentation
        did not indicate a value significantly different from zero. For the
        retained earnings and fixed investment variables, the most important of
        the non—yield influences in [71, the estimated coefficients (and t—
        statistics) were 0.6275 (1.5) and 0.04277 (0.1), respectively. For
        the expected inflation proxy the estimated coefficient was —0.02577 (—0.4).

    7. All y   and   cS   values   in (6)        t—statistics in excess of 1.9
                                            and (7) have
        excep 1l l3 and 2 The         role of the unit sum constraint is to permit
        identification of the corresponding coefficients in (5), and the inter-
        pretation   of those two coefficients is of course conditional on the unit
      sum constraint. The estimation procedure used here also constrains each
      set of lag weights to follow a third-degree polynomial pattern, with the
      right-hand tial of the lag constrained to pass through zero, and with
      each lead weight (Yo or ti) free of the polynomial constraint but still
      included in the unit sum constraint. See Friedman [7] for further
      details of the estimation process.

 8. A third important aspect of the equation's post-sample over-prediction
     is that these data on "actual long—term borrowing" in fact include both
     long- and intermediate—term issues. The shift in the mix of new issue
     maturities from long to intermediate term during the last two years
     further compounds the result shown here.

 9. Simply introducing an   interest rate volatility measure on the right-
      hand side of (5) leads, as would be expected, to a negative coefficient
      that is significant at the 5% level when the equation is estimated
      over 1960:11 — 1981:11, but not over 1960:11 — 1979:111. For all of the
      reasons advanced above, however, such a finding is of questionable
      value. Practically any variable that has shown a sudden increase
      after mid 1979 would produce similar results.

10. The t-statistics for the three individual coefficient shifts were 2.8
      for Bl' -2.5 for B2 and -3.0 for B3

11. The predicted values shown in Table 1 rely on period-by-period updating
     of all right-hand side variables in (5), including the lagged interest
     rate observations in (6) and (7).

12. Adding an interest rate volatility measure to any standard unrestricted
     reduced—form term—structure equation, estimated directly with the long-
     term yield as the dependent variable, would presumably result in a
     significantly positive coefficient. It is not clear what such an
     exercise would contribute to understanding of interest rate relationships,
     however; see again foothote 9.

13.   Researchers investigating the underwriting of new equity issues have
      found more mixed results on this question, although the respective
      hypotheses for the cases of bond and stock issues are not fully
      comparable. See, for example, Scholes [15], Logue [13] and Stoll [16].

14. A break—down between issues priced by negotiation versus competitive
     bidding, within the utility (and post-1979 Bell Telephone) groups,
     showed no apparent differences that would warrant allowing for this
     distinction in the analysis that follows. The omission of the final
     three months of 1979, on the ground that underwriters would have needed
     some time to observe the increase in interest rate volatility before
     reacting to it, has essentially no effect on the results reported here
      (and in Tables 3—5 below) because there were so few issues during those
     months. For the five categories of issues shown in the table, the
     numbers of new issues during October—December 1979 were, respectively,
      2,   6, 1, 0 and 0.
15. Following Conard and Frankena, an alternative approach would be to
     construct a separate yield index with average coupon identical to that
     of each new issue. This approach would be difficult to implement,
     not only because of the amount of data manipulation required but also
     because of the need for tenuously based interpolation and extrapolation
     for many issues.

16. More specifically, assume that the composition of the index is fixed
     and that the bonds in the index are priced at par on average over time,
     so that the mean seasoned index coupon is ks =   s where i is the mean
     observed value of rS during the sample period. Also assume that each
     new issue is priced at par and — now abstracting from the yield effect
     of the coupon differential — at a yield equal to that on comparable
     seasoned issues, so that the coupon on any new issue is kN = rc.
     the discussion below explains, each of these assumptions introduces
                                                                          (
     a bias of known sign in what follows,) If the relationship between the
     yield spread and the coupon differential is the linear rN - rS =
     c + 13(kN-ks), then substituting and rearranging yields (8) where, apart
     from the durruny variable, o =       - Fsand l = 3. Because the equation
     includes an intercept, there is no implication that the level of
     is a proxy for the level of the coupon differential.

17. The two values reported for each category of bonds are, first,
        + ftFs where ?s is the 1977—79 mean of rS and, second, 13j + +
         ÷ i1s where s is the 1980—81 mean of rS. See again footnote 16.

18. For (8) this result is to be expected, in that the F-statistic just shows
     the joint significance of o and51 together. For (9) the F—statistic
     applies to a test for no change not only in   and    but also in 2' 3
     and

19.   See, for example, the evidence along these lines presented in Friedman [5].

20.   See Lintner [12] and Friedman [81   for proofs of this proposition in two
      different contexts.

21. Households cannot issue new corporate bonds, of course; net sales
     represent an excess of aggregate gross sales of bonds already held in
     portfolios over aggregate gross purchases. The household sector of the
     flow-of—funds accounts consists primarily of individuals but also
     includes non—profit institutions and bank—managed personal trusts.
22. The converse is also true for the other investor classes. Post 1979
     behavior that appears ordinary enough on casual inspection may be
     unusual in the context of a model allowing for independent factors.
     n approach to this problem analogous to that employed in Section I
     would be to estimate the six bond demand equations developed in Friedman [51
     using data through 1979:111, and then test the estimated relationships
     using post-sample data. Such an investigation lies beyond the scope of
     this paper.
