                                         ABSTRACT

Uneven development within countries suggests that domestic trade frictions are important. Trade
flows within a country, however, are rarely observed. We employ a new dataset on trade between
fifteen Chinese treaty ports to examine the importance of domestic frictions around the year 1900.
The distribution of welfare effects depends on each port's productivity and factor costs, China's
economic geography as it influences trade costs, as well as the degree of regional diversity in
production, which increases the potential gains from trade. We utilize this framework to quantify
the size and distribution of welfare effects resulting from new technology and lower trade costs.
Domestic trade frictions turn out to be substantial, far from the frictionless world that is
commonly assumed. Moreover, geographic barriers loom large in shaping the welfare gains from
technology improvements and trade cost reductions. We find, however, that an important
explanation for why there was a limit to what could be gained through increased domes- tic trade
was that the differences in productivity across regions of China in the 19th century were
relatively low.

                                          I.   Introduction


Starting in mid-19th century, under military action from Western countries, China
opened an increasing number of ports to foreign traders. These ports were the
conduits of goods, but they were also the carriers of Western influence. During
the Treaty Port Era (1842-1943), foreigners introduced steam ships to China,
dredged harbors, ran the postal system, set up Western courts, and were involved
in numerous other parts of the Chinese economy. One area in which Western
presence was particularly important was the customs system, which from 1859
on operated under the auspices of the Western-led Chinese Maritime Customs
Service (CMCS). We know about trade that crosses a country’s border because it
is typically there that tariffs are assessed.1 In contrast, very little is known about
trade within countries, to the point that in mainstream analysis countries have
until recently been taken as dimensionless points in space (Krugman 2010). The
Treaty Port Era provides a unique opportunity to study trade within a country’s
borders because CMCS statistics record all goods entering and leaving individual
ports. In this paper, we examine how internal trade within China has shaped the
spread of the foreign influence throughout China.

We construct a new, commodity-level, dataset for fifteen major treaty ports to
estimate our model, based on Eaton and Kortum (2002), for China in the year
1904.2 The data pins down a small number of parameters that govern the magni-
tude of the general-equilibrium trade responses to shocks in one or more regions.
We utilize this framework to quantify the size and distribution of welfare effects
resulting from new technology and lower trade costs. We show that the distri-
bution of welfare effects depends critically on each port’s productivity, China’s
economic geography (because it affects trade costs), and the extent of regional di-
versity in production (because of how that shapes the potential gains from trade).

    1 The paucity of information on internal trade is related to the absence of internal trade taxes; e.g.
the Import-Export Clause, Article 1, Section 10, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution.
    2 We choose 1904 because this is the last year for which CMCS statistics report bilateral trade between
treaty ports. Below we also discuss results for two earlier cross sections, namely in 1879 and in 1899.
                                                    2
Specifically, a 20% increase in Shanghai’s productivity raises welfare in Shanghai
by about 1.5%; because of trade, however, total welfare gains accrue not only
to Shanghai (which receives about 40% of total), but also Ningbo, Chinkiang,
and Wuhu, located in the vicinity of Shanghai (28% of total). In addition, since
factor costs, income, and production patterns respond endogenously, welfare in
some ports can actually fall when Shanghai’s technology improves, as it does in
the relatively distant Tianjin.

There are two main findings. First, we show that through trade, a change in
any one of the treaty ports has an impact throughout China; it is not bottled
up within the areas of immediate foreign influence. Technology, factor costs and
trade frictions all play a role for the welfare gains from trade, but it is trade
frictions, as determined by China’s economic geography, that are found to be
central for the distribution of the welfare gains from trade across regions. Second,
across China during the Treaty Port Era, the evidence for regional diversity in
productivity across goods is smaller than for today’s international trade between
high-income countries. This puts a lid on the aggregate size of welfare gains
because differences in productivity across goods–comparative advantage–is the
source of the gains from trade in our analysis.

There has been a recent resurgence of interest in China’s trade during the Treaty
Port Era (Keller, Li, and Shiue 2011, 2013, Mitchener and Yan 2014).3 In contrast
to Mitchener and Yan’s (2014) analysis of the factor price effects of China’s foreign
trade we focus on China’s domestic trade in locally-produced goods. For one,
domestic trade is typically large relative to foreign trade.4 In addition, this is a
rare case where domestic frictions can be quantified, important not least of all in
light of how uneven China’s economic development tends to be across hinterland
and coastal regions—in the past as well as today.5 Our analysis complements

   3 Earlier contributions include Hsiao (1974) and Lyons (2003).
   4 For  example, Shanghai’s exports to the single treaty port of Yantai (Chefoo) were comparable in
size to Shanghai’s exports to the country of Great Britain; for the year 1904, see CMC (2001a), Vol. 39.
    5 Recent work stresses that domestic trade frictions are critical for our models to fit the data; for
example, Ramondo, Rodriguez-Clare, and Saborio (2016) calculate that without accounting for domestic

earlier work on China’s internal trade in this era (Kose 1994, 2005; Keller, Li,
and Shiue 2012) by quantifying the size and distribution of the welfare gains from
trade.

A large literature is concerned with the implications of Western influence in China
during the 19th and early 20th centuries.6 Although early views tended to view
the foreign presence negatively, some authors cited positive demonstration effects
(Feuerwerker 1983)7 and recent work note other positive treaty port influences
(So and Myers 2011, Jia 2014). We do not estimate the causal effect of treaty port
opening. Rather, given the size and structure of domestic trade frictions around
1900, we are interested in how inter-regional trade shapes welfare outcomes as
regions experience technological and trade cost change. To do this, we take a
counterfactual approach to document how, in this setting, technology improve-
ments and trade cost declines were related to the substantial increase in China’s
trade in the late 19th century.8 Some readers might want to view this as tracing
out an indirect effect of the foreign opening, as our estimate on the geographic
scope of the Western impact in China is from the vantage point of a trade model.

Our analysis is part of a rapidly growing literature studying historical economies
with the help of general-equilibrium trade models. Whether it is relative factor
prices that are of interest, as in the Heckscher-Ohlin analyses of O’Rourke and
Williamson (1994, 1999) and Mitchener and Yan (2014), or aggregate welfare
effects and trade costs as in our Ricardian analysis, general-equilibrium trade
models provide a well-defined framework in which to interpret historical data, test
sharp hypotheses, or conduct counterfactual analyses. A key contribution here
is that in contrast to most studies employing general-equilibrium trade models,

trade frictions Denmark’s per-capita income relative to the U.S. is predicted to be 34%, far off what is
in the data (94%), while with domestic trade frictions this rises to 81%.
    6 Morse (1926) and Fairbank (1978) provide detailed historical accounts of China’s treaty port era.
    7 Dernberger (1975) summarizes the earlier literature. See also Rawski (1989), Richardson (1999).
    8 We recognize that domestic trade frictions in the year 1904 do not only reflect the mid-century West-
ern opening but also China’s development in the centuries before; the integration of China’s commodity
markets in the second half of the 18th century, for example, was roughly on par with that in Western
Europe (Shiue and Keller 2007).
                                                    4
the figures on domestic trade we employ are data, not estimates.9 Closest to our
paper in this respect may be Donaldson (2015).10 Our paper complements his
analysis of agricultural income gains due to railroads in colonial India, although
we focus on trade via ships of a broader set of commodities. While the quality
of the data on China does not match that for British India, we know the precise
volume of the ship trade, in contrast to British India where only data on the
location of railroad tracks and the total trade volume is available.

              II.   Historical Background: Trajectories from the Past


After her defeat in the First Opium War (1840 – 1842), China signed the Treaty of
Nanjing (1842) which expanded the rights of Western countries to trade at a total
of five Chinese ports, four more than the one (Canton) that they had been allowed.
Other stipulations included that Hong Kong would become a British colony, and
that foreigners would be subject to the laws of their own countries, as opposed to
Chinese law (extraterritoriality). Additional ports were opened to trade with the
West in subsequent years. Given that the post-1842 increase in trade did not live
up to Western expectations, and that trade taxes went largely unpaid during the
Taiping Rebellion (1850-64), in the year 1854 it was decided that China’s customs
system would be run by Western officials who formally would be employed by
China’s central government. The organization that was founded for this task
was the Chinese Maritime Customs Service (CMCS; Imperial Maritime Customs
Service before 1911), with Horatio Nelson Lay as its first leader. Operations of
the CMCS began in full in the year 1859 in Shanghai, with other ports following
over time. Robert Hart became Inspector-General of the CMCS in the year 1863.
His influence shaped the organization of the CMC and China’s trade opening for
decades to come.

While this paper is focused on the welfare effects of China’s domestic trade around
   9 Typically, domestic trade flows are estimated based on distance, as in Ramondo, Rodriguez-Clare,
and Saborio (2016) for example.

the turn of the century, given the unprecedented growth of trade and foreign direct
investment in China since 1978 it is important to ask how the 19th century fits
in with China’s long-run development (Brandt, Ma, and Rawski 2014). For the
following analysis we focus on Shanghai, which is the largest port in the world
today by several measures (see Keller, Li, and Shiue 2013).

1865 to 1900, we see that the level of Shanghai’s exports in the early 2000s
was close to what one would have predicted based on the 19th century trend.
Additional results for all countries and the early 20th century, as well as on
imports, are presented in Keller, Li, and Shiue (2013). Figure 2 shows that while
French foreign direct investment (FDI) in Shanghai is well below what a simple
extrapolation of the 1872-1921 trend would yield, the relatively fast growth of
FDI recently is consistent with a return to historical trend.11 Figure 3 shows

that the number of Germans in Shanghai today is quite close to what one would
expect based on extrapolating the 19th century trend.


Overall, these findings suggest that although the post-1949 era differs from the
19th and early 20th centuries in that China had become a fully sovereign country,
it is hard to ignore the historical trajectories to which China appears to be re-
turning to now. To put this differently, it will be much harder to predict China’s
trajectory over the next four decades than it was to predict where China was
going for the roughly four decades since 1978.


We now turn to our analysis of China’s domestic trade during the Treaty Port
Era, beginning with our theoretical framework.

Our analysis is based on the Ricardian trade model of Eaton and Kortum (2002).
This section sketches the main features of the model with an emphasis on its
empirical implications. For a full description including proofs and extensions, the
interested reader is referred to Eaton and Kortum (2002).

We consider an economy consisting of N regions. In the empirical analysis below
these regions will be the customs districts of fifteen treaty ports in China. In each
region, firms produce a continuum of goods j ∈ [0, 1]. Goods can be traded across
regions, though trade is costly. Bilateral trade costs between region n and i are
denoted by dni , where n and i are destination (importer) and source (exporter)
region, respectively. A convenient formulation of trade costs is that costs are
in terms of the goods themselves: trade costs of dni mean that d units of the
good have to be shipped from i in order for one unit to arrive in region n. We
                                     8
assume that interregional trade costs are positive, dni > 1 if n 6= i, while within
a region trade costs are zero (dii = 1, ∀i).12 Given interregional trade flows and
other data, these trade costs will be estimated in the context of the model. Trade
costs capture the internal geography of China, including the geographic distance
between n and i, and in the empirics below we allow for additional influences.

Consumers in all regions have identical preferences and maximize the following
utility function subject to a standard budget constraint:

where Q(j) is the quantity of good j consumed, and σ > 0 is the elasticity of
substitution between each pair of goods.

Production technology varies across regions and goods; we denote region i ’s ef-
ficiency in the production of good j by zi (j). The efficiency is stochastic and,
dropping the j index for ease of notation, it is drawn from the following (Fréchet)
distribution function:

                                                           −θ
(2)                                      Fi (z) = e−Ti z


with Ti > 0 and θ > 1. The technology parameter Ti is region i -specific and
shifts the distribution of the efficiency draws: a higher value of Ti increases the
probability of drawing a higher level of efficiency. In the context of a Ricardian
model, Ti is hence a measure of the absolute advantage of a region. In contrast, the
parameter θ determines the variance of the efficiency draws. As θ increases, the
variance of productivity draws falls, until in the limit, with θ tending to infinity,
each draw in region i has the same efficiency, which is governed by Ti . This means
that the relative efficiency across goods–the production of good j compared to

   12 We have also considered positive within-region trade costs, as discussed in Appendix C. Standard
assumptions for within-region trade costs (see Appendix C) have only a minor impact on our empirical
findings.
                                                     9
that of good j’ –does not differ across regions, and hence there are no gains from
trade in this model. Thus, θ governs the strength of comparative advantage, with
the gains from specialization higher the lower is θ. The formulation in equation
(2) describes production efficiency with N+1 parameters, one for each region’s
absolute advantage and a variance parameter that we assume is common to all
regions. We will estimate these key parameters below.

With competitive firms and constant returns to production yielding a unit input
cost of ci , the price a buyer in region n would pay for 1 unit of good j produced
in region i is:
                                                           
                                                     ci
(3)                                pni (j) =                    dni
                                                   zi (j)

The price will be higher the higher are input costs (ci ), the lower is productivity
(zi (j)), and the larger the trade costs (dni ). The distribution of unit prices of
region i produced goods that are offered in region n can be shown to equal:

                                               h              i 
(4)           Gni (p) = P r(Pni ≤ p) = 1 − exp − Ti (ci dni )−θ pθ ,


which indicates that for any value p the chance of a region i-produced good to
undercut this p is increasing in region i’s absolute advantage (Ti ) and decreasing
in both region i ’s input cost (ci , such as wages) and trade costs (dni ). A consumer
in region n is faced from every region i (including his domestic region n) with a
distribution of prices according to (4), and the consumer will choose to buy the
good from the cheapest source. The distribution of the lowest price in n is:

                                                           
(5)                    Gn (p) = P r(Pn ≤ p) = 1 − exp −Φn pθ ,

                  PN               −θ
where Φn =         i=1 Ti (ci dni ) .   Notice that actual purchases in n depend not
only on n’s own technology and input costs but also on those of other regions, as
well as region n’s geographic barriers to all potential trade partner (reflected in
                                        10
the dni ). Gains from trade arise if foreign production inclusive of shipping has a
lower unit price than buying domestically, and the more potential exporters there
are the (weakly) lower the price. Formally, the price index corresponding to the
utility function in (1), pn , is falling in Φn . Moreover, it does so more strongly the
lower is θ, because lower θ raises the chance of an extraordinarily high efficiency
draw in some region.

We now turn to the implications of our model for bilateral trade. First, the
probability that region i is the cheapest source of a good for destination n can be
shown to equal

                                         Ti (ci dni )−θ
(6)                              πni =                  ,
                                              Φn

which is intuitive because in this expression, region i ’s (input- and trade cost-
adjusted) absolute advantage in the numerator is compared to the (adjusted)
absolute advantages of all N regions in the denominator. With a continuum of
goods one can apply the law of large numbers so that (6) also gives the fraction
of goods region n buys from i.

Second, given the distribution of prices of actually purchased goods in region n,
equation (5), it follows that the share of region n’s expenditure on goods produced
in region equals the fraction of goods bought from that region, given by (6):

                          Xni           Ti (ci dni )−θ
(7)                           = πni = PN                −θ
                          Xn           k=1 Tk (ck dnk )

                                                                          PN
where Xni is region n’s expenditure on region i’s goods and Xn =            i=1 Xni   is
region n’s total expenditure. Thus, the share of expenditure on region i -produced
goods depends on how good is region i ’s technology, Ti , adjusted for input costs
ci and location relative to n (dni ), in comparison to factor-cost and geography-
adjusted technologies of all regions.

We assume that goods can be purchased by consumers or by firms as intermediate
                                     11
inputs. Production takes place by combining labor and intermediate inputs, with
labor’s share in production given by β, 0 < β < 1 :

                                                       i   ,


where wi is the wage in region i and pi is region i’s price index. Two sets of
relations are central to solving for the model’s equilibrium. First, substituting
(8) into the expression for Φ shows that the price index in region n is related to
the price indices well as technology and comparative advantage parameters in all
regions:

                                                           wiβ p1−β
                                           X
(9)                              pn = γ           Ti            i   dni
                                            i=1


Furthermore, trade shares can be expressed as a function of wages, prices, and
the parameters of the model:

                                                                           !−θ
                               Xni                         γdni wiβ p1−β
                                                                     i
(10)                               = πni = Ti
                               Xn                               pn


The model is closed by labor-market and goods-market clearing conditions which
are not shown here to conserve space. Regarding labor market equilibrium, we as-
sume in the baseline case that workers are immobile between the sector producing
manufacturing goods that we have modeled so far and another sector producing
non-manufacturing goods.13 Because around the year 1900 in China many work-
ers were employed in manufacturing and other activities one might think that it
is more reasonable to assume that workers can move between the manufacturing
and non-manufacturing sector, and below we consider this case as well. Our mea-
sure of welfare is real GDP, given by aggregate final expenditure deflated by the
region’s price index.

  13 We   use the term manufacturing for brevity; as will become clear below it also includes other goods.
                                                       12
In the following section we describe the data, followed by the estimation of the
parameters of the model.


                                              IV.     Data


For the most part our analysis focuses on the cross section of China’s internal
trade in the year 1904. This year is chosen because it is the last year in which the
CMC publications give aggregate bilateral trade across ports.14 This section sum-
marizes the data that will be employed, with more details given in the Appendix.
The analysis includes fifteen of China’s foreign treaty ports, which are listed in
Table 1 according to the ports’ names as recorded by the British CMC service
as well as the English transliteration of the port name (in Pinyin), and the 20th
century provincial jurisdiction. The port of Guangzhou in Guangdong province,
for example, is called Canton in the CMC publications. These treaty ports are
defined on the basis of the customs district of each port, which includes not only
the port but also the surrounding area. One might therefore prefer to think of the
treaty ports as regions; we will use the terms ports and regions interchangeably.
Our choice of these 15 ports is based on their importance for China’s domestic
trade. The three largest ports during the 19th century were Shanghai, Wuhan
(Hankow), and Tianjin (Tientsin).

Figure 4 shows the locations of the fifteen ports. The figure shows that we cover
broad regions of China, mainly along its coast but also along the Yangzi river.
The distance between Canton (Guangzhou) and Newchwang (Niuzhuang), which
are located in Guangdong and Liaoning province, respectively, is about 2,700
kilometers.

The CMC statistics include only the trade that went through the Chinese Mar-
itime Customs Service. Although our analysis excludes land-based trade, the

  14 Below we will also discuss results from employing data for the years 1899 (the first year for which
we have data for the same fifteen ports) and 1879 (for fourteen of the fifteen ports) as alternatives to the
1904 cross section. Furthermore, some of our analysis is based on bilateral trade data for 1895-99, see
Appendix C.

amount of other water-borne trade in China (covered by the native customs sys-
tem) was small in comparison to the CMC portion. One measure of the fraction
of trade that is covered in the CMC statistics is that during the years 1904 to
1907, the maritime customs revenue collected at the treaty ports was about ten
times as large as the native customs revenue collected outside of the CMC sys-
tem (CMC 2001a, Vol. 45, pages 8-9). While land-based trade was significant,
especially over short-distances, there is no reason to believe that the omission of
land-based trade creates a bias in our analysis.               15



   15 In addition to both maritime and native customs there was waterway transport that avoided all
trade taxes, on which there is generally little evidence. However, this trade would have been mostly
on junks, which were relatively small. For example, even though in 1904 there were five times as many
Chinese-owned junks that entered the maritime customs than Chinese-owned steamers, the aggregate
tonnage of these junks was only half as large as that of the Chinese-owned steamers (CMC 2001a, Vol.
45, p.23). Moreover, the trade outside the maritime customs system was mostly short-distance, whereas
our analysis is primarily concerned with trade over larger distances. The importance of railroads in China
around the year 1900 was still limited.

                                            A.   Trade data


Two types of trade data are employed in the analysis: first, commodity-level
multilateral trade at each of the fifteen regions, and second, the aggregate bilat-
eral trade between the regions. Our analysis focuses on imports and exports of
Chinese products, referred to in the Maritime statistics as “native goods”. The
commodity-level trade data is employed to estimate local prices, defined as the
unit value of a range of goods at each port. The price difference for a given good
between two regions provides an upper bound for the trade costs between these
two regions. Before we turn to that, the following discusses aggregate bilateral
trade of our regions.

Figure 5 shows the matrix of bilateral trade, with the thickness of each line
proportional to the size of the flow. Exports are shown in the same color shade as
the region’s label and are offset towards the center of the figure. Hankow exports a
large amount of its production to Shanghai, for example, while Tientsin’s imports
from Hankow are smaller than Tientsin’s imports from Shanghai.

Importantly, the trade volumes shown in Figure 5 are locally produced in each
of the fifteen regions. The Maritime Trade statistics are exceptional in that
they provide information on re-export trade separately from local-origin trade.
Shanghai, in particular, re-exports goods from other Chinese regions to an extent
that exceeds its exports of local origin.16 If each region would export to every
other region, Figure 5 would show 15 x 14 trade flows; however, 22% of the
bilateral flows are equal to zero.17 Also note that this trade is not balanced in
the year 1904; we do not examine issues of inter-temporal trade in our analysis.

Our discussion of aggregate trade data is not complete without covering the trade
of region i with itself. Because we do not have information on production in region
  16 Note that if lower trade costs or technology improvements would lead to higher re-exports this might
be associated with welfare gains in addition to those resulting from locally produced goods. In that sense,
the welfare gains in the model below, which does not include re-exports, should be thought of as a lower
bound.
  17 In the estimation we add one before taking logs; using Poisson-type regression models does not
change our main results.

i, we cannot follow the usual approach of obtaining region i ’s purchases from itself
as its production minus total exports. Instead, we first run a gravity equation
using all bilateral data on trade between regions i and j. With the coefficient on
distance in hand, the purchase of region i from itself could be estimated by the
predicted value of trade given a zero value of distance. Following the empirical
gravity literature, however, we modify this approach to account for the size of
region i (which is not zero) as its internal distance (see Appendix C).

Turning to the commodity-level trade data, Figure 6 provides some detail on the
                                      17
most important commodities in four regions, as well as a comparison between the
size of domestic and foreign trade at the commodity level. With the exception of
Silk Piece goods out of Canton and Raw Cotton from Shanghai, domestic trade
is larger than foreign trade. Furthermore, foreign trade exceeds domestic trade
in ports other than Shanghai.

The commodity-level trade data is employed to estimate the key parameter θ
from examining price differences across ports. For this purpose we pick 26 com-
modities that are traded between virtually all fifteen regions. These commodities
include coal, matches, as well as cotton goods and cotton yearn. Table B in the
Appendix gives details on these commodities. In Table 2, we show the average

Tianjin, the average price differences are not far from zero. This is consistent
with the hypothesis that for most regions, there are both low-cost and high-cost
products.

                                       B.   Wages


We obtain information on wages in the treaty ports from the Chinese Maritime
Customs’ Decennial Reports, CMC (2001b). These sources cover our fifteen re-
gions over years 1892 to 1921; the director of the customs station in each port
was asked to report typical wages for particular occupations paid in his district.
Occupations include both more and less skilled jobs such as painters, coolies, silk
weavers, and manual laborers. The most frequent records are available for car-
penters. On average, according to these data workers are paid about 390 copper
cash for a day’s of work. This figure is relatively close to the figure of 422 copper
cash wage for a day’s work in the year 1900 cited in Allen et al. ((2009, Appendix
Table 1). Given the relatively small number of 294 wage observations, we have
estimated a region’s wage from a hedonic regression across all ports (including
occupation and year fixed effects). This is discussed further in Appendix A. Av-
erage wages across China’s treaty ports varied to some degree across treaty ports;
                                       19
the lowest wage wi is obtained for Chinkiang at 0.85, the highest for Canton at
1.5. We have examined the robustness of our findings using alternative regional
wages estimated from a subset of the Decennial Reports wage data together with
predictions from a polynomial in longitude and latitude, finding similar results.

                               C.    Labor Force and Gross Product


We estimate the labor force in each region, Li , by applying estimates of the labor
force participation in China from Liu and Yeh (1959) to figures on the Chinese
and foreign population living in each region, from CMC (2001a,b). Our GDP
estimates are equal to the wage bill in each region, estimated as wi Li , plus the
contribution from land, which is estimated based on Perkins (1969). See Appendix
B for details.18

                                    V.    Parameter Estimation


In this section, we present the empirical strategy used to estimate the parameters
of the model. In the first step, we estimate the value of the comparative advantage
parameter, θ. Then, given the latter, we estimate the parameters that capture
each region’s state of technology, Ti , and bilateral geographic barriers, dni .

                                     A.    Comparative Advantage


The model described above provides a simple way of estimating the comparative
advantage parameter, θ. Dividing equation (7) by the equivalent expression for
destination region i, using the price indices and taking logarithms, one can show
that:
                                                                          
                                         Xni /Xn                    pi dni
(11)                            ln                     = −θln
                                         Xii /Xi                     pn
  18 We employ Perkins’ (1969) estimates of the value of provincial agricultural production across thirteen
products, and use data on the fraction of people living in each region i relative to total provincial
population to apportion a fraction of provincial land income to each region.
                                                       20
We use data on aggregate bilateral trade flows and relative prices for each region
pair to recover a simple method-of-moments estimate of θ. The left-hand side
of (11) is the (log of) the share of region n’s expenditure on region i’s goods
(normalized by region i’s share).19

The bilateral trade flows data provide a measure of that dependent variable.

The right-hand-side of (11) requires more discussion. The logarithmic term, which
is not directly observable, depends on the relative price indices of regions n and
i, and the size of geographic barriers between the two regions, dni . We construct
a proxy for that term, Dni , based on the prices of individual commodities in each
port mentioned above:

                                                            J
                                                            X rni (j)
(12)                         Dni = max2j {rni (j)} −
                                                                    J
                                                            j=1


where max2j indicates the second highest value across all J commodities and
rni ≡ lnpn (j) − lnpi (j). The intuition behind the first term comes from the
model: a buyer from region n can always purchase any good j from region i at
the effective price pi (j)dni . Thus, pn (j) cannot be higher than that effective price,
making dni the upper bound (max) of the relative price between regions n and
i. The second term in (12) captures the relative price indices part in (11). We
use the second highest value across all goods to avoid the potential bias from
measurement error for the prices of certain commodities.

Using the proxy given in (12), the method-of-moments estimation procedure yields
a value of the comparative advantage parameter of θ = 18.7.20 This estimate is
higher than the preferred estimate of 8.28 of Eaton and Kortum (2002) for OECD
countries in 1990, from a range of estimates between 3.60 and 12.86. Alternatively,
one can add an error to (11) and estimate θ with data on prices and distance in an

  19 We only use region pairs where n 6= i. For the case n = i, equation (11) is an identity. With data
on 15 regions, we end up with a total of 210 observations.
  20 We have examined how this estimate varies given our set of commodities, finding that it is quite
robust to dropping individual items from our list of 26 commodities.
                                                  21
OLS regression; using this approach we obtain θ = 13.9.21 Overall this suggests
that China’s regional diversity in productivity across goods around the year 1900
was relatively small compared to other settings. This will be important for our
analysis of welfare gains from trade.

                          B.    Technology and Geography Parameters


Armed with an estimate of the comparative advantage parameter θ, we proceed
to estimate the remaining parameters of the model, namely the parameters that
capture regional technology, Ti , and geographic barriers, dni . As in Eaton and
Kortum (2002), the model implies that

                                         0
                                      X
(13)                                ln 0ni = Si − Sn − θlndni
                                      Xnn

where

                                0
(14)                      lnXni ≡ lnXni − [(1 − β)/β] ln (Xi /Xii )


and

                                               1
(15)                                   Si ≡      lnTi − θlnwi
                                               β

Equation (15) provides a measure of a region’s competitiveness, Si , defined as its
technology adjusted for labor costs. As for the geographic barriers in (13), they
are modeled as follows:

                                      6
                                      X
                                                              1     2
(16)                       ln dni =          db DISTb + mn + δni + δni
                                      b=1


where DISTb takes the value 1 if the distance between regions n and i lies in
   21 Eaton and Kortum consider the estimate based on (11) as their preferred estimate; in our case, this
is θ = 18.7. For comparison, Donaldson (2015) estimates θ = 5.2 across 85 commodities in colonial India.
                                                   22
the interval b = 1, ...6, and takes the value zero otherwise, and mn captures
destination effects.22 The last two terms in (16) capture all other unobserved
                                                                1 ) and two-way
geographic barriers between regions n and i affecting one-way (δni
  2 ) trade.
(δni

Combining (13) and (16) yields:

                        0                            6
                      Xni                   X
                                                            1      2
(17)             ln    0  = Si − Sn − θmn −   θdb DISTb − θδni − θδni
                      Xnn
                                                    b=1



Adding a regression error, equation (17) is our estimation equation. The de-
pendent variable is based on aggregate bilateral trade data between the ports,
and we assume that β, the cost share of labor, is 0.36. From equation (17), the
competitiveness measures are estimated as region-specific dummies. The one-way
and two-way unobserved barriers introduce heteroskedasticity and correlation be-
tween the errors of different region-pair observations (i.e., the error terms of the
equations for the pairs (n, i ) and (i, n) have non-zero correlation). Thus, we
estimate this regression by generalized least squares.

Note that the coefficients on the distance bins and destination effects are not
separately identified from the comparative advantage parameter, θ. However,
given our estimate of the latter from above, we can identify those coefficients to
obtain the geographic barriers parameters, dni . Finally, with data on wages and
the estimated values of each region’s competitiveness, Si , we use (15) to recover
the technology parameters, Ti .

Table 3 presents the estimation results for the competitiveness measure and the
implied values of the technology parameters. The table shows that Shanghai is the
most competitive of the 15 regions, with the second highest state of technology,
only surpassed by Swatow that, due to its relatively higher wages, loses part of

   22 The distance intervals (in miles) we use are as follows: [0,200); [200,400); [400,600), [600,800);
[800,1000); [1000, maximum]. We also explore other specifications with polynomials of the log of distance
instead of the distance dummies, finding similar results.
                                                   23
its competitiveness. The result that Shanghai is highly competitive conforms well
with its export level, which is twice that of Tianjin even though the two ports
are roughly equal in size (see Table 1). Also interesting is the case of Canton
(Guangzhou); while the port is third in terms of technology, it ranks 10th in
terms of competitiveness due to the high wages in that region.

Table 4 presents the estimation results for the distance and destination dummies
in (17), as well as the implied percentage effect of each particular barrier on
costs. As can be seen in the table, costs increase with distance, although not in a
monotonic way. In the lower part of the table, we see that exporting to Shanghai
costs 48% less than exporting to the average region, while exporting to Ichang
increases costs by 112% relative to the average region.
With these parameter estimates in hand, we are now ready to perform a number
of counterfactual analyses.

parameters. In particular, we explore the welfare effects of: 1) increases in the
state of technology of specific ports; and 2) lower trade costs across the board.
In all cases, our measure of welfare is real GDP.

Table 5 presents the results from changes in the state of technology of specific
ports, Ti . We start with an increase of 20% in the state of technology of the biggest
port, Shanghai, holding everything else in the model constant. An increase of 20%

Note: Shown are the welfare effects of increasing either Shanghai’s (first half) of Hankow’s (second half)
technology parameter (Ti ) by 20%. Columns 2 and 4 show the percentage change in welfare relative to
the baseline (where technology parameters are those given in Table 3). Columns 3 and 5 show the same
welfare changes relative to the welfare gain in the port whose technology parameter increases.




is reasonable given that the operation of customs by the CMC brought with it
a wide range of improvements, such as dredging of the harbor, new lighthouses,
increased protection from pirates, and the customs process itself. The first column
reports the percentage change in welfare at each port derived from this increase in
Shanghai’s technology. The second column normalizes Shanghai’s welfare change
to 100. The improvement in Shanghai’s productivity leads to a welfare change
in this region of about 1.5%. Importantly, the welfare gains are not confined to
this port. Because of domestic trade, other ports in the vicinity of Shanghai,
such as Ningbo, Chinkiang, and Wuhu also experience significant welfare gains.
Even Swatow, at 1,300 km from Shanghai, experiences around 13% of the welfare
increase of Shanghai. Also noteworthy is the fact that not all regions benefit
from Shanghai’s technology improvement. Because factor costs, income, and
                                   26
production patterns respond endogenously to this change, welfare actually falls
in some ports like the distant Tientsin.

The last two columns present the results of a similar experiment with Hankow’s
technology. The welfare gains in Hankow are similar to those for Shanghai in
the previous experiment. Welfare gains spread to other regions, especially the
ones close to Hankow, but with lower magnitudes than in the case of Shanghai’s
productivity improvement. This is evident by comparing Figures 7 and 8.

In Table 6, we present the results of two experiments involving changes in trade
costs across the board, where we keep all regions’ technology parameters fixed.
We start by lowering trade impediments to half of the original levels underlying
Table 4. This is a drastic reduction of trade barriers which, however, could be
plausible given the introduction of steam ships during the late 19th century. We
see that trade increases by 13% as a result of the lower barriers. Welfare gains,
however, are unevenly distributed across ports, and some regions, in particular

Shanghai and Ningbo, experience welfare losses.

The reason for this lies in the reallocation of production and trade. The intuition
is that lower trade barriers across the board diminish the advantage that Shanghai
has based on its technology. More generally, notice that the four regions with the
lowest welfare gains due to lower trade barriers are Shanghai, Ningbo, Chefoo, and
Swatow, which are the four regions with the highest level of labor-cost adjusted
technology (or competitiveness, see Table 3). For all competitive exporters, lower
trade barriers means that they might not be any longer the low-cost source of
supply for some importing regions, relative to slightly less competitive regions
that are located geographically closer. If a competitive exporter ceases to serve
a particular region, this is a movement in the direction of autarky, and welfare
falls.

The difference between the more strongly negative welfare effects in Shanghai
and Ningbo, compared to Swatow and Chefoo, turns on their geographic loca-
                                  28
tion. Shanghai and Ningbo are centrally located close to the Yangzi Delta. This
means that before the reduction of trade barriers, given their high level of com-
petitiveness they exported to many other locations, and the reduction in trade
barriers has the potential that they lose their status of low-cost supplier in several
importing regions. In contrast, Chefoo and Swatow are located in geographically
more remote parts of China, North and South, respectively. They lose some mar-
kets as the result of the lower trade barriers, but they hold on to others due
to their geographic remoteness. As a consequence, Chefoo and Swatow lose less
than Shanghai and Ningbo. Generally, we find that geography, rather than wage
differences play the major role in determining the distribution of welfare effects
from trade cost reductions. This can be seen from computing the welfare effects
of a 50% trade cost reduction under the assumption that wages across ports are
equal. It turns out that this leads to almost the same welfare effects of the trade
cost reduction as with wages differing across ports (correlation greater than 0.99).

In the second half of Table 6 we experiment with a more extreme reduction
in geographic barriers from the baseline to zero-gravity (setting all trade cost
coefficients to virtually dni = 1). As a result, overall trade increases more than
in the previous case, although the increase remains with 54% relatively modest.
The distribution of welfare gains gives the same pattern as before.

The welfare gains arise with lower trade costs because most regions spend more
of their total expenditure on imports, rather than their own production. Indeed,
one can show that given θ, the share a region imports is a sufficient statistic for
the welfare effect of a change in trade costs: if the import share goes up, welfare
rises, and vice versa (see Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare 2013). The change in a
region’s import share as the result of lower trade costs is shown in Figure 9 for all
fifteen regions. On average, the import share goes up by twenty-six percentage
points. The largest increase is in Amoy, where the import share goes from 15%
to a staggering 82%, or sixty-seven percentage points. In contrast, the import
share falls by nine percentage points in Shanghai, and this move towards autarky

is the reason why welfare falls in Shanghai.
In the following we examine these findings along a number of dimensions.

Changes over time The results so far are based on trade between these regions
in the year 1904. Given that China’s domestic trade grew substantially since the
first treaty ports were opened, it is interesting to compare our results with those
for an earlier year.23 Striking a balance between obtaining a similar sample and a
substantial time difference, we pick the year 1879 where we have trade data for all
but one of the fifteen treaty ports in the 1904 sample (Kiaochow is not present in
  23 For example, locally produced exports to other Chinese regions of two of the largest treaty ports,
Hankow and Shanghai, grew by 5.2% and 3.1% annually between 1879 and 1904 in, respectively (based
on CMC 2001a), Vols. 8 and 39).

1879). Comparing the geographic barriers estimated with the 1879 versus the 1904
trade flows, Figure 10 shows that trade barriers were between 3 and 9 times higher
in the earlier period. This result is consistent with the increase in trade that took
place over these twenty five years. Despite this, we find that many of our 1904
results carry over to the earlier period with higher trade barriers. In particular,
the welfare changes resulting from a 20% improvement in Shanghai’s technology
are similar based on 1879 and 1904 trade data (with a correlation of 0.86 across
14 ports).24 Employing trade data for fifteen ports from the year 1899, we find
the results to be similar to 1904; for example, the correlation between the welfare
changes across ports resulting from a 20% increase in Shanghai’s technology is
close to 0.99 for the 1899 versus 1904 trade data.


Mobile labor between sectors In our baseline estimation we assume that labor is
immobile between the manufacturing and non-manufacturing sector. To assess

  24 We find greater differences for the trade cost reduction counterfactuals; this is due to the different
baseline geographic trade barriers, as shown in Figure 10.

the importance of this for our results we have also considered the mobile labor
case. First, a 50% reduction of all trade costs results in a 11% increase of trade,
compared to 13% with immobile labor. This reduction in the trade response is due
to the fact that mobile labor gives another margin of adjustment, and less needs to
be achieved through trade. Aggregate welfare gains are larger with mobile labor,
although the distribution of welfare gains across ports is quite similar. These
results suggest that while immobile labor is the conservative assumption in terms
of welfare gains from lower trade costs, it does not drive our main findings.


Wage and GDP estimation We have also examined the role of our wage and
GDP estimation for the results by experimenting with a number of alternative
estimates.25 In all cases the empirical findings in the counterfactuals were very
close to the baseline analysis above.

   25 In particular, we have added geographically interpolated wages for some missing locations. We have
also increased the share of non-labor factors in GDP.

                           VI.   Concluding discussion


In this paper we provide estimates of a general-equilibrium trade model for China
in the year 1904, employing a new, commodity-level dataset for fifteen major
treaty ports. We show that the welfare effects of trade depend critically on each
port’s productivity, China’s economic geography via trade costs, and the degree
of regional diversity in production. Domestic trade frictions are estimated to be
substantial, far from the frictionless world that is commonly assumed. More-
over, geographic barriers loom large in shaping the welfare gains from technology
improvements and trade cost reductions.

There are two main findings. First, we find that a change in productivity for any of
the ports has effects throughout China. Specifically, a 20% increase in Shanghai’s
productivity raises welfare in Shanghai by about 1.5%; because of trade, however,
welfare increases not only in Shanghai but also in other regions. For example, the
welfare increase at a 1,300 kilometers distance away from Shanghai, in Swatow, is
still 13% of the welfare increase due to the improvement in technology in Shanghai.
Since trade diminishes smoothly over geographic space, whether between two
treaty ports or between treaty port and hinterland, these results suggest that
technology improvements or trade cost reductions in treaty ports may have had
a positive welfare effect on large portions of China. Furthermore, because factor
costs, income, and production patterns respond endogenously, welfare in some
ports can actually fall, as it does in the relatively distant Tianjin. The endogenous
reallocations of production and trade also explain the negative welfare effects we
find for some ports like Shanghai and Ningbo when trade impediments are reduced
across the board.

Second, we find evidence of relatively small regional diversity in productivity
across goods for China during the Treaty Port Era, at least in comparison with
that found in high-income countries of the late 20th century. Since differences in
productivity across goods – comparative advantage – is the source of the gains
                                     33
from trade in our framework, this provides a rationale for the aggregate size of
welfare gains from internal trade we find for China in this historical period.

Wages are obtained as a mean residual, by port, from an OLS regression on oc-
cupation fixed effects, year fixed effects, length of work time fixed effects (hour,
month, year), currency fixed effects. The wage for Hankow and Foochow is es-
timated as the prediction from a regression of observed wages on latitude and
longitude. The following, Table 7, shows the different occupations that are avail-
able from the Decennial Reports.

                Appendix B: Labor force and gross product data


To obtain figures for the labor force of each region, we employ the average of
the population estimates of the Decennial Reports (CMC 2001b) for 1901 and
1911; there are separate estimates for the Chinese and the foreign population,
which we add together. We apply Liu and Yeh’s estimate of national labor force

participation in 1933 of 51.8% to obtain regional labor forces, Li (Liu and Yeh
1965, p. 182). The wage estimates from Appendix A times these labor forces
yield a region’s wage income, wi Li .

Recall that our regions are defined on the basis of the customs districts of the
treaty ports. While the ports were of central importance, it would be an over-
statement to treat the customs districts as exclusively urban areas. In order to
capture the large contribution of agriculture to China’s gross product at this time,
we estimate the gross product of each region by augmenting the wage income wi Li
with an estimate of the region’s agricultural production, based on Perkins (1969).

The value of agricultural production in each province is estimated for the years
1914-1918 from data on acreage for barley, corn, cotton, fiber (including jute,
hemp, ramie, and flax), millet, peanuts, rice, sesame, sorghum, soybeans, sug-
arcane, tobacco, and wheat (Perkins 1969, Appendix C); yield data for these
crops, see Perkins 1969, Appendix D, and crop prices given in Perkins (1969,
Table D.31). Given the value of agricultural production in each province, pi Qi ,
we estimate each region i’s agricultural production, pi Qi , as pi Qi = si × pp Qp ,
where si is the fraction of region i’s population of the population in the province
in which region i is located. The gross product of region i, Yi = wi Li + λ × pi Qi ,
with λ = 1.1 in the baseline analysis. We have confirmed that our main findings
are not sensitive to choosing other reasonable values for λ (results available upon
request).

                       Appendix C: Purchases-from-self


The expenditures of region i on production of i are not observed. We there-
fore estimate a gravity equation regression of bilateral trade flows on a set of
standard gravity covariates to predict the value of each port’s consumption of its
own goods. These covariates include bilateral distance, the origin and destination
ports’ respective population sizes, and a dummy variable indicating the destina-
tion port’s location on the Yangtze River. Values for each of these variables are
                                       41
for 1904; however, estimates are also produced including additionally data for the
years 1895 through 1899. For these estimates which employ multiple years’ worth
of data, a time fixed effect is included. To preserve zero trade flows and maintain
a sufficiently high sample size after taking logarithms, each trade flow value is
increased by one.

Several flexible versions of the gravity equation are employed, including the stan-
dard log-linear gravity equation, a Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood (PPML)
estimator of the gravity relationship, and a PPML estimator possessing squared
and cubed logarithms of distance. Because of the out-of-sample nature of the
predictions, the preferred specifications are ones that are able to most closely fit
the relation between bilateral trade flows and distance between ports, i.e., those
specifications for which the (joint) significance of the coefficient(s) on distance is
suitably high. Finally, each specification is either estimated by pooling the data
across all 15 ports, or individually for each port. To capture a realistic measure
of internal distance within treaty ports dii , five alternative measures of internal
distance from the literature are used for the predictions for purchases-from-self.
These include (with dij denoting the distance between ports i and j):

  1) Wei (1996): dii = 0.25 minj dij ,

  2) Wolf (1997, 2000): dii = 0.50 mean (dij ),
                                                 p
  3) Redding and Venables (2000): dii = 0.33         areai /π ,
                                           p
  4) Head and Mayer (2000): dii = 0.67        areai /π,
                                             √
  5) Helliwell and Verdier (2001): dii = 0.52 areai ,

where areai denotes the area of the prefecture in which the treaty port i is located.
In total, the various specifications and internal distance measures generate 2 x 3
x 2 x 5 = 60 candidate estimates for purchases-from-self for each of the 15 treaty
ports. The preferred estimates are chosen along three dimensions. First, by com-
paring the correlation between predicted bilateral trade flows x̂ij and observed
                                      42
trade flows xij . Estimates with a high correlation do a relatively good job of pre-
dicting actual purchases from other ports. For the second and third dimensions,
two empirical regularities are exploited: the fact that modern large economies
(which in turn tend to be larger exporters) generally have larger magnitudes of
consumption of their own goods than smaller economies in absolute terms, and
that the ratio of exports to purchases-from-self tends to run from around 0.10
for smaller, isolated countries like Australia, to around 0.25 for the U.S., to 0.35
for large countries such as Germany with many close, large trading partners. We
therefore consider as the second dimension the correlation between total trade,
P
  j xij , and predicted self-purchases x̂ii , and the third dimension as the ratio of
                                                 P
total trade to predicted purchases-from-self, j xij /x̂ii . Estimates that perform
well in the second and third dimensions, by having, respectively, a high correlation
and a “reasonable” ratio, perform comparatively well in predicting the relative
magnitude of trade-with-self.

Of the 60 estimates for purchases-from-self, the four best candidate estimates
are chosen upon evincing a high degree of performance in each dimension and
after fitting the distance variable(s) well: when pooling the data across all ports,
they are: i) PPML with a cubic expansion of log distance using Wolf’s (1994)
internal distance and data for 1904, ii) PPML of standard gravity using Helliwell
and Verdier’s (2001) internal distance and data for all six years, iii) PPML of
standard gravity using Head and Mayer’s (2001) internal distance and data for
1904, and with port-level regressions, iv) PPML of standard gravity using Wolf’s
(1994) distance and data for 1904.
