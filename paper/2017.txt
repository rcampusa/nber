               Persistent Trade Effects of Large Exchange Rate Shocks




                                       ABSTRACT




          paper presents a theoretical basis for the argument that large
       This

exchange rate shocks — such as the rise of the dollar from 1980 to 1985 —
may shift historical relationships between exchange rates and trade
flows. We begin with partial models in which large exchange rate fluc-
tuations lead to entry or exit decisions that are not reversed when the
currency returns to its previous level. Then we develop a simple model

of   the feedback from "hysteresis"  trade to the exchange rate itself.
                                      in

Here we see that a large capital inflow, which leads to an initial appre-
ciation, can result in a persistent reduction in the exchange rate
consistent with trade balance.

      The extreme strengtb of the US dollar in the early 1980s has led
 to substantjii   losse. o   mdrket position   by US—bQseci firms.

 Conventional economic wisdom, and conventional econometric estimates,

 suggest that a return of the dollar to more normal levels will, after

 some lag, reverse these losses. Many businessmen are, however, less

 sanguine. They argue that the extent of the dollar's overvaluation has

 been so large and so persistent that in many cases US firms have

 abandoned markets altogether, or foreign firms have entered markets

 that had previously been US preserves. A fall of the dollar to its

 1980 level, they suggest, will not reverse these effects. Once foreign

firms have invested in marketing, R&D, reputation, distribution

networks, etc. they will find it profitable to remain in the market

even at a lower exchange rate. Once US firms have abandoned markets, a

mere return of the exchange rate to former levels will not be enough

to make the expensive recapture of these markets worthwhile. Following

the recent fashion in macroeconomics, we may describe this argument as

the view that there is "hysteresis" in the response of trade to

exchange rates (see in particular Blanchard and Summers 1986).

     Now the conventional, non-hysteretic wisdom on the dynamics of

trade response to exchange rates is based on surprisingly little

systematic analysis. Distributed lags on the exchange rate are

universal in empirical work, and such Concepts as the J-curve are part

of every international economist's vocabulary, yet little attempt has

been made to provide microeconomic foundations for trade dynamics. So

the pessimistic view about the effects of dollar decline cannot be
    dismissed out of hand. It is nol diffcut to imagine that in the

    esence of important sunk cost nnT bicreasing returns, a temporary

    shock to the exchange rate could have a long term impact on

    international trade. In particular, t seems intuitively plausible

    that very large shocks, such as the one we have just gone through, can

    have qualitatively different effects from smaller disturbances.

         The purpose of this paper is to formalize the idea that large

    shocks to the exchange rate can have persistent effects on

    international trade. It builds on a previous paper by one of the

    authors (Baldwin 1986). In that paper a simple model was developed in

    which a foreign firm can enter a domestic market only by incurring a

    once-for—all sunk cost. The paper showed that in this case a temporary

    rise in the exchange rate, if sufficiently large, would induce

    permanent entry by the foreign firm. This entry would shift the

    subsequent relationship between imports and the exchange rate, so that

    even if the exchange rate returned to its previous level the trade

    pattern would not.

         The present paper extends Baldwin (1986) in three ways. First, we
-
    replace   the finite—horizon, perfect-foresight framework of the

    original paper with an indefinite—horizon, stochastic setup. In this

    setup we can impose stationarity on the exchange rate shocks, which

    has the advantage of helping to clarify the meaning of persistence in

    the behavior of trade.

         Second, we examine the aggregated behavior of imports when there

    are many industries subject to potential foreign entry. This is
                                   3

 important to verify that the results of the single-industry case do

not get smoothed away In the aggregate. For example. one might wonder

whether the distinction between large exchange rate shocks and small

is meaningful when there are many sectors, since a strong dollar from

one industry's point of view may seem weak from another's. What we can

show is that the results do not get smoothed away: even in a multi—

industry case, large exchange rate shocks have persistent effects in a

way that small do not.

     Finally, we examine the feedback from entry and exit decisions to

the exchange rate itself. Clearly macroeconomic constraints imply that

a temporary shock to the exchange rate cannot lead to a permanent

trade surplus or deficit, The exchange rate must adjust so as to

preserve interteniporal budget balance. But the nature of this

adjustment needs examining. One view might be that a temporary

overvaluation will automatically be followed by a corrective

undervaluation that restores the intial market positions. We will show

that this is not necessarily the case. In the particular model we
                                                                     /

consider,   a temporary overvaluation is followed by a persistent

reduction in the equilibrium exchange rate, one which is enough to

restore trade balance but not enough to regain lost markets.

     The models presented in this paper are, to say the least, highly

simplified. Furthermore, the approach is resolutely partial

equilibrium. Even where the feedback to the exchange rate is

discussed, we use a quasi—partial, "elasticities" approach to the

balance of payments. We commit these sins for the sake of
tractability, and in the belief that the   key   insights would SUrVIVe   II
  more satisfactory     framework.



1. The single—industry model



     Consider an industry in which there is a single foreign firm that

is capable of supplying the domestic market. It would be possible to

consider the case of oligopoly, but for simplicity we assume that if

the foreign firm chooses to enter it will be a monopolist. The demand

for its product in any period t will be represented in inverse form:



(1) t = D(Xt)


where X is deliveries to the market and P is the price in domestic

currency.



     The foreign firm is assumed to have a constant marginal cost in

terms of its home currency, and to be concerned with profits measured

in that currency. If the firm enters the US market, we can measure its

operating profits as



(2) ''t     EtPtXt —   cX

where Y is operating profits and E is the price of domestic currency

in terms of foreign. If the foreign firm is in the market at all, it
                                        5

 will   choose X so a. : rnainjze \',       so that we C31.   :'e;iesent the
 outcome of this cor1vc'ntona monopoly pricing proher a


 (3)        Y(E)

Clearly    Y will be an   increasing   function of E.

        We next turn to the question of whether the firn wil actually be

in the market. What we will assume is that both getting into the

market and staying there are costly. To get into the market, if the

firm is not already there. requires an investment in marketing,

reputation, distribution, and so on; we summarize all these costs as           a

single entry fee N. If the firm is already in the market, it will

still have to spend something on all these areas to remain there; we

summarize the cost of remaining in the market by a single niaintenanc

cost M. We will assume that N>M: it Costs more to enter a market than

to stay there. The difference between N and N is the sunk cost aspect

of the model, and as we will see is key to the results.

        In any given period, the firm earns a net revenue that is equal

to operating profits less entry or maintenance costs. We can define

net revenue R by



(4) Rt = 0 if the firm chooses not to be in the market



              —
                  Mt if the firm was already in and stays there
                                                 6

                  -
                         if   the firm was out and          gets   in



       Let   us suppose that the firm is risi-—neutrai. Then its objective

 is to maximize the expected present value of net revenue. Assuming a

 constant discount rate 6, this objective is to maximize



 (5) W =



       The firm's strategy depends on the behavior of the exchange rate

E. Later in the paper we will introduce a model in which E's behavior

and the strategies of firms are jointly determined. Initially,

however, we will simply impose the assumption that E is a random

variable, i.i.d. across periods. The value of E will be assumed to be

revealed in each period before the firm makes its decision whether or

not to be in the market.

       The i.i.d. assumption is clearly problematic from an empirical

standpoint. In reality exchange rate levels are clearly highly

serially correlated over time, to such an extent that in monthly data

they are not too far from a random walk. We therefore need to think of

our periods as being quite long. We believe that the basic insights

would go through as long as the exchange rate follows any stationary

process, e.g. an autoregressive one; however, without the i.i.d.

assumption the level of technical difficulty will rise sharply.

      We are now prepared to consider the firm's decision problem. If

were no higher than M, this problem would be very simple: participate
 in the market if and only if the   current   Y(E) exceeds the entr Lost.
Because of the sunk cost aspect, however, entry now puts the firn in a

favorable position in later periods, and this option value needs to be

taken into account. On the other hand, the existence of a maintenance

cost means that the entry decision is not irreversible: the firm must

also take into account the possibility of leaving the market at some

future date.

     To take the various possibilities into account, we can treat this

as a problem of dynamic programming. Consider first a firm that was in

the market last period. It has two options. It can remain in the

market: if it does so, it will have an expected present value



Y(E) - M




where V1 is the expected present value of future revenues of a firm

that was in the market the previous period, evaluated before we know

the exchange rate. Given our i.i.d. assumption on the exchange rate,

   will be a fixed number. Its value is however contingent on the

strategy of the firm, and must be determined simultaneously with that

strategy.

     Alternatively, the firm can drop out of the market. In that case

it realizes no current revenues. But it still has the option of

entering later, so its expected present value Is V0, where V0 is the

expected present value of a firm that was out of the market the

previous period.
                                         8

        Siinflail':.    fi.rr that was out last period w11 have the choice

between       enteiin and staying out.       If   it   entcr;    ts expected present
value    will be


Y(E) —    N   —




whileif it remains out its expected present value will be V0.
    The optimal strategy of the firm should now be apparent. If it
was out of the market last period, it should enter if the current
exchange      rate exceeds a value we can label                 Otherwise it should

stay out. If the firm was in the market last period, it should remain

in unless the exchange rate falls below a value E0. Otherwise the firm

should drop out. The critical exchange rates                    and    are defined

implicitly by the condition of indifference between staying and

moving:



(6) Y(E1) —            VI   =




(7)    \'(E0) — M




        We still need to explain where V1 and V0 come from. The answer is

that they are the true ex ante expected present values of a firm

following the strategy we have just described, when the firm starts

out in or out respectively. Let f(E) be the density function of E.

Then

        To characterize the firm's behavior, it is necessary to solve the

recursive equations (8) and (9) simultaneously with (6) and (7) to

derive      the four variables E1, E0, V, and V0. We have not come up with

any specific examples that prove particularly enlightening. The main

result, however, does not depend on deriving a closed—form solution.

From (6) and (7), we see that



Y(E) — VIE0) = N      — N > 0




Since V(E) is increasing in E, this implies that E1 >
                                                      E0. The exchange
rate that induces entry is higher than the exchange rate that induces

exit.

        The implications of this result can be illustrated using Figure

1. In the figure, we show import volume in this industry as a function

of the exchange rate. The import schedule has two parts. If the firm

is out of the market, imports are zero. This is represented by the

horizontal line along the axis, 00. If the firm is in the market,

imports will be an increasing function of the exchange rate. This is
                                         10

 shown   by the scheduI     TI Now the   point is that there   is a   range of
 exchange rates. fron         to E1, where either schedu].e could apply. If
 the firm is not in   the    market, then as long as the exchange rate does

not go above E1       ;llI   not enter. If it is in the market, then as

 long as the exchange rate does not go below Ef it will stay in. Thus

the level of imports wli depend on history as well as the current

exchange rate.

     Suppose in particular that the distribution of E          is   such that it

usually falls between E and E1, and only rarely lands outside that

range. Then for long stretches imports will either be zero or

fluctuate along II. Occasionally there will be a large exchange rate

shock, leading the firm either to enter or to leave; this will shift

the industry to the other segment of the schedule, leading to what

will appear to be a structural change in the exchange rate—import

relationship.

     Notice that the persistence we find here is not captured by the

simple notion of a lag in the effect of the exchange rate. To see

this, imagine that the exchange rate were to rise from a level between

   and     to a level high enough to induce entry by the firm, then

return to its original level and stay there forever. (With random E,

we will of course not expect this to happen; thus this is purely a

thought experiment). If persistence were simply a matter of a lag, the

level of imports would eventually return to its original level as

well. In this model, however, the level of imports will remain

permanently higher.
                                  111



      We have now seen how large exchange rate shocks can have

 persistent effects in a single industry The next question we address

 is whether the attribution of persistent effects to large shocks

 Continues to make sense when we are concerned with the aggregate

 behavior of a large group of industries with different

 characteristics.



2. Many industries



     When we discuss a single industry, it is natural to think of two

discrete states: the foreign firm is either in or out. When we are

concerned with aggregate imports, however, we must ask whether the

conclusions are going to be softened by the presence of many

industries with different characteristics. One might suppose that

there will always be some industry with a foreign firm just on the

margin of entry, and another industry with a foreign firm just on the

margin of exit. If this were the case, any exchange rate shock would

induce some entry or exit. This would vitiate our point that large

shocks will produce persistent effects that small shocks will not. So

it is important to ask whether the aggregation of many industries will

smooth out the results we derived for the single industry case. What

we wil]. do is show that for one interesting special case the aggregate

behavior will be similar to the behavior we have analyzed for a single

industry. We will then argue that in the more general case the result

will be only somewhat softened by aggregation.
                                         12

       As a starting point we need to specify the space          across   which

industries are to     b- distributed. In      the model of Section 1 we found

that the dynamic behavior of an industry could he summarized by two

values: E1, the minimum exchange rate that will induce foreign entry,

and E0, the maximum exchange rate that will lead to foreign

withdrawal. These values in       turn   depend in a complex way on       underlying
parameters, but for current purposes all that we need to do is

classify industries by the result. Let us, then, represent each

industry as a point in                space, where the coordinates indicate
                           E0, E1
the critical values for that sector.

       Now E0 and E1 may be said loosely to vary across industries for

two reasons. On one side is what we may think of as comparative

advantage. For industries where foreign firms have low costs relative

to domestic competitors, we might expect both E0 and E1 to be low; for

industries where foreign firms have high costs, both would tend to be

high. To the extent that it is differences in comparative advantage

that mostly dominate the spread among industries, we would expect to

find that E1 and E0 were positively correlated. On the other side,

industries may vary in the degree to which their entry costs are sunk

——   the   effect captured by   the   difference N -   M   in our single industry

example. If industries had similar comparative advantage positions but

were very different in sunkness, we would expect to find                  and E1

negatively correlated: easy-in, easy—out "contestable" industries

would have both high        and low E1.
         What we will do is concentrate firs' cn      the case where
 comparative advantage        is dominant. Specifically,   we will assume that
 if one iliduEtry has a higher E0 than another, it         also has a higher E.
 This    implies that it is possible to assign an index z to industries
 such   that E0 and         are both increasing functions of z. For

simplicity let us further assume that these functions are continuous.

        The resulting situation is illustrated in Figure 2. The axes of

the figure represent the Lo and E1 specific to each industry. Given

our special assumption, the distribution of industry characteristics

lies along an upward—sloping line like ZZ. Each point on that line

corresponds to a particular industry. Note that ZZ lies everywhere to

the left of the 45 degree line. This reflects the fact that
                                                            E1 >
always, which in turn as we saw reflects the sunk cost assumption that

N > N.

        In   each of these industries the foreign firm may be in or out,

depending on the past history of the industry. There is, however, an

eauillbrium      configuration   which, once established, will be maintained
over time,      it    is the following: in all industries with   z less than
some value           the foreign firm will be in, while in all industries

with z greater than I the foreign firm will be out. Once this

configuration is established, the effect of exchange rate shocks can

be wholly summarized by shifts in I. That is, the state of the whole

import sector will be summarized by a single number representing the

range of goods in which foreign firms are present.
                                            14


      To    see that    this configuration will in      fact   be seif-eplicating,

we   examine the geometr:        of   Figure 2.   Suppose that initia1y     the
borderline industry is represented by the point A; in Zi those
industries corresponding to points on ZZ to the southwest of A the
foreign firm is in the market, while in all the industries to the
northeast of A the foreign firm is not in. ow jet there be an actual
realization of the exchange rate, which we can represent as a point on
the 45     degree    line.
      Clearly       there art   three possibilities. First, suppos the
exchange rate falls between              and C. Then E is less than E1 for

industry A, and hence also less for all the industries to the

northeast of A. So no foreign firms enter. At the same time, E exceeds

E0 for A, and hence for all industries to the southwest of A. So no

foreign firms exit either.

       Second, suppose that the realized E is above C,             say at   C'. Then

additional       foreign firms will enter, up to the industry corresponding
to A' .    No   firms will exit. So the form of the configuration will

remain     the same, but the location of the marginal industry will have

shifted.

       Finally,      suppose    that the exchange rate is realized at a level

below B. The case will be symmetrical to the second case: the form of

the configuration will be retained, but the margin will shrink in.

      What is important to note is that even though there is a

continuous      distribution of industries in terms of the exchange rates

that will make foreign firms enter or exit, it is not the case that
                                  15

 there is always a firm on the margin of entry or the margin of exit.

 On the contrary, there will always be a range of exchange rates for

 which no firn either enters or exits. Thus when the marginal firm is

A, the exchange rate range BC leads to neither entry nor exit.

 Geometrically, this range of no change exists because ZZ lies to the

 left of the 45 degree line. This in turn, as we have already noted,

reflects the presence of sunk costs.

     We have now seen that the dynamic behavior of a group of

industries can, under these special assumptions, be reduced to changes

in the location of the marginal industry. The next question is whether

the behavior of the aggregate of a group of industries will still show

the same kind of persistence as each individual industry. As our

measure of the aggregate, we will focus on the total value of imports

from all industries.

     It is clear that the total value of imports, which we will denote

as T, will depend not only on the exchange rate but on the range of

goods in which foreign firms are present. Thus



(10) T =   T(E,)


Depending on the demand functions, T,'aE may be either positive or

negative; for our diagrams we will draw it as positive. Clearly,

however, T will be an increasing function of .

    Now consider a case parallel to that which we used to examine

persistence for a single industry. Suppose that in Figure 2 the
                                     IC

exchange rate usually lies in the range P'C.    Then if   the marginal

industry Ic A. the economy may go on for a time without any change in

the range of industries     in which foreign firms participate. As long as

this   is the case,   there will appear to be a stable relationship

between the value of imports and the exchange rate. This relationship

is illustrated as AA in Figure 3.

       But now suppose that one period's exchange rate happens to lie

outside BC, say at C'. We already know what happens: the marginal

industry shifts to A', so that      rises. If the exchange rate then

returns to DC, this shift will not be reversed. The effect will be to

shift the import—exchange rate relationship up, to A'A' in Figure 3.

The economy may then fluctuate for a time along this new schedule. It

will appear as if the economy has experienced a structural change.

       This scenario is clearly very similar to what we saw in Figure 1.

The main difference is that AA and A'A' are not the only two possible

schedules in E,T space. There is in fact a continuum of schedules,

each corresponding to a different . Some of these schedules will be

sustainable only by exchange rates that occur only rarely, and the

economy will not usually remain on these schedules more than one

period. If sunk costs are large enough, however, there will be a wide

range of , and correponding import schedules, that will tend to

persist as long as the exchange rate falls in its normal range. The

typical behavior of the economy will be to stay on any one schedule

for a while, until a large exchange rate shock pushes it "off the

edge" onto a different schedule. Thus the exchange rate—import

      To derive this result we have      relied   on an assumption about the
 distribution   of industries, namel;, that
                                                  Lo and E1 move strictly
 together. To conclude this section. we ask whether aggregate imports

would still show this kind of behavior with a more general

distribution of industry characteristics.

     Let us try to answer this by sneaking up on the issue. First,

lets suppose that there are two groups of industries, 1 and 2. each

of which can be represnted by an upward-sloping schedule in
                                                                    E0, L
space. In Figure 4 we show these groups of industries as
                                                                 Z121 and
      The fact that industry group 2's schedule lies further from the

45 degree line than industry group .s indicates that sunk Costs are

more important for 2.

     What can we say about the behavior of these two groups'? Both will

exhibit some persistence of effects of large exchange rate changes.

This effect will be more pronounced for group 2, where larger shocks

will be needed to shift the marginal industry. The difference will

complicate the description of dynamics. since we need to keep track of

two margins instead of one. Clearly, however, we will still be

justified in saying that in the aggregate the whole import side

exhibits persistent effects of large shocks.

     If we can have two groups of industries, however, we can have

more. Thus we can approximate a two—dimensional distribution of

industries in E0, E1 space as finely as we like by a series of
                                         18

parallel        lines. The wore lines, the more complex   the   detail   of the

dynamics , but the       b   pc:1flt will not change
       We   have seen then. that      the peculiar behavior we   have    derived
for a single industry will not in general get averaged away in the

aggregate. When we begin to consider large aggregates, however, our

assumption of an exogenous distribution for the exchange rate begins

to become suspect. e would expect there to be some feedback from the

entry and exit decisions of firms to the exchange rate itself ——              if
only because a country must sooner or later pay its way in

international trade. The final step, then, must be to try to model

this feedback.



3. Feedback to the exchange rate



       To allow for feedback to the exchange rate it will be useful to

simplify the assumed structure of the economy in a somewhat different

way from that in the last section. We now assume that there are two

kinds of sectors: normal sectors, where none of these dynamic issues

apply, and hysteretic sectors, where they do. For the normal sectors

there will be a static relationship between trade flows and the

exchange rate. We will simply summarize everything that goes on in

these sectors by a reduced form relationship between the exchange rate

and the balance of trade,



(11)        =
       Bt       B(Et)
                                    19




          will assume that there is a large group of hysteretic import

 sectors that are all perfectly symmetrical, i.e., that all have the

 same entry and maintenance costs, face the same demand, and have the

 same marginal cost. (There is no reason why could not also have export

 sectors where domestic firms enter or leave: we Concentrate on imports

 as an arbitrary choice among alternative simplificatjons). This allows

us to concentrate on the analysis of a representative sector. It also

 lets us summarize the effects of past history by a sin1e number f,

the fraction of these industries in which the foreign firm is in the

market. The total value of imports from these sectors will depend on

both the exchange rate and f:



(12) Tt =
            T(Et,ft)                                                   -




     In   order to assess the feedback from trade to the exchange rate.

we need a model of exchange rate determination. The approach we will

take has two virtues: it is simple, and it forces the economy to

balance its trade in the long run. The vices of the approach will be

immediately apparent and no doubt infuriating to those who worry

seriously about exchange rate determination. We look forward to the

day when our points can be made in a less ad hoc way.

     Our basic approach is a partial equilibrium, elasticities one,

modified to take account of capital flows. Interest payments on past

debt accumulations are ignored, so that the condition of balance of

payments equilibrium is
                                 20




(13) t -      —       =0


where K is net capital inflow.

     Now comes the awful part: we will assume that K is an i.i.d.

random variable. That is, random shocks to the capital account will be

the forcing variable that generates exchange rate movement and the

entry and exit of firms. The only justification for this approach is

its usefulness, which will soon become apparent.

     The exchange rate must move to balance payments. We can express

the exchange rate as a function of net capital inflow and the fraction

of foreign firms that have entered import markets:



(14) Et =   E(Ktft)

with the exchange rate increasing in both arguments.

     Now let us consider the problem of a representative foreign firm.

We assume the following timing: at the beginning of a period the size

of net capital inflows K is revealed. Then all firms decide

simultaneously whether to enter or exit. Finally, the exchange rate

and everything else gets determined.

     Suppose that a foreign firm is not in the market, and considers

entry. In the current period it will earn V(E) — N, where E depends on

both K and the number of other firms that enter. Having entered, it

will also have an expected present value next period. In contrast to
                                       21

 the case we considered ir Section 1, however, the expected present

value V1 will not in genera be constant over time, even though K is

assumed i.i.d. . The reason is that the number of firms feeds back to

the exchange rate, and thus the number of firms in the market by the

end of this period affects the expected value of being in the market

in the future. We must, then. think of a function
                                                        V1(f)
Correspondingly, a firm that is not in the market has an expected

  '::'
         .V0(f)
         Take the functions \',(f) and V0(f) as given for a moment. Then

the decision problem of a firm may be written as follows. A firm that

is out will enter if



Y(E(K,f)) —       N
                      &V1(f) >



A firm that is in will exit if




Y(E(K,f)) — M         V1(f) < &V0(f)


     Now suppose that at the end of the previous period the number of

firms was             Clearly there is a range of current values of K that

will lead no firms either to enter or exit. If K lies above this

range, firms will enter until there is no incentive for more to enter;

if K lies below this range, firms will exit until they are indifferent

between staying or leaving. Let K1(f) and K0(f) be the critical values

for entering and leaving the market. Notice that these are functions,
                                                 22

not    fixed values. These functions may be defined implicitly by the
entry and e:i t cond Uons


(15) Y(E(K1(f),f)) —         N   —
                                     V1(f)   =
                                                  SV0(f)


(16) Y(E(J0(f),f)) —         M       '1(f) =

       The law of motion for f can then be described as follows:



(17)        =        if N(f) <               <




       K.(f)        Mt if Mt >       Ki(f_1)

                =
                    Kt   it Mt <     Ko(ft_i)

       We   will turn to     the interpretation of (17) in a moment. First,

however, we need to ask where the expected value functions V1(f) and

V0(f) come from. The answer, of course, is that they must be

determined simultaneously with the entry and exit functions K1(f) and

K0(f). We can imagine the following computational procedure. Start

with a guess at the functions V1(f) and V0(f). This will enable us to

solve (15) and (16), and thus to compute the behavior described in

(17). Once we have done this, however, we can ask what the expected

present value of a firm would actually be for any given f. We can then

use this computed function as a new guess at the expected present
value functions, and repeat. Art equilibrium will be a fixed ptint     of
this computational process. This is an equilibrium defined a. i     fixed
point in function space rather than in price space -— a concept that

has been widely used in the work of Robert Lucas (see

Lucas (1981)). We will not attempt here to prove existence, let alone

uniqueness. Instead, we simply suppose that the functions V1(f) and

V0(f) can be determined, and that we therefore do in fact   end un with
the   dynamics described by (17).

      Now we turn to trying to make sense of these dynamics. Here we

can use essentially the same trick we used in Section 2, in a somewhat

different space. A particular value of        has associated with it

values K1(f) and Ko(fti), the exchange rates that will induce

entry and exit respectively. It seems obvious that both will be

increasing in ft_i: the more firms in the market, the lower the

exchange rate for any given 1< and thus the higher the K needed to

induce entry or deter exit. Thus we can represent the range of

possible values of        as an upward—sloping line in K0, K1 space.

This is illustrated as FF in Figure 5. Each point on FF has a value of

      associated with it. Also, FF must lie to the left of the 45

degree line, because K1 >
                            K0: a larger capital inflow is needed to
induce entry than to deter exit. Finally, parallel to our technique in

Section 2, we can represent a realization of the actual capital inflow

as a point on the 45 degree line.

      From this point the analysis is exactly parallel. Suppose that we

start with a number of foreign firms in the market corresponding to
                                          24

point A in     Figure     .   Then a capital inflow in the range BC will not

ied either       to   elitry or exit. A large capita] inf1o. however, such as

C' ,   will   lead additional foreign firms to enter. By examining (17). we

see that foreign firms will enter to exactly the extent that no more

would enter if the capital inflow remained at exactly the same level;

in other words, 1' will shift up to the level that corresponds to A'.

If the capital inflow then falls to the range BC, the new, increased

number of foreign firms in the market will persist. We can thus

imagine that for stretches of time there will be a stable number of

foreign firms in the market, but that at intervals that number will be

shifted by large capital inflows or outflows.

       The interesting question, however, is what this says about the

behavior bf the exchange rate. As long as the number of firms in the

market remains fixed. the exchange rate will have a static

relationship with the capital inflow, fluctuating around some mean. A

large inflow (outflow) will at first produce a large appreciation

(depreciation). If the capital flow then returns to its initial value,

however, the exchange rate will not. Instead, following a large

capital inflow that provokes entry by foreign firms the exchange rate

will tend to fall below its original level. We can see this by noting

that f will rise, and this will tend to worsen the trade balance for

any given exchange rate.

       The implied behavior of the exchange rate is illustrated in

Figure 6. For stretches of time the exchange rate will appear to

fluctuate around a constant mean. Then a large capital inflow or

It wj scent as if the initial exchange rate shock has produced a
structural change that permanently lowers or raises the normal leve]
of   the exchange rate ——   until the next. large shock.
      The implications    of this ana]ysis, if it is at       all relevant to

the current US situation, are obvious. Massive capital inflows pushed

the dollar to very high levels in the early 1980s. If this was indeed,

as businessmen believe, a "large" shock that leads to entry by foreign

firms (and by extension, exit by US firms) the dollar in subsequent

years can be expected to fluctuate around a level that is persistently

lower than that of the 1970s.



4. Concluding remarks



      In this paper, as in Baldwin (1986), we have presented simple

models (although with fancy equilibrium concepts) designed to clarify

our thinking rather than to be realistic. We can see from the models

that there is a reasonable case to be made for persistent trade

effects of large exchange rate shocks in the presence of sunk fixed

costs, and that this kind of trade persistence is not simply a kind of

lag in the response to the exchange rate. We hope that even this step

will help encourage economists to take the notion of hysteresis in

international trade seriously. Clearly, however, the next step must be

to make the analysis more operational. In our view, this will involve

three main tasks.
                                   26

     The first ta     i   to make the models mor   reasonable   at a micro

level. We would    ]ikF to dispense with the Lid, assumption about th&
distribution of shocks, and in general sand away the rough edges of

the models to the point where they look as though they might apply to

actual industries. As recent work in the application of industrial

organization models to trade has demonstrated (flixit 1986; Baldwin and

Krugman 1986; Venables and Smith 1986), this will not be easy. The

truth is that the existing models of indutrial organization can be

made to look like real industries only by a Procrustean effort of

model modification. This is true even of static certainty models; it

will be even more true of the dynamic uncertainty models that are

vital here.

     The second task is to get the macroeconomic linkages better

specified. We are of course concerned about our ad hoc exchange rate

approach, although we speculate that the results will not be too much

changed by a better mode here. Perhaps more important is the

modelling of investment decisions and the cost of capital. In the

models of this paper. entry and exit decisions are in effect invisible

investment decisions. Properly speaking, a decision to enter a market

is a kind of investment; a decision to abandon a market amounts to

capital consumption. If it is wrong to ignore feedback from trade to

the exchange rate, it is probably also wrong to ignore feedback to the

cost of capital.

    Finally, we need some idea of how important these effects really

are in practice. Here the problem is one of both technique and data.
                                       27

The dynamic effects r      model   are not captured by tlie usual econometric
assumptions thdt behavior can be represented by rontinuous functions
and a fixed structure of leads and lags. Thus uncunveiitional
statistical    techniques, and perhaps a reliance on case—study—like

evidence, may be necessary. Furthermore, it is at least suggested by

our models that very large data sets may be required. Suppose that

really big exchange rate shocks occur only once a generation. Then

long time series may show a stable relationship between exchange rates

and trade ——   yet   that relationship may change abruptly when a large

shock does hit. When it seems plausible that this generation's one big

shock has just happened, this is a disquieting thought.

     In sum, then, the analysis presented here needs a great deal of

extension. We hope, however, that we have shown that the businessmen's

pessimism about the effects of a decline in the dollar is not

necessarily bad economics, and that we had better not be complacent

about the stability of econometric estimates of trade behavior.
