The Politics of FDI Expropriation

                                            ABSTRACT

I examine the role of political instability as a potential explanation for the lack of capital flows
from rich countries to poor countries (i.e. the `Lucas Paradox'). Using panel data from 1984 to
2014, I document the following: (i) developed countries exhibit larger inflows of foreign direct
investment (FDI), (ii) countries subject to high investment risk are those that typically receive
low FDI inflows, and (iii) investment risk is generally higher in fractionalized and politically
unstable economies. These findings suggest a negative relationship between political instability
and FDI through the investment risk channel. I then inspect the theoretical mechanism using a
dynamic political-economy model of redistribution, wherein policymakers have access to an
expropriation technology that can be used to extract resources from foreign investors. The
proceeds are used to finance group-specific transfers to domestic workers, but hinder economic
growth by discouraging FDI. Different social groups compete to gain control of this instrument,
but face a probability of losing power at each point in time. The greater the degree of political
turnover is, the stronger the incentives to expropriate when in power. A key force driving this
result is redistributive uncertainty, since there is a possibility that no transfers will be received in
the future. The mechanism is supported by the finding that investment risk (a measure that
captures the degree to which the extraction technology is used) is negatively related to FDI and
government stability. Finally, I show that the political equilibrium exhibits over-expropriation
and under-investment even when there is no political uncertainty because fractionalized societies
suffer from static inefficiencies due to the presence of a common pool problem.

1     Introduction
Even though the return of foreign direct investment is potentially large in many countries
at the stage of development (for example, the opening up of Eastern Europe provided
advantages to multinational firms due to the low cost of labor, low levels of capital in place,
and the proximity to major markets), the flow of direct investment is heavily concentrated
in a small set of countries.1 Lucas (1990) suggested that this lack of FDI could be due to the
fact that many developing countries face higher political risk than industrialized ones, but
disregarded the empirical importance of political risk by focusing mostly on the pre-1945
colonial experience as case studies.2 In this paper, I revisit his hypothesis by examining
the role of political risk (due to fractionalization and/or political instability) as a potential
deterrent of FDI inflows. Using panel data from 1984 to 2014, I document three stylized
facts: (i) developed countries exhibit larger inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI), (ii)
countries subject to high investment risk are those that typically receive low FDI inflows, and
(iii) investment risk is generally higher in fractionalized and politically unstable economies.
This suggests a negative relationship between political risk and FDI, through the investment
risk channel.3 I then inspect the theoretical mechanism using a dynamic political-economy
model featuring a redistributive conflict between fractionalized social groups that alternate
in power. The policymaker in power has access to an expropriation technology that can be
used to extract resources from foreign investors which, are then transferred to local targeted
groups. In equilibrium, a higher degree of fractionalization is associated with a greater use
of the technology, and thus lower levels of foreign investment and growth. Fractionalization
(modeled as the number of ethnic, religious, or social groups competing for power) results
in inefficient expropriation for two reasons. First, because the likelihood of staying in power
is smaller, making policymakers more short-sighted. Second, because the common pool
problem is aggravated as the number of groups competing for transfers grows.
     I consider a small open economy composed of a government, a set of multinational cor-
porations and two types of agents: domestic workers and foreign capitalists. Multinational
corporations are run by managers that hire domestic labor and combine it with capital to
produce output. Managers choose investment and dividends in order to maximize the value
of the firm. To highlight the effects of expropriation on FDI, I assume that shares of the
multinational corporations are owned exclusively by foreign investors. Hence, reinvested
earnings constitute FDI inflows to the domestic country. Firms are competitive and face
investment adjustment costs (given by the cost of installing new capital), as in the standard
Tobin’s q model. Domestic workers belong to n social (i.e. ethnic or religious) groups that
alternate in power according to an exogenous probability. Once in office, they decide how
much to extract from FDI and where to transfer the resources collected. The extraction
technology can be interpreted as a cost that foreigners must incur in order to gain access to
the development of an investment project in the domestic market. Examples of these are
investment taxes, capital controls, permits necessary to expand a factory or simply bribes.4
   1 The United Nations (1996) reports that 80% of the total investment flowing to developing countries in

1995 was received by 10 countries with the highest FDI.
   2 See Tornell and Velasco (1992) and Alfaro et al. (2008) for additional literature analyzing the Lucas

(1990) puzzle.
   3 Consistent with this, Busse and Hefeker (2007) find that government stability is an important determi-

nant of foreign investment flows. See also Gastanaga et al. (1998), Janerba (2002) and Brunetti and Weder
(1998) for earlier empirical literature linking political risk to FDI.
   4 The financial crisis of 2001-2002, with the imposition of the ‘corralito’ in Argentina provides a good

example: the government restricted capital transactions and “pesified” contracts and financial assets. For-



                                                    2
    When a group is in power, it chooses policy (i.e. the fraction to be expropriated) while
taking into account how this will affect future production and growth—via reductions in
FDI— as well as the effects on the level of expropriation that other groups may choose in
the future. A balanced-growth Markov-perfect equilibrium (BG-PMPE) is characterized,
where variables grow at a constant rate and policy is a function of the only payoff relevant
variable: foreign capital installed in the country. I focus on symmetric MPE because all
groups are assumed to be identical, so the identity of the group in power is irrelevant on
the determination of policy. It is important to note that this equilibrium concept rules
out reputation mechanisms, and it constitutes a lower bound for the set of potential sub-
game perfect equilibria that would arise in this environment. The choice of this equilibrium
concept is made not only because it allows for a simple characterization, but because it does
not require strong assumptions about the feasibility of punishment strategies. For example,
it would be possible to attain higher welfare by inducing lower expropriation rates under
the threat of financial autarky (as in Aguiar and Amador, 2011), but it is not clear that
this would be in the best interest of foreign investors (i.e. share-holders) ex-post due to the
large costs associated with installing and dis-installing capital.
    The main mechanism explaining the negative relationship between FDI and political
risk rests on the assumption that groups compete to receive transfers and derive no util-
ity if resources are distributed to other groups. So when a given group is in power, it
will balance the government budget by making transfers only to its own type or region.
This introduces a common pool problem, as the benefits from expropriation are enjoyed
by the group in power, whereas the costs are paid by all members of society. Relative to
a planner’s (constrained-efficient) allocation, fractionalization results in over-expropriation.
This static inefficiency would arise even with no political turnover (e.g. under a dictator
in power forever). A second source of inefficiency stems from redistributive uncertainty,
as the incumbent group may lose power next period with some probability—in which case
they receive no transfers. The cost associated with high expropriation rates (e.g. a smaller
‘expropriation base’ next period) is lower on expectation than it would be under a dictator,
whereas the benefits are the same. Hence, the degree of inefficiency is larger when groups
are subject to political uncertainty. Due to these two effects, and given the assumptions of
the model, the political equilibrium exhibits inefficiently low inflows of FDI in fractionalized
and politically unstable economies. This hinders the production capabilities of the country,
reduces both growth and the overall level of welfare. To evaluate the relative importance
of these distortions, I consider changes in both fractionalization (e.g., number of groups),
and incumbency advantage (e.g., ability of the incumbent group to remain in power regard-
less of the number of groups). I show in a numerical example that while both result in
inefficient expropriation levels, the effects of fractionalization are stronger. This happens
because incumbency advantage only affects expropriation by lowering the expected benefits
from keeping FDI undistorted—through lower political turnover—whereas fractionalization
also affects the relative size of current transfers, aggravating the common pool problem. Fi-
nally, I show that greater political instability—due either to fictionalization or incumbency
advantage—is associated with stronger incentives to expropriate, and hence lower levels of
foreign direct investment.
eign firms’ funds were forcedly converted into Pesos, and many contracts, especially in infrastructure, were
rewritten or canceled. At the same time, capital was not allowed to leave the country (hence the name
‘corralito,’ which means ‘little-fence’). Janeba (2002) provides some other examples, such as China’s 1195
announcement of the scrapping of various benefits that foreign firms received in the form of exemptions
from custom duties or tax rebates when using local materials.



                                                     3
    The paper is organized as follows. The next section summarizes the connections with
the literature. Section 2 describes the empirical evidence supporting the main hypothesis
of the paper. Section 3 presents the environment, while Section 4 defines and characterizes
the political equilibrium. Finally, Section 5 concludes.

Related Literature
Eaton and Gersovitz [1984] developed one of the most influential articles on expropriation
theory. They analyzed sustainable equilibria in a static environment, and showed that
even though no expropriation occurs in equilibrium, the international allocation of capital
is distorted. Thomas and Worral [1994] extended this idea to an infinite-horizon economy
and characterized the set of self-enforcing agreements between the host government and a
multi-national corporation. Building on their work, Aguiar and Amador [2011] showed how
political uncertainty could impact international capital flows. Because both the focus and
economic environment studied in Aguiar and Amador [2011] are closely related to the one
in this paper, it is worth pointing out some of their main differences.
    First, the object of interest is different, as they focus on domestic capital whereas I
analyze foreign direct investment. An important value added by this paper is precisely
documenting the empirical relationship between FDI and political instability in a large set
of countries.
    Second, the source of the dynamic inefficiency in Aguiar and Amador [2011] is debt
overhang: absent a large stock of initial debt, the government would not need to distort
capital in order to face interest payments, and the first best would be reached immediately
and sustained forever after. In this paper, to emphasize the role of fractionalization, debt
is always zero (that is, I assume a balanced budget). The inefficiency arises due to a
redistributive conflict, more in line with that in Tornell and Velasco’s [1992] tragedy of the
commons in which a large number of groups would like to gain access to the expropriation
technology in order to divert resources to themselves through targeted transfers. This
friction causes static inefficiencies—incentives to over-expropriate—even if policymakers are
as patient as agents and do not face re-election uncertainty (although, as shown in the
paper, inefficiencies are exacerbated by impatience and political instability). As a result,
the politico-equilibrium is always inefficient in my paper.
    This touches upon a third important difference. In Aguiar and Amador’s [2011] paper,
while political frictions slow down capital accumulation and growth during the transition,
the inefficiency eventually vanishes. That is, in the long run the economy converges to the
first best in their work. In this paper, the economy is inefficient along the balanced-growth
path and never reaches the first best. This is not only the result of the static common
pool problem mentioned above, but also due to the fact that our solution concepts are
radically different. While Aguiar and Amador characterize self-sustaining equilibria, I focus
on Markov-perfect equilibria instead. As mentioned in the introduction, this concept was
chosen because, given the structure of the model, a threat such as financial autarky would
not be appealing due to the existence of adjustment costs of capital and the fact that share-
holders are dispersed (that is, they are not likely to be able to force a corporation of which
they hold an infinitesimal share to leave the country forever after a small deviation). It
would be interesting to consider self-sustaining equilibria where groups could revert back to
the BG-MPE, but that is beyond the scope of this paper and it is deferred to future work.
    Finally, the behavior of policymakers in Aguiar and Amador [2011] is similar to that of
a quasi-hyperbolic (or quasi-geometric) agent in Laibson [1997] (see also Halac and Yared


                                              4
[2014] for a similar environment). This results from the assumption that groups place a
higher weight on consumption when in power than when out of power. Higher political
turnover affects the effective discount factor, making policymakers de-facto more impatient
than agents, and hence always results in more under-investment on the transition path in
their model. The mapping between effective discount factors and incumbency advantage
breaks in this paper because the continuation utility takes a different form when groups are
out of power, as they receive no transfers but are still affected by production. This implies
that the dynamic consequences of excessive expropriations when a group is out of power
are valued differently than when the group is in power. Moreover, the relative marginal
value of a unit of capital in the two cases can be affected by policy. So even though higher
turnover induces myopia due to the ‘effective discount factor effect’ as in their model, it also
changes the relative value of the associated distortion: I call the ‘value of a dollar effect.’ As
a result, and similarly to Acemoglu, Golosov, and Tsivinski [2011], the probability of power
switches does not map one to one with the effective discount factor. To illustrate this, I show
an example in which expropriation rates are completely irresponsive to changes in political
turnover. I also show that this is a knife-edge case, and provide numerical examples in which
higher political stability is associated with better outcomes (e.g. lower expropriation rates).
Acemoglu, Golosov, and Tsivinski [2011], on the other hand, find that more persistence
typically worsens outcomes. The difference in our findings arises from the fact that they
focus on self-sustainable equilibria whereas I restrict attention to Markovian ones. Given
the negative correlation between political stability and investment risk documented in this
paper, the positive implication of my model seems more in line with the data.
    By focusing on this particular equilibrium concept, this paper contributes to a growing
literature characterizing Markov Perfect equilibria under political frictions, following the
pioneering work of Klein, Krusell and Rios Rull [2008]. Examples are Azzimonti, Sarte,
and Soares [2009], Debortoli and Nunes [2010], Ilzetzki [2011], Klein and Rios-Rull [2003],
Martin [2010, 2015], Ortigueira [2006] in closed economy environments, and Quadrini, [2005]
in open economies. More generally, it is related to the political macroeconomics literature
analyzing the impact of political uncertainty on government policy in dynamic environ-
ments. Azzimonti [2011] and Azzimonti and Talbert [2014] show that political turnover
can negatively affect capital accumulation, whereas Amador [2004] points out its effects on
public debt. Caballero and Yared [2010] emphasize how a government’s myopic behavior
in the presence of political risk results in over-indebtedness. Battaglini and Coate [2007,
2008] find similar inefficiencies in a dynamic bargaining model. The underlying force driving
the inefficiency of policy in all of these papers is the uncertainty surrounding the identity
of tomorrow’s policymaker, a channel that was first pointed out by Alesina and Tabellini
[1990] and Besley and Coate [1998]. Most of these papers, by restricting attention to closed
economies, ignore the effects of political frictions on capital flows, and particularly FDI,
which are the focus of this paper.
    Finally, this paper is related to the literature analyzing how weak institutions (i) deter
investment and the adoption of new technologies (Parente and Prescott, [2000]), (ii) explain
differences in income per-capita (Acemoglu et al., [2001], [2002] and Acemoglu and Johnson,
[2005]), (iii) relate to fiscal capacity (Besley, Ilzetzki, and Persson, 2013).

2     Empirical Evidence
In this section, I analyze the relationship between FDI and Investment Risk (IR). I then
show how investment risk is itself related to several measures of political instability. I use
an unbalanced panel of 145 countries (listed in Appendix 6.1) over the period 1984-2014.


2.1     Variables and data sources

    • Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) refers to direct investment equity flows in the re-
      porting economy. It is the sum of equity capital, reinvestment of earnings, and other
      capital. Direct investment is a category of cross-border investment associated with
      a resident in one economy having control or a significant degree of influence on the
      management of an enterprise that is resident in another economy. Ownership of 10
      percent or more of the ordinary shares of voting stock is the criterion for determin-
      ing the existence of a direct investment relationship. This series shows net inflows
      (new investment inflows minus disinvestment) in the reporting economy from foreign
      investors. FDI is measured in current U.S. million dollars. Source: World Bank WDI

    • Foreign Direct Investment as a percentage of GDP (FDIGDP) corresponds to net
      inflows (new investment inflows minus disinvestment) in the reporting economy from
      foreign investors (see description for FDI above), and is divided by GDP. Source:
      World Bank WDI Online.6
    • Growth corresponds to the percentage change in annual GDP of each country. Source:
      World Bank WDI Online.

    • Investment risk (IR) incorporates factors affecting the risk to investment that are not
      covered by other political, economic and financial risk components. The risk rating
      assigned is the sum of three subcomponents: Contract Viability/Expropriation, Profits
      Repatriation, and Payment Delays. It captures the degree by which a government
      might expropriate either the returns to investment made by foreign firms or part of
      the capital invested itself. The larger the value, the higher the risk faced by foreign
      investors (with a scale from 0 to 12). The variable is constructed as IR = 12 − IP ,
      where IP stands for Investment Profile, obtained from the ICRG Researchers Dataset
      2015 distributed by PRS Group.

    • Government Stability (GS) is an assessment both of the government’s ability to carry
      out its declared programs and its ability to stay in office. The risk rating ranges from
      0-12, with 12 indicating the most stable and is calculated by ICRG. The index corre-
      sponds to the sum of three subcomponents: Government Unity, Legislative Strength,

      Group.

   • Internal Conflict (IC) is an assessment of political violence in the country and its ac-
     tual or potential impact on governance. We normalize the series such that the lowest
     rating, 0, is given to those countries where there is no armed or civil opposition to the
     government and the government does not indulge in arbitrary violence, direct or indi-
     rect, against its own people. The highest rating of 12 is given to a country embroiled
     in an on-going civil war. The risk rating assigned is the sum of three subcomponents:
     Civil War/Coup Threat, Terrorism/Political Violence, and Civil Disorder.
   • External Conflict (EC) is an assessment both of the risk to the incumbent government
     from foreign action, ranging from non-violent external pressure (diplomatic pressures,
     withholding of aid, trade restrictions, territorial disputes, sanctions, etc) to violent
     external pressure (cross-border conflicts to all-out war). External conflicts can ad-
     versely affect foreign business in many ways, such as restrictions on operations, trade
     and investment sanctions, ,distortions in the allocation of economic resources, and
     violent change in the structure of society. The variable is defined between 0 and 12,
     with the highest score indicating very high risk. The variable is the sum of three
     subcomponents: War, Cross-Border Conflict, and Foreign Pressures.
   • Religious tensions (RT) may stem from the domination of society and/or governance
     by a single religious group that seeks to replace civil law by religious law and to
     exclude other religions from the political and/or social process, the desire of a single
     religious group to dominate governance, the suppression of religious freedom, and the
     desire of a religious group to express its own identity or separate from the country
     as a whole. The risk involved in these situations ranges from inexperienced people
     imposing inappropriate policies through civil dissent to civil war. The variable is
     defined between 0 and 6, with the highest score indicating very high risk.
   • Ethnic Tensions (ET) is an assessment of the degree of tension within a country
     attributable to divisions associated with race, nationality, or language. Lower ratings
     are given to countries where racial and nationality tensions are high because opposing
     groups are intolerant and unwilling to compromise. The variable is defined between
     0 and 6, with lower ratings given to countries in which tensions are minimal, even
     though such differences may still exist.



2.2    Stylized Facts
The stylized facts are described below. The focus is on four sets of countries, grouped by
regions: OECD, East Asia, Latin America, Africa, and Other. The list of countries included
in each region can be found in Appendix 6.1.

  1. Developed countries receive larger inflows of FDI on average.
      The average amount of FDI (in millions of US dollars) for the period 1984-2014 in the
      different regions is presented below, with the annual growth rate of their GDP over
  7 Precise   definitions can be found at the ‘International Country Risk Guide,’ published by the PRS Group.


                                                      7
  the same period. We can see that developed countries (e.g. OECD) grow at a lower
  rate but receive much larger FDI inflows on average.

                                  Table 1: FDI and Growth

                             Region             FDI       Growth
                             OECD              $26, 971       7.1%
                             East Asia         $11, 892       8.9%
                             Latin America      $3, 825       8.0%
                             Africa              $568         7.8%
                             Other             $2, 440        8.9%
     Note: Average values per region between 1984-2014. Countries included in each region
     are described in Appendix 6.1. FDI is in millions of US dollars, and growth rates are in
     percentage terms.

  These values are surprising due to the fact that OECD countries have a larger stock
  of already-installed capital. Assuming a standard production function, where the
  marginal return of capital is decreasing, we would expect larger flows of FDI to devel-
  oping countries. Lucas (1990) made this point using a simple Cobb-Douglas technol-
  ogy: the marginal product of capital in India should be 58 times larger than in the US,
  yet capital does not flow to India. One of the explanations proposed by Lucas behind
  the lack of FDI flows towards developing economies could be the instability in their
  political environment. The next set of facts provides some evidence that supports this
  hypothesis.
2. Foreign Direct Investment is lower in countries with larger Investment
   Risk (IR).
  Because FDI is measured in current dollars, and factors such as inflation and growth
  may affect the behavior of the time series, I use FDI as a percentage of GDP in this
  section. The scatter-plot in Figure 1 shows a negative relationship between FDI (as a
  percentage of output) and investment risk, indicating that foreigners are reluctant to
  invest in countries where the government uses the expropriation technology extensively.
  The region-specific correlation coefficients are presented in the following table.

       Table 2: Correlation between Investment Risk and FDI as a percentage of GDP

       Region                                     Correlation
       OECD                                           −0.16
       Latin America                                  −0.39
       East Asia                                      −0.39
       Africa                                         −0.09
       Other                                          −0.26

  Emerging economies (i.e. those in Latin America and East Asia) have a similar cor-
  relation coefficient of −0.39, whereas the coefficient is negligible in African countries.
  Note, however, that FDI inflows to African countries are very small on average (see
  Table 2).

Figure 1: FDI/GDP as a function of Investment Risk (average values between 1984-2014 per
country).


     In order to determine whether the negative correlation between FDI and investment
     risk is statistically significant, I compute a fixed-effects regression of the form

                                     F DIGDPit = αi + γt + βIRit + it

     where F DIGDPit denotes FDI inflows as a percentage of GDP in country i at year t,
     IRit represents investment risk for the same country-year pair, and it represents an
     error term. The variable αi denotes country-specific fixed-effects, in order to control for
     time-invariant country characteristics, whereas γt denotes time fixed-effects, in order
     to control for aggregate factors that may have affected FDIGDP at particular points
     in time. The results are summarized column (1) of Table 3. Standard errors clustered
     by country and corrected for autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity are reported in
     parenthesis.
     The negative relationship between FDI and investment risk is statistically significant,
     as suggested by a p-value of 0.02. A value of −0.31 indicates that when IR increases
     by 1 point, FDI as a percentage of GDP declines by 0.3 points when all countries in
     the sample are considered. This relationship is mostly driven by non-OECD countries
     as a comparison of the coefficients in Specifications 2 and 3 in Table 3 reveals: the
     relationship between the two variables is statistically insignificant in OECD countries.
     When emerging and developing economies are considered (e.g. only non-OECD coun-
     tries) the estimated coefficient β = −0.41 is larger than it is for the whole sample,
     β = −0.31.

               Notes: Sample period 1984-2014. The dependent variable in Specification (1) is F DIGDPit , the indepen-

               dent variables are investment risk IRit , time fixed-effects, and country fixed-effects. Specification (2) in-

               cludes only OECD countries, whereas Specification (3) excludes OECD countries, Specification (4) excludes

               both African and OECD countries. Robust standard errors (corrected for autocorrelation and heteroscedas-

               ticity), clustered by country, are shown in parentheses. Significance denoted as: *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, *

               p<0.1



      Because the relationship between IR and FDI is negligible in African countries (see
      Table 2), I re-computed the fixed-effects regression excluding these countries in Spec-
      ification (4). The results are shown in the last column of Table 3. The coefficient is
      now much larger, β = −0.65 (with a p-value of 0.002), suggesting that IR is detri-
      mental to FDI inflows in emerging economies, but less so in African countries. To
      put this number in perspective, recall that IR ranges from 0 to 12 with an average
      value of 4.4, whereas average FDIGDP is 3.5. Thus an increase in IR of 10% from its
      average value results in an average decline of foreign investment of 8.17% per year in
      non-OECD/non-African countries.8

   3. There is lower investment risk in countries that are more politically un-
      stable.
      The ICRG Researchers Dataset has several measures that attempt to capture polit-
      ical instability. For example, low values of ‘Government Stability’ indicate that the
      government is unlikely to carry out its proposed plans or even stay in office. Coun-
      tries under internal conflict (armed or civil opposition to the government) or external
      conflict (cross-border disputes or wars) are also politically unstable. Finally, political
      instability may arise due to ethnic or religious tensions among different groups in the
      population. All of these, by affecting political turnover and the nature of redistributive
      policies, are likely to impact investment risk, and hence the returns to FDI.
      Because the countries in our sample may face one or more political instability factors,
      the analysis will consider the effects of these factors separately. I will first present the
      region-specific correlations between investment risk and political instability, and then
      a regression analysis to test whether the correlations are statistically significant.
   8 This is computed as follows. A 10% increase in IR corresponds to 0.1 × 4.4 = 0.44. The effect of this

change is a −0.65 × 0.44 = −0.286 point decline in FDI as a percentage of GDP, which corresponds to a
decrease of 3.5/0.286 = 0.0817, or 8.17%, from its average value.

     There is a strong negative correlation between government stability and the risk of
     expropriation across regions. This indicates that countries where political turnover is
     high are more likely to engage in expropriation activities. We can also see that internal
     and external conflicts increase expropriation risk in all regions but OECD countries.
     Religious tensions seem more relevant in Latin America and East Asia, whereas ethic
     tensions are strongly correlated with investment risk mostly in East Asia and Africa.
     Religious and ethnic tensions, which we will refer generically to as fractionalization,
     are likely to affect not only political turnover but also the redistributive base (e.g.
     the number of groups receiving transfers) and hence the incentives to expropriate.
     Because the different sources of political instability may interact with each other, it is
     important to consider their effect simultaneously. To do this, I compute a fixed-effects
     regression of the following form

              IRit = αi + γt + β1 GSit + β2 ICit + β3 ECit + β4 RTit + β5 ETit + it ,
     where IRit denotes investment risk in country i at year t, GS stands for Government
     Stability, IC for internal conflict, EC for external conflict, RT for religious tensions
     and ET for ethnic tensions. Country-fixed effects are represented by αi , time fixed-
     effects by γt , and the error term by it .
     Among the political instability factors, government stability, internal conflict, and
     religious tensions seem to be the most significant determinants of investment risk. This
     is the case when considering all countries in our sample (see Specification 1 in Table
     5), as well as when considering a subset excluding developed ones (see Specification
     2). Overall, the empirical findings suggest that countries exhibiting greater political
     instability tend to suffer higher expropriation risk of foreign direct investment.


   Summarizing, the stylized facts above suggest that there is a positive relationship be-
tween political instability and expropriation risk. This could discourage inflows of FDI
despite the fact that the marginal productivity of capital is potentially larger in develop-
ing countries. The model below rationalizes these findings and points to a redistributional
conflict as the main cause of excessive expropriation in politically unstable economies.


3    Environment
This small open economy is composed of a government, a set of multinational corporations,
and two types of infinitely lived agents: domestic workers and foreign capitalists. Domestic
workers belong to one of n social (e.g. ethnic or religious) groups, which alternate in

power stochastically and determine government policy. Hence, the domestic economy is
fractionalized and subject to political instability. To highlight the effects of expropriation
on FDI flows, it is assumed that firms are owned by foreign investors. Hence, reinvested
earnings (i.e. earnings not distributed as dividends) constitute FDI inflows to the domestic
country. The government has access to an expropriation technology that allows it to extract
a proportion of foreign direct investment at each point in time. The expropriation rate
chosen by the government in period t is denoted by θt . The proceeds are used to finance
group-specific transfers to domestic workers. These transfers are the source of redistributive
conflict across social groups.

Technology There is one consumption good produced by identical competitive firms, the
multinational corporations. Following Eaton and Gercovitz (1984), I assume that ‘manage-
rial services’ are the intangible assets that foreign firms bring to the production process
such as organizational skills, technological knowledge, access to overseas markets, etc. The
main difference between managerial skills and physical capital is that the former cannot be
expropriated by the government. More importantly, if expropriation occurs, the managerial
services of the foreign manager are no longer available for production. This implies that any
capital expropriated by the government becomes unproductive either because the domestic
worker does not have the necessary skills to run production by himself or because the capi-
tal installed by the foreign investor was specific to the manager’s skills. Therefore, capital


                                                        12
cannot be used to produce using the foreign technology.
    Firms produce using a constant returns to scale technology F (kt , zt ), where kt is physical
capital in productivity units and zt = Ht Lt . Here, Ht is an index of knowledge or human
capital, and Lt denotes the total number of hours worked. Under this specification, additions
of human capital act as an externality in the production of firms, entering as Harrod-neutral
technological progress. The capital stock follows

                                     kt+1 = It + (1 − δ)kt ,
    where δ denotes the depreciation rate of kt and It denotes investment used for both
increases in physical capital and activities which improve on the quality of capital (e.g.
research and development). While investment becomes productive instantaneously (that is,
there are no delivery or time-to-build lags), the firm faces adjustment costs of investment,
which are given by the function D(It , kt ).

Assumption 1 Adjustment costs are increasing and convex in investment, DI > 0 and
DII > 0. The costs of installing new capital are decreasing in the existing stock of capital
Dk < 0.

   They can be interpreted as costs of installation and de-installation of capital (with the
marginal cost being an increasing function of the rate at which investment takes place) or
diminishing returns in research activities.
   Following Arrow (1962) and Romer (1986), knowledge is assumed to grow proportionally
and as a by-product of the accumulation of investment and research activities in the economy,

                                           Ht = Kt ,
    where Kt denotes the average capital stock across firms (I assume that there is a measure
1 of firms, so Kt denotes aggregate capital as well). This externality allows for the possibility
of growth in the economy.

Foreign Capitalists Foreign capitalists are infinitely lived and have standard increasing
and concave preferences over consumption u(ckt ), which are additively separable over time.
Their lifetime utility is
                                     X∞
                                         β t u(ckt ),
                                          t=0

where β ∈ (0, 1) denotes their discount factor. Each period, they can trade shares of the
firm operating in the domestic market. I denote by st the number of shares held at the
beginning of period t. The ownership of shares entitles the shareholder to a dividend per
share of dt , and shares can be traded at the competitive price pt . Capitalists also own a
risk-free asset Bt that pays a return 1 + r∗ , where r∗ denotes the world interest rate. Their
budget constraint is

                       ckt = st (pt + dt ) + (1 + r∗ )Bt − pt st+1 − Bt+1 .




                                                13
Multinational Corporations Because F (kt , Ht Lt ) has constant returns to scale, we can
focus on a representative multinational corporation. The representative firm owns capital
kt installed in the home country, hires domestic workers, and combines these two inputs to
produce consumption, taking Ht as given.
    The total number of shares is normalized to one. The firm has no access to additional
sources of external finance (i.e. it cannot issue new equity or debt). Hence, wages, invest-
ment, and the distribution of dividends to shareholders must be financed exclusively using
internal funds. The firm’s financing constraint reads

                        F (kt , Ht Lt ) = dt + wt Lt + It (1 + θt ) + D(It , kt ).

   The firm’s objective is to maximize its market value vt . Since owning shares gives
shareholders the right to collect dividends dt and the possibility of re-selling their shares,
the value of the firm is
                                        vt = pt + dt .

Domestic workers Domestic workers supply labor inelastically at the competitive wage
rate w, have no international mobility, and belong to one of n social groups. A group can
be interpreted as a collection of individuals residing in one of n districts, or as sharing a
common language, ethnicity, or religious belief. Agents are identical, so for symmetry it will
be assumed that there is a measure 1/n of individuals in each group or district (and hence
a measure 1 of domestic agents). Their lifetime utility is given by
                                              ∞
                                              X
                                                    β t u(cjt )
                                              t=0

where β ∈ (0, 1) is the discount factor and u(cjt ) is an increasing and concave function
satisfying standard Inada conditions. The consumption of a domestic worker belonging to
group j is denoted by cjt and satisfies

                                            cjt = wt + Tjt .
    Two things from this specification are worth noticing. First, the only source of het-
erogeneity across workers is given by the level of group-specific transfers received from the
government, denoted by Tjt . Second, they do not have access to capital markets, so their
assets equal zero at all times. This simplifying assumption is made to reduce the dimen-
sionality of the problem, and acts as a proxy for the case of developing economies where
FDI is the main driving force of production and domestic investment is negligible.9

Government The government expropriates a proportion of FDI and distributes the pro-
ceeds between agents belonging to different social groups. Assuming that it must balance
its budget (e.g. cannot issue debt), the government’s budget constraint is
                                            n
                                           X   1

   9 For example, the ratio of Inward FDI / Gross Fixed Investment in Bolivia is about 45% while Inward

FDI / Domestic Savings is 69.22 %. The numbers for Hong Kong are 59.24% and 51.53%, and 46.77% and
28.03%for Singapore. Finally, FDI / Domestic Savings is 171.1% for Nicaragua .

    Recall that Tjt denotes per-capita lump-sum transfers received by each agent in group
j, so n1 Tjt is the total amount of transfers that the group as a whole receives from the
government.
    Since transfers can be targeted at specific social groups, it is reasonable to expect each
group to exert effort in order to obtain them. Rather than explicitly modeling political
turnover, and following Aguiar and Amador (2011) or Acemoglu, Golosov, and Tsyvinski
(2011), I assume that groups alternate in power stochastically according to a Markov process.
The probability that a given incumbent group remains in power is denoted by p and satisfies
                                                     1
                                                p=     + ξ,
                                                     n
where ξ > 0 represents incumbency advantage. This specification implies that countries
with higher political instability (i.e. those with low p) will be those where incumbents have
low incumbency advantage ξ or where there is a high degree of fractionalization, i.e. where
there is a large number of ethnic or religious groups n competing for power. Conditional on
the incumbent losing office, the probability that any opposition group gains control of the
                                                              1−p
government, denoted by q, is symmetric and satisfies q = n−1      . Notice that this specification
allows for specifications in which groups gain control via a democratic process where parties
compete for elections, as well as those in which turnover that follows from revolutions and
coups following a non-democratic (and possibly violent) process. It is, however, consistent
with several micro-founded specifications discussed in the political economy literature. For
example, Azzimonti (2011) derives a similar expression for an endogenous voting model
(using probabilistic voting) with n = 2. Battaglini and Coate (2008) consider legislators
bargaining in congress over the distribution of the budget and find that their probability of
being in the minimum winning coalition is constant over time. These approaches share the
property that redistributive uncertainty (captured by the probability of being the decision-
maker in the following period) plays a key role in the level of distortions imposed by policy.
    The group in power tries to maximize the lifetime utility of individuals belonging to that
group, taking into account the possibility of losing power and the actions taken by future
policymakers. More details about the political game are provided in Section 4, where the
political equilibrium is defined. It is worth describing the timing more formally at this point.

Timing
    • At the outset of period t, group j is in power and chooses the expropriation rate θt .
    • The multinational corporation chooses labor Lt , foreign direct investment It , and
      dividends dt .
    • The good is produced, wages are paid, and expropriation takes place. The government
      makes transfers Tjt and domestic workers consume.
    • Foreign capitalists collect dividends and consume.
    • A new group takes power.
   Because all groups are symmetric, they choose the same level of expropriation θit = θjt ≡
θt when in power, so the economy exhibits no aggregate uncertainty.10 Notice that given
  10 Hence, the economy is subject to political risk but not to political uncertainty, as it is in Pastor and
Veronesi’s (2012) paper.

the dynamic nature of the game and the timing of events, it would not be optimal for the
government to expropriate at a level where investment in the country drops to zero (that is,
a θt that drives It to 0). Moreover, it is not optimal for the government to expropriate the
capital itself: as mentioned before, neither the government nor the domestic workers own
the managerial skills needed to run the firm efficiently.11

3.1     The competitive equilibrium given policy
In this section, I define and characterize the competitive equilibrium given policy.

Definition 1 A competitive equilibrium given policy {θt }∞                   t=0 is given by a sequence of
allocations {ckt , {cjt }nj=1 , st+1 , Bt+1 , It , kt+1 , Lt , dt }∞
                                                                   t=0 , transfers {{Tjt }nj=1 }∞
                                                                                                t=0 and prices
          ∞
{pt , wt }t=0 such that
    • Given prices and dividends, foreign capitalists choose {ckt , st+1 , Bt+1 }∞
                                                                                 t=0 to maximize
      their lifetime utility.
    • Given prices, multinational corporations choose capital, investment, dividends, and
      labor {kt+1 , It , dt , Lt }∞
                                  t=0 to maximize their value vt = pt + dt .

    • Given prices and transfers, the domestic worker’s budget constraint holds at each t
      cjt = wt Lt + Tjt .
                                                                          Pn
    • The sequence of transfers satisfies the government budget constraint j=1 n1 Tjt = θt It .
    • The labor market clears Lt = 1.

    • The stock market clears st+1 = 1.

   Foreign capitalists choose a sequence of st+1 and Bt+1 to maximize their lifetime utility.
Their first order conditions deliver the no-arbitrage equation
                                           pt+1 + dt+1
                                                       = 1 + r∗ ,                                         (1)
                                                pt
which implies that the return from owning shares st+1 must equal the return from assets
Bt+1 . Using eq. (1), we can re-write the value of the firm vt = pt + dt as the present
discounted sum of dividends
                                                     dt+1       dt+2
                                  vt   = dt +              +            ...
                                                    1 + r∗   (1 + r∗ )2
                                            ∞
                                            X         dt+s
                                       =
                                             s=0
                                                   (1 + r∗ )s

  where distributed dividends correspond to the difference between earnings and invest-
ment (net of adjustment costs),

                         dt = F (kt , Ht Lt ) − wt Lt − It (1 + θt ) − D(It , kt ).
  11 This is a simplification for a more general case where the government or members of the group in power

could work as managers, but had access to an inferior technology.




                                                       16
    Without loss of generality, and to ease notation, we can study the problem of the firm
as of period 0. It’s objective can be re-written as
                                ∞
                                X         1
                 max                             {F (kt , Ht Lt ) − wt Lt − It (1 + θt ) − D(It , kt )}
           {It ,kt+1 ,Lt }∞
                          t=0
                                t=0
                                      (1 + r∗ )t

                                            s.t. It = kt+1 − (1 − δ)kt .                                   (2)
    Notice that firms internalize the cost of expropriation, θt It , when evaluating the costs
of reinvesting earnings It in the domestic country. Higher expropriation levels increase
incentives to distribute earnings rather than investing them in the home country, and hence
reduce FDI.
    Consider the optimality conditions for an arbitrary t. Wages satisfy the standard
marginality condition wt = fL (Kt , Kt Lt ) since kt = Kt = Ht in equilibrium. Letting
qt denote the current valued Lagrange multiplier on constraint 2, we have that

                                                 qt = DIt + 1 + θt ,                                       (3)

where DIt = DI (It , kt ). Under the optimal plan, the firm invests such that the marginal cost
of an additional unit of capital (which equals 1 plus the adjustment cost and expropriation
rate) equals the shadow price of capital qt , also known as Tobin’s q. Finally, the FOC with
respect to future capital is
                                                                    !
                                  1
                           qt =        fkt+1 − Dkt+1 + (1 − δ)qt+1 ,                        (4)
                                1 + r∗

which represents the Euler equation for the firm: the (shadow) price of capital today must
equal the discounted value of the return on capital next period through higher production,
the savings in adjustment costs tomorrow, and the next period’s shadow price of capital
(which can be obtained by selling capital tomorrow). Re-arranging expressions (3) and (4),
we obtain
                                                                              !
                              1
            DIt + 1 + θt =          fkt+1 − Dkt+1 + (1 − δ)[DIt+1 + 1 + θt+1 ]         (5)
                            1 + r∗
   This dynamic equation determines the evolution of capital over time as a function of
expropriation rates θt .


4     Politico-equilibrium
A group’s objective is to maximize the utility of its supporters. This implies that, while
they do not put any weight on the welfare of other regions or groups, policymakers are
‘benevolent planners’ for their own region.12
   I assume that there is no commitment technology: once in power, the group will choose
what is best for its constituency from that point on. This implies that any promises made
before the political uncertainty is resolved are not credible.
  12 In the political economy literature, these policymakers are referred as partisan. An alternative approach,

also studied in the literature, assumes that the leader’s sole objective is to maximize their probability
of controlling the government because he either obtains some ego-rents out of being in power or he can
redistribute resources to himself (kleptocrats).


                                                          17
    The representation of the maximization problem of a group in power is complex because,
due to the dynamic nature of the game, it is necessary to describe how current policymakers
expect future policymakers to behave. In particular, the optimal decision of policy is not
only subject to how foreign investors react to the level of expropriation today, but also to
how next period’s government will choose to expropriate future investment and to whom
they will distribute it. Since groups are forward looking, they need to predict the effects
that a change in policy today will have on the whole sequence of policies in the future
and internalize that the identity of the policymaker can change at each point in time (i.e.
that a representative belonging to different social group might be in power tomorrow).
In principle, this dynamic game allows for multiple sub-game-perfect equilibria that can
be constructed using reputation mechanisms. Characterizing sustainable equilibria in this
game is more involved than characterizing it in, for example, Aguiar and Amador (2011).
In their economy, the policymaker’s utility when out of power is proportional to the utility
when in power at an exogenous rate. The nature of the equilibrium does not change the
relative value of being in power to that of being out of power, and incentives are given
through the threat of financial autarky. In our environment, the value of being out of power
is endogenous as it depends on the level of transfers received from the opposition (if any).
When constructing sustainable equilibria, this would need to be determined as part of the
equilibrium, as it is an important source of incentives. For example, a policymaker may
receive transfers when out of power as long as it does not deviate (see Dixit, Grossman and
Gul, 2000). Moreover, there could be equilibria where some—but not all—groups engage in
giving transfers to other groups out of power. The solution to the political game becomes
closer to one of determining sustainable coalitions in this environment. This is an interesting
avenue of research, but not the one I will follow in this paper.
    I will focus on Markov perfect equilibria (MPE) instead, defined as a set of strategies
that depend only on the current payoff-relevant state of the economy, Kt . This is closer to
the approach in Klein, Krusell, and Rios Rull (2008) and Azzimonti (2011).

4.1    Symmetric Markov-perfect equilibria
Because groups cannot credibly promise to transfer resources to other regions in the future,
it is in no group’s interest to provide transfers to regions different than its own once in
power. Mathematically, this implies that group j will optimally set

                                      Tst = 0 for s 6= j.

    This reduces the dimensionality of the problem, as we only need to focus on one choice
variable for the incumbent, namely θt , as a function of the state. The level of capital is the
only relevant endogenous state variable because human capital is proportional to physical
capital, so the former does not evolve independently from the latter.
    The key equilibrium object that we need to find in the politico-equilibrium is the expro-
priation rate on FDI, denoted by Θj (K), chosen by group j when in power. This function
is stationary (independent of time) because of the infinite horizon assumption. Since all
groups are symmetric, it is reasonable to look for symmetric Markov-perfect equilibria,

                                     Θj (K) = Θ(K), ∀j,

   where the equilibrium rate is independent of the identity of the group in power.



                                              18
    It is useful to make a change in notation at this point: variables dated at period t have
no time subscript and variables dated in future periods will be denoted by primes (that is,
K denotes today’s capital, K 0 denotes Kt+1 , etc.).
    Consider the problem faced by a representative group in power. It needs to choose
the expropriation rate on FDI, θ, taking as given the behavior of the domestic sector and
foreign firms, as well as competitive prices and aggregates. In particular, it needs to take
into account the effects of the expropriation rate chosen on:

   • transfers to the group it represents, via the government budget constraint

                                      T (K, θ) = nθI(K, θ).

   • the consumption of the members of its constituency when the group is in power,
     because it is maximizing their utility

                                   C(K, θ) = fL (K) + T (K, θ).                           (6)

   • capital accumulation, K 0 = H(K, θ), implicitly defined by the firms’ first order condi-
     tion
                                                                                          !
                              1     0         0    0                0   0               0
     DI (I, K) + (1 + θ) =         f − DK (I , K ) + (1 − δ)[DI (I , K ) + (1 + Θ(K ))]
                           1 + r∗ K

     where I = I(K, θ) = H(K, θ) − (1 − δ)K denotes current investment and I 0 =
     I(K 0 , Θ(K 0 )) − (1 − δ)K 0 denotes future investment. Note that this is the recursive
     representation of eq. (5).

   • the consumption of the members of its constituency when the group is out of power,
     because there is a probability that next period a different group is in power:

                                     ˜ 0 , Θ(K 0 )) = fL (K 0 ),
                                     C(K

    The group in power chooses θ so as to maximize the utility of a representative agent in
its constituency (recall that, within a region, all agents are identical)

                    max u(C(K, θ)) + β{pV (K 0 ) + (1 − p)W (K 0 )} s.t.                (P1)
                      θ

                                    K 0 = H(K, θ), and
                                        θ0 = Θ(K 0 ).
   where V (K) corresponds to the value function of an agent whose group is in power, and
the equilibrium policy Θ is followed,
                                   n                                        o
      V (K) = u(C(K, Θ(K))) + β pV H(K, Θ(K)) + (1 − p)W (H K, Θ(K))                   (7)

   and W (K) is the value function when it is out of power,
                                  n                              o
                 ˜
      W (K) = u(C(K,  Θ(K))) + β qV H(K, Θ(K)) + (1 − q)W H(K, Θ(K)) .                    (8)


                                             19
Notice that the probability of regaining power when the group is not an incumbent is q,
potentially different from p.
    The policymaker chooses the current expropriation rate, taking as given future expro-
priation levels, and assuming that future governments follow the equilibrium rule Θ(K). In
order for Θ(K) to be a Markov-perfect equilibrium, it must be the case that no group has
an incentive to deviate from this equilibrium at any point in time. In other words, it must
be optimal for any policymaker to follow this rule when in power.

Definition 2 A Markov-perfect equilibrium is an expropriation-rate function Θ solving

                     Θ(K) = arg max u(C(K, θ)) + β{pV (K 0 ) + (1 − p)W (K 0 )}.
                                   θ

A final remark is in order: in contrast to Aguiar and Amador [2011], this maximization
problem cannot be written as that of a hyperbolic-discounting agent. The equivalence
would hold only in the case in which the group’s consumption when out of power was equal
to zero.13

4.2     Finding and characterizing the MPE
Following Klein, Krusell, and Rios-Rull (2008), I will focus on differentiable MPE, where
Θ(K) is a smooth function of the state K. Under this assumption it is possible to find a
functional equation that determines the optimal expropriation rate as a function of the level
of capital in the economy.
    The first order condition of a representative group in power can be obtained by deriving
(P1) with respect to θ,

                                 Υθ + β{pVK0 + (1 − p)WK
                                                       0
                                                         }Hθ = 0                                        (9)
    where, to simplify the notation and derivations, Υx denotes the derivative of instanta-
neous utility with respect to x, Υx = uc Cx , with x ∈ {K, θ}. This equation implies that
the marginal gain of expropriating FDI today (and increasing transfers) must equal the cost
of reduced FDI inflows to the country in continuation utility (whether in or out of power
next period). This condition can be re-written as an Euler equation for the government, as
shown in Proposition 1.

Proposition 1 The government’s first order condition can be written as

                                            ∂θ0
                                                

                     β(q − p) ΥK Hθ + Υθ 0 − (1 − q)Υθ                   = 0.
               dθ                           ∂θ                     Hθ0

    with    dθ     = (HK + Θ0K Hθ0 ) Hθ and   dθ     =−    H0θ .

  13 See Amador [2003] for a proof of hyperbolic equivalence, as it can be applied straightforwardly to this

environment.

Proof. See Appendix 6.2.
    This equation is referred in the literature as a ‘Generalized Euler Equation’ because of
its parallel to the Euler equation faced by an agent (i.e. an expression that is independent of
the value function). It is a functional equation that, for any K, determines the equilibrium
expropriation function Θ(K). It is worth noticing that, in contrast with a traditional Euler
equation, this expression depends not only on the level of expropriation rate, but also on
the derivative of this policy function, ΘK (K).
    The first term, Υθ = uc Tθ , captures the fact that when the expropriation rate increases,
there is a direct effect on agents’ consumption since those favored by the group in control
receive an increase in the transfer of Tθ .
    When the expropriation rate is increased today, firms react by cutting FDI by Hθ units.
This reduces the amount of capital available for production next period, modifying tomor-
row’s consumption by causing the next policymaker to reduce the level of transfers. The
group in power will retain control of the government with probability p, in which case the
change in the continuation utility is affected due to the lower amount of capital in the econ-
omy, affecting consumption directly through Υ0k = uc CK   0
                                                            and indirectly through the change
                            0
in tomorrow’s transfers θ . A change in the current expropriation rate, by reducing FDI can
affect the way in which future policymakers will choose the expropriation rate, as captured
                  0
                                             0
by the term dθ  dθ , which has an effect on Υθ tomorrow. This can be seen as an instrument
to manipulate tomorrow’s policymaker.
    The group will be out of power next period with probability 1 − p , in which case the
continuation utility changes only through their effect on the stock of capital (since the group
receives no transfers when out of power). This is seen in the second term of the first row.
    Finally, the term in the second row is associated with the change in expected utility two
periods from now that is triggered by the increase in θ today. This affects K 00 , and hence
consumption and transfers at that point in time. The first term is only relevant when the
probability of regaining power is independent of whether the group is in power (that is,
when q is different from p). Under no incumbency advantage, the term would vanish. The
second term captures the effects of political instability, as it would disappear were p equal
to 1.

4.3    Balanced growth path
In order to further characterize the equilibrium, I will make specific functional assumptions
about preferences and technology. These will ensure the existence of a balanced growth
path where variables grow at a constant rate.

Assumption 2 Suppose that

   • The utility of domestic workers is CRRA,
                                                   c1−σ − 1
                                          u(c) =
                                                     1−σ
      where σ represents the degree of risk aversion, with the standard convention that the
      instantaneous utility is logarithmic, u(c) = log(c), when σ → 1.
   • The production function is Cobb-Douglas

                                    F (k, HL) = Ak α (HL)1−α .

   Under this parametrization, w = (1 − α)Ak α H 1−α (L)−α . Since H = K = k and L = 1,
we find that wages depend linearly on K:
                                            w = (1 − α)AK.
The productivity of capital, on the other hand, is constant: fK = αA. The law of motion
for FDI eq. (5) in the political equilibrium becomes

κ= K  K , which may be non-stationary due to the fact that expropriation could depend on the
stock of capital, Θ(K 0 ). The following proposition shows that a Markov-perfect equilibrium
is consistent with a balanced growth path. That is, there exists a time-invariant tax rate that
satisfies the government’s Euler equation and under which capital grows at a constant rate,
κ = κ0 . Since all other allocations are linear in capital, they grow at constant rates as well.
Proposition 2 Under Assumption 2, there exists a balanced-growth Markov-perfect politico
equilibrium (BG-MPE) in which the expropriation rate is constant Θ(K) = θ̄ and allocations
in the domestic economy grow at a time-invariant rate. In particular,
  1. Capital grows at rate κ̄ = κ(θ̄), with

Proof. See Appendix 6.3.

    Replacing eq. (12) into eq. (13) we obtain an expression that implicitly determines
the expropriation rate θ̄ as a function of political instability p, the degree of risk aversion
σ, the productivity level A and the degree of fractionalization n. A few remarks are in
order. First, there may be non-balanced growth path equilibria in this economy that are
Markov-perfect. I am limiting the analysis to a stationary situation where the growth
rate is constant. This is in line with the analysis performed in the endogenous growth
and macroeconomic literatures, and is analogous to the study of a steady state in a non-
growing economy. Second, the economy may grow or shrink for arbitrary parameterizations.
Because the expropriation rate is only implicitly defined, it is not possible to determine a
set of restrictions on the parameter space ensuring κ̄ ≥ 1, but this will be imposed in the
numerical simulations below. Third, due to the non-linearity of the expressions, there may
be more than one BG-MPE that satisfies eq. (13).

4.3.1   Incumbency advantage, fractionalization, and FDI
Using the findings from Proposition 2, we can show that there exists a negative relationship
between expropriation and growth.
Corollary 2.1 Countries with high expropriation rates grow at lower rates
                                                r∗ + δ
                                  κθ̄ = −                  < 0.                            (14)
                                            γ(1 + r∗ − κ̄)


Proof. Differentiating eq. (12) in Proposition 2.
   Intuitively, higher expropriation rates deter foreign direct investment, and this in turn
hinders growth.

Corollary 2.2 When utility is logarithmic (e.g., σ → 1) and there is full depreciation δ = 1,
there exists a unique expropriation rate θ that is:

  1. Strictly positive, θ̄ > 0.
  2. Independent of incumbency advantage,

                                                ∂ θ̄
                                                     = 0,
                                                ∂ξ

  3. Increasing in fractionalization
                                                ∂ θ̄
                                                     > 0.
                                                ∂n
Proof. See Appendix 6.4
    The corollary shows that, under logarithmic utility, the effects of political instability on
the expropriation rate depend critically on the source of political instability. In this model,
p = n1 + ξ, so there are two possible causes for higher political turnover (e.g. low p). The
first one is low incumbency advantage ξ, as this makes it less likely that the group in power
controls the government next period. The second one is a high degree of fractionalization


                                                23
n, as a larger number of groups in society reduces the chances that any given one of them
gains control of the government. When utility is logarithmic, we find that the first source
of political instability does not affect expropriation rates whereas the second one does. The
intuition behind the second result can be understood by noting that the costs of increasing
θ̄ are borne by all individuals in society (as the overall growth rate κ goes down), but
its benefits are enjoyed only by the group in power. As the number of social groups n
increases, those benefits get shared by a smaller number of individuals within the group, so
the transfer per agent in the group becomes bigger. The incentives to expropriate in order
to consume the transfers immediately are therefore larger, implying that θ̄ increases with n.
It is the nature of the common pool problem rather than the effects of changing the degree
of impatience (by reducing the likelihood of remaining in power) that drives this result.
Hence, if preferences were logarithmic, we should expect a negative correlation between
fractionalization and investment risk on FDI, but not between incumbency advantage and
investment risk.
    This example shows that the effective discount factor of the government is not neces-
sarily affected by the degree of political turnover, emphasizing the differences between an
incumbent group and a planner with time-inconsistent preferences. Aguiar and Amador
(2011), by assuming that the benefits of being in power are proportional to those of being
out of power, showed an equivalence result between the policymaker and an agent with
quasi-hyperbolic preferences (see Laibson [2007]). More specifically, they assume that the
instantaneous utility when in power is µu(c) whereas it is u(c) when out of power, with
µ > 1. This implies that the marginal value of a unit of capital, namely Υk = µuc Ck , when
in power relative to that out of power Υ̃k = uc Ck is exogenous and equal to µ. Under this
assumption, they show that higher political turnover 1 − p translates to a more impatient
government. The equivalence breaks in this paper because the ratio of marginal utilities (in
and out of power) is neither exogenous nor constant. Moreover, the relative marginal value
of an extra unit of capital when in power to that when out of power Υk /Υ̃k is endogenous, as
it can be affected by the expropriation rate. Hence, while it is true that higher p increases the
benefits of leaving FDI undistorted (by making expected utility higher) and hence increases
the effective discount factor, it also changes the relative value of a dollar when in power and
out of power. This additional effect may create incentives to actually reduce expropriation
rates. The strength of the second effect is closely linked to the inter-temporal elasticity of
substitution σ. As Corollary 2.2 shows, when σ = 1, the ‘effective discount factor effect’ is
exactly offset by the relative ‘value of a dollar effect.’ As a result, expropriation rates are
unaffected by increases in incumbency advantage (and hence p).
    The result in the corollary is not general, however, as incumbency advantage affects the
expropriation rate (and hence growth) when σ 6= 1.
                                                                                         ∂ θ̄
Corollary 2.3 The expropriation rate on FDI is affected by incumbency advantage,         ∂ξ     6= 0,
when σ 6= 1.

Proof. By a numerical counterexample.
    I have not been able to characterize ∂∂ξθ̄ theoretically, but a numerical simulation shows
that incumbency advantage affects expropriation for more generic CRRA functions, indicat-
ing that the independence of θ̄ from ξ under logarithmic utility is a knife-edge case. Figure
2 depicts the growth rate of the domestic economy (left panel) together with the expro-
priation rate (right panel) as a function of political stability p, where n is kept constant
and ξ increases such that government stability p belongs to [1/n, 1] (the series are depicted


                                               24
as functions of p rather than ξ to ease interpretation). The parameters used are σ = 0.9,
β = 0.91, α = 0.4, γ = 25, δ = 0.06, n = 10, A = 1.53, and β(1 + r∗ ) = 1.03 so the growth
rate in the rest of the world is 3%.

  Figure 2: Growth Rate κ and Expropriation Rate θ̄ as a function of incumbency advantage.

    We can see that θ̄ is negatively related to incumbency advantage in this case. The
intuition behind this result comes from the redistributive uncertainty and is similar to that
in Amador and Aguiar (2011) or Azzimonti (2011). When a group representing one of
the social groups is in power, it chooses expropriation rates on FDI so as to trade-off the
gains obtained from redistribution (from foreign firms to its own group) against the losses
incurred by the resulting reductions in FDI (which limit future redistribution). Because
the policymaker knows that with high probability, 1 − p, one of the other groups will be
choosing expropriation rates in the future, it has incentives to over-expropriate in the current
period and consume the resources today with certainty. Recall that, if out of power in the
future, no transfers will be received. The political uncertainty induces myopic behavior from
policymakers, as the benefits from an extra unit of foreign direct investment resulting from
low expropriation are not fully internalized (i.e. the extra level of transfers that could be
afforded). The effect is stronger as the probability of remaining in power decreases.

Remark 1 Under σ < 1, we should observe that economies with high political turnover
(frequent changes of power due to low incumbency advantage) exhibit a bias towards spending
in transfers, relatively high expropriation rates, relatively low levels of FDI, and low growth
rates.

   We can also study the effects of fractionalization by increasing the number of groups n
while keeping constant the degree of incumbency advantage ξ. Figure 3 depicts the growth
rate and expropriation rates for the benchmark economy as a function of n ∈ [10, 15] for
three alternative values of ξ ∈ {0, 0.5, 0.9} (depicted as the solid red line, the broken blue


                                                                          25
line, and the dotted black line, respectively). Changing the degree of fractionalization affects
two things: (i) government instability and (ii) the importance of the common pool problem.
Increasing n is analogous to decreasing incumbency advantage in terms of its qualitative
effect on p. A larger number of social groups reduces the probability for the incumbent
to retain power, and hence her incentives to promote growth through low expropriation
rates. In addition, and consistent with what we found for the logarithmic example, a higher
number of groups results in a greater incentive to expropriate FDI as the size of transfers
per capita becomes larger. Taken together, both effects result in higher θ̄ and lower κ as
n rises. Quantitatively, the effect of fractionalization is stronger than that of incumbency
advantage under this parameterization.

4.3.2          Efficiency of the MPE
In this section I want to emphasize the detrimental effects of redistributive uncertainty and
fractionalization in expropriation policies and ultimately growth. To that end, I analyze the
properties of expropriation policy chosen by a benevolent planner that places equal weight
to all social groups in the economy (e.g., that maximize the welfare of all citizens). I assume
that the planner is subject to the same constraints as policymakers representing different
social groups. That is, it has access to the same policy instruments (expropriations and
group-specific transfers) and does not have a commitment technology. Thus, the only differ-
ence between the planner and a politician is that, by giving some weight to all individuals
in society, the former is not subject to the common pool problem. This, in turn, implies
that it does not suffer from redistributive uncertainty due to political turnover: a planner
with identical preferences will replace the current planner with probability one next period.


                                                                             26
The planner solves

                             J(K) = max u(C ∗ (K, θ)) + βJ(K 0 ),                           (15)
                                        θ

   where K 0 = H(K, θ) is the same as in the benchmark case, C ∗ (K, θ) is given by eq. (6),
but where transfers per capita are now:

                                       T ∗ (K, θ) = θI(θ).

    The difference between T (K, θ) and T ∗ (K, θ) is that in the political equilibrium, groups
only collect transfers for their constituency, while under a planner all agents receive them
(so transfers per individual are θI rather than nθI as before). A second difference between
the efficient problem and the one solved in the political equilibrium is that the planner does
not face uncertainty whereas a given group stays in power with probability p < 1.
    It is possible to show that the efficient solution also admits a balanced growth path.

Proposition 3 Under Assumption 2, there exists an efficient balanced-growth path (EBG)
in which the expropriation rate is constant, Θ(K) = θ̄∗ and allocations in the domestic
economy grow at a time-invariant rate. In particular,
  1. Consumption and capital grow at rate κ∗ = κ(θ̄∗ ), with κ(.) defined as in Prop 3.

  2. Investment is proportional to capital, with     I
                                                     K    = κ̃∗ = κ∗ − (1 − δ).
  3. Transfers are linear in K, T (K, θ̄∗ ) = θ̄∗ κ̃∗ K
  4. The expropriation rate θ̄ solves
        h              i              
                                   1−σ            −σ                      −σ
         κ̃∗ + θ̄∗ κ∗θ̄ 1 − β (κ∗ )      + β (κ∗ ) κ∗θ̄ θ̄∗ κ̃∗ = −β (κ∗ ) κθ̄∗ (1 − α)A.   (16)

Proof. See Appendix 6.5.
    We can easily see that κ̄ 6= κ∗ , so the expropriation rate in the political equilibrium
is generally inefficient. Moreover, this holds even when the incumbent faces no political
uncertainty.

Corollary 3.1 For any n > 1, the BG-MPE is inefficient even under no political instability
(i.e. p = 1). Moreover, if utility is logarithmic and δ = 1, we have that

                                    θ̄ > θ̄∗   and   κ̄ < κ̄∗ .

Proof. See Appendix 6.6.
    Hence, political frictions create inefficiently large expropriation rates and low growth
even if the incumbent knows for sure that it will remain in power forever after. This result
is in sharp contrast with previous studies in which the only source of inefficiency is given
by an excessive degree of impatience caused by political uncertainty, such as Amador and
Aguiar (2011) or Azzimonti (2011). The main difference lies on the fact that in those papers
the disagreement was about the composition of a public good, whereas here it lies on the
size of targeted transfers. In the current environment, the common pool problem has both
a dynamic and a static component. As a result, even a ‘benevolent dictator’ will distort the


                                               27
growth rate by excessively expropriating FDI. This illustrates how fractionalization may be
detrimental to growth even in autocratic regimes.
    Under redistributive uncertainty p < 1, there is a second source of inefficiency that
arises from myopia. From the numerical example, it is possible to see that the problem is
aggravated by the higher political instability (figures omitted, but available upon request).
The smaller the value of p (i.e. greater government instability), the further away FDI
inflows are from their efficient level. In terms of welfare, the uncertainty over the identity of
tomorrow’s policymaker introduces volatility in private consumption, which is absent in the
planner’s solution (keep in mind that there are no shocks in this economy other than the
identity of the group in power). Welfare along the BG-MPE is lower not only because the
amount of resources is smaller, but also because individuals suffer from artificial fluctuations
in consumption caused by the volatility in targeted transfers.


5    Conclusions
In this paper, I examine the role of political instability as a potential explanation for the
lack of capital flows from rich countries to poor countries. I first do this empirically by
studying the relationship between FDI, investment risk, and politically instability in a large
set of countries between 1984 and 2014. I then provide a dynamic political economy model
of redistributive conflict to explore the theoretical mechanism.
    There are several simplifying assumptions that were made in order to reduce the di-
mensionality of the problem. First, workers are excluded from capital markets. If domestic
agents were allowed to save, expropriation would be costlier because FDI acts as an ex-
ternality in production. By discouraging FDI, the returns to savings—and hence future
income—would be reduced. Secondly, all groups are assumed to be identical and, in par-
ticular, have the same number of supporters. If there is a clear majority with a larger
probability of being in power, the BG-MPE would no longer be symmetric. As in Azzi-
monti and Talbert (2014), we would expect cycles to arise as groups that gain power less
often become more myopic and choose to expropriate larger amounts. This also introduces
some uncertainty over policy that would affect the way in which FDI is chosen by firms and
potentially generate FDI cycles. Finally, it would be interesting to develop a model where
alternation of power is endogenous.

6.2    Proof of Proposition (10)
We can obtain an expression for VK by differentiating eq. (7) with respect to capital,

      VK (K) = ΥK + β{pVK0 + (1 − p)WK
                                     0

                                                                    0
                                                                      }Hθ ]ΘK ,
                                             |             {z            }
                                                                 =0 by eq. 9

                       ⇒ VK (K) = ΥK + β{pVK0 + (1 − p)WK
                                                        0
                                                          }HK .
Notice that from (9) we get
                                                          Υθ
                                β{pVK0 + (1 − p)WK
                                                 0
                                                   }=−       .                           (17)
                                                          Hθ
Therefore,
                                                     HK
                                   VK (K) = ΥK − Υθ                                 (18)
                                                     Hθ
Notice the difference between this condition and the one that we would normally see in
a neoclassical growth model. In the traditional model, the marginal value of a unit of
investment is given by the increase in marginal utility driven by the extra consumption
that this unit of capital produces (i.e. VK (K) = ΥK ). In this economy, the equality is
broken for two reasons: first, because foreigners decide how much to invest, and not the
domestic workers; second, because the envelope theorem does not hold in economies where
the identity of the policymaker may change over time.
   We can obtain WK by differentiating (8) with respect to capital,

   WK (K) = Υ̃K + β{qVK0 + (1 − q)WK
                                   0
                                     }HK + [Υ̃θ + β{qVK0 + (1 − q)WK
                                                                   0
                                                                     }Hθ ]ΘK ,           (19)

where Υ̃K denotes the marginal change in instantaneous utility triggered by an increase
in FDI when the agent’s group is out of power. Since agents do not receive transfers in a
such case, the marginal utilities of consumption and labor are such that Υ̃K 6= ΥK . This
implies that the second term in the expression is different from zero, in contrast to the case
of V (K). Because there are no transfers when out of power, Υ̃θ = 0.
    From eq. (9), we have that
                                                     

                                          Hθ β          1−p
   Replacing this into 19,
                                                              

             WK (K) = Υ̃K + β        (q − p)Vk0 − (1 − q)        H K + H θ ΘK .          (20)

Replacing eq. (18) into eq. (20) we can obtain an expression WK       independent of value
functions. Updating such expression, together with eqs. (18) and (19) (that is, evaluating
them in tomorrow’s capital) and replacing them back in the first order condition eq. (9) we
obtain the following equation

To obtain eq. (10), note that the total change in K 00 when θ increases is
                                 dK 00     0

Parts 1, 2, and 3 Imposing the balanced growth path (BGP) condition κ̄ =           K ,   we
obtain

Replacing this into eq. (11), we have

Clearly, a BGP requires a constant expropriation rate. Imposing Θ(K) = θ̄, we obtain the
following quadratic expression

Inspecting eq. (23), we see that only one of the roots satisfies this condition.

Υ̃K κ̄−σ . These imply Υ00θ = Υθ κ̄2(1−σ) and Υ00K = ΥK κ̄−2σ .


                                                   35
     From the FDI’s decision of firms H(K, θ) = κ̄K, we have

                                             Hθ     =    κθ̄ K
                                             HK     =    κ̄,

which implies Hθ0 = κθ̄ κ̄K and HK
                                 0
                                   = κ̄.
   Using these, we can show

                                     dK 00
                                           = (κ̄ + Θ0K κθ̄ K 0 ) κθ̄ K,
                                      dθ
as Θ0K = 0 in the BGPME. We also have that

                                         dθ0    Hθ Hk0
                                             =−        = −1,
                                         dθ      Hθ0
     dθ 00
so   dθ 0    = −1. To obtain eq. (13), replace these into the GEE eq (10) and re-arrange

6.4          Proof of Corollary (2.2)

Part 1.: existence, uniqueness, and sign Under full depreciation κ = κ̃ = κ̄, and
under logarithmic utility,
                                                           
                           Υ(K, θ) = ln (1 − α)AK + T (K, θ) ,

implying that
                            υθ                                   1
                            Υθ =
                               , Υ̃θ = 0, and ΥK = Υ̃K = ,
                             e                                  K
whereas Hθ = κθ̄ K and HK = κ̄ as before. Replacing these into the GEE, eq (10), imposing
balanced growth conditions, and re-arranging,
                                                    β κθ̄
                                          Υθ +             = 0.
                                                  1 − β κ̄
     This expression can be re-written as

                                                                κ (1 − α)A
                             (1 − β)[κ̄ + θ̄κθ̄ ] + β θ̄κθ̄ = −β θ̄        .               (24)
                             |           {z              } | κ̄ {z n }
                                       LHS
                                                                   RHS

     The right-hand side (RHS) is increasing in θ̄,

                           ∂RHS(θ̄)    (1 − α)A  κθ̄ 2 1 + r∗

                             ∂ θ̄          n      κ̄    1 + r∗ − κ̄
     and equal to zero at the origin RHS(0) = 0.
     The left-hand side (LHS) is decreasing in θ̄,

                                   ∂LHS
                                         = (2 − β)κθ̄ + θ̄κθ̄θ̄ < 0,
                                    ∂ θ̄

                                                    36
since κθ̄ < 0 as shown in Corollary 2.1 and
                                        ∂κθ̄      (κθ̄ )2
                              κθ̄θ̄ =        =−             < 0,
                                         θ̄     1 + r∗ − κ̄
and positive at the origin, LHS(0) > 0. Hence, there exists a θ̄ > 0 at which they intersect,
RHS = LHS.

                                                                       ∂ θ̄
Part 2.   Since the LHS and RHS of eq. (24) are independent of p,      ∂ξ     = 0.


Part 3. The LHS is independent of n. The RHS is increasing in n. Hence, for a small 
and n00 = n0 + , RHS(n00 ) > RHS(n0 ). This implies θ̄(n00 ) > θ̄(n0 ). We can approximate
∂ θ̄(n)
  ∂n as follows
                             ∂ θ̄(n)       θ̄(n00 ) − θ̄(n0 )
                                     w lim                    >0
                               ∂n      →0          

6.5     Proof of Proposition (3)

The proof of Parts 1, 2, and 3 is analogous to those in (the proof of) Proposition 6.3. The
only significant difference is that transfers satisfy T ∗ (K, θ) = θI(θ), whereas they were
T (K, θ) = nθI(θ) in the political equilibrium. In addition, the expropriation rate θ̄∗ is
potentially different from θ̄.
   The proof of Part 4. is more involved, as we need to re-compute the GEE. Recall that
the planner solves problem (15). Its FOC is
                                        Υ∗θ + βJK
                                                0
                                                  Hθ = 0,                               (25)
where                                                        
                     J(K) = u C ∗ (K, Θ∗ (K)) + βJ H(K, Θ∗ (K))
and Θ∗ (K) represents the expropriation rate followed by future planners in the MPE. Dif-
ferentiating the last equation, we obtain
                                                                
                          JK = Υ∗K + Υ∗θ Θ∗K + βJK
                                                 0
                                                     HK + Hθ Θ∗K

which, using eq. (25), reduces to
                                                      HK
                                    JK = Υ∗K − Υ∗θ       .
                                                      Hθ
Updating this expression and replacing it into eq. (25), we obtain the planner’s GEE
                                                       0
                                                        
                                            0      0 H
                            Υ∗θ + βHθ Υ∗K − Υ∗θ K          = 0.                      (26)
                                                     Hθ0
This is similar to the GEE in the political equilibrium, with the exception that there is no
political turnover (so p and q do not appear in this expression) and the transfer function is
different. This implies that now
                                                      
                                    Υ∗θ = u∗c I ∗ + θHθ ,


                                               37
                                   h                         i
                          Υ∗K = u∗c (1 − α)A + θ∗ HK − (1 − δ) .

Imposing the balanced growth path conditions, HK = κ and Hθ = κθ K. Replacing these
into eq. (26), and re-arranging, we obtain eq. (16)

6.6   Proof of Corollary (3.1)

When there is no political instability p = 1 and q = 0. Then, eq. (13), determining the
expropriation rate under the political equilibrium θ̄ reduces to

                                                                     κ̄−σ κθ̄
                 (1 − βκ̄1−σ )[κ̃ + θ̄κθ̄ ] + β θ̄κθ̄ κ̄−σ κ̃ = −β            (1 − α)A.   (27)
                 |                 {z                      } |          n {z         }
                                   LHS
                                                                         RHS
                                     ∗
The planner’s FOC determining θ̄ can be written as

                 (1 − βκ̄1−σ )[κ̃ + θ̄κθ̄ ] + β θ̄κθ̄ κ̄−σ κ̃ = −βκ̄−σ κθ̄ (1 − α)A.      (28)
                 |                 {z                      } |          {z        }
                                   LHS                                   RHS

Note that the LHS of eq. (28) is the same as that of eq. (27), whereas the RHS differs for
any n > 1 implying that θ̄ 6= θ̄∗ . Hence, the BG-MPE is inefficient.
    To show the second part, evaluate the equations at δ = 1 and σ = 1. Eq. (27) collapses
to eq. (24), studied in Appendix 6.4. The RHS of eq. (27) is larger than the RHS of eq.
(24), implying that θ̄∗ > θ̄. Since κ is decreasing in θ, then κ̄ < κ̄∗
