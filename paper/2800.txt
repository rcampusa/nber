SHIRKING OR PRODUCTIVE SCHMOOZING:     WAGES   AND THE ALLOCATION OF TIME AT WORK


                                         ABSTRACT




        Major strands of recent macroeconomic theory hinge on the relation of
 workers' efforts to their wages, but there has been no direct general evidence
 on   this relation. This study uses data from household surveys for 1975 and    1981

 that include detailed time diaries to examine how changes in the use of time on
 the job affect wages. Additional time spent by the average worker relaxing at
 work has no impact on earnings (and is presumably unproductive). Additional on-
 the-job leisure does raise earnings of workers whose break time is very short.
 Only among union workers •   for whom additional leisure time (in unscheduled
 breaks only) appears productive, does this pattern differ. The results suggest
 that further growth in on-the-job leisure will reduce productivity (output per
 hour paid-for), that monitoring workers can yield returns to the firm, but that
 entirely eliminating breaks is counterproductive.

I. Introduction
      Since World War II there has been a rapid increase in two types of leisure

that may affect workers' productivity while they are actually working. The

first of these is the well-known increase in paid time        off   from work - - -

vacations,   holidays and sick days. In larger manufacturing firms (U.S. Chamber

of Commerce, 1953. 1987) this type of payment for not working increased from 5.4

percent of total payroll cost in 1953 to 10.2 percent in 1986. (Comparable

figures for paid holidays and sick time alone are 2.1 and 4.4 percent.) The

less well-known source of increase is the rise in time spent at work but not

working. In the same survey this source of paid on-the-job leisure increased

from 2.1 to 3.3 percent of payroll costs.

      In Hamermesh (1986) I analyzed workers' demand for mixing work with

leisure on the job and paid leisure off the job. However, no one has examined

how on-the-job leisure affects production or the demand side of the labor market.1

Time spent on the job relaxing (loafing?) can increase workers' productivity by

enabling them to rest when they are physically or mentally fatigued. To the

extent that this productivity-enhancing effect exists, it has implications for

issues of interest to labor economists and economists generally. First, and

simplest,    how does   the structure of pay differ along the dimension of the

allocation    of time   at work?   That is, do we observe pay differences that are
related to the amount of time       workers spend on   scheduled and unscheduled breaks?
      Of particular recent interest to macroeconomists and labor economists too

has been the role of shirking on the job and the incentives shirking gives

 employers to institute monitoring schemes. This question also speaks, though

 less directly, to the issue of efficiency wages. Yet in the burgeoning

 literature on the role of wage differentials in affecting worker productivity

 the evidence supporting the hypothesis is the documentation of interf iris wage

                                              1
differentials unexplained by conventional human capital, demographic and other

variables (Krueger-Suz.ners, 1988). The hypothesis is based on how time is used

in the work place; but no evidence on time use is provided. This is the first

comprehensive study to relate time use to wages.

         Alternative uses of time on the job also affect predictions about the

impacts of various labor-market policies. Legislated reductions in the standard

workweek will affect the relative demand for workers and hours differently

depending on the current productivity of slack time in the work place (see Hart,

1987. p. 53). The more productive slack time is, the smaller is the margin

available to employers for increasing the efficiency of hours paid for in

response to an imposed change in standard hours. Increases in wage rates, be

they legislated or bargained, are more costly to employers, and will have a

greater disemployment effect, the lower the productivity of time on the Job.

Understanding the effects of on-the-job leisure on productivity informs us about

the structure of the demand for workers and thus about the possible impacts of

such policies as overtime pay requirements, payroll taxes, and minimum wages.

         In Section II I review the work of industrial engineers and psychologists

on the effects of alternative uses of time        on   the job on worker performance.

This   evidence is used to motivate an implicit-contract model in which workers
and    firms sort   themselves according to their tastes and technologies defined
over    time use on the job. In Section III I describe the data used to examine

the issues and present the equations that will be estimated.           Section IV   provides

the evidence on how time is used and its effects on productivity, essentially

answering whether on-the-job leisure is shirking or represents productive

schmoozing - -   - socializing   with workmates that adds to productivity (see Schrank,

1978). Section V draws inferences from the results for pay structure, shirking

models   and trends in time   use.

                                              2
II. Background and Theory

        As far back as Florence (1924) industrial engineers have charted the paths

of output, spoilage and other indicators of physical productivity as functions

of the length of time the employee has been producing during the day. The

evidence suggests that accident rates and work spoilage are lowest after breaks

and at    the   start of a shift, and that output is highest at those times. A huge

literature in industrial psychology (see McCormick-Ilgen, 1985, for a suimsary)

has    examined   the effects of rest periods   on   the job on fatigue,   boredom and

other    counterproductive reactions. Among workers engaged in physical tasks
there is clear physiological evidence of reductions in work capacity occurring
at lover levels of rest and break time. Among workers in sedentary jobs no such
physiological      evidence exists. Those workers do, however, report feelings of

fatigue when deprived of rest periods, and the literature indicates that there

are psychological benefits from rest periods that may enhance the well-being of

these workers and hence their productivity.

         This evidence is   clearly important; but its implications for labor-market
outcomes    are not entirely clear. What is required is some consideration of how

time    use on the job   affects the rewards - -     higher wages - - - that are the returns
to productive uses of time on the job. Unless worker productivity is independent
of the way time is used on the job, the phenomena must be modelled as being
jointly determined by workers and employers.
         Consider   first a simple model   of the choice of hours of productive work
 and   wages in a world of homogeneous workers and a representive firm among those

 where leisure on the job is possible. The firm operates in a competitive product

 market. I ignore shirking/monitoring in this simple           model.   Let production Y   be

 characterized     by:
(1)         Y —   Y(I1, b(H -
where H is normal (non-break) hours per worker, bsl is a parameter indicating

the productivity of on-the-job leisure, and H is the fixed amount of hours paid

for in the firm. I make the assumptions that Y1(x,x) >             Y(x,x)    0, i.e.,

that the marginal minute of work is uniformly more productive than the same

marginal minute of on-the-job leisure. Normalizing the product price at one,

and assuming that the firm has already decided how many workers to employ, I

assume it maximizes (Y -    WHI subject         to:


            U(WIf, H-He) U(f, 0)
where U is the representative worker's utility function, U is the wage the firm

pays, and 1* is earnings available in jobs where no on-the-job leisure is

possible. The maximization process yields solutions for wages and on-the-job

leisure:

            U — F'(b,     H, I');

            H,, —   F2(b, H, i.').
Depending on preferences and the sizes of Y1           and Y2,   the jointly-maximizing

value of H,, can be less than H.

      The comparative-static question of interest here is the effect of an

increase in b, the productivity of on-the-job leisure, on the equilibrium values

of U and H,,. One can show that an increase in b lowers both U and H,, given a

fixed H. Essentially, a higher b encourages the firm to substitute on-the-job

leisure for normal work, and it can still attract workers at a lower wage rate

because the workers are more than willing to trade off reduced normal work for

increased on-the-job leisure.

      This model yields little that is testable, as we cannot observe b to link

it to combinations of       and   fl,,.
                                          It   does, though, provide the basis for

analyzing a more useful model, one characterizing an economy with heterogeneous

                                                  4
firms and workers in which shirking is possible and firms spend resources on

monitoring their employees. Consider firm l's production technology:

(2)
                 —
                                b[H"-H1]).
Each   firm has a different production technology. Y1. Firms                 cannot measure       as


well   as workers, though they can observe the results of a                  low H. Accordingly.

they choose to spend some amount M on monitoring workers, so that profits are:

(3)
                 —   Y1
                          -
                              Wlf    -
                                         M.
         The firm uses its resources to monitor workers and improve its probability

of catching slackers. I model this in terms of the probability of a worker being

fired, p(H, Mi), with p1<O, and with increasing M reducing the dispersion of

p over the range of H,, between 0 and H". Workers j maximize utility defined

over the probability of keeping the job in firm i:

                  — [l-p)U(WH. H"-lç) + pU(I".               0).

Each firm maximizes profits subject to the competitively determined market locus


 shown in Figure 1 in W- - space.              The firm's isoprofit curves slope upward


because it can    offer       a higher wage rate if it      can induce its workers to spend
 more time on the job engaged in normal work. Workers' indifference curves slope
 upward because   workers must           receive   a higher wage rate to be induced to forego
 more of   their on-the-job leisure. As a result of both sets of behavior, WW, the


 market locus of     equilibrium combinations           (W, 4),    also   slopes upward. With a


 fixed   H" this means        that   the locus of equilibrium combinations       of wages and on-



 the-job    leisure,          and .4i,    slopes   downward. Implicit in this maximization

 is    an equilibrium amount of spending on detecting shirking. M.

          Consider what happens if b rises in each firm, while workers' preferences

 for spending time in on-the-job leisure rather than work remain unchanged. At

 the old equilibria the value of a dollar spent on detecting shirking decreases.

 because on-the-job leisure is now more productive, competition among firms                   for

                                                       5

workers forces employers to raise the wage at each level of               less than H*.

The competitive pressures are especially increased among firms that had already

chosen a low H,, (and a high iijj)• for the productivity gains are greatest in

those firms. (In the extreme, at a firm in which H,, — H*, a small increase in

   will not change the firm's choices of W and H,,.) The market locus in

Figure 1 thus rises and rotates clockwise, becoming W%J, when on-the-job leisure

becomes more productive. Obversely, the negatively sloped locus of equilibrium

                     H
combinations of U and 4 becomes flatter also.
                           H
         A simple way to see this result is to abandon our obsession with labor

supply and assume      that   workers are indifferent between time spent at work in

alternative uses, be they productive or just loafing. In that case the market

locus in      Figure 1 would slope upward solely because employers who use       a more

loafing-intensive      technology will have lower output than otherwise identical

 firms   that have higher !4.       They   can remain   in business only by paying lower


wages than other employers. If on-the-job loafing becomes more productive.

 competition will pressure them to raise wages. In the extreme case, in which we

 continue the assumption that workers are indifferent among uses of time on the

 job, but assume that all time uses are equally productive, the market locus in

 Figure   1   becomes horizontal.

         This observation on the possible effects of productive on-the-job leisure

 in an implicit market gives a specific prediction: The more productive is on-
 the-job leisure, the flatter will be the market locus relating the wage rate              to

 hours actually worked, holding total hours on the job constant. This means that

 the market locus relating wage rates and on-the-job leisure will also be flatter,

 other things (including total hours) equal, the more productive is on-the-job

 leisure. In the next Section I discuss ways of implementing these observations.


                                                 6
III. Data and Estimating Equations

        The model to be estimated is of the standard form:

(4)              in W —   0(1,   T)

where X is a vector of control variables, and T is a vector of variables that

measure alternative uses of time on the job, including H,, and H1. It is easier

to estimate some of the versions of (4) by entering the time spent in each

alternative use separately than by including total time        on the   job and the

fraction spent on breaks. This requires a slight reinterpretation of the results
in Section II, since total hours at work are not held constant. At the extreme,
in which   on-the-job leisure is as productive as normal working time (is identical

to it from the employer's standpoint), demand forces alone would make the slopes

of both loci the same (and positive       if workers   dislike spending more time on the

job). However, if marginal workers find on-the-job leisure less unattractive

than normal working time, we will still observe a higher positive slope for the

wage- -working time market    locus   than for the wage- -on-the-job leisure market

locus. The discussion in Section II        suggested that, for a given distribution of
tastes for normal work    and on-the-job leisure, higher productivity of the latter

will cause 3lnW/8H1 to approach alnw/aIç.2 In the extreme case, if workers'

distastes for time on the job are distributed independently of how that time is

used, the estimated differences in these slopes will be perfect measures of the

relative productivity of on-the-job leisure and normal working time. If the

marginal   worker has a greater distaste for additional       normal working time than
for additional   on-the-job      leisure, then 8mw/aM1 <   alnW/aIç even   if the two uses

of    time are equally productive.
        This discussion illustrates the difficulty of drawing inferences about the
relative productivity of alternative uses of time on the job.3          We   simply cannot
be sure that any differences in the slopes that we do observe are            attributable to

                                              7
differences in productivity rather than to differences induced by workers sorting

themselves into various jobs according to their relative tastes for normal time

at   work and on-the-job leisure. Clearly, if we found ölnW/3111 << alnW/aIç, we could

interpret that result as reflecting the different relative productivity of the two

activities, different relative tastes for the two activities, or some combination

of both. In interpreting the results I shall make the extreme assumption that

workers find time spent at work equally distasteful regardless of whether it is

spent in normal work activity or in on-the-job leisure. This is not necessarily

correct, but I leave it         to   the   reader   to decide how large are the potential

biases    that this assumption imparts to my conclusions about the relative product-
ivity    of the alternative uses of time on           the job. So long as on-the-job leisure
is not   more attractive to workers than off-the-job leisure, thougi, we should

observe that amy/oH1 > 0 if OTJ leisure is productive.

         The model assumes that the productivity of workers' uses of time on              the
job   is reflected in the       wage rates they       receive. The output of this estimation

is   thus an   upper bound on        the difference between the productivity of normal
working time and on-the-job leisure. If this upper bound is low --- an hour of

this type of leisure has nearly the same effect on wages as does normal work - - -

we   may infer that OTJ leisure            is a productive use of time   on   the job for which
employers are willing to pay. This inference would suggest that at least some
shirking on the job does         not   harm a firm's profitability. It would provide some
evidence that the role of expenditures on monitoring workers has been overstated

and would    undercut the importance of shirking/monitoring as an explanation               for

various labor-market phenomena. If, however, the upper bound is large, we may
be fairly sure that       OTJ   leisure is not productive, especially given our
assumptions     about   workers' indifference among         uses of time on    the job.

                                                       8
            The empirical examination of time use on the job is conducted on data from
the    1975-76      Time Use Study   (Juster etal, 1979) and from the 1975-81 Time            Use
Panel Study (Juster etal, 1983). These data sets do not appear to have been

used by economists outside the           group     that collected the data;      and among the

purposes       to   which they have been    put,   only one study, Stafford-Duncan         (1980b),
examined time use on the job. The extract that underlay that study was                       quite

similar      to the one I create from the 1975-76 sample, but those authors did not
analyze the relation between wages and alternative uses of time on the job.
            The 1975-76 Study obtained data from four days of time              diaries kept by
members      of 1519 households. The days          were at three-month intervals, with two

being weekdays, one         a Saturday and the fourth a Sunday.            The data on time use
are coubined into synthetic weeks, and it is these that I use in estimating
(4). The 1975-81 Panel Data were collected similarly, with follow-up diaries
kept   for four days (again, at three-month intervals) in 1981 by 620 of the

households that were included in the               1975-76    survey.

            In the 1975-76 diaries workers could categorize time on the job as: Normal

work; work at second job; lunch at work; coffee breaks; and other breaks
breaks      before regular work, after regular work, or other breaks during work.
In    the    1981 follow-up survey information on normal work time at home was also
collected, and separate totals were reported for the three components of other
breaks. Reporting of break           time   does not        merely include scheduled on-the-job

leisure, but instead         is designed to reflect all non-normal working time while on
the   job.     Because of this, and because time             use is   reported by the   worker,   the

data on time         use should   include much     of   what economists could regard as time

spent       shirking. This is especially likely to be              the case   for the less structured

category, other breaks. Any           positive effects on wages of additional time spent
                                                        9
in other breaks would be an especially strong indication that on-the-job leisure

is productive.

        The   data   on   household heads in the surveys formed the basis for the
analysis. Only those who responded that their weekly work hours on the main job
were at    least 20 during each of the four interview waves in 1975-76 and whose

actual normal work time (in the time diaries) exceeded 15 hours on that job in

the synthetic week were included in the extract. Also, in order to ensure that

the data describe the same workplace, only workers who kept the same employer

throughout     the interview     year were included. These disqualifiers accounted for

most    of the reductions in the nuther of data points, with the remaining reductions
due to the exclusion of household heads for whom substantial amounts (at least
ome full day out of the four) of time-use information was missing, or for whom
data    on one of the I      variables   was not   reported. Taken together, the exclusions

resulted in 343 usable         observations from the 1975-76 Time Use Study.4 Of these,

311    were employees, and 276 were employees whose only earnings were wages or
salaries. The statistics and estimates are reported for all three subsamples.
         These same 343 people formed the basis of the subsample from the Panel
 Study. With the same exclusions - - - that the individual did not           change   employers

                 (though the employer      in 1981 could differ from that in 1975-76); that
 during   1981

 the   respondent stated that he or she worked at least at least 20 hours per week

 in    1980 when working and the time diaires showed at least 15 hours of normal

 work    time; and that data on X be available -- -       the   usable subsample contained

 92    individuals, of whom      81   were employees. Eecause of the small size of the

 panel,    breaking the subsample into still finer groups made no sense.
          The vector I includes        all the variables that have become standard
 controls     in wage equations and for which the Time Use Study and the Panel Study

 provide information. Thus educational attainment, years of labor-market

                                                    10
experience (including a quadratic), self-reported health status, union membership,

marital status (currently married or not), location in the South, whether in a

large metropolitan area, and vectors of duumiy variables for one-digit occupation

and industry were all used as controls in estimating (4).

       Normal work measures time    (in   minutes) reported for the    synthetic   week

(based on the four daily diaries). For the observations in 1981 this measure

includes work time at home.6 Equation (4) is estimated using reported break time

in the three categories - -   - lunch,   coffee and other - -   - separately,   as well as

with an aggregate of time spent on these three activities. The wage measure is

monthly pay, and the dependent variable in all estimation is the logarithm of

monthly     pay. This is calculated as the sum of reported earnings on          the particular

job during     a recent month and the monthly bonus received during that month.
IV. Wages and Time on the Job
       A.     The Time Use Study, 1975-76

       Table   1 presents descriptive characteristics of the three subsamples from
the 1975-76 Time Use Study. In addition, I present separate data for union and
nonunion employees. The four categories defining time use on the job are listed
in minutes per week. Together the data from the time diaries total              42.5 hours

per   week, somewhat less than the 44.0 hours that sample members report when asked
how much time they usually work per week.' This discrepancy suggests that
CPS-type     data overestimate the amount   of time devoted to market production and
lead   one   to underestimate the amount of time spent in household       production   and
leisure. The allocations of time on the job do not differ much among the three
subsamples. However, unionized workers took distinctly more other break time on
the job than did nonunion     workers, and coffee breaks were      more widely available

and/or longer among unionized workers.

        Are the data on break times reasonable? Consider first their means. The

total weekly break time, 214 minutes for employees, seems at first glance to be

disturbingly low (less than 45 minutes per working day for the average employee).

It is quite comparable, thougt, with other available data. The Chamber of

Commerce survey (1987, Table 4)         of   larger firms shows that only 3.4   percent   of


payroll   costs are accounted for by lunch, coffee and other paid breaks. Assuming
a forty-hour week, this means those paid breaks totalled only 82 minutes per
week. Even if only half          of the 168 minutes of coffee and   lunch   breaks reported


by   employees in our sample are paid for, we may conclude that the Time Use Study
does not understate break time.
        Now   consider the variability of break time across the days on which the
workers kept diaries. (Remember that the typical respondent kept time diaries
for two work days.) The average correlation between time on coffee breaks within
a    pair of diary days was .32 for the sample of 343 workers. For lunch breaks it

was    .27,   and   for   the less structured other breaks it was .16. These correlations

are significant, suggesting the data are not just noise. That the correlation

is lower for other breaks is consistent with their less formal nature.

         The differences in diary times between workers in the largest subsample

aM the sample consisting of employees only are striking. Self-employed workers,

excluded from the second subsample, reported 2685 minutes of normal work, but

 only   117 minutes of break time.        Self-employed   workers, who presumably determine
 their own break time to maximize productivity, spend only half as much time               on

 breaks   as employees, and they do this during a longer workweek.

          The demographic characteristics on which Table I provides information (and

 others not shown) suggest the subsamples are quite typical along most dimensions.

 The workers' average age and educational attainment are rougi1y what one             observes

                                                  12
for steady workers in subsamples from other large micro data sets. Employees in

this subsample are unionized at roughly the same rate as were all nonfarm

employees in 1976 (see Hainensesh-Rees, 1988. P. 247). Along the dimensions of

the other control variables too, members of this subsample are representative of

household heads in the mid-1970s.

        In Table 2 I show the parameter estimates of (4) for the various subsamples.

Before comnenting on the returns         to   alternative time   uses   on the job, it is worth

noting   that the   returns   to   other characteristics of the workers accord with

those    found in earnings regressions on other sets of data.'            The effects of

normal   working time on earnings are positive and usually significant. For the
entire subsample an additional hour of normal working time in a typical week
raises earnings by .71 percent. Thus the marginal benefit from additional normal
work is positive, though it is well below the average wage in this subsample.
         For none of the three types of breaks is the marginal effect of additional
time significantly positive in the three main subsamples. Indeed, in the least-
structured category of self-reported break time -- - other breaks - - - the marginal
impact is negative and almost significant at conventional levels. From the
results in Table 2 one would infer that time spent at work but not working is
entirely    unproductive ---       it has no impact on monthly earnings. This would
imply    that, to the extent that      breaks   are not contractual (explicit or implicit)

benefits, it pays employers to spend resources on monitoring workers to induce

 them to shift time    from unproductive breaks to productive normal work.
         The results for lunch and coffee breaks are similar for union and nonunion

workers. For other breaks, though, the effects on wages are strikingly and

 significantly different. Among nonunion workers the effect is negative:

 Additional other breaks reduce monthly pay. Among union workers additional

 other breaks raise monthly pay. Given the rigid structuring of union jobs, this

effect should not be too surprising. Unscheduled breaks are the workers'

necessary and productive responses to the rigidity. This view is consistent

with the notion (Stafford-Duncan, 1980a) that higher union wages are in part a

compensating differential for the structure of work. In the less rigidiy

structured nonunion sector, these unscheduled breaks detract from performance.

These results clearly suggest that OTJ leisure is shirking among nonunion

workers, but may be productive leisure among unionized employees.9

        Before accepting these conclusions we should investigate their robustness

in light of the evidence from industrial psychology cited in Section II that

error rates, accidents, etc. improve following breaks in long spells of continual

work. It may be that a few short breaks throughout the day raise productivity

in nonunion jobs too, even though   the   average minute of time spent in breaks is

not   productive. To investigate this conclusion I reestimated (4) by combining
the three   categories of break time into one, H1, and by adding quadratic terms in
normal working time and break time, and an interaction term between H and H1.1°
        The marginal impacts of H,, and H1 on earnings at their minima, means and
maxima are shown in Table 3. While the results are not very strong, they tell a
somewhat different story from that suggested by the estimates in Table 2. Except
for unionized workers • the initial minute of break time, evaluated at the mean
normal working time in the sample, does produce higher earnings (though the
effect is not very significant). Implicitly this mirrors perfectly the results
from industrial psychology on the declines in productivity that come with
continual, uninterrupted work. At the mean break time      in   these samples, though,

an    additional minute of break time has a much smaller positive effect on
productivity; and at the maximum break time in the sample, an additional minute
of break time reduces earnings. Among unionized workers the marginal effect of
breaks on wages is increasing.

        This extended investigation suggests that the total abolition of break

time would reduce earnings. However, the results also indicate that additional

break time beyond the average adds nothing to pay. These inferences are

buttressed by our observation that break time is much less among self-employed

workers, but that the self-employed do take some breaks. If we maintain the

assumption that the results reflect differences in productivity between normal

working time and on-the-job leisure, we can infer that, except among unionized

workers, increases in break time will be unproductive. The average minute of

time spent on the job but not in normal work is shirking rather than productive

schmoozing. However, the results also imply that employers act rationally in

not being overly zealous in monitoring workers' activities, for some break time

may be productive (and excessive monitoring could reduce productivity).

        B. The Time Use Panel Study, 1975-81

        There are several reasons for using panel data to explore further the

relation between pay and time use on the job. Most important, the cross-section

estimates   of the previous   subsection do not allow us to separate Out the effects

of   worker-firm specific   matches and unobserved worker characteristics that may

be correlated with the uses of time. For example, it seems quite reasonable to

expect that workers with strong tastes for on-the-job leisure will sort themselves

into firms that can provide that on-the-job leisure at little cost. We will

then observe a flatter earnings--break-time market locus, holding total hours

constant, than would be estimated if we could control for the characteristics of

the workers and the firms that affect this sorting. Also, the use of a panel of

workers allows us to examine the the stability of patterns of time use on the

job. The cost of using the Panel Study is the reduction in the number of

individuals   included in the   subsamples."



                                            15
        In Table 4 I list the means of most of the same variables shown in Table 1.

A comparison of the two tables indicates that the workers included in the

subsample from the Panel Study spent about the same time on the job as did the

average worker in the 1975-76 cross section. The mean amount of time spent in

normal work fell sharply in this subsample between 1975-76 and 1981. and the

amount of break time reported fell proportionately in both samples. While time

on lunch and coffee breaks fell, though, time spent on other breaks rose.

        What is most interesting about these data is the large deviation between

time reported in the time diaries as having been spent on the job in 1981 (a

mean of 39.7 hours) and workers' responses about how many hours they worked per

week    (a mean of 43.3 hours). This discrepancy is twice as great as that in the
1975-76 data (both in Table 1 and for 1975-76 for this subsample of the Panel
Study).    Does this change reflect increasing overreporting of hours in CPS-like

data? It is true that the questions on usual weekly hours differed in the two

surveys, with the 1975-76 question referring to the main job at the current

time,   and the 1981 question referring to weekly hours when working in 1980.12

If we restrict the sample to people with only one job, for example, to the 73

employees who held only one job in 1981, the inferences are similar: The

discrepancy between usual hours and     diary reports of total work was 1.9 hours
in 1975-76, but was 3.0 hours in 1981. Another possibility is that economic

conditions differed between 1980 and 1981, so that usual hours reported for 1980

produce a biased comparison to the 1981 diary hours. The CPS data do show that

reported average hours of workers on full-time schedules were 42.8 and 42.4 in

the two years." This .4     hour   decrease is not   sufficient   to explain the increase

in   the gap between reported and diary hours of 1.1 hours among employees with
only one   job. The only   remaining statistical explanation is that field workers
somehow asked the questions differently in the two       years    and therefore   elicited

substantially different answers.              If   that    conjecture is wrong, we    must infer not
only that there are upward biases in reported hours of work based on responses
to questions about total working time that are contained in the major household
surveys,   but that these biases may be increasing.

        There is remarkable stabiliy in monthly earnings over the six years 1975-

76    and 1981 among workers in the subsample. Table S shows the autocorrelations
are around     .80.     That the six-year autocorrelations of time use           by   category are
positive suggests that even                          represent serially
                                        those data do not solely

independent noise.14 It is interesting to note in these data that the

autocorrelation between total break times in the two years of the panel is not
far   below   the autocorrelation in normal working time. Also, the lowest

autocorrelation         coefficients are in other break time, the least structured
category of time        on      the job that is not spent in normal work.
         Equation     (4)       is estimated on the panel of two cross sections from the Time
Use    Panel Study.         I   assume the error structure is characterized by:
(5)                 —
                        p + v , i—i            N, t—l975, 1981,
where e is the error term in (4), p is the individual-job specific effect, and
u    is an i.i.d. error term.15           Equation   (4) is estimated using a generalized least
squares estimator based upon this random-effects model. The particular estimator
used is    essentially a weighted average of the "within" estimator (in this case,

based on the differences in the variables between the two observations for each

worker) and the "between" estimator (in this case, based on the averages of the

variables for each individual). (See Judge etal, 1980.) The parameters

are calculated as OLS estimates of (4) computed over observations for all N

workers for both years from which U                times the individual means   have   been sub-
tracted    for all variables, where 8 is the ratio of the standard errors of the

"within" to the "between" estimators.

       The Lagrange Multiplier statistics that test for the presence of individual

effects in the OLS estimators of (4) on the panel data suggest that it makes

sense to worry about computing GLS estimates.16 For the sample of 92 workers

the statistic, distributed y2(l), equals 29.67; for the subsample of employees

the statistic is 32.58. both of these are highly significant, suggesting that

there is a gain to computing GLS estimates in these data.

       Table 6 shows the CLS estimates of (4) with the error structure embodied

in (5).u7 The responses of earnings to increases in normal          working   time   are
estimated    with about   the    precision as in the cross-section data. The
                                same

responses    to increases in break time are even less precisely estimated than in
in Table 2. The GLS estimates on the panel data reinforce the conclusion that
the marginal minute of time        that   the average worker spends on breaks is
unproductive (assuming that supply effects are not large), and that there could
be   a payoff to resources that employers devote to monitoring workers. As in the

cross-section estimates, here too other (presumably unscheduled) breaks have the

most   negative     effect on wages.

        I also used GLS to estimate versions of (4) that contain a second-order

approximation       to a generalized earnings function in H,, and H1 (analogous to         the


results in Table 3). The marginal effects on earnings of a one-minute increase
 in time    spent   in normal work or in breaks are shown at their minima, means and
maxima in     Table 7 for both subsamples. These results do not confirm even the
 weak findings from the cross section. The marginal effects of additional minutes
 of break   time are    small and insignificant over the entire range of break time.
 Estimates based on the panel data, from which our estimating procedure removes

 potential biases produced by unobserved individual-specific components of wages,

 do not indicate that even a low level of time spent on breaks will increase the

 productivity of the average worker.

complete second—order approximation on normal work and break time.
V. Conclusions and Implicationa

      I have found that additional time spent on breaks at work has no effect

on earnings. Employers simply do not pay for increases in time on the job that

is not spent in normal working activities. However, there is some evidence that

time spent on breaks does raise wages: The cross-section results suggest that

the marginal effect of break time on wages is positive among otherwise identical

workers who spend little time on breaks. Moreover, the finding that self-employed

workers do give themselves unscheduled breaks (thougi of much shorter duration

and/or frequency than employees) also suggests that some break time is productive.

tJithin the confines of our key assumption that workers' distastes for time spent

at work are not greatly affected by how that time is spent, the empirical

results support the notion that the marginal minute of break time is unproductive.

      For the average worker the results strongly imply that additional time

spent in on-the-job leisure represents shirking rather than productive schmoozing.

This is especially so for nonunion workers. This means that employers have a

substantial incentive to devote resources to monitoring workers' allocations of

time on the job, as time spent on breaks does not add to firms revenues and

does produce costs. To the extent that monitoring can at the margin shift the

time allocations of workers who are paid on a tine-rated basis away from breaks

and toward normal   work,   we can infer that at least some monitoring expenditures

can add to profits. The apparent unproductivity of additional break time also

implies that employers have ample latitude for responding to legislated cuts in

standard hours or to higher overtime premia by tightening up their supervision
of break time. The existence of this additional margin means that the employment
effects of such legislation are even more complex than standard labor-demand
models suggest. Finally, the results imply that workers who obtain additional
                                            19
OTJ leisure at the expense of normal work time will see their relative pay fall


(since   they would   be substituting unproductive for productive work time). To

the extent that OTJ     leisure   is a normal good, an increase in the variance in

full incomes will, other things equal, lead to a smaller increase in the variance

of observed earnings through this mechanism.

         The evidence I have produced is based on cross-section data and does not

speak directly to predicting the effects of the trend toward steady increases in

the fraction of time on the job that is spent in what I have termed mixed leisure

     the interspersing of leisure time with normal working time. Indirectly,

though, the evidence suggests that the trend toward increased mixed leisure is

costly in terms of lost output. People may well choose to spend more time at

work in activities that are essentially leisure, but that choice comes at the

 cost of slower increases in productivity, and hence in living standards,      than

 would otherwise occur. For the typical worker the U.S. economy is now far past

 the point where one can argue that additional break time raises productivity.

1. Hersch (1985) did include data on the number of work breaks in an equation
describing the hourly earnings of a small group of piece-rate workers in one plant.

2.   Note that here I am no longer assuming that total hours are fixed, as I did
to ease the exposition in Section II.

3. The problems of drawing inferences from more typical hedonic equations are
discussed by Biddle-Zarkin (1987).

4. The exclusions are quite similar to those in Stafford-Duncan (1980b). Their
final subsample contained 375 workers, partly because their hours disqualifiers
were less stringent than the ones I have used.

5. In the 1975-76 data experience was measured as age - education - 6. The
provision of additional information in the Panel Study allowed the use of self-
reported years of labor-market experience in 1981.

6. Of the 92 workers in the subsample of the Panel Study, only three, all of
whom were self-employed, reported any working time at home.

7. Stafford-Duncan (1980b) note the same discrepancy between answers to
questions about weekly hours and totals of time spent at work based on time
diaries.

8. For examples, in the estimates of (4) over the entire subsample the rate of
return to schooling was 6 percent, the union wage premium was 13 percent, and
workers in the South earned 5 percent less than otherwise identical workers.

9. If we split the sample by industry, we cannot reject the hypothesis that the
structure of (4) is the same in manufacturing as in the rest of the economy.
The same qualitative conclusions are provided by tests on the subsamples of all
workers and workers who receive only wages or salaries.

10. This is essentially an expanded version of the market loci estimated by
Biddle-Zarkin (1987).

11. This problem is inherent in starting out with a very small basic sample.
Thus Stafford (1987) had only 77 observations from the Panel Study in his work
on two-parent families with young children.

12. The question in the 1975-76 data was, "How many hours do you work in your
main job in an average week?    In the 1981 follow-up the question was, "How many
hours did you work in 1980 when you were working?"

13. F.mployment and Earnings, January 1981, January 1982.

14. Whether they represent autocorrelated measurement errors or true observations
cannot be inferred. However, Duncan-Hill (1985) suggest for a similar household
 survey   that only part is measurement error.

individual or the match between the individual and the job. Each interpretation
is probably valid for one part of the subsample but not the other. One should
note, however, that 15 percent of the workers in the subsample changed one-digit
industry between 1975-76 and 1981, and undoubtedly many more changed two- or
three-digitindustries. For at least this group the interpretation should be
that p represents an individual effect only.
16.   The test is discussed by Judge etal    (1980, p. 338).
17.  Also included in the estimating equation in addition to the control variables
listed in Table 6 is a duimny variable for 1981. It is worth noting that the OLS
point estimates on the pooled cross-section time-series data differ little from
the CLS estimates presented in the Table. Similarly, the "within" and "between"
estimators suggest the same qualitative conclusions.
