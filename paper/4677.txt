                                         Introduction

        There are two kinds of macroeconomists. One kind believes that price stickiness plays

a central role in short-mn economic fluctuations. The other kind doesn't.

       Those who believe in sticky prices are part of a long tradition in macroeconomics. This

tradition includes prominent twentieth-century economists such as John Maynard Keynes,

Milton Friedman, Franco Modigliani. and James Tobin. and it dates back at least to David

Hume. The assumption of sticky prices is an essential underpinning of the IS-LM model,

which is taught almost universally to undergraduates as the theory of short-run fluctuations.

Traditionalists believe that this model contains a large element of truth.

       By contrast, those who deny the importance of sticky prices depart radically from
traditional macroeconomics. These heretics hold disparate views: some argue that fluctuations

arise from technological shocks to competitive economies, while others emphasize non-

Wairasian phenomena such as increasing returns and sunspot equilibria. Nonetheless, heretics

are united by their rejection of propositions that were considered well-established a generation

or more ago. They believe that we mislead our undergraduates when we teach them models

with sticky prices and monetary non-neutrality.

       A macroeconornist faces no greater decision than whether to be a traditionalist or a

heretic. This paper explains why we choose to be traditionalists. We discuss the reasons, both

theoretical and empirical, that we believe in models with sticky prices. And we survey recent

research in this paradigm, highlighting both the new discoveries and the questions that remain

open for future work. Recent research both strengthens the foundations of traditional models


                                               1
  and extends the range of phenomena that these models can explain.

          Our dictionary defines TMmanifesto" as 'a public declantion of principles or intentions"

  This word describes perfectly what we try to do in this paper. Rather than present new

  theoretical or empirical results, we attempt to set out what we believe and why we believe it.

  Of course, our goal is to persuade others. We realize that what follows will not convert a

 confirmed heretic. But we hope that it will persuade readers who have not yet made up their

 minds.



                               Why We Believe What We Believe

          We are ted to be traditionalists by three convictions. First, we believe that shifts in

 monetary policy often have important effects on real economic activity. Second, based on

 microeconornjc evidence, we believe that sluggish price adjustment is the best explanation for

monetary non-neunaiity. Finally, we give weight to the long tradition in macroeconomics in

which monetary non-neutrality and price stickiness have central roles.

       Recent research on sticky prices, which we discuss below, has reinforced our belief in

traditional macroeconomics. Yet our most basic traditionalist convictions predate this work.

Indeed, these convictions have been the motivation for us and others to pursue research on

sticky prices. We therefore begin by discussing each of these convictions in turn.


Money Matters

       We believe that monetary policy affects real economic activity. The main reason for

our belief is the evidence of history, especially the numerous episodes in which monetary


                                               2
contractions appear to cause recessions.

       In his course on monetary economics given over a decade ago, Stanley Fischer posed

the question, "How do we know that money matters? His answer was, "Friedman and

Schwartz, and Paul Volcker." Friedman and Schwartz's 1963 treatise, A Monetary History of

the United States. identified a number of episodes in which the money supply contracted

sharply. Economic activity declined after each of these shocks, and so it is natural to conclude

that money has real effects.

       Paul Volcker's disinflation, coming almost two decades after Friedman and Schwartz's

treatise, is another episode of this sort. Monetary policy tightened in 1979 because Voicker

was more committed to the goal of low inflation than was his predecessor, William Miller.

it is easy to explain the deep recession that accompanied the disinflation of the early 1980s if

one believes that monetary policy affects output.

       Today we can add "Romer and Romer" to Fischet's list of reasons to believe in

monetary non-neutrality. In important and controversial studies (1989, 1992), Christina Romer

and David Romer have extended the work of Friedman and Schwazt The Romers read

through the minutes of the meetings of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee and

identified seven dates since World War II when the Fed shifted its policy towards reducing the

rate of inflation. They show that shortly after each of these dates, the economy experienced

a decline in output and employment Indeed, the seven policy tightenings account for most

postwar recessions. The Romers' results suggest not just that money is non-neutral, but that

monetary contractions axe a major source of U.S. business cycles.

       If monetary contractions are followed systematically by contractions in the real


                                               3
economy, how can heretics maintain that mone is neutral? A common argument is that

causality runs from output to money, rather than the other way around. We agree that it is

difficult to establish the direction of causation. Indeed, the identification problem leads us to

put little weight on the many smdies that test for monetary non-neutrality through statistical

correlations, such as tests of Granger causality. Changes in monetary policy, whether measured

by the money stock or interest rates, are most often endogenous: policymakers are responding

to past or expected changes in the economy. Thus money-output correlations cannot establish

true causality.

       The crucial advantage of the "narrative approach' used by Friedman and Schwartz and

by Romer and Romer is that a careful reading of history can yield evidence about the direction

of causality. In many of the tight-money episodes that these authors identify, it appears that

policy is shifting in ways not determined by events in the real economy. For example, the

Fed's unusually passive stance as the money supply and the economy collapsed in the early

1930s is often attributed to Benjamin Strong's death in October 1928. Similarly, policy

changed in 1979 because William Miller chose to resign in that year and his replacement had

a more fervent distaste for inflation. This historical fact makes it plausible to interpret the

Volcker disinflation as an exogenous event that caused the 1981-82 recession. It seems less

likely that causality ran in the other direction -- that Voicker looked ahead to the upcoming

recession (over which he had no control) and decided, for some reason, that it was a good time

to pursue contractionary policy.

       Historical analysis is, of course, intrinsically open to dispute. Different historians can

tell different stories about what happened in a given episode. Yet it is noteworthy that there


                                               4
is no treatise entitled A Technology-shock History of the United States. The leading

interpretation of U.S. macroeconomic history remains monetary.

        There is another kind of historical episode that provides evidence of monetary non-

neutrality: changes in exchange-rate regimes. One can unambiguously identify episodes of

sharp shifts between fixed and floating exchange rates, such as the breakdown of Bretton

Woods and the entry of various countries into the EMS. If money were neutral, such shifts

in policy towards nominal exchange rates would not affect the behavior of j exchange rates.

In practice, as Mussa (1986) documents, real exchange rates become vastly more volatile when

there is a shift from fixed to floating rates, and vastly less volatile when policy shifts in the

other direction. Eichengreen shows (1993) that these changes are too large and too sudden to

attribute to changes in the economic environment that might have triggered the shifts in policy.

Krugman (1993) summarizes the evidence this way: 1 personally think that the effort to

explain away the apparent real effects of nominal shocks is silly, even if one restricts oneself

to domestic evidence. Once one confronts international evidence, however, it becomes an act

of almost pathological denial."

       We have focussed on the effects of money because they provide a clean test for the

existence of nominal imperfections. Nominal variables such as the money stock have no role

in the standard theory of general equilibrium, where the unit of account is indeterminate and

irrelevant The evidence that money matters implies that the economy contains an important

nominal imperfection, and (as we argue below) sticky prices are the most realistic candidate

for such an imperfection.

       Once one assumes sticky prices, however, the implications go well beyond the effects


                                                5
 of money. In traditional macroeconomics, this assumption generates an upward-sloping

 aegaxe supply curve, and thus explains the output effects of any shift in aggregate demand.

 Our traditionalist beliefs are reinforced not only by the recession that accompanied the Voicker

 disinflation, but also by the boom that accompanied high government spending during the

 Viemam War. As we discuss below, sticky prices can also play a central role in explaining

 the effects of aggregate-supply shocks, such as large changes in oil prices. Purely real models

can in principle explain the effects of government spending or oil shocks, but they cannot

match the unified theory of real and monetary shocks that follows from sticky prices.



Microeconomic Evidence on Sticky Prices

       We believe that price stickiness is the best explanation for monetary non-neutrality. It

is natural to consider the macroeconomic effects of sticky prices, because we observe many

prices that change infrequently. Both of us go to barbers who keep haircut prices fixed for

several years.

       There are now many microeconomJc studies of the behavior of prices, and the finding

of substantial stickiness is universal. In an early study, Stephen Cecchetti (1986) examined the

newsstand prices of magazines. He found that the typical magazine allows inflation to erode

its real price by about 25 percent before it raises its nominal price. When inflation is 4percent

per year, the typical magazine changes its price about every six years.

       Dennis Carlton (1986) examined a very different data set: the Stigler-Kindahl data on

transactions prices among firms buying from other firms. He concludes: "The degree of price

rigidity in many industries is significant. It is not unusual in some industries for prices to


                                               6
 individual buyers to remain unchanged for several years."

        The most comprehensive study is the recent one by Alan Blinder (1991), who has

 interviewed managers in a large, representative sample of U.S. firms. One of his questions is

how often the firms change their prices. He finds that 37.7 percent of firms change theft prices

once a year, and another 17.4 percent change their prices less than once a year. The median

firm in the economy changes its prices about once a year.

       It is of course true that many prices in the economy are quite flexible. Blinder finds

that 10.1 percent of prices are adjusted more than once a month. The most extreme cases are

the prices of cornniodities traded on organized exchanges, which change every few minutes.

We live in a world in which some prices are sticky, and some are flexible. Such a hybrid

world, however, is more Likely to be described accurately by a fixed-price model than by a

flexible-price model. Both empiricai evidence and theories of "real rigiditiesTM suggest that

firms' desired relative prices are not very sensitive to economic fluctuations (Blanchard and

Fischer, 1989, Ch. 10). Since flexible-price firms desire fairly constant relative prices, they

do not adjust their nominal prices substantially when others do not adjust. Thus flexible-price

firms inherit sluggish adjustment from fixed-price firms (Haltiwanger and Waldinan, 1989;

Bonomo, 1992).

       In addition, for the purpose of explaining monetary non-neutrality, not all prices are

equally important. According to traditional theory, money has real effects because the price

level does not adjust to equilibrate the supply and demand for money. For this theory, the

most important prices are for those goods bought with money, since the prices of goods bought

with credit do not directly affect the demand for money. Goods bought with money tend to


                                              7
 be small retail items, such as newspapers and haircuts. Experience suggests that these are the

 goods for which prices are most sticky.



The LonQ Tradition

        The view that monetary policy has potent effects is not questioned by the general

population. Policymakers and the press clearly believe that policy can speed up or slow down

real economic activity. The chairman of the Federal Reserve is sometimes called the second

most powerful person in the United States. In 1987 a book made the best sellefs list with the

title, "Secrets of the Temple: How the Federal Reserve Runs the County." The heretical belief

in short-run monetary neutrality has never been taken seriously outside of the ivory tower.

       Moreover, it is only recently that academics have taken this view seriously. Heretics

often go under the label "new classical," suggesting that their views harken back to a more

enlightened era before the Keynesian revolution. Yet the term is a misnomer. The classical

economists themselves never suggested that money was neutrai in the short run. Here is what
David Hume said in his 1752 essay "Of Money":

      In my opinion, it is only in the interval or intermediate situation, between the
      acquisition of money and the rise in prices, that the increasing quantity of gold or silver

      is favourable to industry.... The farmer or gardener, finding that their commodities are

      taken off, apply themselves with alacrity to the raising of more.... It iseasy to trace the

      money in its progress through the whole comxnonweajth where we shall find that it

      must first quicken the diligence of every individual, before it increases the price of
      labour.



                                              S
A key insight of the classical economists, which today we take for granted, is that money is

neutral in the long run. In claiming that money is also neutral in the short run, today's heretics

take classical economics more seriously than did the classical economists themselves.

       In the 1960s, economists engaged in heated debate over the best way to view economic

fluctuations. See, for example, the exchanges in Milton Friedman's Monetary Framework: A

Debate with His Critics (1974). Yet no one in these debates questioned that money affects

output because prices adjust gradually. Indeed, it is ironic that Milton Friedman is sometimes

viewed as the intellectual grandfather of today's heretics. In fact, he was the economist who

argued most forcefully that monetary policy is a frequent cause of economic fluctuations, and

he never doubted that wages and prices adjust gradually. Although traditionalists are often

called "new Keynesians," this label is also a misnomer They could just as easily be called

"new monetarists." (We regret our contributions to this terminological confusion.)

       Why does it matter that monetary non-neutrality and price stickiness are part of a long

tradition in economics? Scientific truths, unlike legal decisions, are not determined by appeals

to authority. There was once a long tradition asserting that the sun revolves around the earth,

but that tradition did not stop the heliocentric solar system from becoming the reigning

paradigm.
       The answer, we believe; is Occam's razor. Occam's razor is the philosophical premise

that if several competing theories are consistent with the facts, the simplest one is probably

right. The heretics would have us believe that the Fed is an institution with little power. Yet,

somehow, the entire economics profession before 1980, and the world outside the ivory tower

still today, have been misled into thinking the Fed is a powerful force controlling the economy.


                                                9
 Occam's razor suggests that such a contorted theory should be viewed with skepticism.

        It is noteworthy that Occam's razor is sometimes used implicitly to argue in favor of

 heretical theories, such as real business cycle theory. Real business cycle theory takes a

 standard model of economic growth--the Ramsey model—and applies it to study economic

 fluctuations. Indeed, the primary appeal of early real business cycle theory was its parsimony.

 Yet, over time, real business cycle theory has found itself deviating more and more from

 standard growth models. Real business cycle theorists now emphasize non-convexities and

 home production, for example. As more epicycles are added, the theory loses the virtue of

parsimony.

        In our view, Occam's razor dictates that one should not dismiss a long tradition of

thought without compelling reasons. Certainly, it is possible that the tradition Is wrong, and

that the heretical view of monetary neutrality and price flexibility will turn out to be true. But,

just as certainly, Occam' s razor gives the heretics the burden of proof.



                             Challen&es to Our Basic Convictions

       In the previous section we described our most fundamental beliefs about
macroeconomics. We recognize that recent work has challenged some of these beliefs. Here
we evaluate three of the most important challenges.



The Cyclical Behavior of Prices

       Traditional macroeconomists believe that shifts in aggregate demand generate

procyclical movements in prices. That is, booms tend to raise prices, and recessions tend to
lower them. Several recent empirical studies call this prediction into question (Kydland and

Prescott, 1990; Cooley and Ohanian, 1991). These studies argue that the price level is

countercyclical in the postwar United States. They reach this conclusion by detrending the

price level and real output using the Hodrick-Prescott filter, and then showing that the

correlation between the detrended series is negative. Economists such as Barro (1993) interpret

these results as evidence against traditional models and in favor of real business cycle models,

in which productivity shocks generate countercyclical price movements.

       We are not persuaded by this evidence for two reasons. First, even traditional
macroeconomists believe that supply shocks, such as the oil shocks of the 1970s, are important

in some historical periods and can move prices and output in opposite directions. Second, we

believe that the statistical methodology in recent studies is misleading. This point is made by

Chadha and Prasad (1993), who perform stochastic simulations of a traditional model. The

shocks in the model are shifts in aggregate demand, and they affect output because nominal

prices adjust slowly. Nonetheless, when the simulated data are detrended, the model yields a

negative conelation between the price level and output. Thus recent empirical results are

consistent with traditional models.

       To gain some intuition for these issues, consider an economy in which inflation falls

from ten percent per year to zero because of a large, sudden change in monetary policy. In

this economy, the price level rises quickly until the new policy is implemented and then

remains constant. A fitted trend smooths out the kink in the price level, and therefore lies

below the price level at the tune of stabilintioo the detrended price level is highest at this

point. According to traditional theories, the disinflation will temporarily decrease output. Thus


                                               1:1
 the detrended price level will appear countercyclicaL ThJs reasoning explains the finding that

 the HP-filtered price level rises during recessions that are accompanied by disinflation, such

 as the Volcker episode (Barro, 1993).

        We are more persuaded by other approaches to examining the comovement of output

 and prices. Jo Anna Gray and David Spencer (1990) estimate a structural aggregate supply

 equation, carefully controlling for supply shocks and changes in the natural rate of
 unemployment. They find that unexpected changes in the price level are positively associated

 with output

        Ball (I 994b) follows another approach, which imposes less theoretical structure. He

 identifies 28 episodes in OECD counthes in which an economy experienced a large, sustained

reduction in inflation. In 27 of the 28 cases, output fell below trend during the disinflation.

Traditional macroeconomics predicts exactly this pattern: the tight monetary policy needed to
reduce inflation reduces output as well.



Other Explanations of Monetary Non-neutrality

       We believe that sticky prices provide the most natural explanation of monetary non-

neutrality since so many prices are, in fact, sticky. Other economists, however, accept

monetary non-neutrality but resist the assumption of sticky prices. They have been led to
develop models of non-neutrality with flexible prices.

       As a matter of logic, any model of monetary non-neutrality must include some nominal

imperfection. The developers of flexible-price models replace nominal price rigidity with some

other nominal imperfectioD. In our view, these alternative imperfections are less plausible


                                             12
empirically than sticky prices.

       The most famous alternative to sticky-price models is the Lucas model (1972, 1973).

In Lucas's framework, the nominal imperfection is informational: agents do not know the price

level and thus cannot distinguish movements rn nominal and relative prices. We have mixed

feelings about this model. As many authors point out, the assumption of an unobservable price

level appears implausible, at least for economies such as the United States where reliable price

data are released monthly. Thus the Lucas model is not a convincing substitute for sticky-price

models. On the other hand, Lucas's broad theme - that imperfections in information help

explain monetary non-neutrality — is appealing. As we discuss below, incomplete information

can explain why finns set prices for fixed intervals of time, as often assumed in traditional

models. Interpreted broadly, Lucas's approach is complenientaiy with theories of monetary

non-neutrality based on sticky prices.

       A popular current alternative to sticky-price models for explaining non-neutrality is

models of "liquidity effects" developed by Lucas (1990), Fuerst (1992), and Christiano and

Eichenbaum (1991, 1992). In these models, the key imperfection is that some agents set their

nominal money holdings in advance and cannot adjust immediately if the price level changes.

By itself, such an assumption is reasonable: empirical studies of money demand fmd that

nominal balances adjust slowly towards the optimal level. We do not believe, however, that

the assumption provides a convincing explanation for the effects of money.

    Most macroeconomic models with flexible prices dichotomize. Real output and the real

interest rate are determined by the goods market and the supply side of the economy, and the

money market determines only the price level. Thus, under flexible prices, imperfections in


                                               13
  the money market are irrelevant to the behavior of output To break this classical dichotomy,

  liquidity-effect models introduce a channel through which money directly affects aggregate

 spending: a cash-in-advance conswaint that sets consumption equal to real balances. With this

 consüaint, slow adjustment of money holdings to a change in prices implies a change in reai

 balanôes and hence a change in consumption. In IS-LM terms, a monetary shock influences

 output because money enters the IS curve.

     We doubt that this channel of monetary transmission is empirically important. In reality,

 consumers do not face a period-by-period cash-in-advance constraint: the ratio of money

 balances to consumption need not be constant. If a person's real balances are low because of

 sticky nominal balances, he can adjust by increasing the velocity of money — by visiting the

 bank more often -- rather than reducing his consumption. We suspect that this is the more

relevant margin of adjustment Certainly most empirical researchers on consumption do not

rake seriously the idea that a person's money holdings are an important determinant of his

consumption, given his overall levels of income and wealth.



Credit Policy vs. Monetary Polkv

       At this point we admit a nagging doubt about our basic convictions. In our discussion

of monetary non-neutrality, we assumed that monetaiy authorities directly control only nominal

'variables. In reality, the Federal Reserve engages in activities in addition to controlling the

sock of money. As emphasized by Plosser (1991) and Rmer and Rnmer (1993). the Fed

sometimes intervenes in credit markets by changing bank regulations, applying informal

Pressure for reduced lending, or restricting consumer credit There is evidence that such credit


                                              14
actions influence output; for example, the 1980 credit controls appear to have contributed to

the recession of that year.

        By itself, such evidence does not cast doubt on traditional models. A restriction in

credit is likely to cause a shift in aggregate demand. Thus, one can explain the effects of credit

actions through traditrnnal channels involving sticky prices.

       Yet the existence of these credit actions casts doubt on some of the evidence of

monetary non-neutrality. Credit actions often coincide with shifts in conventional monetary

policy as the Fed uses various approaches to shift aggregate demand. And, by disrupting

financial intermediation, credit actions can reduce aggregate supply as well as aggregate

demand. In our view, the best case for monetary neutrality centers on the supply-side effects

of credit actions. It is logically possible that real disruptions of intermediation account for the

output losses in episodes of "tight policy," giving the illusion of monetary non-neutrality.

       We are skeptical that direct credit actions can explain the apparent effects of money in

all episodes. At this point, however, there is little hard evidence on the relative importance

of credit actions and traditional monetary policy, or on whether credit actions mainly affect

aggregate demand or aggregate supply. We hope that future research will fill these gaps.



                                 New Theories of Sticky Prices

       Despite the merits of the traditional approach to economic fluctuations, it went through

a rough period during the 1970s and l9SOs. Everyone knows the story of the "new classical"

revolution, in which Robert Lucas and his followers convinced economists that there were

irreparable flaws in traditional macroeconomics. The most compelling argument was that


                                                15
 traditional models were incompatible with microeconomics.        Traditional models simply

 assumed the crucial feature of nominal rigidity, even though agents could gain by eliminating

 it. For example, the models of Fischer (1977) and Taylor (1980) assumed that firms and

workers sign long-term nominal contracts even though both sides would benefit from

indexation. Similarly, Brunner, Cukierman, and Meltzer's (1983) model of persistence in

output fluctuations assumed that prices are fixed in advance, even though firms could raise

profits by adjusting to current shocks. In Lucas's famous quip, traditional models assumed that

people left $500 bills on the sidewalk.

        The new classical attack convinced many researchers that they should abandon

traditional macroeconomics and start the field afresh. But die-hard traditionalists such as

ourselves were not convinced. The incompatibility of traditional models Mth optimizing

behavior was a serious problem, but not a fatal one. Over the past decade, many economists

have sought to support this view by developing sticky-price models based on firm
microeconomic foundations. Often this research goes under the label "new Keynesian" Here

we summarize the outcome of this effort. (For more detailed surveys, see Ball, Mankiw, and

Romer [1988], Rotemberg [19871. and Romer [1993]).



Static Models of Nominal Ri2idities

       The first step was to build simple, static models to explain nominal rigidity. In our

view, this work is largely complete. The explanation for nominal rigidity rests on three

foundations: imperfect competition, small 'menu" costs of nominal price adjustment, and "real

rigiditiet"


                                             16
       In retrospect. it is obvious that imperfect competition must be part of any coherent

theory of price stickiness. Under perfect competition, finns are price takers, not price setters.

Only under imperfect competition can we ask whether a firm will choose to keep its price fixed

or to set a new price in response to a shock.

       It is also essential to posit a menu cost or some similar friction in nominal price

adjustment. As discussed below, many kinds of price rigidities arising from efficiency wages,

customer markets, implicit contracts, and so. on can help explain economic fluctuations. But

these are not enough, because they are rigidities in        wages and prices: absent irrational

money illusion, workers and customers care only about real variables. Adjustment to a

monetary shock requires changes in nominal variables but not in real variables, and so real

rigidities do not imply monetary non-neutrality. As a matter of logic, nominal stickiness

requires a cost of nominal adjustment.

       Recent research on sticky prices began with an insight of Mankiw (1985) and Akerlof

and Yellen (1985): imperfect competition and menu costs are not only separate ingredients of

a sticky-price model, but are highly complementary. Critics of sticky-price models point out

that menu costs in the real world are small: it costs something for firms to print menus and

replace price tags, but not very much. How then can menu costs generate price rigidity that

in turn generates recessions with large social costs? The answer is that imperfect competition

creates a wedge between the social and private gains from price adjustment If a firm fails to

reduce its nominal price when the money stock falls, its loss of profits may be small — too

small to warrant paying the menu cost. Nonetheless, with imperfect competition, the social

costs of rigidity may be large.


                                                17
         More concretely, the social costs of price rigidity are likely to exceed the private costs

 because imperfect competition creates aggregate demand externalities. This point is formted

 by Blanchard and Kiyotaki (1987) and Ball and Rower (1989), who use the Dixit-Stiglitz

 model of monopolistic competition. If the money stock falls and prices do not adjust then,

 in these models, the Lower real money stock reduces total spending in the economy. When

 aggregate spending falls, the demand curve facing each firm shifts inward - a firm sells less

 at any given price. Consequently, the firm's profits fall.

        In this setting, the private and social gains from price adjustment are very different. If

 a single firm adjusts its price, it does not change the position of its demand curve; it simply

 moves to a new point on the curve. This adjustment raises profits, but the gain is second
order. In contast, ifjj firms adjusted to the monetary shock, the aggregate price level would

fall, real balances would return to their original level, and each firm's demand curve would

shift back out The gains in profits would be large: a firm gains more from an outward shift

of its demand curve than from a movement along the curve. Unfortunately, an individual firm

does not take this effect into account because, as a small part of the economy, it takes

aggregate spending and hence the position of its demand curve as given. Thus firms may not

bother to make price adjustments that, taken together, would end a recession.

       Blanchard and Kiyotaki and Ball and Rower show that, because of aggregate demand

externalities, costly economic fluctuations can in principle arise from arbitarily small menu

costs. In their models, however, this resuit arises only for exteme parameter values — in
particular, both labor demand and labor supply curves must be very fiat. With plausible

amounts of curvature in production and utility functions, small menu costs cannot generate


                                               18
 substantial nominal rigidity. The reason is that the private costs of rigidity, although smaller

 than the social costs, are large for non-negligible changes in money. Firms and their workers

 would gain substantially from adjusting prices and thereby dampening fluctuations in

 employment and output, even if other firms' prices are rigid. Thus small menu costs do not

 deter them from adjusting.

         These results establish the need for the third foundation of sticky-price models: real

 rigidities.   There are many plausible theories of why relative prices and real wages are
insensitive to shifts in demand. (Our favorites include efficiency wage models, Okun's (1982)

customer-market theory, and Woglom' s (1982) model of kinked product demand based on

imperfect informatiort) As discussed above, real rigidities alone do not yield nominll rigidity.

But, Ball and Romer (1990) show, real rigidities magnify the nominal rigidities arising from

menu costs. The reason is that real rigidities reduce the private cost of nominal rigidity. If

a firm wishes to maintain a stable relative price, and if other nominal prices are rigid, then the

firm desires at most a small nominal adjustment when the money supply falls. The private cost

of forgoing this small adjustment is likely to be smaller than a modest menu cost.. Thus adding

real rigidities to imperfect competition and menu costs helps to explain why firms fail to make

the price adjustments that would neutralize a monetary shock.

        A final feature of recent models is important for answering a common heretical

criticism. The argument is that sticky prices are irrelevant in practice because there is little

correspondence between the sectors of the economy with sticky prices and those that are most

sensitive to monetary shocks. Ahmed (1987), fbr example, demonstrates the lack of correlation

across industries between nominal wage rigidity (measured by the extent of indexation) and


                                               19
 employment variability. Car prices may be more flexible than haircut prices because they are

 set by bargaining; yet the auto industry is more cyclically sensitive than the haircutting
 industry. These facts are, however, consistent with current sticky-price models because

stickiness affects the economy through aggregate demand externalities. The effects of

monetary shocks on aggregate spending, and hence on demand in a given sector, depend on

aggregate nominal rigidity, not rigidity in that sector. It may be the barbers' fault that the

aggregate price level adjusts sluggishly, but this does not help the car salesmen when demand

drops in a recession. Differences in the cycicality of industries arise from other factors; for

example, autos are hit hard by tight money because spending on them is sensitive to interest

rates, whereas spending on haircuts is not



Makin2 the Models Dynamic

       In our view, the ideas discussed above add up to a complete theory of nominal rigidities

in a static setting.    Yet real economies are not static. A basic tenet of traditional
macroeconomics is that money is non-neutral 'at the short mn--a period of a few years—but

neutral in the long run. Can dynamic models with costly price adjustment generate the time-

series responses of prices and output to monetary shocks that we observe in actual economies?

In contrast to static theory, there is considerable disagreement among sticky-price researchers

about the right approach to dynamics.

       Before discussing the difficulties in this area, we should emphasize a basic insight about

dynamics: the role of staggered price adjustment in generating price-level inertia. Sticky-price

models, like all macro models, face the challenge of expltining       the   persistence of output


                                              20
fluctuation& When Paul Volcker tightened monetary policy in October 1979, why was output

depressed until 1984? The particular problem for sticky-price models is that the period for

which downturns last exceeds the period for which most individual prices are sticky. If most

prices are adjusted within a year, as Blinder finds, why doesn't the long-run of monetary

neutrality arrive within a year? The answer, first presented by Taylor (1979) and Blanchard

(1983), is that different firms adjust prices at different times. With synchronized adjustment,

all firms would adjust fully to a monetary shock as soon as their next adjustment date arrived.

With staggering, however, some group of firms must go first in adjusting prices, which means

accepting a tower relative price. With sUong real rigidity, no firm is willing to accept a large

relative cut. instead, different firms take turns m2king small adjustments, and it takes many

rounds of adjustment for the aggregate price level to adjust fully. Thus, full adjustment to a

monetary shock can take much longer than the period for which each price is fixed.

         Beyond this qualitative insight, can we solve dynamic models of price adjustment? The

answer depends on what simplifying assumptions we make. The crucial modelling choice is

between "time-contingent' and "state-contingent" adjustment            Under time-contingent

adjustment, a firm adjusts prices at intervals of a fixed length (which can be chosen optimally

given the cost of adjustment). Under state-contingent adjustment, a finn adjusts whenever the

state   of the economy warrants it usually, it is optimal to follow an "Ss" rule in which the
firm's relative price is adjusted to a base level whenever it hits some bounds.

         The behavior of economies with time-contingent adjustment is now well-understood.

Taylor and Blanchard use time-contingent models to formalize the result that staggering

produces inertia More generally, researchers have derived the dynamic response of the


                                              21
economy to a monetary shock under reasonable conditions.            Typically, an innovation in

nominal money produces smooth adjustment of the aggregate price level over time, with the

speed depending inversely on the degree of real rigidity. The effect on real output is greatest

when the innovation occurs, declines over time, and dies out asymptotically.

       There is no simple summary of results for state-contingent models, because they have

proven much more difficult to solve.       Starting with Caplin and Spulber (1985), impressive

progress has been made in analyzing state-contingent models; current state-of-the-art models

include Caballero and Engel (1992) and Caplin and Leahy (1991a). Unfortunately, strong

restrictions are still needed for tractability. in most models, for example, real rigidity is ruled

out: a firm's desired price depends entirely on the money stock rather than on other firms'

prices. (Caplin and Leahy (1991b) is an exception.) Thus the models do not include the key

source of price inertia under staggered adjustment.

       In any case, the bottom line of state-contingent models is similar to that of time-

contingent models: the price level does not adjust immediately to a monetary shock (except in

very special cases), and so money is not neutral. State-contingent models go beyond time-

contingent models in generating subtle non-linearities. In Caplin and Leahy (199 Ia), for

example, a positive monetary shock is less likely to raise output if it is preceded by other

positive shocks. The empirical relevance of such non-linearities is unclear.

       State-contingent models have recently been more popular than time-contingent models.

The apparent reason is that state-contingent adjustment is optimal for a price setter who faces

a fixed adjustment cost. In this setting, it is arbitrary to assume that the firm adjusts at fixed

intervals, regardless of whether adjustment is warranted by changed circumstances. In our


                                                22
 view, however, the emphasis on exclusively state-contingent models is misplaced. As

 Caballero (1989) shows, time-contingent adjustment is optimal if the main cost of adjustment

 is gathering information about the state rather than making the actual adjustment. State-

 contingent models assume that firms continuously monitor the environment to determine when

 to adjust. Yet it may be less expensive to gather information at fixed intervals. If so, and if

the pure adjustment cost is small, firms naturally adjust prices at these fixed intervals.

        As an empirical matter, time-contingent adjustment is common. Nearly all wages are

adjusted on a fixed time schedule. The same is tue for many output prices; for example, many

finns issue catalogs on a regular schedule. The use of time-contingent rules also explains the

fact that firms often make small price changes (Kashyap, 1987). A small change can be

optimal when the time for adjustment arrives, whereas small changes never happen with state-

contingent adjustment

       In addition, even if many firms make state-contingent adjustments, the behavior of the

aggregate price level can be close to the pure time-contingent case as long as there is some

time-contingent adjustment. This point is made by Bonomo (1992), who studies an economy

with both kinds of adjustment The result follows from the idea, discussed above, that flexible

parts of the economy inherit rigidities from the rigid part of the economy when firms care

about relative prices. In this case, the relevant rigidity is the fixed timing of price adjustment

The fact that time-contingent firms cannot adjust immediately to a large shock means that state-

contingent firms do not want to adjust either.

       Research on dynamic price adjustment is far from complete. In particular, the literature

has produced some surprising results that warrant further investigation. Caplin and Spulber


                                               23
show that monetary neutrality can arise even with sticky prices if firms follow one-sided Ss

rules. Ball (1994a) shows that if finns follow time-contingent rules, then a fully credible

slowdown in money growth can cause an output boom. These theoretical results are important,

even though they have little direct empirical relevance. The Caplin-Spuiber result shows that

explanations for non-neutrality must go beyond the simplest stale-contingent models, for
example by introducing idiosyncratic shocks that cause prices to fall as well as rise. The Ball

result suggests that theories must include credibility problems as well as frictions in price

adjustment Research on these issues is continuing.



What Are Menu Costs?

       The new work on sticky prices has established that menu costs—the underlying nominal

friction producing non-neutrality--can be of trivial size relative to the macroeconomic effects

of non-neutrality. To be sure, they must be strictly positive: there must be some cost to

adjusting prices. The resistance to sticky-price models in some quarters appears to arise from

an unwillingness to allow any cost of nominal adjustment. Is the idea of menu costs plausible?

       Certainly "menu cost? should be interpreted more broadly than the physical costs of

changing price tags. In this sense, the term may be unfortunate. "Menu costs" are a metaphor

like "shoe leather cost?. Some critics have suggested testing menu-cost models by seeing

whether rigidities arise in circumstances of higher technological costs of price changes—for

example, when price tags must be replaced by hand rather than electronically. This is a bit like

testing whether consumers dislike inflation more in countries with less durable footwear.

       We suspect that the most important costs of price adjustment are the time and attention


                                              24
 required of managers to gather the relevant information and make and implement decisions.

 The fact that many wages and prices are adjusted ax faxed intervals of time suggests that

 information-gathering costs are important. At a common-sense level, it seems obvious that it

 is more convenient for busy managers to decide on new prices once a year rather than once

 a day. This fact leads to infrequent adjustment if (as suggested by recent research) the private

 costs of non-adjustment are small.

        In any case, a literal account of menu costs is not necessary for studying most issues

 in maaocconomics. Menu costs should be viewed as a parable—a convenient formalization

 that captures the facts that prices are not adjusted continuously, and that they tend to adjust

 more quickly to large than to small shocks In resting our theories on a parable, we have an

irreproachable precedent: price theory under perfect competition, which rests on the parable of

the Wairasian auctioneer. Wairas observed that prices move to equilibrate supply and demand,

and he captured this tendency with the parable of an auctioneer. Sirnil2rly, macroeconomists

have noted that many prices are sticky in the short run, and they capture this fact with the

parable of menu costs. It is no more appropriate to insist on an exact identification of menu

costs than it is to demand the social security number of the Walrasian auctioneer.

       Of course, it is still interesting to go beyond the parable to better understand the
foundations of nominal frictions. Future research could examine information gathering and

processing costs in actual firms, for example. The analogue in competitive economics is

research that examines the foundations of the auctioneer story, such as the literature on the

convergence of Nash games to perfect competition. Note that microeconomists are rarely

reproached for studying competitive models despite the incompleteness of this research on


                                              25
foundations. Similarly, macroeconomists can use menu-cost models without a complete, literal

account of menu costs.



                             A New View of Aggregate SuoDlv

       The previous section describes recent progress in developing models of sticky prices,

and the challenges that remain. We now ask what the payoff is to all this work One

accomplishment is to put the assumption of price rigidity on firmer foundations. We can now

write down models with sticky prices and teach them to undergraduates without the guilty

feeling that we are doing violence to microeconomics. But beyond providing microeconomic

foundations, have we learned anything about macroeconomics?

       Early menu-cost models were sometimes criticized for failing to generate new empirical

predictions, or to explain previously mysterious phenomena (e.g. Summers, 1988). The models

were designed to produce monetary non-neutrality, and that is all they dicL In our view, the

last five years of research have made this criticism obsolete: an important new branch of

macroeconomics has grown out of models with costly price adjusunent. In particular, the

models lead to a new theory of the supply side of the economy in the short run, a theory with

several novel (and apparently correct) empirical predictions. The simplest way to summarize

the new theory is in terms of the undergraduate model of aggregate demand and aggregate

supply. Sticky-price models provide new answers to several old questions about the short-run

aggregate supply curve:




                                             26
  Why does the age2ate supply curve slone UP?

         Equivalently, why do shifts in monetary policy or other determinants of aggregate

 demand affect real output, rather than prices alone? This question provided the original

 motivation for research on sticky prices. As described above, the answer rests on a
 combination of imperfect competition, menu costs, and real rigidities.



 Why does the slope of the aR2re2ate suønlv curve differ across countries and time oeriods?

        One benefit of deriving rather than assuming nominal price rigidity is that one can

discuss why the degree of rigidity might vary. The new research has shown that a key

determinant of the degree of rigidity—and thus the slope of the aggregate supply curve—is the

level of trend inflation (Ball, Mankiw, and Romer 1988). High inflation leads to more frequent

price changes for given adjustment costs, and more frequent adjustment increases the

responsiveness of prices to monetary shocks: the aggregate supply curve becomes steeper.

Ball, Maniciw, and Romer report strong empirical support for this prediction: average inflation

explains much of the variation in the slope of the aggregate supply curve across countries and

over different eras in a given country. In addition, DeFina (1991) reports evidence of a higher-

frequency time-series relation between trend inflation and the slope of aggregate supply. The

effects of trend inflation are quantitatively important: the Ball-Manldw-Rorner estimates imply

that reducing inflation from ten to five percent more than doubles the output effect of a

monetary shock Thus for example, the output-inflation tradeoff facing U.S. policymakers is

considerably less favorable today than at the outset of the Volcker Ikinflation. And attempts

to achieve zero inflation, as in Canada today, are likely to be very costly.


                                              27
Why does the a22re2ate sunolv curve shift?

        Traditional macroeconomics fell into disfavor in the 1970s in part because of its

inability to explain the stagf]ation arising from supply shocks. These shocks were apparent

movements in the aggregate supply curve, rather than movements along it resulting from

changes in aggregate demand. At one level, this problem was solved when researchers added

"supply shifters" such as world oil prices to empirical Phillips curves. At a deeper level, shifts

in aggregate supply have remained punling. A shift in aggregate supply means a change in

the aggregate price level corresponding to given output As a theoretical matter, it is not clear

why the aggregate price level should be influenced by changes in relative prices, such as an

increase in oil prices arising from OPEC collusion. Indeed, classical theory draws a sharp

dichotomy between relative prices, which depend on real microeconomic factors, and the

overall price level, which depends on the supply and demand for money.

       A new explanation for shifts in aggregate supply, consistent with traditional

macroeconomics, is developed by Ball and Maniciw (1992). The classical argument that

relative prices are unrelated to the aggregate price level implicitly assumes flexibility of

nominal prices. By contrast, we assume that it is costly to adjust prices. The key implication

is that finns adjust prices in response to large shocks, but that it is not worth adjusting to small

shocks. Consequently, large shocks have disproportionately large effects on actual price

adjustment.

       In this setting, the overall price level depends on the distribution of shocks to desired

relative prices. To see this point, consider an example in which the frictionless .relative price

of oil rises by 50%. By the definition of "relative," other relative prices must go down to


                                                28
  balance this increase. Yet it is not usual for some other sector to experience a 50% relative

 decrease when oil prices rise. Instead, the relative decreases are spread across the non-oil

 economy, s%ith many equilibrium prices falling by small amounts. Thus the distribution            of
 desired price changes is asymmetric. With full price flexibility, the increases in the oil sector

 and decreases in other sectors average to zero.             But with menu costs, and hence

 disproportionate adjustment to large shocks, the asymmetry in shocks has aggregate effects.

 The actual increases in oil prices are larger than the decreases in other sectors, and the

 aggregate price level rises. Thus the model can explain an increase in the price level for given

 aggregate demand.

        Ball and Mankiw show that this idea has wide applicability. Empirically, we measure

the relative incidence of large positive and large negative shocks with the skewness of the

distribution of price changes.   If the distribution is skewed   to the right, for example, there are

large positive shocks, which tend to raise the price level. We find that movements in the

skewness of price changes explain a large fraction of U.S. supply shocks, or shifts in the short-

run Phillips curve, both in the OPEC era since the 1970s and in earlier periods. Indeed, our

measures    of skewness outperform traditional supply shifters such as food and energy: they fit
better in sample, display greater subsample stability, and better explain various historical

episodes.



Why might the aggreQate suoolv curve be non-linear?

       One theme in traditional thinking is that the slope of aggregate supply is likely to be

different for increasesand decreases in aggregate demand. Tobin (1972) and others argue that



                                                29
 decreases in demand have large output effects, whereas increases in demand trigger larger price

 responses and therefore have smaller output effects. Typically, traditionalists obtain this result

 simply by assuming that prices are more sticky downwards than upwards.

        Recently, sticky-price theorists have shown that an asymmetric aggregate supply curve

 arises endogenously under natural conditions. Different versions of the argument appear in

 Tsiddon (1991), BalI and Mankiw (1994), and Caballero and Engel (1992). In all cases, the

crucial assumption is positive trend inflation. In an environment with trend inflation, finns'

relative prices fall automatically between nominal adjustments. In this setting, a firm does not

need to make a special adjustment if a negative shock reduces its desired relative price:

inflation automatically does the work. In contrast, a positive shock means that the firm's

desired relative price is rising while its actual price is falling, creating a large gap between

desired and actual prices. Thus a positive shock triggers quick nominal adjustment, whereas

prices are sticky in response to substantial negative shocks - exactly the asymmetry that Tobin

and others assume.

       A number of empirical studies present evidence that monetary shocks indeed have

asymmetric effects on real output. See Cover (1992), DeLong and Summers (1988), and

Morgan (1993). This finding is yet another empirical result that is explained by new research

on sticky prices.



Conclusion

       A scientific theory should be judged not only by the intrinsic appeal of its assumptions,

but also by its ability to explain observed facts—especially ones that it was not explicitly


                                               30
designed to explain. Menu-cost models were intoduced to explain the first feature of the

aggregate supply curve—its upward slope—but Mankiw and Akerlof-Yellen were not thinking

of asyininethes or cross-county differences in aggregate supply, and certainly not the relation

between inflation and the sketmess of price changes. As menu-cost models have developed,

they have yielded a unified explanation for many of the empirical features of aggregate supply.
