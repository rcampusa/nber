                                          ABSTRACT

Access to new foreign technology is often central to countries’ development strategies. However,
we know very little about the quantitative impact of technology sourcing. In this paper, we study
the role of outward international business travel for technology sourcing and innovation by
examining whether patenting in European regions is affected by the number of business travelers
heading to the United States. Using European regional patent data for the years 1996 to 2010
from Eurostat and information on incoming business travelers from the U.S. Department of
Commerce’s Survey of International Air Travelers, we find that controlling for a region’s R&D
spending and size, innovation is increasing in the number of business travelers of the region to the
United States. Technology sourcing through in-person business travel is not only statistically but
economically significant, accounting, for example, for 20% of the higher patenting in Germany’s
Greater Stuttgart area, compared to Portugal’s Algarve region.

1       Introduction
Acquisition of new foreign technology is often central to countries’ development strategies. A case
in point is South Korea, one of the so-called East Asian miracle countries (World Bank 1993), which
encouraged its students, scientists, and engineers to go abroad to acquire leading-edge technology
that upon their return would improve domestic technology. In the mid-1970s, the fraction of
South Korea’s post-secondary student population studying abroad was six times what it was for
Argentina, for example (Westphal, Kim, and Dahlman 1984).1 Despite the prominence of such
activities in accounts of successful catch-up and development, we know very little empirically about
the importance of technology sourcing. In this paper, we examine the role of outward international
business travel for technology sourcing and innovation.

This paper asks whether patenting in European regions is affected by the extent to which its busi-
ness travelers head to the United States, a country that is widely considered to be close to the
world’s technology frontier. Because technology is first and foremost knowledge–a blueprint– it
might seem that business travel is unnecessary since blueprints, as a form of disembodied knowl-
edge, can easily be emailed for use abroad. And yet, researchers studying technology diffusion em-
phasize that technological knowledge contains non-codifiable elements that make it ’tacit’ (silent),
and that face-to-face meetings are an effective way in which such knowledge is transferred (Polanyi
1966; see discussion in Keller 2004).

Employing European regional patent data level for the years 1996 to 2010 from Eurostat and infor-
mation on US business travelers from the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Survey of International
Air Travelers (SIAT), we find that controlling for a region’s R&D spending and size, innovation
increases with the number of outward business travelers from a given region to the United States.
Because our data provides information not only on the European traveler’s city of residence but
also US destination county, we can account for differences in the knowledge content gained from
business trips by accounting for R&D differences across US regions. For example, a business trip
to Silicon Valley is expected to provide more knowledge than a trip to a typical town in the
American Midwest, and more generally we exploit the idea that travel to high-R&D locations
improves patenting by more than travel to locations with less R&D. The relationship between
outward business travel and patenting is not only statistically but also economically significant.
For example, technology sourcing through business travel to the US accounts for about 20% of the
higher patenting in the Greater Stuttgart area, compared to Portugal’s Algarve region.

This paper contributes to a large and growing literature on international technology diffusion
    1
    The fact that some of those heading abroad eventually choose to not return matters quantitatively, but it does
not negate the point in principle.

(Keller 2010 is a survey). While trade based on exogenously given productivity differences can
be seen as a form of international technology diffusion, the substantially higher performance of
outward-oriented economies compared to inward-oriented economies is hard to explain without
accounting for the flows of tacit knowledge between economic agents who take part in international
transactions.2

The literature so far has focused on international trade and foreign direct investment to explain
why outward-oriented economies perform better compared to inward-oriented economies. In par-
ticular, we know that economies benefit if their import composition is tilted towards technologically
innovative trade partners (Keller 2000, 2002a), and that firms gain in productivity by engaging in
export activity (learning-by-exporting; van Biesebroeck 2005, De Loecker 2007). Quantitatively
important technology learning spillovers from inward FDI have been documented for countries as
diverse as China, the United States, and Lithuania (Jiang, Keller, Qiu, and Ridley 2019, Keller
and Yeaple 2009, and Javorcik 2004, respectively). Our paper provies an additional explanation,
the flows of tacit knowledge that are associated with business travel.

Some authors examine the relationship between international business travel and these channels of
technology diffusion, in particular FDI. For example, Foley and Kerr (2013) note that international
business travel may help to explain why a higher share of inventors from a certain ethnicity lead
to an expansion of multinational employment in the region where this ethnicity is prevalent.3
A smaller literature has examined the role for international business travel in the diffusion of
technology. Hovhannisyan and Keller (2015) show that US business travelers generate positive
learning externalities in the countries to which they fly to. By studying travelers from Europe
who travel to the United States, this paper focuses on technology sourcing.4 Technology sourcing
related to multinational activity has been analyzed by Almeida (1996) and Branstetter (2002), and
the research most closely related to ours may be Griffith, Harrison, and van Reenen (2006) who
show that UK firms tap into leading-edge knowledge by locating R&D activities into the United
States. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first paper that estimates the importance of
business travel for international technology sourcing.

The remainder of this paper is as follows. Section 2 provides information on the sources and main
patterns of the data, with more details on data construction given in the Appendix. The following
section 3 introduces our statistical model and discusses the sources of identification. All estimation
results are given in section 4. We present a number of concluding thoughts in section 5.

2       Data and Summary Statistics
This section describes our main data sources and provides initial evidence by examining key pat-
terns in the data.
Travel The information on international air travel in this paper comes from the Survey of Inter-
national Air Travelers (SIAT) which is conducted by the International Trade Administration, a
branch of the U.S. Department of Commerce. This survey provides information on travel of Eu-
ropean countries’ residents to the United States during the years 1993 to 2003 (see the Appendix
for details). The data has information on the travelers’ European city of residence, U.S. destina-
tion county and the purpose of the travel (business or other). We aggregate this data to business
travelers from a given European city to a given U.S. state. Further, we match European cities
to regions based on documentation from the Eurostat at the NUTS 2 level. Figure 1 shows the
NUTS 2 regions of Europe (2010 classification) constructed from the Eurostat Statistical Atlas.
We have consistently coded the travel data taking account of changes in the European regional
classification; see the Appendix for a detailed description.

Table 1 shows some basic patterns of outward business travel from European regions to the United
States. It is clear from Table 1 that there is substantial variation in business travel originating from
various European regions. There are also important size (gravity) effects; Lombardia (ranked 5th) ,
for example, with Milan, has a larger population than Sardinia (Sardegna), which is ranked among
the regions with the lowest number of originating business travelers. The top regions from which
business travelers come to the U.S. are London, Île de France (including Paris), and Oberbayern
(which contains Munich).

Table 2 presents information on patterns of European business travel to each U.S. state. Note that
size plays a role here as well (California, New York, and Florida are all big states).
In addition to size, the destination of European travelers appears to be also determined by other
considerations. Despite its relatively small size, the District of Columbia, for example, hosts a
relatively high number of R&D plants, and regions in which a lot of R&D is performed should
matter more for technology sourcing than regions where little R&D is done. In order to account
for differences in local technological capacity in the United States we employ R&D data by the
U.S. National Science Foundation to construct R&D stocks of each state.5
Table 3 shows information on R&D stocks across U.S. states in our sample.
Our technology sourcing variable for European region r in year t, BizT ravSourcert , is defined as
follows:

   We follow Keller (2002a) and others in constructing R&D stocks using the perpetual inventory method; see the
Appendix for details.

where RDst is the R&D stock of U.S. state s in year t. Following Griffith, Harrison, and van Reenen
(2006), in order to reduce endogeneity concerns we employ pre-sample weights in the construction
of BizT ravSourcert : Brs is defined as the average number of business travelers between European
region r and U.S. state s over the years 1993 to 1995. The weighting with Brs in this expression
incorporates the idea that travelers flying to a state s where more R&D is performed may have a
greater impact on European innovation than travelers that journey to a state s0 where less R&D
is performed because the former has more technology than the latter.

Innovation The dependent variable in our analysis is constructed from patent applications to the
European Patent Office (EPO) of a given NUTS 2 region in the years 1996 to 2010 as recorded by
the Eurostat. This data comes from the regional statistics database of Eurostat which provides
data on patent applications by year and NUTS 2 region.6 We focus on applications to the EPO
since we are interested in understanding the impact of knowledge transfer on domestic innovation
in European regions. Furthermore, by restricting the analysis to EPO patent applications we
ensure that the innovations will pass the same quality standard and are comparable. The top ten
and bottom ten European patenting regions are presented in Table 4, showing that there is a large
amount of variation in regional patenting. In the regression analysis below we will focus on each
region’s share in all of Europe’s patenting.

Other variables In addition to technology sourcing, a region’s level of innovation may depend on
the region’s own level of R&D spending, and perhaps also on R&D at the country level, perhaps
due to different innovation cycles at the country level. Therefore we control for regional (NUTS 2)
and country level R&D (source: Eurostat, regional statistics database). The size and development
level of each region may matter, among others, for its domestic technology absorptive capacity,
and consequently we include data on GDP for each region. The data on GDP for each NUTS 2
region for the years 1996 to 2010 is from Cambridge Econometrics European Regional Database.

Summary statistics of the data are presented in Table 5. After combining the various sources
of data, our baseline sample has 2,185 observations from 22 countries and 254 NUTS 2 regions.
The countries included in the analysis are Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Germany,
Denmark, Greece, Spain, Finland, France, Croatia, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway,
Poland, Portugal, Romania, Sweden, Slovakia, and United Kingdom. We have an unbalanced data
set, due especially to missing R&D data; the influence of this will be examined below. The first
   6
    We use the date of patent application compared to the grant date to ensure that the differences in processing
times would not be a factor.

row of Table 5 shows each region’s share of all European patents. On average, a region has a
share of 0.3% of all European patenting, with some regions accounting for a substantially higher
fraction.
The next three rows in Table 5 show descriptive statistics (in natural logarithms) on measures of
regional R&D expenditures and regional GDP, as well as country level measure of R&D expendi-
tures for each country where each region is located. The figures confirm that there is a substantial
amount of heterogeneity across these regions.
The next section introduces our estimation framework.



3       Statistical Model
Our empirical specification is given by the following estimation equation

                 share_patrt = β1 BizT ravSourcert + β2 RDrt + β 0 X + ωr + τt + εrt ,                         (2)

where the dependent variable is share_patrt is the share of European region r in all European
patenting of year t, and BizT ravSourcert is the US state R&D-weighted sum of outward business
travelers to the US from region r in year t defined in equation (1) above. Simply put, we seek
to explain the composition of European patenting across regions by the composition of outward
business travel to the United States.7

Another variable that may influence innovation is each region’s own R&D effort, RDrt , defined as
region r0 s R&D stock in year t. The vector X includes region r0 s GDP in year t as a size control
    7
    In the absence of differences in bilateral travel patterns to the US, BizT ravSourcert would simply be equal to
the sum of US state R&D, which would not be identified separately from time fixed effects.

                                                        11
and, in some regressions, other variables which may exert an influence on patenting.
As noted earlier, the business travel variable BizT ravSourcert is constructed using pre-sample data
for 1993-95 to reduce endogeneity concerns. We also include time fixed effect, τt , that captures
common shocks, as well as regional fixed effects at the NUTS 2 level, ωr ; the latter addresses
unobserved and observed time-invariant heterogeneity across regions. We assume that the error
term εrt is well behaved and estimate the equation with OLS, allowing for dependence by employing
clustered standard errors.

The inclusion of regional fixed effects in equation (2) means that identification comes solely from
time-variation within each region. The coefficient of primary interest β1 will be positive, providing
evidence for technology sourcing through outward business travel, if regions whose outward US
business travel grows or shifts towards more high-tech destinations typically account for a larger
share of European patenting. European travel patterns to destinations other than the US may
affect patenting; furthermore, based on existing evidence one would expect that regional trade
and FDI patterns may matter as well. Due to the unavailability of suitable data, here we cannot
explicitly address these points, and we assume that the influence of these factors are captured at
least in part by regional R&D and GDP. Note that country-level changes of non-business travel
factors will be addressed in the robustness analysis below by including country-by-year fixed effects;
as we will see this does not much change the results.



4     Empirical Results

4.1    Main Results
Table 6 shows estimation results based on a number of different versions of equation (2) above.
In order to show which determinants matter and which do less so, the baseline specification is
developed step by step. We begin by including the business travel, technology sourcing variable
only with a time trend; column (1) shows that the bilateral correlation between patent share and
outward business travelers is positive and significant. Year fixed effects capture common shocks
to these European regions, which may have become more common due to the introduction of a
common currency, the Euro, in 1999. Replacing the trend with year fixed effects, we see that this
does not have a major impact on this result (column (2)).

Regions located in different European countries are likely subject to shocks at the country level,
such as national innovation policies. To capture these effects we introduce country fixed effects in
column (3); the increase in R2 indicates that country effects can account for some of the variation
in patenting, however, the change in the point estimate for the sourcing variable is relatively small.

                                                 12
Next, we include each region’s R&D, which is time-varying, together with regional fixed effects as
controls for heterogeneity at the regional level (standard errors are now clustered at the region and
year level, 254 regions and 15 years). The coefficient on regional R&D is positive, as expected,
and the business traveler sourcing variable has now a coefficient of 4.6% (column (4)).

Accounting for changes in the size of the region, as measured by GDP, does not lead to major
changes in our technology sourcing findings (column (5)). Furthermore, R&D at the country level
has only a marginally positive coefficient (column (6)). Including country R&D reduces somewhat
the size of the regional R&D coefficient, likely because of the positive correlation of the two. In
contrast, the outward business travel coefficient increases somewhat to 5.1%, significant at standard
levels.
Finally, a simple analysis of the economic magnitudes is provided by comparing standardized
regression coefficients (or, beta coefficients), once each variable has been rescaled to have zero
mean and a standard deviation of one. These coefficients are shown in column (7) in hard brack-
ets. According to these results, outward business travel to the US is of great importance for the
composition of European patenting. In particular, it is exceeding that of the region’s own R&D
spending (beta coefficients of 0.48 and 0.08, respectively). Of course, given the extent to which
patenting and business travel is distributed across European regions the average effect does not
necessarily apply to most regions. It is thus instructive to compare two particular European re-
gions, for example the Stuttgart area in Germany and Portugal’s Algarve region. Recall from
Table 4 that in terms of patenting, the former is highly innovative compared to the latter. Based
on our estimates in column (6), the higher sourcing benefit from US business travel for the Greater
Stuttgart area accounts for almost 20% of the higher patenting in Stuttgart when compared to the
Algarve region.
Overall, these results provide evidence that technology sourcing through business travel is an
important channel of technology diffusion.



4.2    Robustness Checks
This section discusses a number of important robustness checks, see Table 7 for the results. The
first column repeats the baseline finding from Table 1 (column (6)) for comparison. The next
specification allows for arbitrary year-to-year changes in patenting at the country level by including
country-by-year fixed effects. This leads to a moderate increase for the technology sourcing point
estimate, and we conclude that our findings do not primarily reflect shocks at the country-year
level.

Table 6: Basic Results




         14
Table 7: Robustness Analysis




            15
The next three specifications explore robustness of the results with respect to sample composition.
First, Germany is Europe’s biggest economy, and we have seen above that German regions account
for a substantial portion of all patenting in Europe. Dropping German regions from the sample,
however, does not lead to a major change in the technology sourcing coefficient (see column (3)).
Furthermore, as noted above there is no patent and R&D data for some of the regions annually
during our sample period. To understand the influence of the regions’ entry and exit from the
sample for the results we examine a more balanced sample with eleven or more observations per
NUTS 2 region. As seen from column (4), the business traveler-sourcing coefficient is now higher,
at about 8%. It is reassuring that we estimate a positive coefficient with the more balanced
sample, because it suggests that the entry and exit from the sample mainly generates noise that
is weakening the estimated relationship between US business travel and regional patenting.

In a final check on sample composition we focus on observations with strictly positive levels of
technology sourcing. This sheds light on whether our findings are mostly driven by European
regions from which business travelers to the US are originating, versus those regions where this is
not the case. The results in column (5) indicate that this is not the case.

The following specifications examine whether the technology sourcing effect associated with out-
ward business travel has become weaker or stronger over time. First, we introduce an interaction
between BizT ravSourcert and an indicator for years after 2002. As shown in column (6), this
interaction is not significant at standard levels. This finding does not change when we introduce
additional post-2002 interactions for regional R&D, regional GDP, and country-level R&D (col-
umn (7)). Finally, the last column in Table 7 shows that the finding of no major change in the
relationship between technology sourcing through business travel over time largely holds as well for
the sub-sample for which we have at least eleven observations per region. This suggests that tech-
nology sourcing through business travel is not an important reason why international technology
diffusion has increased over time (as shown in Keller 2002b).

Overall, we find evidence for a statistically and economically significant relationship between busi-
ness travel to the US and European patenting.




                                                 16
5       Conclusions
The results of this paper suggest for developing countries seeking to catch-up to foreign technology,
that in-person meetings in the U.S. are essential to capture tacit knowledge. This paper goes hand-
in-hand with Hovhannisyan and Keller (2015) that shows business travel by U.S. travelers carry
the non-codified knowledge overseas as well. Together, the papers provide consistent support for
the importance of face-to-face meetings for international technology diffusion.

Using European regional data of U.S.-bound business-travelers from 1993-1995 and regional patent
data for 1996-2010, this paper finds evidence that patenting in a region rises as the number of
business travelers to the U.S. increase, even after controlling for a set of other regional and country
variables that could affect a region’s innovation. These results remain robust after adding country-
by-year fixed effects, dropping German regions from the sample, and after narrowing the sample
to those countries for which we have, or close to, annual data.

The effects are also economically significant. Twenty percent of the difference in patenting between
the Greater Stuttgart area --one of the regions with the highest average outward business travelers
to the U.S.-- and the Algarve region in Portugal can be explained by Stuttgart’s high level of
in-person business conducted in the United States.

However, we caution the reader that our results are limited in a few ways by a lack of suitable
data. First, the paper is missing non-US destination travel patterns which could systematically
affect the results. Second, regional trade and FDI patterns may also have an effect on regional
patenting. These unobserved variables will be captured in part by the included regional R&D and
GDP variables however, it would be useful to re-examine our findings once suitable regional data
on trade and FDI is available.

The evidence in this paper provides support for the notion that some technological knowledge can
not be expressed in written form. This paper is also relevant to recent claims that China is “stealing
technology” because the results suggest that merely having blueprints is not enough to implement
technology effectively.8 Rather, China’s technological improvements --the evidence suggests--is
coming from face-to-face interactions between US and Chinese engineers associated with FDI and
other international transactions involving the meeting of domestic and foreign nationals.

Appendix
This section gives additional details on the sources and construction of our variables.
Travel
The data on international air travel comes from the Survey of International Air Travelers (SIAT),
which is conducted by the United States Office of Travel and Tourism Industries, a branch of
the International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce. SIAT collects data on
non-U.S. residents traveling to the U.S. and U.S. residents traveling from the U.S (excluding
Canada). This survey has been carried out monthly starting from 1983 on randomly selected
flights from the major U.S. international gateway airports for over 70 participating domestic and
foreign airlines. Questionnaires in 12 languages are distributed onboard U.S. outbound flight to
international destinations.

In this paper we use data on European residents traveling to the United States in the period
of 1993-1995. Although the data on 1993-2003 is available, we only use data for the pre-period
1993-1995 to reduce endogeneity concerns. Information on travel comes from an individual-level
database which has information on traveler’s European city of residence, main purpose of the trip,
secondary purposes of the trip, main destination US counties, secondary destination US counties,
and quarter and year of travel. Data is aggregated up to US destination states, and both main
destination and secondary destination states are coded. Individual observations are expanded if a
particular individual traveled to distinct destination states, treating each destination as a separate
trip. If a particular traveler mentioned multiple purposes of the trip, each purpose is given equal
weight. Further, expanded individual travel observations for business purposes are aggregated by
European city of residence and destination US state. After matching European city of residence
to NUTS 2 regions (see below), business travel data is constructed, Brs , as the average number of
business travelers between European region r and U.S. state s over the years 1993 to 1995.

Eurostat data and NUTS classification
European cities are matched to NUTS 3 2010 classification regions based on this source file:
https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/Ttypologies and local information corresponding to NUTS3.xls.
Further, NUTS 3 regions are aggregated up to NUTS 2 regions. Eurostat constantly revises the
NUTS classication, however, data on regional patenting and R&D and country R&D from Eurostat
were presented in either NUTS 2010 or 2013 classification. All inconsistencies were manually
checked and corrected based on documentation from Eurostat available at
https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/nuts/history.

US R&D stocks

                                                 20
R&D expenditures by U.S. states during years 1996 to 2007 were available from the NSF’s Survey of
Industrial Research and Development (SIRD), while data for the years 2008 to 2010 were obtained
from NSF’s Business Research and Development and Innovation Survey (BRDIS). In the years
1991 to 1997 data was collected only in odd years, therefore data on R&D for the year 1996 was
linearly interpolated.

Using R&D expenditures data from 1996-2014, R&D capital stocks (S) which are defined as
beginning of period stocks, were constructed from R&D expenditures (R) based on the perpetual
inventory model, St = (1 − δ)St−1 + Rt−1 , where δ is the depreciation or obsolescence rate, which
is assumed to be 5 percent. The benchmark stock of R&D is calculated as S0 = R0 /(g + δ), where
g is the average annual logarithmic growth of R&D expenditures over this period, and R0 is the
first year in which data was available for all states. The data for R&D expenditures was available
from 1991, however several states had missing observations during the years of 1991-1995, therefore
1996 is chosen as the first year. Finally, RDst , is obtained as the R&D stock for each state s and
each year t for the years 1996-2010, which is used for the construction of our technology sourcing
variable.

Patent data
Patent applications to the European Patent Office (EPO) by priority year and NUTS classification
in the period of 1996 to 2010 were obtained from the Eurostat’s regional statistics database.
Priority date corresponds to the first filing worldwide and is the closest to the invention date.
Therefore priority date in the text is referred to as the application date. We use patent applications
to the EPO by each NUTS 2 European region and application year for the years 1996 to 2010.
Although Eurostat provides data by European NUTS regions for up to year 2012, we only use data
up to 2010 as data on 2011 and 2012 data was incomplete. This is a common occurrence with
patent data as the last several years in the patent datasets are prone to truncation issues.

According to Eurostat documentation, regional patent data is assigned based on inventor’s place of
residence. This approach allows measuring the inventive capacity of each region. For applications
with multiple inventors, the patent is divided equally among all of the inventors resulting in
fractional counting and thus avoiding double counting. Finally, the dependent variable in our
analysis share_patrt is constructed as the share of each European NUTS 2 region r in all European
patenting of year t.
