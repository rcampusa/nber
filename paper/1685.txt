            Productivity Growth in Manufacturing
               During Early Industrialization:
                 Evidence from the American
                   Northeast, 1820 to 1860


                            ABSTRACT




         This paper reports estimates of labor and total factor

productivity, for thirteen manufacturing industries in the Northeast

over the period from 1820 to 1860. It finds that although the highly

mechanized and capital—intensive industries, such as cotton and wool

textiles, realized somewhat more rapid progress than the others did, even

the latter managed major advances. The evidence appears to support the

conclusion that the manufacturing sector in the Northeast was quite

dynamic during this stage of industrialization, and that much of its

early productivity growth can be explained by changes in production

processes that did not require mechanization or substantial increases

in capital intensity. This suggests, as has been argued by a number of

recent studies building on an old tradition, that developments such as

increases in the division and intensity of labor within firms and other

relatively subtle alterations in technique, perhaps stimulated by the

expansion of markets, may have played important roles in accounting for

the progress achieved.

          It has long been recognized that industrialization got under

way in the U. S. early in the nineteenth century, and was largely

concentrated in the Northeast throughout the antebellum period. The

dramatic sectoral reallocation of reBources that accompanied this

process is generally acknowledged to have yielded a significant gain in

measured per capita income, if only because resources in that region

were more productive in industries other than agriculture. The extent

of productivity growth within sectors, however, remains unclear. This

gap in our knowledge has been a serious obstacle to improving

our understanding of this initial phase of industrialization, because

the record of productivity is so closely related to issues of the sources,

location, timing, and nature of this episode in American economic

growth.

          Evidence on the progress realized in manufacturing, in

particular, would have a direct bearing on whether the surge of rapid

industrial expansion in the Northeast was driven by dynamic manufacturing

industries that were generating sustained increases in productivity and

income, or by a declining agricultural sector that was finding it

increasingly difficult to compete with producers outside the region.

Moreover, industry—specific estimates would help determine to what

degree early productivity growth in manufacturing was linked to capital

deepening or capital—augmenting innovations. Some scholars have

suggested that these factors were virtual prerequisites for major gains
                                                                  2




in productivity, while others have emphasized that changes in the

organization of labor, increases in the intensity of work, and other

alterations in production processes that were not dependent on

additional capital equipment per unit of labor may have been important

sources of measured advances (Chandler, 1977; David, 1975; Landes, 1969, 1985;

Lazonick and Brush, 1985; Marglin, 1974; Sokoloff, 1984b).

        Despite the clear significance of the issues involved, there

have been few studies of productivity growth during early U. S.

industrialization due to the relative inaccessibility of evidence.'

Recently—collected samples of firm data from the schedules of the 1820

Census of Manufactures and the McLane Report of 1832 provide valuable

new sources of information however (Sokoloff, 1982). Employing these

bodies of evidence in conjunction with the Bateman—Weiss samples of

firms from the schedules of both the 1850 and the 1860 Census of

Manufactures, and the aggregate data from those censuses, this paper

seeks to establish the record of productivity growth in northeastern

manufacturing during this critical period of industrial development.

        These sources are not without flaws, but the richness of the

information they contain make them together an unequalled collection of

material for research on the subject. All of them provide reports of

the value of outputs produced and the quantity or value of inputs

utilized, and thus indexes of productivity can be estimated for many

industries in each of the four years. Perhaps the primary concern

involving the quality of the data, is that the firms included in the

four cross—sectional samples from the manufacturing survey and censuses
                                                                  3



 may not be representative of the population of northeastern

 manufacturing firms during the respective years.2 Problems of the

 representativeness of data are always a serious matter and require

 special care in conducting the analysis. Nevertheless, as will be

 discussed below, the sample selection biases that afflict these bodies

 of evidence seem unlikely to be responsible for the qualitative results

uncovered.

         This paper reports estimates of labor and total factor

productivity, for thirteen manufacturing industries in the Northeast

over the period from 1820 to 1860. It finds that although the highly

mechanized and capital—intensive industries, such as cotton and wool

textiles, realized somewhat more rapid progress than the others did, even

the latter managed major advances. The evidence appears to support the

conclusion that the manufacturing sector in the Northeast was quite

dynamic during this stage of industrialization, and that much of its

early productivity growth can be explained by changes in production

processes that did not require mechanization or substantial increases

in capital intensity. This suggests, as has been argued by a number of

recent studies building on an old tradition, that developments such as

increases in the division and intensity of labor vithin firms and other

relatively subtle alterations in technique, perhaps stimulated by the

expansion of markets, may have played important roles in accounting for

the progress achieved.

        Estimates of labor productivity over the period are

presented in section II of the paper. The procedures employed in
                                                                      4



constructing them are discussed in some   detail,   and   although   they were

consciously designed to yield conservative estimates of the increase in

productivity, weighted averages indicate rates of labor productivity

growth that are quite high by nineteenth— or twentieth—century

standards. There is evidence of an acceleration in the pace of

advance, particularly in the less machanized and capital—intensive

industries. Estimates of total factor productivity are        presented    in

section III. They reveal that if one treats firm      valuations     of their

capital investments as relatively accurate assessments of the capital

input, as it is contended here that one should, the data imply that

most manufacturing industries realized large gains in total factor

productivity over the period. As all classes of industries appear to

have manifested similar rates of progress, doubts about the primacy of

capital deepening or capital intensity in generating productivity

growth are reinforced. Moreover, the estimated advances are          of   such a

magnitude that they appear to account, together with increases in the

ratio of raw materials to labor, for nearly all     of    the rise in labor

productivity. Some general remarks on what these findings suggest

imply about   the early stages of industrialization in the U. S. are

offered in section IV.
                                                                  S

         There are at least several reasons why the record of labor

 productivity deserves separate treatment from that of total factor

 productivity. Perhaps the major one iB that movements in labor

productivity convey information about the evolution of production methods

that is not generally contained in the more comprehensive measure.

Since several of the most important issues relating to the development

of manufacturing technology during early industrialization concern the

direction and extent of changes in factor proportions, it would seem

desirable to examine both labor and total factor productivity. The

availability of the two series is also useful in that investigation of

apparent inconsistencies between them can help to identify problems

with the data or of interpretation. Finally, it might be argued that

because movements in output per unit of labor are more closely related

to those in per capita income, establishing the record of labor

productivity, even in only this single sector of the economy, would by

itself directly contribute to our understanding of economic growth

during this critical period. The accounting exercise of decomposing

the responsibility for increases in labor productivity between changes

in factor proportions and total factor productivity, for example, may

yield results suggestive of what similar calculations for per capita

income would indicate.

        Two measures of labor productivity are employed here, value added

per equivalent worker and gross output per equivalent worker.
                                                                 6



Estimates expressed in current dollars are presented in Tables 1 4ad 2,

respectively, for thirteen industries at the years 1820, 1832,   1850,
and 1860. The industries examined were selected so as to cover both

the major ones of the period and a broad cross—section of the

manufacturing sector, subject to the limitations imposed by the need

for each industry to be reasonably well represented in the samples of

manufacturing firm data and a desire to maintain conventional

industrial classifications.3 Some industries do not have estimates of

productivity reported f or certain years, because of an inadequate

number of observations, but the threshold for inclusion was set to keep

the number of omissions low.

        Three sets of estimates, ,   , and    are reported

for each industry. They are computed over different subsets of firma,

with the variation in composition attributable to the progressive

application of increasingly stringent standards for separating

establishments likely to be operating part—time from those in full—time

production. Part—time enterprises should be excluded from the sub—

samples over which the estimates are prepared, because the measured

productivity levels of such firms are biased downward due to the

general practice of reporting the average labor input over the period

in operation, rather than over the entire year.4 Since these firms

generally failed to explicitly identify themselves, several methods of

ordering the establishments by their probability of being part—time

operators, so that selected proportions could be dropped from the sub—

samples over which productivity was estimated, were applied to the
                                                                                                               7

Notes     Sources: The firm—level estimates were computed from the

samples of northeastern manufacturing firm data drawn from tbe

schedules of the 1820, 1850) and 1860 Federal Censuses of Manufactures

and the McLane Report (U. S. Rouse of Representatives, 1832). The

aggregate estimates were computed from the industry—wide information

reported by state in V. S. Census Office (1858, 1865). The figures

reported for 1832, 1850, and 1860 are based on information that

probably pertains primarily to the operations of firms in 1831, 1849,

and 1859 respectively. The estimates were calculated as the ratio of

the industry value added (or the value of output minus the cost of the

raw materials) to the total number of equivalent adult male workers in

the industry. The number of equivalent workers was computed according

to the formulation: TE   11 +   0.5   (F + B) + B, where TE is the number

of equivalent adult male workers, M is the number of adult male

employees, F and B are the numbers of female and boy employees

respectively, and B is set equal to one per firm as the measure of the

entrepreneurial input. In 1850 and 1860, firms generally did not

separately enumerate adult males and boys. Accordingly, the reported

numbers of male employees in those years were decomposed into adults

and boys by assuming that boys accounted for the same proportions, by

industry, of male employees as tbey had in 1820. In those industries

in which boys had accounted for more than 33 percent of male employees

in 1820, it was further assumed that the shares had been reduced to 33
                                                                           9




 percent by 1850 and 1860.

            The estimates based on firm   data   were computed over sub—samples

 from the various years that have observations deleted from them in

order to control for the effects of establishments that operated only

part—time and other outliers. The method adopted to identify potential

part—time firms utilized tvo distributions of firms        for   each year by total

factor productivity, one computed with gross output as the measure of

output (TFP) and the other treating value added as that measure (NFP). The

guiding principle was that the lower the total factor productivity of a

firm   in   a given year, the more likely the firm was a part—time

operation and should be truncated from the sub—sample of establishments

over 'which the productivity estimates were computed.

            Three sets of productivity estimates have been prepared from

three corresponding sets of firm sub—samples.         The sets of sub—samples

vary in composition by the successive truncations made primarily to

exclude part—time firms    from the   calculations. The 4    set   of

estimates were computed over sub—samples of firms 'with no adjustments

for part—time operators. •The establishments dropped from the samples

of firms that reported all of the necessary information and did not

explicitly identify themselves as part—time enterprises to obtain the ,4

sub—samples included those with negative value added, a few other large

outliers, and those who placed in the top 3 percent of enterprises in

the respective years by both measures of total factor productivity.

These criteria led to 4 percent being truncated from the 1820 sample, 3

percent from that in 1832, 5 percent in 1850, and 4 percent from the
                                                                     10




sample in 1860.

        Set   B is based on more severe truncations of the left—tails

of the distributions of firms by total factor productivity. For the

1820 sub—sample, establishments that ranked in the lowest 30 percent by both

measures of total factor productivity were dropped from sub—sample ,

to get .      The corresponding percentages were 5 percent in 1832, 10

percent in 1850, and 10 percent in 1860. The smaller proportions

truncated from the samples of later years reflect the presumed decline

over time in the fraction of firma operating part—time, as well as the

desire to bias the estimated productivity growth rate downward. In

order to achieve this latter goal, one would seek to overestimate the

proportion of establishments in 1820 that operated part—time, and

underestimate the proportion in 1860.    A particularly small proportion

was dropped from the 1832 sample because enumerators from the NcLane

Report indicated that nearly all of the establishments covered from the

states considered here were operating throughout the year. The total

proportions of firms excluded from the entire samples to obtain set I

were 29 percent in 1820, 5 percent in 1832, 9 percent in 1850, and 10

percent in 1860.                     -


        For set , even larger fractions of the firms in the samples
were truncated. Firms that, by either measure of total factor

productivity, were in the bottom 40 percent of the 1820 sample were

left out of the sub—sample that was the basis for the      estimates of

that year. The corresponding threshold points for truncation from the

  sub—samples for the other years are 10 percent for 1832, 20 percent
                                                                           11




for 1850) and 20 percent for 1860. In addition, those establishments

that were in the top 3 percent of firms by either measure of total

factor productivity in their respective years, and had not already been

dropped from the       and   .   sub—samples, were also truncated to produce

the £ sub—samples.      These criteria led to 48 percent being truncated

from the 1820 sample, 17 percent from that of 1832, 28 percent from

that of 1850, and 29 percent from that of 1860.

          The numbers appearing within parentheses signify the number

of observations on which the respective estimate is based. No

estimates are reported for years in which there were less than three

observations in the j sub—sample. The only industry whose estimates are

based on such a limited number of firms        is   glass, but in this case the

several firms appearing in the 1820 sample account for a substantial

proportion of the regional output. No estimates are reported for the

boots/shoes industry in 1832, because a large proportion of the firms

in   the sample from   that   year were putting—out establishments.

problem, and yielded roughly similar results. The method and

procedures underlying the construction of the three sets    of   sub—samples

employed in this paper are explained in the note to Table 1. The logic

behind reporting three sets of estimates is to provide evidence on the

sensitivity of the results to the assumptions made about the prevalence

of part—time operators in different years.5 Although intended to yield

somewhat conservative estimates of the rates of productivity growth

over time, the 1   set   represents the "best—guess" figures, and will be

the basis, unless otherwise indicated, for the results discussed below.

        The major implication of the estimates reported in Tables 1 and

2 is that nominal labor productivity, whether evaluated in terms of

value added or gross output, increased substantially between 1820 and

1860. All of the thirteen selected industries registered significant

advances in product per equivalent worker, by each of the measures. Ten

of the thirteen managed a greater than 50 percent increase in gross

output per unit of labor (GQLP) between 1820 and 1860, and eight did by

the value—added gauge of labor productivity (VLP).6 The unweighted

averages of the growth over the period in the value—added and gross—

output measures of labor productivity are 73 and 102 percent

respectively, whereas the weighted average increases are only slightly

different1 72 and 112 percent.7 This record of advance might not seem

remarkable taken by itself, but considered together with the evidence

of sharp decreases in output prices (see Table 3), the implied gains in

real labor productivity are dramatic indeed.

        It is fortunate that the principal qualitative finding seems
                                                                     15



to be insensitive to reasonable variation in the proportions of firms

truncated from the samples to deal with the problem of the inclusion

of part—time firms in the data. The      estimates imply much more

substantial productivity growth than the "best—guess"     figures, and

the   set suggests somewhat less progress, but all three provide

evidence of an era of major increases in manufacturing productivity.

This general robustness can be demonstrated by computing the implied

growth in labor productivity that results from an especially extreme

adjustment for the problem.8 If, for example, one accepts the

estimates for 1820, and the I   estimates for 1860, thus assuming that an
unrealistically high proportion of firms in the earlier year operated

part—time and that an extraordinary decline in their prevalence

occurred, weighted averages of the estimated growth in labor

productivity over the thirteen industries fall from 72 to 46 for value—

added labor productivity and from 112 to 97 percent for gross—output

labor productivity. These are not trivial alterations to the

quantititive results, but the picture of labor productivity growth in

manufacturing that emerges from the data remains essentially unchanged.

Such sensitivity analysis suggests that although the initial truncation

of establishments for likely part—time operations has major effects on

estimated productivity levels and growth, the influence of successive

truncations declines, to the point that no plausible revision of the

proportion of firms assumed to be operating part—time in 1820 could

reverse the basic finding of major advances over the period.

        There are several troubling features of the estimates that
                                                                      16




should be considered in interpreting them, but they do not seem to

warrant a general rejection of the reliability of the figures. Perhaps

foremost among these is the irregular pattern of advance that a number

of the industries exhibit. Nominal labor productivity does not always

increase continuously across the sub—periods, and even in those industries

where it does, the apparent rates of growth fluctuate widely over time.

Some variability should be expected, however, since the nominal

estimates are not adjusted for the substantial and erratic changes in

the prices of many commodities, including outputs and raw materials,

that occurred during the period. Moreover, a great deal of random

variation in the estimates of productivity would also be generated by

the limited numbers of observations.9 This latter problem is quite

serious for estimating the growth in productivity over the sub—periods,

but would be expected to decline in significance for the study of long—

term changes, because the proportion of the variation in estimated

productivity due to substantive or actual movements in productivity

should increase with the length of the period under examination.

       Also puzzling are the sometimes large discrepancies between the

estimates computed from the firm—level information and those from

aggregate data in 1850 and 1860. The industry estimates drawn from

these two sources are frequently similar, but diverge substantially in

some cases, particularly in 1850. One might have expected the

figures based on aggregate data to be generally lower, because of the

presumed inclusion of part—time establishments in those totals.

However, where there are large disparities, it is typically these
                                                                           17



 estimates which exceed those from the firm data. This might teem to

 imply that the prevalence, or the production, of part—time operators

 was rather modest in those years. In addition, the pattern is

 consistent with the view that the design of the 1850 and 1860 samples

 served to significantly bias the productivity estimates for those

 years downward.10 Accordingly, one might suppose that the aggregate-.

 based estimates would be more representative of the actual
                                                               productivity
 levels in the respective industries than those computed from firm data.

Whatever the reasons for the discrepancies, the close correspondence

between the estimates iii 1860 means that the qualitative results on

productivity growth over the entire period are not sensitive to the

choice between the firm— and aggregate—bated figures for that year.

        Although the series of current—dollar estimates are useful in

roughly gauging the long—term trends in   labor   productivity, they are
not nearly as informative as would be series expressed in constant dollars.

Accordingly, a variety of price indexes have been assembled to

construct estimates of real productivity from current—dollar values,

and are reported in Table 3. Measures of the changes in the prices of

the outputs and of the raw materials for each of the thirteen

industries would of course be preferred for the calculation of the

constant—dollar estimates. This goal could not be achieved, but a wide—

ranging survey of available price series for the period yielded

industry—specific indexes for the outputs of all thirteen industries,

and for the raw materials of nine." The Warren and Pearson Price

 Table 3



Notes         Sources: Corresponding to the productivity estimates, the

price indexes reported for 1832, 1850, and 1860 actually refer to the

price levels in 1831, 1849, and 1859. The price indexes, however, are

expressed relative to an 1860 standard of 100. The industry—specific

capital price indexes were constructed as a weighted average of the

price indexes for "structures" and "machinery", as well as of the

industry—specific indexes for output and raw materials. The weights

were obtained from firm level data on the composition of the total

capital investment contained in the McLane Renprt or, when there were

insufficient observations from 1832, from aggregate information

contained    in the report of the 1890 Census of Manufactures. See

Sokoloff (1984a) and U. S Census Office (1895). The "structures" and

"machinery" indexes were weighted by the shares of the total capital

investment that they accounted for in the respective industries. The

remaining proportion of the capital investment was assumed   to   consist

entirely of inventories, which were divided equally between output and

raw materials. Bence, the latter two indexes received half of the

weight for inventories in constructing each industry. capital price

series.




          General Output: Consumer and Wholesale Price Indexes (CPI and

          WPI henceforth) from U. S. Bureau of the Census (1975, E—135 and

          E—52).

Boots/Shoes: Output price index for "shoes" from Brady (1966).

Interpolation was based on the WPI (as were all interpolations

of price indexes drawn from Brady). The index for raw materials

was constructed from the 1850 and 1860 firm data, and from

U. S. Bureau of the Census (1975, £—55).



Coaches/Harnesses: Output index constructed from that for

"carriages, buggies, and wagons" in Brady (1966), and from the

1850 and 1860 firm data. The index for raw materials also

consists of a segment obtained from these data, spliced into the

WP I.




Cotton Textiles: Both the output and raw materials indexes are

from U. S. Bureau of the Census (1975, E—128 and E—126).



Furniture/Woodwork: The output index is that for "furniture"

from Brady (1966), and the raw materials index is from U. S. Bureau

of the Census (1975, E—59), and the 1850 and 1860 firm data.



Class: The output index is that for "window glass" from

Brady (1964). The WPI serves as the index for raw materials.



Rate:   The output index is that for "mens hats" from Brady

(1964) The WPI serves as the index for raw materials.

Iron: The output index was constructed from several price

series contained in Cole (1938). The raw materials index is the

WPI, with a segment estimated from the 1850 and 1860 firm data

spliced in.



Liquors: Both indexes are from U. S. Bureau of the Census

(1975, E—62 and E—123).



Mills: Both indexes are from U. S. Bureau of the Census (1975,

E—124 and E—123).



Paper: The output price index is that for "writing paper" from

Brady (1966). The index for raw materials is from U. S. Bureau

of the Census (1975, E—128).



Tanning: The same price index serves here as the basis for both

the output and raw materials indexes, U. S. Bureau of the Census

(1975, E—55). The two indexes differ slightly, however, in that

the segments between 1850 and 1860 were obtained from the firm

data for those years.



Tobacco: A price index for "tobacco" was constructed from

several series appearing in Cole (1938). This index was

utilized for both outputs and raw materials.
                                                              22



Wool. Textiles: The output index is for "woolen worsted goods"

from Brady (1%6). The index for raw materials was      constructed
from information in Cole (1938).



Capital Component Price Indexes: The indexes for structures and

machinery   are   for "factories, office buildings" and "machine—

shop products" respectively. Both are drawn from Brady (1966).
                                                                       23



 the prices of raw materials in the remaining four industries. In cases

 where there was reason to doubt the representativeneas of an index, and

 where the procedure was feasible, the change in price between 1850 and

 1860 was estimated from the information in the samples from   those
 years, and patched into the original series.12

         In addition to these price indexes for outputs and raw

materials, Table 3 also presents industry—specific estimates of the

price of capital. These indexes of the price of capital will be

utilized in the calculations of total factor productivity treated

below, and were computed as weighted averages of the indexes for

structures, machinery, outputs, and raw materials. The weights vary

across industries, and were obtained from industry—specific proportions

of capital invested in structures and laud, machinery and tools, and

inventories. Inventories were assumed to have been composed of equal

amounts of outputs and of raw materials.

        Perhaps the most striking general pattern that emerges from an

examination of Table 3 is that the prices of outputs declined

significantly relative to those of raw materials and capital between

1820 and 1860. In all of the thirteen industries but tobacco, where

the same series was adopted for both outputs and raw materials, the

index for output prices fell relative to that for raw materials; the

index declined relative to that for capital in ten of the thirteen.

Since it is also clear that real wages rose substantially over the

period, one can infer, by duality, that total factor productivity must

have increased (Sokoloff, 1983).
                                                                      24



       Indexes of real value added and real gross output per equivalent

worker have been constructed for the thirteen industries by applying

the output price series to the conversion of the current—dollar labor

productivity estimates to units of constant dollars. These indexes,

which are presented in Tables 4 and 5 respectively, indicate that all

of the industries realized major advances in real labor productivity,

by either measure, between 1820 and 1860. Weighted averages of the

records of the industries yield, taking the estimates based on aggregate

data as the standard for 1860, increases of 166 percent in value added

per equivalent worker and 198 percent by the alternative gauge. Only

very few failed to register gains of 100 percent. It is interesting to

note that in most industries the progress in gross output per

equivalent worker significantly exceeded that in value added per

equivalent worker. This feature of the results preawnably reflects a

rapid growth in the amounts of raw materials processed per unit of

labor during the period.

        As for the reliability of these labor productivity estimates,

it must be admitted that even after their conversion to constant

dollars, there remain many anomalies where the productivity growth

indicated f or an industry over a sub—period is either implausibly high

or low. These cases generally involve rather short span. of time, but

not always. Many of them might be attributed to noise in the point

estimates generated by a paucity of observations, inappropriate or

inaccurate price indexes, rapid changes in the factor proportions

utilized, varying degrees or types of sample selection bias over    the

 years included, or cyclical effects, but their number is nevertheless

 unsettling. It is, however, reassuring to Dote that the frequency and

magnitude of Buch strange results are greatly reduced in the series of

 total factor productivity estimates discussed below.'3 The industry

with the most puzzling record is paper, which appears, by both measures

of labor productivity, to have realized astonishingly high rates of

advance, particularly after 1832. Although substantial progress would

be expected, because of the dramatic increases in the utilization of

raw materials and capital per unit of labor over the period, the

estimated gains are probably too large to be believed. Given that this

qualitative result is not sensitive to the choice between the firm—

level and aggregate estimates, the problem may stem from the output

price index employed.14 Anomalies in the productivity series for

boots/shoes, tanning, and tobacco are also associated with suspicious

movements it the relevant price indexes.'5

        The per annum growth rates of labor productivity presented in

Table 6 were computed from the ..   sets   of indexes in Table 4 and 5.

Rates of advance are reported for the entire period from 1820 to 1860,

as well as   for   several sub—periods. The estimates indicate that labor

productivity increased rapidly in virtually all industries, ranging

from 1.0 and 2.1 percent per annum for VLP and GQLP      respectively   in

flour/grist mills to 4.3—5.5 and 5.3—6.2 percent in paper. Weighted

averages of the performance of the thirteen industries yield estimated

ranges of 2.0—2.4 percent and 2.5—2.7 percent for the rates of growth

of the two meaarcc zf     labor productivity. These figures are

remarkable in that they are drawn from the experience of industries

that together accounted for a large share of the entire manufacturing

sector in the Northeast, and yet are substantially higher than those

that other scholars concerned with antebellum growth have calculated

for the U. S. economy as a whole. (David, 1967, 1977; Gailman, 1972a,

1972b).

          Not only do these estimates of productivity growth in

northeastern manufacturing during early industrialization exceed what

might have been expected from previous work, but they are quite high by

historical standards. For example, NcCloskey (1981) has computed rates

of labor productivity growth for four major manufacturing industries in

Britain during that country's initial phase of industrial development,

1780 to 1860. His industry rates range from 0.9 to 2.6 percent per

annum, with an unweighted average of 1.6 percent. Moreover, the

figures presented here are greater than those estimated by Kendrick

(1961) for the U. S. manufacturing sector between 1869 and 1957.

          The other major pattern that emerges from these estimated rates

of labor productivity growth is that, on average, there appears to have

been an acceleration in the pace of advance over the period. This

characterization is based primarily on a comparison of the record

between 1820 and 1850 with that between 1850 and 1860,   and   thus must be

offered tentatively. An analysis focusing on the performance before

and after 1832, of the eight industries for which we have estimates in

that year, yields weak, if any, evidence of acceleration.

Nevertheless, the thirteen industries considered together exhibit a
                                                                       33



 marked increase in the rate of labor productivity growth. The

 acceleration is particularly striking with the VLP measure, where a

 weighted average of the industries registered growth of 1.6—2.1 percent

 per annun before 1850 and 3.3 percent following. On an individual

 industry basis, nine of the thirteen realized faster growth during the

 later sub—period than in the earlier one.   Although, the pace of

 advance may indeed have quickened, it is clear that rapid progress must

 have been realized as early as the 1820o. While the evidence of

 acceleration in productivity during the initial stages of

 industrialization might seem to conform well with the work of scholars

who view the diffusion of mechanization across the manufacturing sector

during the 1840s and 1850s as the crucial development behind

productivity growth in manufacturing, this perspective contributes little

to understanding how and why the impressive advances between 1820

and 1850 were achieved (Chandler, 1977).

        Given that the utilization of sophisticated machinery and

highly capital—intensive production processes were essentially confined

to but a few induBtries until late in the period, the finding that a

broad range of manufacturing industries enjoyed substantial gains in

productivity throughout the early nineteenth century might tend to enhance

appreciation of the importance of the changes in labor organization and

other relatively modest alterations in technique that seem to have

generally been adopted sooner and more widely. Another reaction, however,

would be to question the accuracy of the estimates of productivity

growth. Comparisons between the rates reported here and those computed
                                                                       34



for other places or eras do provide some check on the plausibility of

the re8ultS, but those drawn with alternative industry—specific figures

for the same period would be even more informative. Unfortunately,

such estimates are quite scarce, and the only prominent industry for

which they are readily available is cotton textiles. As for that

industry, the rates of labor productivity growth presented here are

generally lower than what other scholars have found. Davis and

Stettler (1966) calculated that gross output per worker in the entire

U. S. industry increased at rates of 4.1 percent per annum between

1820 and 1860, and of 3.4 percent between 1832 and 1860, as compared to

the 2.5—3.5 and 1.9—2.3 rates for the respective periods reported here.

Their estimates for cotton textiles in Massachusetts indicate somewhat

slower rates of advance in that state; but their figure of 2.2 percent

per annum growth between 1832 and 1860, resembling the 2.0 and 2.5

rates of McGouldrick (1968) and Layer (1955) for mills in Lowell during

roughly the same years, is near the upper end of our range. Nickless's

(1979) analysis of Layer's data on three Lowell establishments yields

an even higher estimate, 33 percent per annum, for the period from

1836 to 1860. Bence, the evidence from the only other industry for

which independent estimates are easily obtained suggests that our

figures on labor productivity growth are on the low side, as they were

constructed to be.

        A skeptic might not accept the number or relevance of the

standards of comparison utilized, and continue to dispute the estimatea

of the rates of advances as too high, claiming that the results were an
                                                                                 35



 artifact due to some defect in the data or in the way they were

 derived. There are, indeed, several aspects of the estimation

 procedure that could potentially be of sufficient import to account for

 the findings of rapid productivity growth across a wide spectrum of

 manufacturing industries, and on average, in the sector at large.

 Perhaps the most obvious of these is the selection of price indexes.

 As is clear from the indexes listed in Table 3, there were substantial

 fluctuations in both absolute and relative prices over the period from

 1820   to   1860.   In   this context, it is conceivable that some of the

price indexes utilized might diverge significantly from the actual

movement of the relevant prices, particularly since the indexes

frequently pertain to only one specific product or raw        material   of an

industry and were in several cases drawn from the WPI. Nevertheless, in

order for there to be a qualitatively—important upward bias in the

estimates of productivity growth, the respective price indexes would

have to seriously overstate the decline in output prices relative to

input prices. Given the absence of any evidence or argument that such

a systematic pattern in the errors of the price indexes across

industries exists, there would seem to be no basis for accepting the

argument that inaccurate price indexes account for the general finding

of rapid labor productivity growth.

             There are several other reasons to doubt the severity of the

problems with the price indexes. The first is that when multiple price

indexes were available for an industry, the most conservative of them

were generally selected for use, so as to bias the estimated rates of
                                                                        36




productivity groth downward. Another factor that mitigates the

significance of possible errors in the indexes is that the value—added

figures were deflated to constant dollars with only output price

indexes, instead of converting the values of gross outputs and raw

materials separately. In manufacturing industries in which the prices

of the raw materials consuxned fell relative to the output prices, this

procedure would lead the advance over time in real labor productivity

to be overestimated. The evidence, however, auggests that it was the

relative price of the outputs that typically declined during the

period. Of the eight industries included in Table 3 that have separate

and industry—specific indexes for outputs and inputs, all experienced a

decrease in the former relative to the latter. To the extent that

this pattern was characteristic of the manufacturing sector, the

eriployment of output price series to deflate the nominal value—added

figures should tend to bias estimates of productivity growth downward,

not upward. Hence, the likelihood that the result of substantial

advances was due to inaccurate price indexes seems even more remote.

Given that there are undoubtedly some errors in the price indexes

utilized, however, and that the magnitude and perhaps the direction, of

the biases referred to must vary across industries, one should be

cautious about comparing the relative performances reported for

individual industries. Although the rates of productivity growth

should be biased downward in most industries, the variability

in the extent of the biases at the industry level implies that the

record of any particular industry relative to another might be quite
                                                                               37




 fragile.16

         The other feature of the construction of the estimates that the

 qualitative results might plausibly be sets itive to is the method of

 adjuatnient for the inclusion of establishments Operating part—time in

 the samples. This is a potentially important problem, because such

enterprises did not generally explicitly identify themselves as such,

became less prevalent in manufacturing over time, and had their

measures of productivity biased downward from     the   actual levels,17 As

discussed above, the logic of the procedure adopted to deal with the

di1emii.a was based on the assumption that the lower the total factor

productivity of an establishment, the greater the likelihood it

operated only a fraction of the year. Generous assessments of the

prevalance of part—time operations in the various years were made, and

corresponding percentages of the least productive enterprises were

dropped from the respective samples to obtain the sub—samples over

which the sets of estimates were computed. The          set of estimates was

intended to represent conservative "best—guess" figures, and provides the

basis for the rates of growth reported in Table 6. If the adjustments

to the samples   underestimated   the extent of part—time operations in

1820, or especially the decrease in their prevalence over       time,   then

the rates of productivity growth would likely be biased upward. This is

conceivably a possibility, but as an examination of the nominal figures

in Table I and 2 indicates, the qualitative result of rapid

productivity growth, on average, in manufacturing is not sensitive to

reasonable variation in the proportions of firms presumed to have beet
                                                                           38



operating part—time and truncated from the samples. Estimates of

the advances in several of the industries, such as iron and tanning,

might be substantially affected, however, as could the relative rates of

progress in sons industries versus others.

          There are other aspects of the estimation procedures that might

be expected to yield biased results, but they are more likely to

lead to understatements of the advances in productivity than overstatements.

The first concerns the manner in which value added was computed. Each

of the bodies of data employed contains reports of the value of outputs

produced and the value of raw materials consumed by the particular firm

of industry. Value added was calculated in a straightforward fashion

by deducting the value of the raw    materials   from the total value of

output. The potential bias arises from the additional category of

expenses specified by firms in the 1820 Census of Manufactures. This

class of production coats was defined as "contingent expenses" and

included the costs of items   such   as fuel, insurance, and repairs to

equipment. Since none of the other surveys collected information on a

similar category of expenses, "contingent expenses" were ignored in the

calculation of the value added figures for 1820. If, however, some of

tbe expenditures on inputs counted among "contingent expenses" in that

year were included as raw materials later, then the value added per

firm   would be overestimated in 1820 relative to that in other years,

and the growth in the value—added measures of productivity

underest imated.

         Another possible source of systematic error in the preparation
                                                                        39



 of the productivity estimates is the method of aggregating different

 classes of workers into units of adult—male equivalents. Females and

 boys have been treated as equal, in terms of their labor input, to one—

half of an adult—male employee, with these weights having been drawn

from evidence on the relative wages of the groups prevailing near the

end of the period.18 It both the 1820 Census of Manufactures and the

McLane Report of 1832, each of the three types of workers were

separately enumerated. There were only two classifications of

employees utilized in the 1850 and 1860 censuses, however, males and

females. For those years, the reported number of male workers in each

industry was decomposed into adults and boys by assuming that the

industry—specific proportions of males that were boys were the same in

1850 and 1860 as they had been in 1820.19 Since the shares of male

employees that were boys probably rose somewhat over the period, a

small upward bias might be imparted by this procedure to the estimation

of the labor inputs in the later, relative to the earlier, years

(Goldjn and Sokoloff, 1982). As a consequence, estimates of

productivity in those years, and thus of its growth aver time, would

tend to be biased downward.

        One might also expect the estimates of productivity growth

during the period to understate the actual record because of the

problems in the sample selection that afflict the various bodies of

data. First, the systematic under—counting of smaller establishments

in the 1820 and 1832 samples should probably generate overestimates of

the productivity levels in those years.2° In addition, the
                                                                       40



unrepresentative character of the samples from 1850 and 1860   would be

expected to yield underestimates. These two samples were designed to

ensure that tbere were a certain minimum number of observations from

each state that had surviving data and hence suffer from a

disproportionate representation of manufacturing firms from states that

had relatively limited industrial development or small populations

(Ateck, Bateman, and Weiss, 1979). As the firms from such states

tended to be less productive than those from other areas, at least

partially because of their smaller scales of operation, the levels of

productivity estimated from the samples should be lower than those

actually prevailing in the Northeast at the respective year..

Moreover, the inclusion of part—time establishments in the aggregate

data from the 1850 and 1860 censuses means that the estimates obtained

from these sources are downward biased as well. Eence, with

productivity levels overestimated for 1820 and underestimated for 1850

and 1860, the rates of advance derived should be lower than those that

were actually realized.

        The above discussion has reviewed, in considerable detail, many

of the features of the data sources and the estimation procedures that

might have contributed to inaccurate or biased assessments of the

productivity growth between 1820 and 1860. It has been argued that

most of them would be expected to have led to estimates that were

biased downward. The chief exception to this generalization about the

impacts of the potential biases is the effect of a decline over time

in the relative amount of manufacturing production carried out by firms
                                                                         41




 operating seasonally. The disproportionate truncation of the least

 productive manufacturing establishments from the 1820 sample, however,

 should probably more than compensate for this problem, because the

 percentages dropped from the analysis for the thirteen industries seems

 likely to have exceeded those of firms that were part—time enterprises.

 Even if the adjustments underlying the   set of estimates, on which the

 discussion focuses, are not quite sufficient, sensitivity analysis

employing set   for 1820 indicates that the qualitative results would

not be altered by any reasonable relaxation of the assumptions

concerning the prevalence of seasonal operations in that year.21

Particularly when one considers the net effect of all the biases, it

appears likely that the estimates of productivity growth in

manufacturing understates, on average,- the actual record.

        The evidence seems to support the conclusion that labor

productivity growth in manufacturing during this initial phase of

industrialization was remarkably rapid and significantly higher than

scholars may have previously reckoned. What is one to make of this

performance? One possibility is to attribute the progress to the

combined effects of a variety of related developments marking the

period that include the introduction and diffusion of machinery, increases

in capital and raw materials intensity, changes in the organization of

labor, the realization of scale economies, learning—by—doing,

and the impact of expanding markets through the selecting—out of

inefficient producers and the stimulation of technical innovation. One

might also explain the remarkably high rates of labor productivity
                                                                       42



growth as being at least partially accounted for by the severe

contraction that occurred in the U. S. between 1816 and 1821, and might

have dragged productivity in 1820 veil below its trend level. From

this perspective, the estimates could accurately reflect the actual

amount of labor productivity growth between 1820 and 1860, but convey a

misleading impression about the long—term record.

        Although cyclical effects might, in principle, have been large,

the qualitative findings with respect to productivity growth over the

entire period from 1820 to 1860 are not fundamentally altered when one

makes adjustments for them. In order to gauge the potential magnitudes

of the cyclical effects on manufacturing productivity, estimates of the

trend over time in gross output per worker were computed through

regression analysis from the annual series on cotton textiles assembled

by Davis and Stettler (1966) and by Layer (1955), and then the

residuals were compared with the NBER classifications of cyclical

behavior by year (Thorp, 1926). Both sets of residuals indicate some

pro—cyclical variation, with the greatest deviations below trend in

labor productivity being achieved, on average, one year before the

trough of the business cycle. The Davis and Stettler series implies

much greater cyclical variation than the Layer series, but even here

the effect seems somewhat modest. In the average business cycle, labor

productivity, as measured by gross output per worker, fell to only 4.2

percent below trend during the year before the trough.22 Moreover,

over the limited period of time spanned by their date, the magnitude of

the deviation from trend does not appear to have been systematically
                                                                        43




 related to the duration of the cycle. It is not clear whether cyclical

 variation in labor productivity should be more or less in cotton

 textiles than in other industries. Nevertheless, even if the 4.2

 percent figure is doubled and applied to all manufacturing industries,

 the adjustment for the business cycle in 1820 would not change the

 qualitative results concerning the pace of labor productivity growth

over the period under study. Such refinements would be even    less
significant for the other years covered by the data, because none of

them seem to have been associated with extreme cyclical activity.23

         It is apparent that taking cyclical factors into consideration

does Dot appreciably alter the interpretation of the finding that these

were major increases in labor productivity across a   wide range of
manufacturing industries during the antebell period. Not so clear,

however, is the relative importance of the various contributors, such

as capital deepening or mechanization, to these developments. That

virtually all of the industries investigated realized impressive gains

in labor productivity despite the rather modest degrees of

mechanization and capital intensity in most of them, suggests that

other factors must have played a significant role. An indirect method

of roughly gauging whether capital deepening or mechanization were the

principal determinants of the rate of progress is to examine whether

the records of productivity growth of the capital— and machinery—

intensive industries compared favorably with those of their

Counterparts.

Table 7



Notes and Sources: These estiiates were computed as weighted averages

of the industry—specific figures underlying the indexes presented in

Tables 4, 5 and 6. They were calculated with the sane weights employed

in those tables to construct the weighted averages. However, the

weights of the industries in each class were normalized so that their

sun was always equal to one. The mechanized industries include cotton

textiles, wool textiles, paper, glass, mills,   and iron. The capital—
intensive industries include cotton textiles, wool textiles, paper,

mills, iron, liquors, and tanning.

proportions employed and productivity growth through a discussion of

the cases of individual industries, the thirteen industries were ranked

by both capital intensity and machine intensity, on the basis of

information pertaining to 1850 and 1832 respectively, and divided into

two groups for each diznension.24 Weighted averages of the alternative

measures of labor productivity were computed for the various classes of

industries, and indexes and per annum rates of growth derived from them

are presented in Table 7.

          Several findings of interest emerge from these estimates.

Perhaps most important is that, over the entire period from 1820 to

1860, all categories of industries registered major increases in labor

productivity. It does appear, however,      that   the more capital—intensive

and machinery—intensive industries generally realized somewhat larger

advances, particularly in terms of GQLP. For example, in the more capital—

intensive industries this measure of labor productivity rose by 177 to

217 (depending on whether the firm or aggregate data is employed)

percent between 1820 and 1860,   whereas   those less dependent on capital

managed only 144 to 169 percent. This differential is consistent with
the view that the utilization of machinery or capital equipment may

have   facilitated changes in production processes that increased the

rate at which raw materials could be prOceBsed into final products with

a given amount of labor.

         What is rather puzzling about these comparisons between the

various classes of industries is that the qualitative results appear

sensitive to whether the productivity estimates are derived from the
                                                                            47




 samples    of   firm information or from the aggregate data. Especially in

 1860, the aggregate figures suggest much greater productivity growth

 in the capital—intensive and machinery—intensive industries, relative

 to their counterparts, than do the estimates obtained from the firm

 reports. Since both sets of estimates would be expected to be biased

 downward, as discussed above, the substantial disparity might be

 thought to shed light on which sources of biases are most serious, and

 accordingly     convey information about the structure of the manufacturing
 sector. In particular, it might         suggest that the
                                      seam to

disproportionate sampling of firms in 1860 from less—developed states
biases the firm—level productivity estimates downward by more than the
aggregate productivity figures are           by the inclusion of part—
                                       affected

time   operations in the census totals. Such an explanation does not
hold up well, however, to the observation that no industries other than
tanning and perhaps cotton textiles have large discrepancies of the
same sign   between the firm— and aggregate—level productivity estimates
in   both 1850 and 1860.    Instead, the sensitivity   of the finding of

higher productivity growth in the capital—intensive and machinery—

intensive industries to the choice between the two sets of      estimates
is   primarily   attributable to the enormous differences in 1860   for
cotton textiles and paper that have not yet been satisfactorily

accounted for.25

         Regardless of the appropriate interpretation of the

significantly more rapid progress of labor productivity implied by the

aggregate data, one must be impressed with the extent of the advances
                                                                      48



realized by those industries with low levels of capital or machinery

intensity. By either measure of labor productivity, these industries

managed growth rates of over 2.0 percent per annum. Despite the

evidence that industries with a greater reliance on capital and

machinery did slightly better, this strong record would seem to bear

against the view that the increasing utilization of these factors of

production per unit of labor were the dominant forces in accounting

for, or encouraging, growth in manufacturing productivity during this

early phase of industrialization.

        One might legitimately challenge the persuasiveness of this

argument, on the grounds that a comparison of the rates of productivity

growth between classes of industries defined by their factor

intensities at one moment in time does not bear directly on the issue

of how changes in the ratio of capital to labor over time contributed

to advances in labor productivity. Such a procedure does, however,

establish whether there was an association between the capital

intensity of an industry at a point in time and the future capacity

for, or history of, its productivity growth (depending on whether

capital intensity is measured at the beginning or end of the period in

question), but that is a somewhat different, if related, question. In

this regard, the finding that the rates of advance achieved were nearly

equal across classes of industries tends to suggest that any

relationship between capital intensity and productivity growth was weak

during this phase of industrial developnent. An alternative approach

to the problem of how important capital accumulation was in promoting
                                                                          49



 productivity increase would be to formally evaluate how much of the

 growth in labor productivity over some specified span of time can be

 directly attributed, in an accounting sense, to the accumulation of

 capital per unit of labor that occurred. Such an analysis entails the

 measurement of total factor productivity, and will be carried out in

 the next section of the paper.

            Another caveat to the interpretation of the comparisons between

 the rates of labor productivity growth in machinery— or capital—

intensive industries and their counterparts is that the disparities are

significantly smaller f or the entire period from 1820 to 1860 than they

are when attention is restricted to developments before 1850. For

example, the gap in the rate of increase of GQLP between the mechanized

industries and the less mechanized widens from between 2.6—2.9 and 2.3—2.4

percent per annum for 1820 to 1860, to between 2.7—3.0 and 1.7—2.1

percent for 1820 to 1850. This pattern reflects both impressive rates

of advance throughout the period for all industries, and an

acceleration      from 1850 to 1860 that is especially pronounced among, and

perhaps exclusive to, the less mechanized and capital—intensive

industries. The record of change in the capital to labor ratio is

similar, in that the less mechanized and the less capital—intensive

industries experienced an extraordinary rise between 1850 and 1860,

while their counterparts failed to manifest any robust acceleration.

            This perspective on the evidence tends to place somewhat greater

e!npbasis   on   the roles played by mechanization and capital accumulation

in promoting labor productivity growth. The      estimates   can be viewed as
                                                                     50



consistent   with the notion that the advances were initially most rapid

among industries that mechanized, and were highly capital intensive,

early, such as cotton textiles, and that the pace of progress in the

rest of the manufacturing sector was boosted as sophisticated capital

equipment began to be diffused more broadly during the 1840s and 1850s.

Nevertheless, it is also clear that many industries, such as hats and

furniture/woodwork, realized substantial increases in productivity

while they were still utilizing small amounts of capital per unit of

labor and little or no machinery.

        The findings thus support the judgement that there may have

been two general sources, or perhaps "stages", of productivity growth

in manufacturing during early industrialization. The first wave of

advances seems to have been associated, in many industries, with

changes in the organization of labor and other alterations in

production processes that did not involve large adjustments in the

capital to labor ratio (Goldin and Sokoloff, 1982; Sokoloff, 1984b).

The gains from these sorts of improvements were eventually to be

exhausted, but a second class of innovations related to the

introduction of sophisticated capital equipment followed, leading

perhaps to an acceleration of labor productivity growth (Chandler,

1977; Atack, 1985). These stylized "stages" undoubtedly fail to

describe the experience of all manufacturing industries; indeed, it is

apparent that industries passed through them at different rates and

periods, and that the timing of the diffusion of the new production

methods may have varied across firms within industries with location
                                                                     51




and other characteristics. Moreover, changes in production techniques

that encompassed aspects of both '1stages" at once were implemented in

some industries. It is difficult to determine precisely how important

each development was in explaining labor productivity growth,

particularly with only the bodies of evidence examined here. An

exploration of more comprehensive measures of productivity should,

however, help to improve our assessment of at least the relative

significance of the various contributors.
                                                                 52

        Although the estimates of labor productivity growth presented

above are quite informative about the record of industrial development

in the Northeast, broadening the investigation of productivity to

include other factors as inputs can extend our knowledge further. It

makes possible, in particular, the decomposition of the growth in labor

productivity between the amounts attributable to increases in capital

and raw materials utilized per unit of labor, and that due to advances

in total factor productivity. Such inform.ation will in turn contribute

to our understanding of the evolution of production methods and help to

determine how important physical capital accumulation was during the

early stages of industrialization.

        It is useful to begin the treatment of total factor

productivity by examining the indexes of real partial factor

productivity reported in Table 8. These figures indicate the industry—

specific movements over the period in the ratios of gross output to raw

materials, capital, and labor. Several features of these estimates

deserve comment. The first is that in nearly all industries, each

of these ratios of partial factor productivity increases between 1820

and 1860. Although the liquors and tobacco industries do diverge

slightly from this pattern, neither case appears to contradict

significantly the general result as the decreases they manifest are

small and sensitive to the choice between firm— and aggregate—level

estimates. Since the index of total factor productivity is equivalent

Table 8



Notes and Sources: See the note to Table 1. The nominal values of the

respective measures of partial factor productivity were converted to

constant dollars with the industry—specific price indexes presented in

Table 3. These estimates were then normalized relative to a base of

100 representing the respective induatrys levels in 1820.
                                                                        55




 to a weighted average of these individual ratios, it is accordingly

 obvious that any reasonable measure of the former would rise aver the

 period in all industries.

         Another pattern in the data that merits enphasis is that, in

all industries, labor productivity increased much more over the period

than either raw materials or capital productivity. While the gains in

labor productivity between 1820 and 1860 were typically very large, the

advances in raw materials productivity observed are quite modest.

Capital productivity appears to have generally increased less than

labor and more than raw material, productivity, although there are a

few prominent deviations from this pattern where it also failed to

keep up with the rise in the latter (i.e. liquors and flour/grist

mills). This evidence suggests that, in general, manufacturing

production methods evolved over time in such ways as to reduce the

amounts of labor and, to a lesser extent, capital required to process a

unit of raw materials into final product. It conforms well with the

work of scholars who have argued that many of the innovations

introduced by manufacturers during this period were intended to

substitute relatively cheap raw materials for other inputs (Rabakkuk,

1962).

         y dividing GQ/L by GQIX or GQ/RM, one can calculate the

change over time in the ratios of capital or raw materials to labor

from the information provided in Table 8. These latter ratios indicate

that northeastern manufacturing did shift somewhat toward more capital—

intensive production processes, as   judged   by the capital to labor
                                                                            56




ratio, between 1820 and 1860. Bowever, the extent of this adjustment

in factor proportions pales by comparison with the dramatic surge in

raw materials intensity that occurred contemporaneously. Whereas the

weighted—average growth in the ratio of raw   materials   to labor was in

the 118—127 percent range, the rise in capital per unit of labor

amounted to only 67—72 percent. It is striking that both of these

increases in the utilization of other inputs per unit of labor are

proportionally much lower than the estimated growth in GQLP during the

period. This finding casts additional doubt on whether either raw

materials accumulation or capital accumulation, but especially the

latter, could play the dominant role in explaining the advance in labor

productivity.

        There is, of course, substantial variation across the

industries in the extent of the movement toward greater capital

intensity, and some of th experienced significantly larger shifts

than the average did. Nevertheless, as will be shown below, the

increase in the ratio of capital to labor was not sufficiently massive

in any industry to directly account for a major share of the progress

realized in labor productivity. Moreover, it ii interesting that the

industries that underwent the st extensive capital deepening during

the period may have been those that were most capital intensive to

begin withe Industries such as liquors, flour/grist mills, paper,

tanning, and wool textiles, which were among the seven most capital

intensive of the thirteen in 1820, appear to have experienced the

largest increases in the capital to labor ratio. Conversely, several
                                                                        57




of the less capital—intensive industries, boots/shoes,

furniture/woodwork, and hats, were among those with the smallest

percentage gains. Weighted averages of the two classes of industries

reveal that the capital to labor ratio rose by 57—91 percent over the

period in the more capital—intensive industries (as indentified at

either 1820 or 1850), and by 16—95 percent in their counterparts.

Since the estimated range of increase for the former class of

industries does not unambiguously dominate that for the latter, one

cannot make an unqualified claim that those industries that were

initially most capital intensive carried out more capital deepening.

Nevertheless, it is clear that the classes of industries were not

converging in their degrees of capital intensity, and that many remained

highly labor intensive throughout the period.26

        A final point to make about the indexes of partial factor

productivity is that they imply that the doubts some scholars have

raised concerning the accuracy of the census valuations of the capital

invested in manufacturing firms are unwarranted. The chief question

about the usefulness of the reported capital input has been whether

establishments included working capital in their statements to census

enutnerators.27 If, as some have argued, they did not, then estimates

of both the growth of capital intensity and of total factor

productivity over time would likely be confounded. The possible

seriousness of the problem can be evaluated with the more detailed

information on the composition of capital investments contained in the

1832 sample drawn from the McLane Report. These data include separate
                                                                           58



assessments of the value of capital invested in land and structures,

tools and machinery1 and inventories (Sokoloff, 1984*).

          Since the bulk of the capital investment was in working

capital, and the 1832 estimates of total factor productivity arid the

capital to labor ratio were based on valuations of the capital input

that included inventories, one would expect to observe some stark

contrasts between the estimates from that year and those from 1820 or

1850 if working capital had not been incorporated as part of the

reported capital investments in the censuses of the other years.

More   specifically,   there would be large decreases in total factor

productivity and substantial increases in capital intensity between

1820 and 1832,   especially   in those industries in which investment in

working capital was relatively important. No such patterns emerge, nor

do the differentials in total factor productivity across industries,

varying with the relative investments in fixed and working capital,

that would be evident in the 1820, 1850, and 1860 data if their

information on capital investments did not include at least a major

component of the working capital. It thus seems unlikely that

undervaluation of working capital in manufacturing censuses was a

serious defect, and correspondingly that the estimates of the growth in

total factor productivity and capital intensity are significantly

distorted as a consequence.

two alternative definitions of output, are presented for the thirteen

Notes and Sources: These estimates of total factor productivity were

computed over the same   sets   of observations as the corresponding labor

productivity estimates presented in Table 1 and 4 were. See the notes

to Tables 1 and 4. The index of total factor productivity for the

weighted average of the industries was computed with the same weights,

and in the same manner, as the index of labor productivity reported in

the latter table. The output elasticities employed in the computation

were selected from a range derived by estimating Cobb—Douglas

production functions over each cross—sectional sample. These

regressions yielded estimates of the capital coefficient between 0.25

and 0.30. The latter value was employed here so as to increase the

estimate of the inputs in the later years relative to the earlier.

The formulation of total factor productivity employed here is:



                         NFP —   (vA/K030 L0'70),


where NFP is a measure of total factor productivity utilizing value
added as the measure of output, VA is value added, K is the value of

the capital invested, and L is the labor input. The calculations of

NFP were performed after the values of gross output, raw materials, and

capital had been deflated to constant dollars, utilizing the price

indexes reported in Table 3. These "real" estimates of total factor

productivity were then normalized relative to an 1820 standard of 100.

Notes and Sources: These estimates of total factor productivity were

computed over the same sets of observations as the corresponding labor

productivity estimates preserved in Table 2 and 5 were. See the notes

to those tables. The index of total factor productivity for the weighted

average of the industries was computed with the same weights, and in

the same manner, as the index of labor productivity reported in Table

5. The output elasticities were selected from a range provided by

Cobb—Douglas production functions estimated cross—sectionally. The

choice was influenced by the desire to have the coefficients for

capital and raw materials to be on the high aide io as to depress the

estimated rates of productivity growth. The formulation of total

factor productivity ployed here is:



                     TFP — C QIRIf°'54   L033 x03),


where TFP is a measure of total factor productivity utilizing the gross

value of output as the measure of output, RN   is   the value of raw

materials,   L is the labor input, and. is the value of capital

invested. All of the relevant variables were deflated to constant

dollars, by the indexes in Table 3, before the calculations were

performed. These "real" estimates of total factor productivity were

then normalized relative to a 1820 standard of 100.
                                                                            63



 reported above, the estimates were computed for each of three sets of

 sub—samples of firms      so as   to demonstrate the insensitivity of the

 results to the extent of adjustment for part—time firms, and the price

 indexes appearing in Table 3 were employed to convert the nominal

measures of gross output, value added, raw materials, and capital to

 constant dollars before productivity was calculated.

             The results indicate that by either of the two measures, nearly

all industries realized substantial growth in total factor productivity

between 1820 and 1860. Weighted averages of the records of the

individual industries yield estimated increases ranging from 103 to 131

percent with output is defined as value added (NIP) and from 70 to 78

percent by the alternative gauge (TFP). Each industry performed

veil by at least one measure. Flour/grist mills registered the smallest

advance in NIP, only 18 to 19 percent, but the estimated gain in TIP

approached 60 percent; and although tobacco ranked at the bottom in

terms   of   progress in   TIP,   its increases of 30—48 percent in that

measure, and        71—116 percent in NIP    are   not unimpressive. The cotton

textiles, wool textiles, and paper industries are among         those   attaining

the largest estimated increases in total factor productivity, but major

gains were also achieved by industries such as furniture/woodwork and

hats, which were among the least capital intensive and mechanized

throughout the period. These figures provide dramatic testimony to how

dynamic the manufacturing sector was during the early stages of

industrialization. Moreover, they serve to undercut the hypothesis that

capital accumulation was the driving force behind productivity growth
                                                                      64



during this era. The substantial increases in total factor

productivity demonstrate clearly that the bulk of the gains in labor

productivity cannot be directly accounted for by capital or raw

materials deepening within manufacturing firms. In addition, the wide

range of industries that shared in this general advance of productivity

suggests that the phenomenon can not be attributed to developments such

as the diffusion of new and more sophisticated capital equipment, which

touched only a relatively limited number of industries until late in

the period.

        The consistency of the finding of large gains in total factor

productivity, across industries and measures, bolsters confidence in

the robustness of the qualitative result. Moreover, as the minor

differences between the . and   . sets   of estimates suggest, the basic

picture that emerges is not sensitive to any reasonable adjustments of

the sub—samples to account for the existence of part—time

establishments.28 It is also encouraging to note that there are fewer

implausible fluctuations in these estimates than in the indexes of

labor productivity, particularly with the TFP measure. Several

industries do continue to manifest strange records of progress, but in

at least the most troubling cases, paper, tanning, and tobacco, the

price indexes relied on are suspect and likely the primary source of

the problems. The other questionable features may also be attributable

to the inappropriate or defective nature of the price series utilized,

or an inadequate number of observations in some years. Whatever the

explanation for these anomalies, however, the fundamental results do

and 10. See the notes to those tables. The NFP estimates are of the

growth of total factor productivity measured with value added as

 not depend upon their inclusion in the manufacturing average..

         Estimates of the per annum growth rate. of total factor

 productivity have been computed from the indexes reported in Tables 9

 and 10 for the entire period between 1820 and 1860, as veil as for

 several sub—periods. They aze presented in Table 11, and confirm that

 a wide spectrum of manufacturing industries in the Northeast enjoyed

rapid progress in total factor productivity during this initial phase

of industrialization. Indeed, the weighted—average per annum growth

rates for these thirteen industries match, if not exceed, the

performance of the U. S. economy during other periods. Between 1820

and 1860, northeastern manufacturing appears to have achieved per annum

rates of increase of 1.7—2.0 percent in NFP and 1.3—1.8 in TFP. These

figures might be compared to the 1.8 percent rate for NYP estimated by

lendrick (1961) for the national manufacturing sector between 1869 and

1953, or to the 0.8—0.9 and 1.4 percent rates computed by Gailman

(1986) for the annual increase in TYP for the economy at large during

the respective periods 1840—1900 and 1900—1960. Although some might

react to the application of these standards by rejecting the early

manufacturing rates of advance as implausibly high, it should be

remembered that one vould expect the pace of productivity growth in the

most dynamic sector of the most burgeoning region during the period to

have surpassed that for the national economy or for U. S. manufacturing

in total. Rence, the finding that northeastern manufacturing might

have realized faster rates of total factor productivity increase during

its initial burst of expansion than economy—wide averages, pertaining
                                                                       68



to the same or other periods, should perhaps not be too surprising.

        These estimates further suggest, as did those for labor

productivity growth, that productivity rose, on average, more slowly

between 1820 and 1850 than during the 1850s. The average rate of

advance in TFP, for example, increased from 1.5—1.9 percent per annum

over tbe first thirty years to 2.3—2.4 percent during the later ten.

The pattern of acceleration ii, admittedly, somewhat weaker if one

focuses on the contrast between 1820—1832 and 1832—1860, and only on

those industries for which 1832 figures are available. Nevertheless,

even here, the weight of the evidence seems to favor a mild increase in

the pace of total factor productivity growth. Many researchers have

contended that such an acceleration may have resulted from a spurt in

the accumulation of more and better capital equipment, during the 1840s

and 1850s (Chandler, 1977; David, 1977; Williamson and Lindert, 1980).

They might tend to argue that the process of capital deepening only

seems unimportant, because the conventional measures of inputs fail to

fully detect the technical change that is embodied in newer vintages of

capital. The acceleration of total factor productivity growth during a

decade of more rapid diffusion of machinery is certainly consistent

with this interpretation, but alternative explorations of this feature

of the economic record are also available.29

       Although some of technical change realized between 1820 and

1860 was undoubtedly embodied in capital goods there are several

reasons to doubt whether a proper accounting for this phenomenon would

be capable of reversing the qualitative conclusion concerning the
                                                                                   69


 significance   of capital accumulation for productivity growth in early

manufacturing. First, even if one were to ascribe as much as half of

 the acceleration in total factor productivity increase to improvements

of manufacturing capital not reflected in its price the amount of

productivity growth so generated would be quite small relative to the

total realized over the entire period. One might claim that more of

the estimated advance in total factor productivity should be credited

to embodied technical change unincorporated in price, but the rationale

for this appears weak. Not only did the less capital—intensive and

less mechanized industries do quite veil before the purported

consequential developments of the 1840.         and   1850., but their

investments in machinery and tools per unit of labor remained              quite
small in absolute terms,     as   veil as in   relation   to their total

investment in capital, at the end of the period. Even most of the

counterpart industries, classified as more mechanized and capital—

intensive, had rather modest absolute and relative amounts invested in

capital equipment that was directly involved in production (Sokoloff,

1984a). Given that manufacturing industries had the bulk of their

investments in structures and inventories, there would seem to be

severe limits on the amount of embodied technical change that the

capital input could plausibly be endowed with.30

        One   approach   to evaluating the importance of embodied technical

change is to compare the records of total factor productivity

growth between the more capital—intensive and tbe less capital

intensive industries, or between the more mechanized and less

mechanized one;. The logic underlying this procedure is that where

new vintages of capital are endowed with embodied technical change, the

measured increase over time in the inputs utilized by firms will be

lower, relative to the outputs produced, and hence, measured total factor

productivity higher. Given that one would expect the realization of

technical change embodied in capital and not incorporated in its

price to be associated with either the size of the capital input

relative to other inputs, or the change in that relative size of the

capital input over the period in question, the more capital—intensive

and mechanized industries might seem likely to have enjoyed greater

total factor productivity growth than the others if this component of

embodied technical change was of much quantitative significance.31

Although, as discussed above, the evidence of significantly more

capital deepening over the period by these classes of industries is not

entirely robust, it is clear that they did employ larger amounts of

capital and machinery per unit of labor throughout the period, and

carried out at least as much capital deepening as their less capital—

intensive and mechanized counterparts did. One would, accordingly,

expect them to exhibit more total factor productivity growth.

        When one examines the indexes of total factor productivity

presented in Table 12 for classes of manufacturing industries, however,

only minor differences in performance emerge.32 The discrepancies in

the amount of productivity growth realized between the more and less

capital—intensive industries are trivial in magnitude and vary in sign

with the choice between measures. As for the other system of

 classification, the more mechanized industries do seem to have

 experienced higher rates of advance than the less mechanized did.

 However, these disparities are small relative to the rates of increase,

 particularly when TFP serves    as    the gauge for total factor

 productivity. Another feature of these estimates that bears against

 the hypothesis that much of the technical change realized was

embodied in physical capital and not reflected in its price is the

relative decline in the rate of total factor productivity growth of the

less mechanized and capital—intensive industries, as compared to their

counterpart classes between      the   sub—periods 1820—1850 and 1850—1860.

As already alluded to, the rates of increase of both capital intensity

and   labor   productivity accelerated sharply between the two sub—periods

among the former classes of industries relative to the latter.33 If

the capital investments involved considerable embodied technical

change, then one would expect a relative increase in the pace of total

factor productivity in less mechanized and capital—intensive industries

to have accompanied the relative surge in capital deepening and labor

productivity.

         Regardless of how persuasive these arguments for questioning

the extent of embodied technical change are, it is informative to

decompose the growth over the period in gross output per equivalent

worker between the amounts directly attributable, in an accounting

sense, to increases in capital intensity (XIL), in raw materials

intensity (RM/L), and in total factor productivity (TFP). The results

of such a procedure are reported in Table 13, with separate estimates
                                                                            76



presented for the estimates obtained from     the   firm   data   and those from

the aggregate data. They indicate that in most industries the increase

between 1820 and 1860   in   capital intensity explains less than 10

percent of the growth in labor productivity as measured by GQLP.

Indeed, in no case does the share exceed 16 percent. Advances in total

factor productivity, on the other hand, appear to be the principal

force behind labor productivity growth, generally accounting for over

half of the increase in GQLP and never below 25 percent.34 These

findings dramatize how remarkably limited the importance of capital

deepening was in generating labor productivity growth during early

industrialization. They imply that if capital accumulation played a

substantial role at all, it was due to improvements in capital that

were not reflected in price. Given the basis for skepticism about the

extent to which technical progress was embodied in capital outlined

above, other sources of total factor productivity, and thus of labor

productivity, growth would appear to deserve more attention.

        This paper has relied on four cross—sections of anufacturiug

firm data to study the growth of labor and total factor productivity

during early industrialization in the U. S.. Although the bodies of

evidence analyzed suffer from some defects1 the procedures employed in

constructing the estimates were designed to deal with the problems and

yield growth rates that would be biased downward. Despite this concern

for producing conservative estimates, the results indicate that a wide

range of manufacturing industries realized major increases in both

labor and total factor productivity as early as the 1820s, and

continued to do so, at an accelerated pace, through 1860. The

breadth, magnitude, and timing of the advances observed suggest that

the northeastern manufacturing sector was a dynamic one, whose

productivity growth, perhaps coupled with similar gains in agriculture,

fueled the process of industrialization in that region. The evidence

would seem to make it increasingly difficult to sustain the view that

the onset of industrial expansion in the Northeast was primarily due to

the release of labor and other resources from a stagnant and declining

agricultural sector.

        Of perhaps even greater interest, the estimates imply that

increases in total factor productivity, sometimes referred to as the

residual, accounted for most of the advance in labor productivity

between 1820 and 1860. The deepening of capital, in contrast, appears

to have made only a modest contribution. Although it is possible that
                                                                   78



a major share of the growth in the residual over the period consisted

of technical change embodied in capital equipment, which would enhance

the significance of capital in explaining the gains in productivity,

the shreds of evidence that can be gleaned from these data do not

support this notion. Capital accumulation may indeed have had

important influences on the course of early industrial development,

such as through allowing for the extension of the transportation

network and other social overhead capital, but the introduction of

sophisticated capital equipment and capital deepening in general were

evidently not as central to the initial phase of industrialization as

they have sometimes been depicted. On the contrary, the material

examined here seems to suggest that other sources of measured

productivity growth in manufacturing, including the changes in labor

organization and the intensification of work that have been emphasized

in recent studies, played the leading roles (Lazonick and Brush, 1985;

Goldin and Sokoloff, 1982; Sokoloff, 1984b). Although many questions

remain, the results also appear to be consistent with, if not to

actually support, the view that the expansion of markets that

accompanied the onset of industrialization unleashed powerful forces

that acted to raise productivity. At least in the U. S., pre—

industrial manufacturing seems to have had the potential, which it was

ultimately to realize, for substantial gains in efficiency without

major additions to the stock of capital equipment.

  *    This   paper was substantially revised during the year following the

       presentation at the Williamsburg Conference. The author thus had

       the opportunity to take full advantage of the penetrating comments

       he received from Jeffrey Williamson, and the excellent advice

       offered by Robert Allen, Paul David, Lance Davis, Stanley

       Engerman, Robert Fogel, Gerald Friedman, Robert Gailman, Peter

      Lindert, and Thomas Weiss. He also benefited from seminar

      discussions of early versions of the paper at Northwestern

      University, U.C.L.A., the University of British Columbia, the

      University of Chicago, and the All—University of California

      Conference in Economic History, held in Los Angeles in May 1985.

1. Nearly all studies of productivity growth during this period have

      been based on information that was either highly aggregated or drawn

      from only to a small number of cotton textile firms (David, 1967,

      1975, 1977; Davis and Stettler, 1966; Gailman, 1972a, 1972b, 1986;

      Layer, 1955; }cCou1d..k, 1968; Nickless, 1979; Williamson, 1972).
                                                                     80




 2. Each of the data Bets suffers from problems of sample selection

    bias. The coverage of the 1820 Census of Manufactures and the

    McLane Report differed substantially by geographic region and size

    of establishment, with an apparent net result of an undersampling

    of smaller, and accordingly less productive, firms. The design of

    the samples from 1850 and 1860 led to a disproportionate

    representation of firms from states with limited industrial

    development. See Sokoloff (1982) and Atack, Bateman, and Weiss (1979)

    for details on the characteristics of these sample.. Since the

    sample selection biases are likely to raise the estimated

    productivity levels for 1820 and 1832, and reduce them in 1850

    and 1860,   the   rates of productivity growth computed from these sources

    should understate the actual record.



3. The industrial classification system employed in the 1850 Census

    was in general adopted, but several of the industry definitions

    industries used here include two or more of the 1850 categories.

    The reluctance to combine data from different industries stemmed

    from a concern about the possibility of confusing increases over

    time in labor productivity within industries with variation in the

    estimates due to changes in industrial composition.



4. This generalization about the reporting practices of part—time

    establishtrerti is based primarily on an examination of the
                                                                     81




      schedules for roughly 200 firms in the 1820 and 1832 samples that

      specified the fractions of the year they were in operation. Rather

      than expunging observations of sea8onal enterprises from the

     calculations, one would of course prefer to have accurate

     assessments of their inputs and outputs to work with so that their

     levels of performance would be reflected in the estimates. It is

     likely that part—time firms, whose relative importance declined

     over time, were indeed less efficient producers than their full—

     time counterparts. Accordingly, to the extent that the adjustments

     in the composition of the sub—samples do succeed in excluding all

     part—time establishments from consideration, the estimates of

     productivity growth might tend to understate the advances realized

     over the period by failing to pick up the perhaps important gains

     to the economy of displacing seasonal operators with full—time

     producers.



5.   It is admittedly unclear what fractions of manufacturing firms in

     the various years were operating significantly fewer than 50 weeks

     per year (full—time). A general sense of the orders of magnitude

     has, however, been obtained from the reports by many firms in 1832

     of the fraction of the year they were in operation, from an

     examination of the cross—sectional distributions of establishments

     by industry, size, wage rates, and location, as well as from

     inspections of the distributions of firms by measures of total

     factor prodiirrivtv. The approach adopted in preparing the three
                                                                      82




    sets of estimates was not to attempt a precise delineation of the

    proportion of firms operating part—time in the individual years,

    but rather to demonstrate that no plausible assumptions about the

    changes in their relative numbers would reverse the qualitative

    findings. Although ad hoc in nature, this manner of displaying

    the patterns in the data appears effective. One     can   check the

    sensitivity of the industry—specific results by comparing the

    figures from the three sets of estimates, or by evaluating the

    figures for 1820 with respect to the      figures for the later

    years. The extent of the allowance for the decreasing prevalence

    of part—time firms   implied   by this latter comparison appears to

    be extremely generous.



6. In this paper, such summaries of the quantitative results are based

    on the choice of the 1860 estimates computed from the aggregate data

    as the standard for that year.



7. The weights employed to construct the averages consist of the

    industry shares of total northeastern value added and gross output

   respectively in 1850, and were calculated from U. S. Census Bureau

    (1858). The two point estimates available for twelve of the

    industries in 1850 and 1860, as veil as the growth rates they

   enter into, will henceforth be expressed as a range of estimates

    (i.e. 72—112 percent).
                                                                   83




 8. The general robustness of the results is apparent from the

     observation that the estimates of labor productivity in 1820 are

     greatly affected by the shift from the   sub—sample to the    in

     only a few industries. The value—added figures are considerably

     more sensitive to the subset of establishments employed in the

     calculations, but even by this measure, only three of the

     industries have their levels of labor productivity raised by as

     much as 15 percent.



 9. Of greatest concern in this regard are the glass, liquors, and

     tobacco industries. All of these industries are characterized by

     having estimates based on very few observations in at least one of

     the years. Random variation in the estimates due to this source

    may magnify the impact of sample selection bias in some cases.

    For example, the extremely high levels of productivity estimated

    for the glass industry in 1832 is probably related to their being

     computed from information on a rather small number of glass—making

    enterprises in Massachusetts. The most advanced plants in that

    industry were located in Massachusetts (Davis, 1949), and that

    state accounted for a disproportionate share of the firms included

    in the McLane Report.



10. The 1850 and 1860 samples were designed to ensure that each state

    accounted for a certain minimum number of observations. This

    feature of their collection led to an over—sampling of
                                                                     84



     manufacturing firms from smaller and less—developed states such as

     Maine, Vermont, and New Hampshire. The establishments located in

     such states operated, on average, at lover levels of productivity.

     Accordingly, one would expect that this source of sample selection

     bias would lead to underestimates of productivity. In principle,

     one should be able to correct for this sample selection problem by

     re—weighting the observations. In practice, however, inconsistent

     evidence from the aggregate census reports and the firm samples on

     the industrial composition of state manufacturing sectors suggests

     that there are other defects in the samples that confound the

     identification of the appropriate set of weights.



11. It is, of course, important to recognize that the great majority

    of the price series pertain to only a single output or raw material

    of the respective industries. Hence, they undoubtedly introduce

    errors, and must be applied with caution. The four industries for

    which raw materials indexes could not be retrieved are

    coaches/harnesses, glass, hats, and iron. The Wholesale Price

    Index constructed by Warren and Pearson was employed as a

    reasonable substitute in these cases, because it behaves more like

    the average of the other raw materials series than the alternative

    general indexes. Another deficiency is that in two industries,

    tobacco and tanning, the author was compelled to rely on basically

    the same price index for both outputs and raw materials. It is

    especially unfotuute that separate indexes could not be obtained
                                                                     85




      for these industries, because the indexes, which pertain primarily

      to the price of raw materials, move quite erratically. Additional

      information on whether the prices of outputs and raw materials in

      each of these industries actually followed such peculiar paths

     would be quite helpful. It seems likely that the extraordinary

     variability in these price indexes accounts for at least some of

      the irregular movements in the productivity growth estimates for

     these industries.



12. In cases where there were several alternative price indexes

     available, the most conservative, with respect to the estimation

     of the increase in productivity over time, were generally selected.



13. This suggests that a significant portion of the variability in the

     labor productivity estimates is due to sharp changes in the factor

     proportions utilized.



14. The extreme decline in the price index for paper output invites

     skepticism. Rovever, it should be noted that the general

     stability between 1820 and 1860 in the ratio of gross output to

     raw materials in that industry would seem to suggest that the

     output price index might not be far off in terms of the extent of

     the decrease over the entire period.



15. As was mentic: ahoy.., the price indexes for tanning and tobacco
                                                                    86




     fluctuate wildly, particularly between 1859 and 1860. The erratic

     behavior of the index for "hides and leather" may also affect

     estimates for boots/shoes, because that series serves as the index

     for raw materials in that industry, as well as for both outputs

     and raw materials in tanning.



16. The argument presented in this paragraph applies to estimates of

     productivity growth that employ value added as the measure of

    output. Rence, it supplies a rationale for why the

    value—added figures might indicate less advance over the period

     than those relying on gross output as the appropriate measure of

    product. Given the uncertainty about the accuracy of the

     individual price indexes, however, any conclusions about the

    relative performance of two industries, regardless of the measure

    of productivity referred to, should be offered tentatively.



17. There are, admittedly, some scholars who judge part—time

    operations to be the rule during the early stages of

    industrialization, rather than the exception. Moreover, few would

    expect there to be many firms in industries such as flour/grist

    mills that were in production all year. Nevertheless, the

    enumerators for the McLane Report indicated that the overwhelming

    majority of the establishments included in that survey claimed to

    be in operation for at least 50 weeks a year. Although the level

    of production in any individual firm may have been characterized
                                                                     87




     by enormous seasonal variation, there might have been tasks that

     required at least some workers to be employed throughout the year.

     As long as enterprises in such circumstances reported their

     average labor and capital inputs, they should, for our purposes,

     have been classified as full—time operators and included in the

     subsets of firms over which the estimates were prepared.



18. As is apparent from the evidence presented in Goldin and Sokoloff

     (1982), the ratio of female to adult male wages increased from

     roughly the 0.25—0.35 range in 1820 to roughly the 0.45—0.55 range

     in 1850 and beyond. Hence, to the extent that the wage ratio

     reflects the average relative productivity of the two groups, it

     might be argued that employing the same weights in all years leads

     to overestimates of the amount of productivity growth. The

     issue turns, however, on whether the change in the relative

     productivity of females is due to variation over time in the age

     or skill composition of workers, or to some other factors. In any

     case, a wide range of weights for females and boys were tested,

     and the general qualitative results were found to be insensitive

     to reasonable variation in them.



19. It was further assumed that in no industry at 1850 or 1860 did

    boys account for more than 33 percent of the male labor force.

    Such a constraint, probably serves to bias upward the estimates of

    the labor injt. fi veral industries. This ceiling on the
                                                                     88



     proportion of males who were boys was introduced as another way of

     ensuring that the estimates of the labor input in the later years

     would err on the high side, if at all.



20. This would be expected, because of the scale economies present in

     most manufacturing industries (Sokoloff, 1984b). The bias is

     likely to have been greater in the 1832 sample, because

     Massachusetts firms accounted for a highly disproportionate share

     of the enterprises covered by that survey, and generally were larger

     and had higher than average levels of measured productivity.



21. For example, the weighted average of the industry rate of growth

     in gross output per equivalent worker, as computed from the

     estimates for 1820 and the B estimates for 1860, ranges between

     2.3 and 2.5 percent per annum. These figures are only slightly

     lover than the 2.5 to 2.7 range derived from the employment of the

       estimates for both years.



22. The Davis and Stettler series might be expected to yield estimates

    of the variation in output per worker over the business cycle that

    were downward biased, because their figures pertain to output per

    man—hour. See Davis and Stettler (1966).



23. One caveat to this generalization is that the iron and steel

     industry         .o have been quite depressed during the late
                                                                        89



        1840s and early 1850s. See Temin (1964).



  24. The industries were ordered in terms
                                              of capital intensity by the

        information on their aggregate capital to labor ratios in the

       Northeast obtained from U. S. Census Bureau (1858), and then

       divided into groups. The same classification of industries is

       derived from the 1820 firm data. The
                                              ranking by machinery
       intensity was computed from information contained in the 1820 and

       1832 samples of firm data, particularly the latter, as well as in

       U. S. Census Office (1895). Industries were placed in categories

       on the basis of estimates of the investment in
                                                        machinery per unit
       of labor computed for 1832.

                                         in the firm samples were, on

      average, also smaller and substantially less capital intensive than

      their counterparts in the aggregate data. Their level8 of total

      factor productivity were, however, not much lover. The massive

      disparity in measured labor productivity may accordingly be due to

      the less—developed states, which were over—represented in the

      samples, being characterized by a much different system or type of

      Cotton manufacture.



26.   It must also be admitted that these indexes of partial factor

      productivity not infrequently exhibit irregular, if not

      implausible, movements from one point in time to another, as veil
                                                                     90




     as discrepancies between the firm   and aggregate level estimates
     for 1850 and 1860. Just as was contended above in discussing the

     labor productivity figures, many of the former type of problems

     may be due to inaccurate price indexes, excessive variability in

     point estimates because of a small number of observations, or

     sample selection biases. The disparities between the independent

     estimates for 1850 and 1860 are disturbing, but they might again

     be partially explained by many of the firm—level estimates being

     based on the characteristics of relatively few firms located in

     unrepresentative areas. These anomalies in the data indicate that

     much caution should be exercised in drawing conclusions,

     particularly with respect to changes over short periods, but they

     do not justify a blanket dismissal of the results.



27. The other principal issue has concerned whether firms reported

     the gross value of their capital investment or the net value.

     Recent work has tended to agree that some net measure of the

     capital stock was being reflected in the figures. See Galiman

     (1986) and Sokoloff (1984a).



28. If one computes the weighted—average growth in total factor

    productivity       from the     figures for 1820 and the   figures

    for 1860, the estimates decline only slightly. NFP rises by 87 to

    113 percent over the period, while TFP increases by 63 to 71

    percent.
                                                                             91




  29. One could, for example,
                                      explain the acceleration in total factor

         productivity as arising from the expansion of
                                                             product markets,
         which stimulated changes in the organization of production within

         the firm, technical change, and
                                             intra—regional specialization
         between the more urbanized counties
                                                 and the outlying areas within
         the Northeast (Lindatrom,
                                       1978; Sokoloff, 19841,).



 30.    Although it    is difficult to imagine that variation in the

        relatively    small   amount of tools and machinery per worker could

        account for much of the large changes observed in productivity, it

        would be helpful to know, by industry, how the former ratio moved

        over time. Unfortunately, of all the data Bets being examined

        here, only the 1832 sample contains
                                                the detailed information on the
        composition of   capital necessary to estimate the ratio. It seems
        likely, however that the
                                     percentage changes   in machinery and tools
       per equivalent worker would resemble the course of the capital to

       labor ratio, because the shares of capital invested in tools and

       machinery had not been altered much
                                                by 1890 (Sokoloff, 1984a;
       U. S. Census Office, 1895).



31. This Conjecture does
                                not necessarily hold, but if all else was

       constant, one would expect it to. The chief obstacles or

       objections to its applicability
                                           probably concern the variation
       across industries in the rates at which
                                                   capital goods depreciated,
                                                                           92




    old vintages were replaced by new, and output increased over the

    period. The       complication   arising from this latter gituation is

     that the industries that grew most rapidly would tend to benefit

    relatively more from technical change embodied in capital even if

     their capital to labor ratios were low and hadnt changed much,

    because a greater proportion of their capital stock would consist

    of new—vintage items.



32. A series of pooled cross—section production functions were

    estimated with various measures of output serving as the dependent

    variable, and measures of the inputs, year dummies,         industry
    duixmiies,   class   duiies, and interactions appearing as independent

    variables. When variables for the interaction between dummies for

     the more mechanized or capital—intensive industries and the year

     1860    were   included in the specifications, the coefficients on them

    generally failed to indicate that these classes of industries

    realized significantly more        productivity   growth between 1820 and

     1860.




33. For example, the per annum        rates   of growth of capital per

     equivalent worker between 1820 and 1850 were 0.9—1.2 percent and

    —0.l—+O.l percent for the more and less mechanized industries

     respectively. During the next decade, the less mechanized

     industries experienced a sharp acceleration in their absolute and

     relative rates of increase of this variable to 4.0—6.8 percent per
                                                                     93




     annum, as compared to the 0.7—2.3 percent pace registered by their

     Counterparts.



34. If one decomposes the growth in value added per equivalent worker,

     the qualitative result is the same.   Increases   in the capital to

     labor ratio directly account for only a small fraction of the

    progress realized, leaving most of the rise in labor productivity

    to be explained by advances in total factor productivity.
