          DYNAMIC OPTIMAL INCOME TAXATION WITH GOVERNMENT COMMITMENT


                                  ABSTRACT
     The optimal income taxation problem has been extensively studied in one-

period models.    This paper analyzes optimal income taxation when consumers work'

for many periods.     We also analyze what information, if any, that the

government learns about abilities in one period can be used in later periods to

attain more redistribution than in a one-period world.     When the government

must commit itself to future tax schedules, intertemporal nonstationarity of

tax schedules could relax the self-selection constraints and lead to Pareto

improvements.     The effect of nonstationarity is analogous to that of

randomization in one-period models.     The use of information is limited since

only a single lifetime self-selection constraint for each type of consumer

exists.    These results hold when individuals and the government have the same

discount rates.     The planner can make additional use of the information when

individual and social rates of time discounting differ.      In this case, the

limiting tax schedule is a nondistorting one if the government has a lower

discount rate than individuals.
